Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) shares his theory of who the creator of Bitcoin is and what evidence there is to support that theory.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so recently this bitcoin thing um craig wright i don't know much about it other than like one article i read i guess he's an australian guy and he was being sued by this person who wanted a share of the money for what's the story uh i don't know about his lawsuit but i know about craig wright and that he basically for a long time has been claiming to be uh satoshi nakamoto so well so he claims to be the creator of bitcoin and then people who are smart in the community are like there's no [ __ ] way so people but the this lawsuit basically he's being sued by the spouse of someone this ma this craig wright had a partner the partner died and the spouse of the partner sued craig wright and craig wright won the lawsuit and winning for what uh she said that you owe me money because of this reason and that reason we created this you and my husband created this thing together you owe us some money and in winning i forget exactly how it worked but in winning the case the jurors said well no you're satoshi and you worked on this alone and so uh like in order for him to win in a weird i don't know the exact details but in order for him to win they were basically saying yes we believe you're satoshi and satoshi worked alone so okay here's here's the story so uh kleinman versus wright the jury ruled that david kleinman's relationship to craig wright did not constitute a business partnership meaning the estate was not entitled to a share of the satoshi nakamoto fortune which wright claims to have control over as the self-purported creator of bitcoin the jury ruled against wright on the conversion count awarding awarding 100 million dollars to kleinman what a rule against right yeah so he said they got 100 million out of it i don't know because i thought he was celebrating it was a little confusing but the point was is that this like this legal team okay they wanted billions they didn't get that but they got 100 million against him for the unauthorized use of funds from climate and wright's shared venture wnk info defense research llc oh god this is from something else so did this guy the guy who started it that's what i wanted so so basically um so he claims to have invented bitcoin then um there's a great clip by the way of vitalik buterin the creator of ethereum uh co-creator of ethereum uh on stage and he goes uh there's they were talking about it and usually people like you know like in a w in a conference panel people are usually pretty like you know they don't take shots at people like live there and he just he just pipes because you want to know what i think and they're like yes we'd love to know what you think he goes he goes um he gives this like quick like two-minute rant that just destroys craig right where he's like i think if you're the creator of bitcoin you have a v and everybody was saying you're not and you keep trying to tell people you are all you have to do is one simple thing you just have to sign something with satoshi's wallet and that will just show that you're him and the fact that you're not doing that like the you know he he calls some like some like you know awesome razer oxen's razor or whatever like just some term like that he's like the simplest explanation here is that you're not satoshi because if you have a simple way to prove your claim and you do not prove your claim using the simple way you cannot prove your claim and um so you kind of just like [ __ ] on him right there so who crowd went wild so who is this you think is he he just died or he's still quiet um the best theory is that it's uh that it's this guy hal i forgot his name is hal uh hal finney um this was so hal finney was like a cryptographer he received the first bitcoin transaction he was the like the second wallet and normally like what does a developer do when they test something that's like oh i send it from like sean a to sean b like my test account basically like that's how i do the first transaction and um he was like very active in the forums and then he died right around the time he got als and died around the time that the last known time that stoshi ever posted anything um so you know what he was like why wouldn't he tell do you think he why wouldn't he like tell his wife or his family or you know like because it looks like he has a wife on these pictures yeah well a maybe he did and b um like you know some people are so mission driven in their thing and they're thinking and like you know there was a there's a real genius of the idea of being like i'm gonna have this as a pseudonymous name satoshi nakamoto i'm not gonna use my real name which means i'll never get the credit for being a genius if this works but also it like it's kind of like the parent dies so the child can survive it's like the only way a currency like this could have really worked is if you couldn't point to the creator because then they would just attack the creator they would say the creator has too much they'd say this guy has a ulterior motives he has control he's he's too powerful to you know he's just the new the new bad guy you know okay you're bad at the federal reserve and the governments uh yeah now you're mad at this guy for for private citizen being in control of this so do you think this is him i personally think it's him um like i've looked into a couple times about like who are the most likely candidates um you know is it a group of people uh was it the government themselves was it one person and it does seem like it was like you know i guess like i shouldn't say it does seem like it there's really no evidence of the existing evidence that's there this kind of like speculative data point you have how phineas fits the story in my worldview the best so i think it's him god that's i love these mysteries which would mean that it's it's sort of gone like his coins are locked up um unless he gave him to his wife unless he gave her the keys uh and like you know and she and told her don't touch it because it hasn't moved no not a single coin has moved uh ever and um you know i think if he did it let's say he did give her instructions how would i give instructions i would say um i would probably not actually let her have it i would say this file is going to be available to you on this date um 20 years from now and i would say you know follow the instructions inside so i wouldn't even give her the opportunity to make a bad decision because i would say if these move before bitcoin wins um then it'll be this will be just very destructive for it like if the creator of bitcoin starts to sell bitcoin that will trigger like a huge sell-off in the market because it'll be like oh the creator's alive they don't believe they're selling their coins who is it it'll create this like whole drama it'll hurt the project but has any money ever left his account no not a single satoshi has ever left his account so then he would have had to have create a different account for her to live on or something yeah which could have easily happened right um you know at some point but you know people can also see the ledger so they know who all satoshi sent the they know which wallet satoshi sent coins to and um some of them are like known identities like the other people that were in this like crypto like the cypherpunk community that wanted to test out the project early on but like you know he very easily could have just had her set up mining a mining rig so it didn't even have to come from his account he could just say because he didn't give himself the coins he mined the coins sure it's just that mining was so easy at that time so you know she could be minor number eight um you know that mine some coins and that's it that's she can live off that yeah god well we should see like you know house finney how's she living is she like in a in a 40 million dollar home in venice i don't even know if he i i mean there's a woman with all these pictures with him like it looks like a wife i don't even know anything about her i just googled it it doesn't say anything about wikipedia about his wife um but oh yeah his wife yeah so he does have a wife yeah i'd be curious i'm looking at pictures of his house when he's dying like pictures of him dying and he's in his home it does not look fancy yeah yeah also als just looks so brutal man yeah it feels like the worst completely debilitated uh that's really tough yeah so anyway that's fascinating we should do like an entire episode on that that's this [ __ ] is so interesting to me yeah i agree we should we should just do the research of like okay what is all the research that's out there and like what's the conclusion i think people are i'm fascinated by like this story i think it's one of the coolest [ __ ] out of straight out of a movie but it's actually real life things that has ever happened you know i like that and silk road but i think the silk road case is far more cut and dry than anyone thinks i think ross did it i think ross did everything right

Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) and Sam Parr (@TheSamParr) talk about the surprising companies that are making big money by employing stay at home moms.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
i've been saying this for a long time which is anybody who could figure out how to employ the stay-at-home mom workforce is going to make billions of dollars so if you just work backwards from there's a bunch of moms at home they want to earn a little extra income doesn't have to be a ton they want to maintain flexibility of being able to stay at home and work not like necessarily a fixed number of full-time hours or the same hours every day who can solve that problem and um there's only one example that i know of that's solving that problem i don't know if you know any um for moms yeah uh maybe uservoice.com i think they do it uh testing usertesting.com that's the one i was thinking about oh is it really my mom my mom worked for them yeah so oh my god that's so funny i knew about it what a random thing that we both knew that um so i would say so use testing.com amazing company by the way so you just pay someone to like go through your website public by the way um how cool is this they just went public and my mom stuck and my mom was like well say what it is so user testing basically it's a service where i have an app or a website i want to know where it's confusing for users like design makes sense to me but like sure enough when somebody else is using it they're confused they can't find the thing they want and they just record your mom like scrolling through the site so they have an army of testers which is just all the requirement is be a normal person you have we do not even want you to be highly skilled like you're supposed to represent the average customer so they have a bunch of people they send them a little camera that um that records their finger on their phone basically it records them like and they just talk out loud so that you give a task you say like you know find a christmas gift for your dad and put it into your cart and they're like okay i'm looking for the gifts for dad section i don't see it uh scrolling scrolling scrolling they don't see the button that says menu oh there's the menu uh dad oh it's men's men's okay i'll click men's um yeah i don't get how this is sorted oh this is by new release and you just talk through what's confusing to you and that 15-minute video goes to the company and the company gets to watch it and they get to share it internally their their researcher basically shares it with the designer or the engineer they pay like 300 for it right no no each test is like 25 or 30 dollars and then um and then well now it's all switched to subscription but originally it was like 25 30 a test the tester gets 10 bucks for doing the test and the company kept you know 15 20 bucks and so the tester is like cool i could do like four of these in an hour and so a like a bid would come online oh chipotle wants you to test their new mobile menu and you would just have to go quickly say yes and then you qualify they're looking for women you know age 40 to 55 in the us and you're like yeah great i qualify i can take this test that's a billion dollar company now it's market cap is over a billion dollars did your mom get paid did they give her shares yeah it's awesome so basically my mom was she first started off as a tester then she got hired by the company to review the other testers because you have to do quality control so she became like she would watch the test and give feedback to the testers like hey your audio sucks or like you're mumbling or like you didn't follow the instructions of the test um one more strike and you're out of the testing pool and so that was her job and she was the oldest person in the company i think so she was like my mom's like 63 now so she just retired this this year so she was there at 62 years old my mom like had slack and like knew how to use all like jira she knew what a jira ticket was like it was crazy my mom like who knew and she got some shares and she had always told me like should i i was like yeah you want the shares for sure um and then she would tell me like hey the ceo did an all hands he said this this this is that good i'm like yeah it sounds good like this company's doing well i should have bought secondary stock in the company during that time because i had like basically inside info of like this company is pretty good it's a good quality company and i was a user of the service as well so it goes public the other day like like two weeks ago and i'm like mom how many shares do you have and she goes looks in carter she tells you to share i'm like mom you made a hundred fifty thousand dollars no way and she's like yeah because her strike price was super low uh she was there for like four or five years and uh so i was like that's amazing that's like uh like that's that my mom was so happy yeah like good for her that's badass and so like this is why i think this model of who do you want to pull is actually interesting because it's actually there it's two for two reasons it's motivating so like the fact that like they are employing uh most like i have no idea i should make this up if it's like mostly women who stayed at home for a long time and now they want to get back to it that's like incredibly motivating it's like look we're serving our employees yeah it's very noble it's cool let's say you want to hire uh uh ex-cons or something it's like look this is interesting or we're gonna hire a bunch of 16 year olds and it's going to be the first job we're going to train them how to be men and women and prepare them for the rest of their lives it's actually incredibly cool it's fascinating there's one um i want to look up the name give him a shout out here so it's higher you hire military wives as eas that's awesome it's called and it also helps with expectations so you know what you're wearing you what's it called squared away squared away that's basically a woman i think i think her story is that she i'm assuming she was in this position i don't really know um but basically it's military spouses um and i was like this is a great this is a great idea um because you know this is us uh these are us employees they want this work they um you know they it's great to provide for their family while the husband's away i think it's awesome and um and it's it it helps significantly with expectations because then user testing knows all right we're mostly going to be hiring 60 year old or 50 year old uh women who don't have a probably a ton of experience with slack and jira jail we know like here's where they're gonna struggle here's we're not gonna show so that's cool

he tells me he's like you know i just expanded the vision for for what i'm doing he goes um this is eventually going to be the next blackrock bigger than blackrock i think i can be a trillionaire in the next 50 years oh my gosh [Music] all right um what's going on uh not too much dude we um is the last episode the ryan holiday one yeah what did you think i wanted to debrief that real quick because i thought he was um really great uh i said i think i said this maybe i don't know if it was on air if this was afterwards but he um he felt to me like one of the happier more calm and peaceful people that we've ever had on the show uh he just had this vibe about him like he wasn't um like a lot of people come on the show and they try to put on a show they are trying to perform or they're trying to kind of play up something they're trying to sell you on something they're trying to uh present themselves as bigger than they are and it's not just on the show this is life and uh or you meet somebody and they're kind of like you know they have the disease of more more and more and i know it because i i have it myself in many ways where i kind of want uh you know more success more whatever um and i just felt like he was a guy who was curious about certain things like to do certain things but didn't have this like he didn't seem like an itchy person didn't say there's all these itches all across his body that he was trying to scratch he seemed at ease and i thought that was just like one thing that i don't know if it comes across on a podcast because you're listening to it or you see the guy you don't necessarily pick that up but that was the one thing that stood out to me i think he's really like that i've uh i've been friendly with them i wouldn't say we're like close friends but friendly for a couple years now but neville and noah are all really good friends with them and they said that like he pretty much just stays at home most of the time and like if you want to see him you got to drive out to his farm and like he's a homebody and he like just knows what he likes and he and he does it yeah i thought it was interesting because his reputation at least for me in my head right the image i had in my head was this guy's like this internet marketer growth hacker which is like usually one breed of person right like there's like that comes with a certain certain package usually and then you know we'll have this like kind of he's an author and then he has like uh but his books are all about like kind of interesting things right he doesn't writing boring normal calm books he's writing like conspiracy and how the media is messed up and then like you know trust me i'm lying right like these provocative books and then he had the daily stoic and i was like oh okay reminded me a little bit of like you know like tim ferriss i think is kind of like this where tim ferriss started off you know selling brain supplements which is again like an internet marketer type of thing you know it comes with a certain package to create a brain supplement company uh then second to that was like an author and then you know now is like extremely zen and like into mindfulness and detoxification and digital detoxing and moving away from san francisco and you know was just trying to get away but like even peop usually when i find people who are gravitating towards things like meditation and stoicism and um you know micro dosing psychedelics they feel like they're still on the search for that calmness he felt like he found the calmness and that was kind of the distinction i think i was envious of him for two reasons the first was he said that he dropped out of college because he wanted to be a writer and he is a writer i was incredibly envious that he had found what he loved and he found it very early and he and he actually same thing with his wife he said he met his wife and he was 20. they've been dating since they were 20 or something like that right this guy found love early i was envious of that and the second thing was he did not maybe not envious but what i learned was he did a really good job of basically you know you and i talk about ideas and all this stuff and we know a lot of successful people but at the end of the day once you get past a relatively low point it's about being happy and he did a really good job of putting that into perspective you know even your addiction i would say like yeah you know it's one thing to say it we all say it it's another thing to actually do it and uh you know it's like oh so okay you got this money you made this money doing this you know you made this money are you using that to parlay your fame and whatever into more and more no i like writing so i keep writing right and it's like um do you okay you you know you what do you do with your investments are you in crypto trying to hit the next big home run i bought a bookshop it's like oh [ __ ] this guy's extremely grounded so rob dyrdek made one line on our pod that always kind of stuck with me so he's like this happy guy but then i made a comment like yeah i think like i didn't know that you're gonna be this big and he goes yeah like i'm on my way to becoming the billionaire like i deserve and i thought it was funny that he's like he definitely had a chip on his shoulder and he was like more and more and more and more and more which isn't bad that's very human but that was interesting and i almost felt like ryan didn't necessarily have that we have a buddy who texted me yesterday uh he's you you you don't know him as well but uh i think you can mention him i don't know maybe i shouldn't say his name because it's a funny funny quote say it say it and then say his name then bleep him texted me and he goes uh you know he tells me he's like you know i just expanded the vision for for what i'm doing he goes um this is eventually gonna be the next blackrock bigger than blackrock i think i can be a trillionaire in the next 50 years oh my gosh and i was like he says it with a straight face he's not like joking which is uh you know amazing and delusional and amazing again right that's like those that's my that's how my brain goes i'm like wow then i'm like wow that's delusional then i'm like well you know great you know good for you that's what gets that capable is he capable pulling it off yeah like i i said this early on i met him when he was like 19 or 20 and i said of all the people i've ever met if i had to bet my life which one of these people who today is worth less than you know five million dollars will be a billionaire i would have put my life on the line on him because i was like he's singularly focused on just that so it's like you know michael phelps woke up every day and swam like for [ __ ] three hours and then 18 000 calories and then did that for like 12 years straight and didn't take a day off so it's like yeah when you devote your life singularly to a pursuit whether it's swimming laps in a pool or it's becoming a billionaire you know that already cuts you away from 99 of the population that wants to be wealthy but also wants to be you know in a good relationship it also wants to be this and also wants to have fun with their friends and go out on the weekends it's like he cuts out all that so you know i think it gives him the odds on top of being a very smart capable guy right like he's already amongst the like high iq people then within that he's got an obsession on money that very few people have let me let me please play devil's advocate or as my other favorite podcast calls it devil's avocado let me play let me play devil's avocado here for a second who says that so uh michael bisping said it is all that goes double doubles avocado yeah so uh of two things one i'm reading this book or i already read it called spor recently called sports gene and they basically talk about genetics and they're just like look like the closer you live to the equator the longer your limbs are and the shorter your torso is and that just makes you like 15 percent better runner and what that means is like if your legs are longer that just means that if if we all work the same and the best people from who don't have long legs and short torso some of them definitely can compete but like you have a fifteen percent edge and when you're talking about gold medals and being the best in the world that fifteen percent is like a world tenth of seconds on things you know that helps yeah they're like that that's just so it's like it's like it's like a giraffe versus a hippo or you know something like that like that just matters and so one becoming like a billionaire which is an outlier like i actually think that like you can kind of sweat your way to like maybe 5 or 10 million in a lifetime but becoming a billionaire and this huge outlier i think it takes like a particular type of skill like you just genetically predisposed to have it in your favor and i think that matters you're not saying this kid does or does not have it but i think that it's more important than just like training for 12 hours a day i think that just being gifted genetically is more important than hard work uh to be the best so you need both second you you know like i all i definitely believe like the whole pull yourself up by your bootstrap thing but in order to be like let's just call the threshold a billion in reality it's probably like 200 million 100 million like there's so much luck that needs to be involved on a macro level it's like which country are you born in but on a micro level it could be just like well like did you just me happen to do do it with your friends in college you know yeah or are you able to stay healthy um did you not fall in love and meet someone like right you know what i mean like there's all these tiny like luck things that really matter like jeff bezos like did his mom i think wasn't he adopted yeah he's adaptive so like that is like a oh it's a big decision but it's like a relatively small like decision it's a yes or no decision that changed everything totally or did you decide to go to princeton versus stanford like it's uh and you know jesus would have been successful no matter what but there's a difference between uh this guy made 10 or 30 million dollars in his lifetime versus became at one point the richest man on earth or the richest man ever to walk the earth or whatever you know like there was a the variance so to me success is very success has success itself and the yes or no has very little to do with luck the magnitude of success has a lot to do with luck but that's why i was saying you know i'm i'm creating a funny hypothetical which is of people who already are not already in a good position financially like under five million net worth let's say they're not they don't have some edge there where they're just gonna invest their way to success um of those people who haven't already made it who would i bet is most likely to make it well i agree with you that if it was the field versus him i'd take the field but uh what am i going to bet on like for example i think you could say like our buddy jack smith i think you could say you know jack is a quirky curious guy who's actually not obsessed with money at all but just like really into what he's into and it's usually off the beaten path that's gonna usually win in a way and he's super smart also right like they're still in the top one percent iq or whatever um that's going to have a good outcome i believe that but um but you're kind of betting that this guy's luckier this his magnitude of success is gonna he's gonna have more luck than this guy and i think you could kind of tell who's gonna get lucky or who's not but it's really hard to place it like who would you bet if i told you that same situation i don't know if you have a name but before somebody had a bunch of money who in your life did you run into that you're like all right if i had to say who's going to become a billionaire in my life this is who i would pick i mean when i met moyes ali he didn't he had sold the company and he probably was worth less than five million dollars and immediately took a few days of meeting him like oh uh you're a shark and what what was it yeah shark is a good word what what it was a shark um he was had a singular focus i mean he was customer focused but singular focus he's like and really high intensity very high intensity singular focuses focused uncomfortably intensity i'm uncomfortable protect him yeah uncomfortable and also he like he was a lawyer from harvard so like top of the top at the top yeah and then his brother is uber successful so i'm like there's no reason why you should screw this up and so when i met him that i thought was hilarious he has these great one-liners moy said something that was like um you know like i don't know some people were put you see usain bolt and you say that guy was put on earth to run um you see this person they were put up michael phelps you see his body he was put on earth to swim i was put on earth to do one thing increase earnings per share [Laughter] he always uh he he like one time he told me he goes you know my worst the worst phrase i hate on earth is when i hear it it makes me cringe and i run the run the other way blue chip stocks he goes do you want to talk about words that i love uh what did he call it distressed assets distressed asset that's what he said he goes he goes the two most beautiful words of the english language distressed assets and he said that i was like oh my god one time i heard amazing one-liners one time i heard him uh one time we met with this person who has this vitamin company that's doing really well and he was being really cordial and nice and everything and just saying hi and then this person walked out the room and he looks at me and he goes that person's business is one google search away from me ruining it it's like that's one google search away from me copying their company because he's like the formula is nothing and that was like that was the first line that he said he is really he's a poet um all right i've got an idea so andrew wilkinson texted me because he's in my str group str stands for short-term rentals my latest obsession we'll see if it sticks but very interested in it and i think we need to rebrand that by the way way too like std you know like does anybody know what an str is no i don't why don't i just say dorks you know my like real estate or airbnb you know or whatever vacation rentals dude here's the truth i made this group when i was going to the bathroom and i just tweeted it out and you'll notice the picture is just a boot that's just because i just like googled as like i googled something you know like this is a shoe yeah this is a shoe i don't remember but that was that picture was available which goes back to your uh your point you did a long time ago that people got really upset with you we were like don't think about a name or don't buy a domain a good domain or something you said something like that that people got really pissy about and you were basically saying don't let that don't let figuring out the branding and the name hold you back from the thing which is like getting it out there yeah yeah so that's what i did i like did it like literally when i was going to the bathroom this was like a literally a two-minute thing and it just is what's it called sam's str crew no i keep wanting to say std so 1200 or 1500 people you know what i think i could do i'm not sure if i'm going to do this but you know what i think i can do i think i could turn this into a newsletter business and i think it could be like a really good business and i'm going to explain why have you ever heard of och davis the headphone daniel ock no okay so uh look up daniel ock uh i think he's like probably worth eight or ten billion dollars so och davis is like a famous hedge fund this guy like is i think that um i'm almost positive that when elon musk got shorted this guy was one of the guys and he sent him like a pair of shorts if i remember correctly and so it's this billion-dollar multi-billion dollar maybe 40 billion dollar hedge fund anyway it got started because the davis was this guy named ziff davis who started um oh sorry his name was bill ziff who started zif davis publishing company have you heard of zif davis no okay so zif davis was a basically at this point it's still around it has a five billion dollar market cap it does over a billion dollars in revenue it's been around since probably the 60s it's got it got its start because it owned magazines in a ton of different super specific but uh high-end industries so for example they owned the most popular magazines on popular popular electronics sailing flying they own this thing called mac week they eventually started ces which or they started um it was called one thing and then it now is has become ces um masasan started cs now masasan bought it from davis okay and so he like it was all niche publications and it's still a business and i think i could do something like that for strs where you create an empire based on like things that aren't exactly side hustles but have like serious money going into them for example this industry probably isn't big enough but i've been a bunch of people that have like they've bought like 10 cars just for like toro and and all that kind of thing and i've also and so that's kind of intriguing to me like i just think that like something can be done here there's this company called the penny holder which is sold for like a hundred plus million dollars and they basically wrote blog posts on this and they drove drove traffic to it made money but anyway i thought that was interesting and let me tell you one last thing have you heard of this website called speed test speed test like the uh internet speed test yes yeah of course i go to it all right all right that's owned by ziff davis oh no way so check this out on similar web it gets a hundred million visits uh a month in there if you scroll all the way to the bottom and you click a button that says advertise that's what you always want to click for these types of websites and it tells you all about their traffic according to their website it says they get 10 million visits a day and away the tricks of the trade here on how you get these numbers i am and so it says they get 10 it says they get uh uh i think it says 40 or 50 million monthly uniques but 10 million total visits right now go back to that home page ben well i've i always have ad block on so this is my first time seeing it with ads dude it's like so there's a button that says go like test your speed and then this oh it's like it's like it's like an army it's like you're surrounded there's nowhere to go you are gonna look at these ads there's a mailchimp add up top and on the right and on the bottom and on the left there's a ufc so look at this that's one two three four five ads right there i don't know what like the current cpm is on google but let's just say that all of those because this is like a relatively high end potentially market let's say that's 15 per cpm it could be 10 but i bet you it's between 10 and 15. on 10 million visits a day that's 50 million dollars a year just on on this these ads plus go to the top right then and click where it says developers they also sell all these solutions so you can like test the internet speed of i actually don't know like why anyone would use this there's a world where like this is a two or three maybe 200 million dollar your business just from this simple ass web page that's wild and there's also i think who who came out with a competitor i think netflix did or somebody speed.com yeah yeah uh yeah somebody came out with that as well but i think this one's like pretty entrenched it's it this would i i looked up if you like there's some websites that they're called um i forget what they're called but ben if you google speedtest.net or wherever the url is and then the word revenue there's all these websites that tell you how much your traffic is worth and like they're not really that interesting but they kind of are this one it says a billion dollars it says there this url is worth one billion dollars um like a mobile version of speed tests like is there an app that just you open it up it just tells you how fast your internet is right now and so ios widget you can just leave that open all the time great question so i in order to get all this information i went and read a lot of z2 zip davis's annual reports and they just acquired a company that they want to integrate into this company that does that for mobile so they're working on it but clearly there's opportunity here yeah that's funny um yeah the thing with speed test is like any uh it's like they get free customers because any time somebody like if you call your comcast or whatever they're like hey can you go run a speed test go to speed test and they like send you the link and so it's like it's like every troubleshooting it person like sends you this link so that they're not like paying for customers they get it for free that way which is an interesting which is interesting but you kind of said two things so you're so ziff is interesting but then you were saying what could i do with str so there's kind of like let's say three paths there's um default do nothing there's path two which is okay i keep this facebook group and i just actually do the short-term rental which would be like the equivalent of the alex hermozy guy or whatever doing like building out more gyms right so it's like well you can actually make a lot of money if you just do the short-term rentals and just use that information put your energy there or you can put your energy towards building the community and the content around people who are interested in short-term rentals and there's clearly appetite your thing's at like a thousand members and there's like super valuable interesting content being shared there so clearly there's value in either a paid community or a paid newsletter plus a paid community or something like that um how do you think about which one is like a good thing to do well i might do the first one which is do nothing i didn't create this to build a business i did it just because people were reaching out to me i didn't want to talk to everyone and i needed a way just to like communicate but if and maybe if i want to but also maybe if i never want to i think the way that you go about this is you do like a i would do one of two things i would create either a weekly or a bi-weekly newsletter that explains the news that impacts this business and regulations followed by i would do what you do which is take like the five most interesting tweets from the week of str's and i'll explain my opinion of them i would do that and then i would also create a um a paid tool so i would create the best sheet so like whenever you like look at these properties you create like a sheet that like you put your inputs in yeah yeah and then and then it would say like look like a lot of people are current what we've noticed is that currently people are getting 20 cash on cash returns so if above you know do that it below don't do it and here's like how your math should look so i think you could create something like that and and sell it for maybe three to five hundred dollars a year and then if you wanted to you do a higher end thing like ten thousand dollars for people who already have three or four airbnbs and it just you talk to all the experts who have scaled this up successfully to like 10 and 20 units and done it relatively hands off and i think you could charge two to five thousand dollars for that yeah yeah i think there's a ton of options um so yeah i think you you've stumbled into a very a very cool niche that you're genuinely interested in so i think you know it'll play out how it plays out it's cool right it's very cool yeah it's one of one of the more interesting little things that uh that i've kind of seen one of our friends doing recently yeah i think it's intriguing i have two silly ideas for you so silly idea number one um so i was looking at so remember the guy from liquid death came on and he came on i don't know when that was maybe like a year ago or less than a year ago no i think it was like two years ago and and because i i i wasn't doing this thing two years well you're right uh but i still had an office and uh and we closed the office a while ago but he and we were i thought we were late he had raised like 20 or 30 million dollars i think the other day he raised like a hundred or like something crazy so it's just continued to do super well and uh and i've just seen a bunch of like kind of like different water water beverage companies by the way did you see this this funny thing they have this kind of tangent did you see this uh so austin reef tweeted out um the guy that guy from morningbrew he tweeted out uh you know hey you know the rock is gonna become a billionaire off of his tequila did you see this tweet yeah and then the rock replied so i'll explain it yeah so he goes rock's gonna become a billionaire from uh from this tequila and um he goes you know ryan who is oh george clooney george clooney's casa amigos was sold for 1.2 billion and was doing like 170 000 cases the rock is already doing like uh whatever i don't know it was like three and a half times that so uh you know the rock's doing whatever no public math ex more uh cases he's going to become a billionaire off this business and the rock replies which is kind of amazing because the rock is one of the most um famous people on social media period like in the world so pull ben pull that tweet up um by the way this ben screen sharing thing uh in the words of sampar can you say game changer so make that little bigger and we need a name you know like powerful young jamie we need uh you know like powerful mormon ben we need like some so some killer nickname for you could you uh just make the font bigger so i can see it all right there we go so he goes so dwayne johnson replies and says uh the following let's scroll that down okay cheers austin emoji of a tequila glass i don't know about that first line lol but i can speak to part to the parts to i can speak to the other parts of this tweet blushing smiley face like the rock is flirting with him and he goes uh our projections to one million cases is pretty mind-boggling and expedient which i just like when he said expedient i thought it was so funny i was like yeah he's right about a left field and he goes big exciting big comment exciting taramana uh announcement coming next week stay tuned man picture emoji of the earth and then emoji of a fist brown which i don't is that the symbol of tarabana i don't know uh like i lost it wait what what were you even talking about in the first place anyways okay so i'm talking about wait let me tell you really quick yeah austin texted me and he goes hey some kid that we just hired at the morning brew said he listened to your podcast and he said because austin asked this new guy like all right now who else should we hire and the kid goes uh well they're in their employee onboarding they they say we just hired you who else should we hire which is like a guy raises yeah and this kid raises his hand and goes i listened to this podcast with this guy named sam parr i don't know what he does for work we should hire him [Laughter] he goes he seems like a pretty good podcast podcast host maybe we should hire him yeah and just the other day sean got an offer to be or like asked to interview for the head of digital for playboy enterprises and i'm getting offers that morning brew like to be a staff writer yeah to be a they want me to be a junior associate writer at morning brew or i can uh become hedge digital at playboy enterprises who comes out on top uh what's your reaction to the uh to the job offer what do you think about that you know like i'll have to talk to my family we'll have to talk to my family and i'll have to see you i'm excited to announce my next chapter that's so funny but um by the way at one point i remember uh when i was running my startup this was one of my like i thought this was fair game all's fair in love and business but uh but i think other people would think this is like completely unethical i told people on my team i was like oh yeah you should uh go interview or maybe even just [ __ ] go work at one of these companies like you know while we're building this thing for the next three months like go just find out some information about these other companies that like are like they're not like our direct competitors but like if i knew information it would be quite valuable to me and uh i remember to me i literally i literally didn't even think twice about it which is like you know maybe where my moral compass is broken but um i remember and like half of my team was like oh great idea and then one person was like you know i don't know if that's the best idea and i was like what why what did i say and then i like realized i was like oh yeah i guess that could be seen as kind of like dirty i guess so you know i was like oh whoops my bad never mind if i if i ask you to do anything that is considered bad cancel uh cancel the ball well the other tactic is you just um try to recruit the other people's team not intending to hire them for a particular role and you say like super high salary yeah yeah and they're like well why would you consider leaving this company oh you don't like how it's run what what don't you like about it right i definitely talked to ex-employees so i've done this twice i found somebody who worked at a place before i'll call them up and usually like somebody who's like you know left the company they don't really mind sharing they're not sharing like confidential information but like they'll tell you like you know we thought initially we thought about things this way but then we learned this like i i saved i remember once i just pivoted my business because we were going to do this one thing and then um i talked to this guy and actually it's funny because this actually played out i was building a thing that was getting really popular amongst teens doing group facetime so this before the iphone let you do groups and um and so it was like we kind of started to grow really fast amongst teenagers and i was like how has nobody thought of this before this is not like a new idea just like oh instead of phrase time group facetime and so i went back and i talked to the i forgot who was like there's some app that like had blown up seven eight years before that before house party so we did this and house party was just starting to do the same thing and i wouldn't talk to somebody from like vauxhall or i forgot what they're called there's like some app like that that like you've done this before and they had gotten pretty far like they had raised like tens of millions of dollars they had millions of users they were like sponsoring concerts that like teens were going to and be like oh download our app and then group facetime yeah group facetime when you go home and like it was like the thing and it like didn't work so i asked the guy i was like hey i'm kind of building group facetime now like what went wrong for you guys and he's like buddy let me tell you here here's how your future is going to play out and he basically described kind of like word for word a bunch of things and i was i was like and so in my head i'm thinking it's good input it's good feedback a good like real world data do i in my mind do i have a compelling counter argument to why my fate is gonna be different than this person's fate and i did not and so i was like yeah i think the things he's saying i have really no like i think basically his like main thing was it'll grow but it won't stick and you'll never make money and it won't which was like the whole whole point of the clubhouse thing yeah which is very similar to what ended up happening clubhouse before clubhouse house party so the guys who created meerkat they pivoted to house party house party blew up vcs are funding it tens of millions of dollars doing group face time and i remember telling one of the vcs who did it i go hey here's why we pivoted away from this like just a couple months ago even though we kind of had similar like pretty explosive growth was i saw some problems with churn i couldn't think of what i would do to mitigate it and then i talked to this guy and he was like yeah here's the problem they'll come home from school he's like he's like there's this there's a sweet spot in age where they have friends but they don't have a car and so they come home and they're like trapped so they just want a group they'll just like go home go to the room and just call their friend for like six hours straight he's like let me guess dude so in your data you're seeing six hour sessions i was like yeah we are and he's like yeah cool you that's normal and i was like oh i thought we were special he's like no that's exactly how they'll use this and then they go to car and then they'll go to college when they go to college their freshman year they'll use this ton with their friends from high school and then they'll never use it again because they don't they stop talking to the friends from high school and then in college their friends are all around them they don't need group face time and then they become an adult they never need group face time he's like so why why did these get funded then uh because you see the chart you see growth like we were saying you see six hour sessions and you say uh is this the next week's social network maybe this is the next snapchat next tick tock and so you bet and like sure enough house party sold for not a lot to to fortnight basically in the end as like a team and technology acquisition and that never saw the light of day again like it didn't work out um but you know i i think other people should do what i did which was talk to the past competitors and they're always going to have like they're always going to be jaded so you know they're never going to say this will work because their [ __ ] didn't work and they think they're smart but when you hear their argument from what went wrong you say does that match my data and experiences and then secondly do i think anything has changed is the why now any different um and in my case it was not damn that's crazy man we gotta we gotta like when i see some of these things get invested i also get intoxicated into them as well i'm like oh wait this is not going to work yeah consumer's just so hot honestly it's still a fine bet like somebody was saying this when i did that clubhouse thing and a bunch of people were like i think that's true that i think that's how it's going to play out a couple smart people pointed out like look um these guys invested i think they invested like a hundred million dollars i think i think andreas invested 100 million dollars at a four billion dollar valuation for clubhouse at its peak and like since then the chart just shows it going down down down but they're like you know their fund is this big so this is like it's not it's not a it's not a like majority it's not like they're betting the house on this they're betting like their normal size bet it's just a big number to you secondly it's a pretty binary option like this is either gonna go big and this is gonna this price is gonna look cheaper it's gonna go to zero and if it goes to even if it goes down they're gonna be able to sell this for something and they have preference so they're gonna make back you know if this thing sells for 50 million dollars eventually to twitter or whoever um you know they're going to get the whole 50 because they have like the they get the money first so they'll make back their money first and so like you know like on the whole it's not that bad of a bet even if it doesn't work out and if it does work out you know you're a genius and great you're you know everything worked out great so um so yeah it was whatever yeah i was going to tell you an idea yeah well you're interested in my ideas are on a beverage company okay so i was thinking about i was like damn everybody's done every variation of this that's like bottled water boxed water liquid death is water even hand that looks like a beer logan paul has one there's vitamin water there's non-vitamin water there's flavored water there's sparkling water and then there's like 10 of each of these right i was like what what haven't people done what's the and so i came up with this brand and this is free for anybody to run with um just ketchup what's it like hot dogs put your boys in cut your boys in uh if you do this i'm calling it felix falicious um which is i don't know if you ever read harry potter but it's basically this potion that harry gets he wins this thing and the professor gives him this potion and it's like you get one drop of this and it's it's going to give you great like good luck for one day 24 hours you're going to have everything's going to go your way and the potion was called felix felicious or something like that or felicis i don't know how you say it but like in my head when i was reading it i called it felix felicia so we're going to go with that so basically it's it's good luck felix and it's like you're one lucky cat i don't know i bet i'm just butchering the pronunciation and i don't know what it is but what a great slogan that you just came up with as we built this brand in public here it was delicious you're one lucky cat and um and the you know the brand it's basically it's water that's infused with things that give you good luck i don't know what that is it might just be good vibes it might be like some crystal uh like you know that goldschlager liquor like there's like some flakes at the bottom that are your little good luck charms um this comes from you know the himalayas it comes from whatever the luckiest place on earth is i don't know what that is we'll find out that's the idea it's just placebo water and it's openly placebo water but you know what i like when i feel like i had a little good luck charm at the start of my day i like the idea that hey you know i got that big test today if i'm what am i going to go grab vitamin water or lucky water i'm gonna go i could grab the lucky water if i got the test just in case just in case i've heard a lot of ideas on this podcast and that is definitely one of them that's that's what i would tell you about that my second silly idea is again another great name it's called galimony what's galimony you ask galimony is alimony for your girlfriend so here's the deal let's say you're a girl you're dating a guy who's super into crypto right yeah he keeps talking about ethereum and bitcoin and z cash and the next big thing he keeps telling you that 3 is the future and you know smart contracts and the dollar is going to crash he never needs to talk to a lawyer again because of smart contracts you say oh that's cool actually i have a great smart contract idea for us and she he's like oh i'm so glad you're finally getting into web three this is the future you're like yeah it's the future for sure um hey why don't you just use your metamask to log into galimoni and what you do is you put up one either and if we break up i get half it's basically a divorce for non-married couples where the boyfriend is obsessed with web 3 and you're the girlfriend and you're like how do i profit off of this guy's annoying obsession that's actually galimoni smart contract that would go viral and you just both lock up your you both lock up your earth or maybe he locks up your ear he locks up to each and it's actually actually here's okay let me make it better let me just riff with myself here this is a one-man brainstorm okay he puts in the eath the eath is never at risk so because you know maybe he's like why why would i take this deal you say the eath is never at risk my friend if we break up you'll always get your eat back but while we're dating this is gonna be automatically yield farming interest and i get to keep the interest on this thing because i'm putting in this time dating your schmuck ass who's gonna be obsessed with web3 so put a little collateral up it's gonna be farming we get to have a web3 experience this is the future am i right that's what i would be doing if i was dating so so how does she get paid she like clicks a button says smart contract actually maybe it's tied to like your instagram account i don't know maybe maybe both sides have to confirm that you're broken up uh yeah but why would i ever confirm that because then you start dating the next girl i'm just gonna send her this link that says he signed in with a cryptographic signature that only he could do with his private keys saying we are not broken up and so you know you kind of need that proof of proof of relationship to be accurate otherwise you're leaving a little liability out there by saying with the utmost true truth that you are in a relationship so he's gonna have to he's gonna have to be true have you heard young kids what they say now is the receipt yeah these are receipts yeah like show me the receipt that's what we're talking here i just learned that on that tv show that you just uh discovered for everyone else called cheer yeah you know i'm just like you know such a i'm basically like at like these indie festivals just finding these hidden gems like cheer yeah so galimony i'm on board with i think that's cool that is a viral idea ben uh young powerful mormon ben can you come out here and tell us give me your rankings 1 to 10 10 being i'm quitting my job and i'm going starting this one being i can't believe you just said that idea give me felix felicious where are you at um i'm honestly at like a nine or ten thank you thank you you threw out the term though you just kind of threw away like placebo water which i also think is like a separate brand maybe for like science nerds but like same and the tagline is like at least we admit we're full of [ __ ] no no it's it no it's actually placebo water is actually part of the category i'm a category creator in addition to an entrepreneur designer and fashionista so the category here it's like plant-based but it'll just be called placebo-based uh beverages and these are placebo-based beverages of which we are you know we launched the first one okay and what about i'm on board and galimony that one not quite there not not quite to the level of uh felix felicis i'm gonna say that's more like a a six like there's something there but you need to develop it a little bit more okay anything less than an eight is a zero by the way feedback is a gift so i i thank you for the gift back can i tell you about one thing really quick that i just discovered so have you heard of the twitter handle elon jet elon jet no what is that dude there's this young kid who created it's just basically elon's jet is that the guest who just tracks elon's jet and so as of now he's near where our friend jack lives in hawaii and so basically when you have how many followers does this have eighty-three thousand and so it's like 20 minutes to the poor guy who's like trying to produce high quality content every day and it's grinding to like 12 000 followers and then elon's jet just zips to 83 000 followers overnight it says something like um all right took off from honolulu kailua hawaii now going to austin texas arriving in six hours and 17 minutes landed in austin texas approximate time six hours and 21 minutes it's pretty pretty wild didn't it um this you're not a big sports guy like a mainstream sports guy but this became a big deal every year for uh nba free agency so basically you know kawhi leonard becomes a free agent he just won the finals he's the finals mvp he's like the hottest free agent and nobody knows where he's gonna where he's gonna sign and all the reporters were trying to like work their sources but like their sources are basically like teams leaking information that makes them look good and the agent leaking information that just like is a negotiation in public against other teams and reddit actually solved the case they were like hey we can just track kawaii's jet oh look he's going to la i bet he signs at the clippers and sure enough signed with the clippers like wait what the magic did he have uh like why so i i how does jet registration work so they could so they could track basically any private uh private flight has to go through air traffic control that's how these guys do all this stuff so they have that so what they do is they just enter they just figure out once what they don't you don't know who's the passenger but you figure out whose jet is it so for example this is elon's jet what they were tracking for reddit i think was the owner's jet so they knew um they knew which owners which teams were going to pitch him so be like oh a flight from miami to toronto just left that's price that's the miami heat owner's jet so that's them going and pitching their case oh they got a second meeting so that means they're doing better than the next didn't get a second meeting and they were tracking that and then i forgot how i think what it was was like the someone had let basically like they they know who the they know who the billionaire's jets are and you can't like shake that once that's tagged it's tagged and so from there they knew and somebody was like letting him use their j it wasn't kawhi's jet but like something like that was going on where a rich guy was letting kawhi use his jet for this purposes and so they knew before the professional journalists knew where he was going to sign this is badass i've never heard about this this is awesome i knew that like jet tracking was was like that but i didn't realize it was that good that you could like for basketball trades right it's really scary it's kind of like you shouldn't be able to do this dude what's crazy is like my head automatically goes like crazy stuff like jfk [ __ ] like yeah i'm like oh i could go kill elon yeah some kidnap or something like yeah like like just with

Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) and Sam Parr (@TheSamParr) talk about how Andrew Lloyd Webber has used musicals to become a billionaire.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
dude there's this guy uh people are gonna laugh at me because i don't know or if you know who this is uh is it andrew lloyd webber i forget who i forget the guy's name is that the fan of the opera guy yes so you get school of rock phantom of the opera and evita which are all big hits that i've heard of and then i've never heard of jesus christ superstar but yeah that's apparently like done in the 70s yeah he uh he's a billionaire yeah so i looked up so when i thought of that play model i was like is the play is the play business a good business it could be and i think it can be so the the top the top ip definitely accrues like a [ __ ] ton of value like i said if you you can go look at like lion king is grossed like two point something billion dollars uh that's the number one stage play number two hamilton is like getting up there it's like it's like number two or three now but it's like very new so it'll it'll surpass lion king if it just keeps going um there's like fan of the opera there's mamma mia there's like so you take the top ten and they're all doing like hundreds of millions in gross sales okay now you don't get to keep the gross sales but i think you could do this in a way that works so like the guy who created hamilton lynn manuel whatever his name is yeah but did the uh did the author get paid too on that one uh so he gets so this guy lynn who's the creator of it he uh has like a seven percent royalty or something like that wow so he's made like tens of millions of dollars off of the the profits they actually crowdfunded the thing uh so what they did i don't have the full story in front of me because i'm just trying to say this off top my head from a memory but i think what they did was to raise the money to create the thing they had like a bunch of patrons basically chip in money and they all get to keep a profit share after a certain amount of money had been recouped and so that investment has been paid over like 10 times so if again if i was hustling i'd be like hmm there's web3 [ __ ] going on interesting a lot of people flush with cash buying into [ __ ] okay cool digital tickets nfts okay what can i do with this and i would basically raise 10 million dollars through an nft pre-sale of the show and uh in different tiers like you know some of the tickets have backstage passes attached to them some of them don't whatever it's interesting and i would i would just let people buy buy this i'd raise 10 million dollars i'd use the 10 million dollars to go into a bunker to create whatever the health hamilton black people is and then i would hamilton brown people for indians oh yeah sorry not black people brown people so then i would take that show on the road and i would just try to i would be like yeah i know it's hard but like being a successful stand-up comedian was also like a 0.1 percent success rate or whatever um you know to get to where he's at so like yeah you want to get to the point one percent success rate but this time with a superior business model that um doesn't require your face on stage saying the jokes yeah i think that's sick i think that's a that's a great idea i think that's actually that's wonderful i think and that could be incredibly creative creatively fulfilling i wish i had said it on the spot it's like one of those when you're in an argument and then like later you're interested in that oh [ __ ] i should have said that that's what happened to me but luckily we were still hanging out at that moment so i was able to tell them you know then ah this is a cool idea i think in the next couple episodes what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to bring in i'm going to do some research on the broadway business or like theater i guess what do you call it theater yeah um it's actually an interesting idea i was always curious because american idiot basically they did this so billy joe armstrong wrote green day wrote american idiot the album the song they turned it into a uh a rock musical right you didn't have to be there they didn't have to be there you know exactly and they got paid a lot from it book of mormon let me see how much book of mormon has made of mormon yeah 500 million dollars has been the gross ticket sales of book of mormon and then if you did something like a hamilton or like a lion king or whatever you could take that same ip those characters you have merch you have like other that ip is your key is you got to own the ip and um you know so so i think you know when that when book of mormon launched it says it was bringing bringing in 19 million per month so like i don't know what south park generated lifetime but like i bet it's kind of like on par with that uh or you know i guess south park's probably a bigger success um yeah oh wow south park okay just in 20 i didn't know this happened actually it looks like a couple months ago the south park creators signed a 900 million dollar deal for more episodes for for uh six years uh with viacom cbs that's insane i didn't know that that's actually amazing that's amazing right now is the best time ever to be a like a production company or an ip holder and we said this a long time ago remember i said someone needs to there's all these platforms now you got at the time it was netflix amazon prime and then i said disney plus was gonna come out it hadn't come out yet um and then there was like you know there's hulu there's all these different platforms apple tv plus came out um they all want original content they're all hungry for content and they are betting billions of dollars uh budgeting every single year to buy content i think netflix or amazon or something like they're paying like six billion dollars per year for content uh for new content production and so it is the best time ever to be a seller of content at the time we had said somebody should create yc for content basically the way that y combinator helped produce software startups and i just said hey two engineers okay you're 21 years old you graduated from stanford all right come here this is essentially like a business school but you're going to create a little business and you know maybe you can sell to facebook or google or you'll end up becoming the next airbnb you'll go public i think the same thing with the content where you come in as two kind of like creatives you have a pitch for an idea of a show you want to create you have three months to basically create the sizzle reel or the pilot or whatever and then there's a demo day with a bunch of buyers from all the big streaming platforms and they just buy options on your [ __ ] and um i just think that's a beautiful i still think that's a great business idea and it's only been proven when south park signs a 900 million deal with with cbs uh shonda rhimes i think signed a couple hundred million dollar deal with netflix to produce six shows um reese witherspoon sold her production company which didn't even have that like for like a billion for like a billion dollars um like this is you know this is tech startup money that's being sold for for tv content which is amazing so you know that's a that's way more fun than building software way more way cooler um way cooler than that and i think today hussmannaj also announced his production he created a production company today he announced it like 100 things called 186k productions or something like that which is smart again like once you see reese witherspoon and other people's production companies selling and we had rob deerdeck on i think he said he sold his production company for 200 something million he said that he i think he said he's walking away with 100 him personally yeah so like i think you know at least let's say at least 100 million probably closer to 200 million he sold his production company which basically just produced shows for mtv that's a great business to be in and i think it's only going to get better for like this kind of five year period

it was strange i was pulling up to my university or through college and i would pull up and uh at some i would pull up in like a drop top lexus like 70 000 car and i was like 19 right [Music] dude so um val sean uh he's not making it today but that's okay we um so your thing went viral today how many likes did you get like three thousand thirty three something like that i had to turn off my notifications i can't do when you work with i don't know how you guys do it i don't know how people do it while running full businesses but um i had to turn that off because i just can't concentrate that that thing just my phone was just blowing up all day now you know how i feel it is crazy right it's crazy so you you had 3 000 followers and now you have like nine maybe nine thousand something like that yeah i mean it took me how many years to get up to like 20 700. um yeah now it's i don't know i didn't look to be honest with you but i'm probably at like eight nine thousand at this point so all right the background here is i met you through my like we we share like a best friend joe and we joe told me about you he goes this guy's crazy and so lit val let me tell you what i know about you and you tell me if it's right or wrong and then i want to hear your story but basic basically you he goes and i'll i won't reveal too many numbers i'll let you talk about any number that you want to talk about because i don't know if what i know is confidential or not so i'm not going to i'm not going to mention them but you as a 19 year old you came from uh russia you came from russia i came from uzbekistan it was about the age of 11 and then you come here you get a computer at like 16 or 17 you start this uh affiliate marketing uh business you're the only employee by age like 22 23 you've made something like 30 million in profit from this like one little business from there you parlayed that into in a lyric website that was like one of the biggest lyric websites in the world which doesn't sound that impressive but most people don't realize that lyric websites are some of the most biggest websites in the world and so that made like another eight figures in profit from there you parlayed that into an ad network that now is like huge from there you've now launched a jewelry business that apparently joe has said it's bigger than all your other companies but i don't know if that's true or not and then throughout all this you've acquired and sold and developed like a hundred plus million dollars of real estate is all this accurate uh some of it uh okay so well actually my first and by the way the reason i'm having you on here is because we've had a lot of really successful people on here do interesting stuff and there are like a lot of them are well known but you don't i basically the other day begged you to like tweet something and i helped you write this tweet and it took like a few days and we got it out there but like besides that you pretty much have never done any press you've never talked about this publicly and when i met you i was like this is a gold mine this guy has so many interesting stories we gotta tell this story so anyway what was wrong and what was right so okay so well actually the funny part is that the the first business i had was a playstation like a video game website so it wasn't like huge but you know i was in high school and making like 5 000 bucks a month that actually taught me a lot of lessons um so the so the the search market and you actually told me i actually tweeted another thing about you where you said hey my 12 year old son has a website that's making like two g's a day or something like that um and he needs an email service provider which one should he use and i tweeted that screenshot and it would be yeah well that was anonymous i guess it's not anonymous anymore but uh so he he's uh yeah that that is interesting i saw you post that um and he still has a website it's not doing as well but uh not quite at 2000 um anymore but uh he's uh he's working on like coding this thing away and he's like figuring out all these things so it's actually amazing to see it you know at his age that you know so where'd you get it's crazy that you and your family you just find all these opportunities where did it start so you your thing first thing was a playstation website which what is that so a site called psx extreme um we this is like i launched like 98.99 or something like that actually 99 it was right before the the bubble the dot com bubble burst i was like about eight months into the the the bubble and it was doing really well it was very easy to generate revenue and you know once i got the traffic it was the site was all about anything related to playstation so like get cheat codes your reviews um screenshots whatever right anything for like playstation fans so it was like a playstation fan website then the dot com bubble hits my revenues disappeared 90 my traffic was still up there but i had no revenues because all the ad revenue disappeared like it went from being three dollars cpm down to 30 cents cpm if you could be lucky enough to get that how many people were going to this website um it wasn't huge but i had like like ten thousand uniques a day maybe twenty thousand and ninety 99 and 98 that's got to be a massive site yeah it was good it was a good amount of traffic and it was all free um so it was interesting like experience because i had to quickly learn how to generate revenue and i i had to go out there and sell advertising myself and you know like i and then once i figured out that i could sell advertising i didn't have enough traffic so i went i started going to other video game sites and saying who had much more traffic than me and say hey i got all these advertisers who would spend more if i had more traffic like i'll let me put ads on your sites so i went to all these other video game sites and like just was a broker for advertising so that was kind of like my first uh you know making decent amount of money um i was making five and like just from the site and i was making probably another 10 a month from being a broker and then the thing that you tweeted today or maybe last night it basically you told the story about how when you were 19 after this playstation site you built an affiliate ad site and it made like i forget the i forget the numbers but in two or three years it was like over 30 million in profit so what were you you were selling stuff on behalf of half.com or ebay who were you or no new york times you had like 800 basic you basically you had like 800 ad accounts that sold different stuff so like a new york time subscription for which sold for a hundred dollars but you were able to uh sell it for only 30 bucks so you were able to keep the difference something like that yeah so you know it's affiliate marketing but i use page search which was very new back then and at the time um when after dot com bubble burst all the advertisers got all sudden advertising digital advertising stopped being interesting you know for a sec for for a moment there people thought businesses thought it might you know internet might be over over right so all of a sudden you see kind of all these budgets get you know just get pulled back right especially all the brand advertising and but nobody really you know so everybody has to still figure out how to get customers so they say okay you know what we won't do brand advertising but if you dr if somebody drives as customers we'll pay per customer like we can't loosen that right so performance marketing um so that was around and it was very um accessible and at the same time the media wasn't expensive right because the supply was there but the demand wasn't there so that's what i took advantage of i started buying up a lot of supply mostly was search search page search and that's what made everything so uh profitable because i was just playing into those supply demand dynamics that were working in my favor um but yes what i would do is i would find an advertiser that had a product i would test it on at the time you know kind of like the the modern day yahoo paid search or back then was called goto.com and then later google came around and so i would test that ad if it works i expand on it if it doesn't work right i would figure out how to make it work right uh if there's a if there is a if there's a way to make it work and yeah just like it just uh you know i was like and what what things are you saying oh man everything everything um yeah and all this and all this was making like uh like many millions of dollars of sales for your little one-person operation every year yes that's crazy about yeah tell us a little bit about like what was going on in your life at the time like did you try and go to college were you doing this while you were at college did you drop out like what are you doing with your life uh so um i already had the business um and i went i got into like i'll have finance so i was like all right so i'm gonna do business finance and i didn't really feel like i should be but i only did it because and i had no time for it you seemed like you'd be awful at that i am i was awful i was actually interested in the topics especially the topics i was interested in like law or finance or business accounting all those things were interesting like i couldn't i couldn't sit through biology but even even though they were interesting i had no time to study so i would suck the tests my gpa was horrible i can't remember what it was but it was just horrible um because i just didn't care to you know get prepared for the test i slept in half the class of just catching up on sleep because i would go to sleep at 4 o'clock in the morning and then don't you don't you still do that don't you go to sleep at four and get up at noon yeah i average four or five yeah so if i go to sleep i think yesterday i wanted to be four three i woke up at 11 so i try to get try to get seven hours of sleep it doesn't happen all the time you know a lot of times i have to you know live on five six hours but do you do do you recognize that you're a weirdo um i'm used to i'm used to it you know what i'm i'm a weirdo um i i know i'm i'm do i do everything in reverse my wife keeps telling me like like you do everything backwards so you're you're studying uh finance but you're not doing well because you're running these businesses well i'm in school just because i have a jewish mother and she wanted me to go to like you gotta be in school you have to be in college right or you have to go but did they know that you're like hey mom like i bet you i'm making more money than you uh i i think she she kind of knew i don't know if she knew but uh what i was making i don't remember um but it was it was strange i was pulling up to my university or through college i went to baruch um um new york city baruch business of uh finance ziklin business of finance um and i would pull up and uh at some i would pull up in like a drop top lexus like a 70 000 car and i was like 19 right so or 18 whatever i was i think it was 18 at that point i think i don't think i even started the paid surgery at this point so this business is just like crushing it so like a few years in you've in your tweet you said it made over 30 million in profits like three four five years in so it's gone really well you're paying like a crazy amount of taxes you said so you decide to move uh to the burbs a little bit outside of new york city and you like buy a cheap house in cash so things are going well right like it's but you you said you know i'm a little bored with this or i don't really want to go much further into this in this racket i want to try something new and then the next business was uh mobilefuse which is around today right um so i actually launched around the same time um we launched two businesses so after han so i i launched i launched the let's call the the the music content distribution company oh that's right sorry right so that so we didn't own i didn't own actually lyric sites what i did is i built a service uh i built a system that connects called ringtone matcher and what i realized was there was demand for ringtones and there was all this traffic for um for all this music related traffic especially in lyrics and so what i did is i built a service and the other thing i realized that the traffic was very much international like 70 of of a music site or lyric site was non-us and i noticed that some of the advertisers like ringtone advertisers were advertised they'll do okay but they would have only uh they could only accept u.s customers and they could only accept like verizon customer only t-mobile customer so i built this thing called ringtone matcher and ringtone matcher basically integrated like 60 countries into one system so if you have a music site you could drive that those users to ringtone matcher and ringtone match will figure out based on geo like what country you're in right based on what carrier you use because it's carrier billing so it's important that you know i figured out like ufc mobile and to match you up to a ringtone service that actually um is compatible with t-mobile and then the third thing we look for that content is available so if you're clicking on hey get this get toxic by britney spears ringtone on your phone i need to make sure that that song is also available in their catalog because some some ringtone providers had um like warner music and some of some of them maybe just had the emi they were like four major music companies at the time and uh you know these ringtone providers didn't have all those catalogs so they might have one or two at a time so i would take all that data and put it into one simple link and and how big did that get how big did that business go i was in a front of ringtone matcher was in front of a half a billion people a month yeah half a billion so um and it was everywhere i mean it wasn't just lyric sites i was on cbs radio aol radio yahoo radio last fm like every pretty much every music site i remember even talking to musically which is tik tok now right i remember even talking to those guys i was talking to uh we were talking to whatsapp in the early days like when they were just two guys or something like we wanted to integrate because anytime somebody mentions music or a song or something like i wanted to be i want my i want to bring the matcher there to show up so and but but when you're you're using the word we again it's not weird no this company was so actually that company i started ringtone matcher myself again that was a one-man show at some point i um we you know there was one little group of guys who were pretty good at dealing with advertisers and or actually ringtone providers and i felt like i need help on that front and so i merged those guys in so there were five guys that merged into my company um two formed when you say merge who bought who i was a majority owner of the company and then the the five guys had the like they they had a third of the company i had two thirds how big was it when it was just you um it was just it was going nuts up but uh i think i believe the the year i think the year we merged it was 10 million just again just 10 million profit with just you do you why do you think so this is the we'll get to the rest in a minute but why do you think that you find this weird stuff and why don't you hire people two different questions but how on earth do you find this type of stuff you know it's it's funny like i know i see how organized you are right like you make your goals you lay everything out on paper right you're very organized then you could think about it you ask people for feedback um i'm totally opposite of that um i just kind of go with where like i like to test things and i'm i guess i'm very curious um and uh and i and i i could be very very focused but if i get distracted i get very easily distracted right so it could be like sometimes it's a curse but sometimes it's a blessing a lot of times it's a blessing um and i come across these interesting things and my curiosity just takes it further um so when i when i so the way i actually came across this thing was because i felt that there was a point of my life where i was seeing google was just too dominant part of my business and i didn't like that um because i didn't want to rely on any one thing so i started looking outside of page search for supply um and i came across these music sites and i actually started testing rhapsody on them because i had such a good deal with rhapsody i was like let me start marketing outside of search i did okay and i had these you know i started building these relationships with the music sites and then then then i kind of tested a ringtone service and it just crushed like it was not even close like i did three times better and i was like wow this thing did three times better than rhapsody and that ringtone provider was uh just covering us just like one or two music labels and like two carriers out of four i think i had four there were four major carriers at the time i was like hold on a second if it's already doing three times as well what happens if i start integrating everything globally right so that's how ringtone macho came about was your when you launched stuff what's your first version like junk like you get the idea it was a kitty script i wrote um this you know guy was kind of freelancing for me a little bit um i just i didn't want to tell him about the idea he's actually a cto of one of my companies now um he was like 15 16 years old and i didn't tell him the idea so i said hey how do you script this how do you script that so i scripted it myself and um and uh so yeah so it was pure junk it was literally just a bunch of if and then statements on and and asp we were running windows um windows server on asp infrastructure so i uh i had a bunch of redirects that were just doing a bunch of if and then statements and redirecting people based on certain parameters wouldn't and when you're doing it are you like see every time i've hung out with you the reason i like hanging out with you and joe i consider joe one of my best friends and so i have like his attitude you and joe have the same attitude which is like he's a little more laid back than just and you i think he is he is i've never seen him lose his temper he is very calm and i'm like hey this didn't work out for this reason he goes oh that's okay like he's super calm but you have that too i think i think that like i think that what it you have this like i don't know if it the right word is like hutzpah if the right word is like i don't know what the word is but it's almost like things i've heard we're going to get to the rest of the stories because because there's like this jewelry business that you started which is like seems like even bigger than all the other things that you've done potentially and you like do these things where i'm like but like val you don't know anything about that and like you don't even have any employees like you don't know anything and but you just are like yeah but uh you know whatever i'll just we'll just go a little bit further and then we'll see what happens and then if it if it sucks i'll bail you know what i mean like you have this like oh shucks attitude like oh you know yeah we'll see what happens it's very interesting whereas like if i was doing what you were doing and i started seeing those results i'm like is this illegal am i breaking the law am i going to go to jail what is going on like oh it's almost like i would have most people would have self-destructive tendencies when they see this like going so well yeah look i see that all the time i feel like people tend to overthink things and spend a lot of time like analysis paralysis and the reason i think a lot of people are successful like especially somebody like me is well somebody's thinking about making perfecting one thing which by the way will still have a you know 60 failure right and that one thing that you just overthought i rather test 10 things by within that same time period and i will likely have i have a better um accuracy or i'll have a better um chance of hitting it out of the ballpark with one of those 10 things maybe more than one of those things yeah how did you get into the jewelry business to start with um so after i sold those two music related companies um which i took like three years off off you know i thought i retired all right um but it was anything but i just got started getting like my curiosity was just taking me into all different like i was on all these boards and i was like you know investing into a bunch of things and um and i realized that's the three years i need to build something again so i started looking at i knew that i wanted to do something where it's fixing or disrupting a fragmented space i didn't really want to go after like corporate america um i wanted to go after like mom and pops that when i say mom and pops it could be like you know i'm taking like car dealerships right they do tens of millions of dollars it doesn't mean they're tiny right so i wanted to go after something like along those lines um and i had some investments in the jewelry space i had some family in the jewelry space it's a pretty tight-knit community i just happened to be i had some family that too that that knows that that that business um i actually worked as a teenager i worked um every weekend i worked in a you know in a jewelry store i knew how to fix like i knew how to fix jewelry i mean i would sit on a bench uh with a blowtorch at like 15 years old uh because my cousin taught me it was my it was a it was a family business my my aunt and uncle's business they had a couple jewelry stores and um they taught me how to fix jewelry and um to you know so i knew the business a bit from the retailer's perspective it always seemed like a very weird way to do business i always had questioned everything like they're doing and so so um so the idea was hey like these retailers um if we could integrate build a platform and services and we could integrate into them and this is a 300 billion dollar industry by the way globally which fragmented but controls is actually bigger um independents are bigger part of the business fine jewelry than the majors the chains so i knew that again if i could build distribution but i had to bring um then there's a lot of power there but i have to bring value and that's where my expertise and data and marketing digital all that came into fruition you know so we basically put this thing together we integrate into stores and help them grow help them bring customers cut costs increase their revenue how much did you invest to start it um to start it i don't i mean to start it i think we started off a couple million so you put two million dollars a video in the beginning yeah how big is this but you've done more i think you put more in since how big is this going to be i put in way more i mean at this point i put in eight figures into this business um i think it's a multi-billion dollar company in the future for real you think it's a multi-billion dollar company like to sell yeah market cap i i believe that hey i don't know if there's anybody big enough to buy my company or this or this company we actually have a lot of people this time around it's no it's no longer just val we have a lot of employees i i believe this company will be if it's successful we could do what we need to do and we could really help all these retailers step up their game um i i don't think that there's really a company in that space that would be big enough to acquire us so like well but are you are you the ceo of that company is that smart i mean that doesn't seem like you're you're just you get up at 11 a.m and like you go to bed at four how are you the ceo of a company that could be a billion dollar company um yeah i know a good question look um we have a great team that is able to execute how many people um it's hard to say we became pretty global but you know our our offices outside of us are not all um most they're not employees right so they're so all all in um if i have to talk about factories our our tech teams our marketing teams are um we're probably talking about 70 people at this point wow and who's like but you're not running the day-to-day of the business oh hell yeah yeah 95 of the time goes into this business so then are you like talking with the employees and things like that i mean you're like running all hands meetings and things like that yeah i'm not big on meetings i'll be on you know to be honest with you um but um but uh i'm very accessible to all my team i mean everybody on my teams have access to me i go into the office in the city we actually had the we were in the office june june 2020 i mean we had you know covet like every it was ghost town in the city and we had to figure out how to be in the office because it's not an eco it's not just a digital ad business that i could just operate from from work from home right we had to have people in the offices and uh we did all kinds of things we we we got cars to car um to to pull people in to the office but um but anyway we yeah i'm i'm i'm there i'm i'm in the weeds but it's not like you're kind of downplaying it i invested in one of their your properties we bought a six plex in greenpoint i think i forget well we essentially bought land right we bought a house because it's gonna be knocked down we're gonna build a brand new uh we're gonna ground up construction it's gonna be uh like a nice a nice condo building yeah yeah yeah that's that's what i mean but i didn't even look at the details i was just like anything that val does i'm part of but it's it's way bigger than you're you're just saying like it's a project i mean i think you've bought like 100 million dollars with the real estate right no i haven't i haven't bought 100 million we have six projects couple of them already completed third one is just about to be completed actually two the first two were completed and completely sold out uh the third one is about to be completed and go on the market um and then we have three other projects and they are getting bigger and bigger um the value of um the the the combined sale value of value of those projects would be approaching 100 million dollars do what do you what are you tinkering on now what excites you now what and and someone asked a good question which is what is the uh the equivalent of ringtones today what's the equivalence of like it's just crazy that it's just like you're kind of like this like digital cowboy you're just like this like one guy in the wild west doing this [ __ ] with like no rules it's just i just think it's hilarious that you are just a pirate who's taking it to the extreme where are the digital pirates at right now uh it has to be like tick-tock um what do you mean it's you know you look for like those spaces that haven't been touched right um i guess people ask me i think i think that's what you're saying like what's what what can you what can be marketed these days and how to get that kind of scale and i i don't it's hard because what i've seen over over my career is that the windows of opportunity those white spaces right the windows windows are becoming shorter and shorter and shorter every iteration right there was the paid search probably lasted a good six years after that um or around that same time there was display that probably lasted a little less and then there was social media that that window probably you know the arbitrage window right yeah yeah that probably lasted two three years at best now you talk you know now you got like instagram and tick tock and you got the instagram reels um i mean those are probably also one year windows of opportunity if you could kind of catch that lightning and build on it then you got something but your your window and it's all rooted in distribution which is how do you get distribution quickly and you're saying that you think that's tick tock do you think that window is still open um i i think if you have a knack for understanding how get virality or get content then then you have your own distribution if you don't have that knack you got to figure out how to work with people that have that that access so if there's one company that could work with all the sampars right all the podcasters uh how much is that worth like we're using a platform here right now right that is just smart they're they're doing the right thing like they're focusing on guys like you who have all this access but they're not selling anything right they're just selling you a platform if somebody could sell figure out how to sell a product across a number of podcasts that's worth a lot and you could sell i'll move a lot of product and by the way it doesn't have to be podcasts what about all the tic tacs who are doing all those dances right i know um i know like for one company they they scale to like 80 million in sales a few years ago i'm not going to mention the name of it but um they scaled to like 80 million in sales just on the back of youtube influencers what was the product it was cosmetics and they just cosmetics was that cosmetics it was just like makeup or something or lotion yeah yeah the numbers were just insane and um yeah it was just a long place like it wasn't just big influencers even the like thousands of mediocre uh influencers or the smaller um ones that just drove it so stuff like that like latch on to something that is big um especially if you could uh latch onto the like the long tail of it because not not a lot of people look at the long tail part of uh sure businesses well so one thing i wonder you know like this thing that val talks about of testing out 10 different things before the other guy can put his pants on right like you're you're building your uh perfect thing that's going to take you six months before you even get to market great i'm gonna test 10 things in that time that sounds really nice but also like i guess i'll actually ask sam first then i'll ask you val like what do you think it is about val what do you think it is about either his skill set or his personality that allows him to do that much testing where other people just like can't figure that out apparently the uh i think that this is a common thread that i've seen i i my buddy joe is just like this there's this thing particularly i find it amongst immigrants or children of immigrants and maybe because they've like experienced some type of hardship where they're like uh like dude i've experienced some crazy [ __ ] or my family has experiencing it has experienced crazy [ __ ] i have zero fear and looking like a fool if that's the worst if the worst that's gonna happen is i'm gonna look stupid or lose uh a tiny amount of money i'm okay with that and i don't so i don't have any fear about that that's what that's what i think i've noticed that's the trend i've noticed amongst people like belle look i think there's a i think that's i think there's a huge that's a huge factor and one of the things i look at like i'm raising kids now right how do i make sure that they kind of because they're not going to grow up the same way i grew up right they're not going to come out the resources they have the access they have it's very different from what i grew up with so what i think i realized is the power the power is in resourcefulness okay i was able to make a lot or do a lot i should say whether it's money or whatever it is right it doesn't have to be just money it could be whatever whatever it excites you right but i was able to do a lot with very little but it's because i had no choice and i had very little like we weren't poor like you don't get i didn't come from poverty or anything like that but but again my parents couldn't afford a computer for me for the first six years of my life here right um so i i got to think like how do i recreate that and you can't really recreate that for your kids but i figured okay i'm not you know i'm not going to give my kids everything on a silver platter so so you i mean you just talked about my son like he is uh he he he's his dna is very like like mine like he's way ahead of me because he has all these tools like you know he has a computer way before me i didn't buy him a computer i made him save up the money i don't care how he does it birthdays work whatever during that time he researched all parts and everything i think at the age of like seven or eight he built a computer bought the parts by himself he built a computer from scratch by himself i didn't even help him that's crazy so he now built two computers like and he taught himself how to code and um so i i suppress resources for my kids systematically not like i don't feed them like they're they're they're they're very they're they're doing just fine like they're big groups they live in a nice neighborhood but i systematically uh make sure that they're not given all the resources because that's how you naturally learn to become resourceful what do you think it is yeah fundamentally it's about doing more with less essentially you're saying yeah yeah but but it has to start from day one are you driven by money yes and no um i i yes because it's uh it's it's uh it's kind of like a score right i i don't see your money it's like a it's a number and a bank account right like you don't it's not like back in the days where you look you know you you know it's not like we're scrooge mcduck like you get to jump through the to the vault of cash right like i i would watch it as a kid and i was like wow i want to be that guy one day um um and um but uh no i think i think what i'm driven really is by just winning and um there is i think there is a bit of sense in me of um that i'm one step from losing it all you still feel that way uh i feel like it's still possible i think i think it's a i think it's like an immigrant thing um probably by the way i feel exactly the same way i was like in bed last night telling my wife i was like i need to go like a therapist or something i'm like i'm freaking out we're gonna lose everything this is all going away i feel the exact i feel like i for a long time i like had a plan on where i would go if i was homeless like i still don't believe that in some ways in a in a weird way kind of excites you not about homeless but that you got a chance to figure it out from scratch again it yeah because i like uh it does kind of make me because when you have nothing it's kind of fun to play games because it's just easier to bet sometimes you can't bet as much but it's kind of exciting to be like just like a hood rat with nothing like which which i was um it is kind of exciting but i get fear of like the anxiety i i feel of losing everything like i like i have so many spreadsheets that map out like all right when the money gets to this number then i gotta go and panic and get a job and start like ubering like i have like a plan for that we um the reason why i had you on and ben the reason why i wanted to show you this guy is now it's he's hard to explain but i wanted people to understand like a truly unique and original thinker and i don't you know i we you're gonna have to come on again but like d do you does it do you understand what i'm saying but it's very original thinking yeah and you you can see that just in the way that like you've out have attacked have tackled like a a different set of problems than anyone else i've ever talked to uh just like i've never talked to someone who's like yeah i tackled ringtones and then ad networks and then peer-to-peer lending and then the jewelry business like i just think that kind of belies how your mind functions differently than other people do you do you feel that way like do you feel that you just have unique perspective have you met anyone that looks at the world the way you do and if you acknowledge that it's weird because and you're saying that you didn't you didn't actually realize it was weird until i talked about you in the podcast like half a year ago which is weird because how old are you like 39 at 38 and you're now just realizing that you're you're you're an oddball um yeah so i i i didn't see myself that way until you did the whole expose with that show on that on that one episode um that you didn't tell me about but uh after our lunch but um i know yeah by the way i i i told joe i was like dude i'd never do that i almost always ask for permission before i talk about it but i just was too excited and i forgot um it was i have a i have a story but i'll tell you that after um on that but um so to me like when you said like oh this guy goes from this industry to that industry he's like jumping all over the place and he's you know kind of successful or or successful and doing it this is like crazy i was like huh i i never thought of myself that way that but it makes sense like i i don't know i keep jumping different categories i guess again that curiosity just kicks in and and and i just but i i go after it instead of just what if you know i just kind of go after it but um no i i i until now i really haven't realized uh that how odd that is uh but thank thank you for letting me know that i'm uh i'm really strange i just think that like there's just a bunch of unique there's just a bunch of unique things about you and i think it's so cool when i say weird and odd that's a really good compliment by the way yeah listen i know you well enough now to to know that's a compliment so so the funny story about again before you i was pretty under under the radar right like yeah you can find stuff on you you have to really look like nobody really put it out there right and so then joe tells me like you're gonna do they did podcast and i didn't tell my wife and then the podcast comes out i'm like hey sarah um um the the the um this guy did a podcast on me she's like and who cares about a podcast she's like you know but he's not talking about me who cares like what a couple hundred people gonna listen i'm like apparently this guy has like a million people listening she's like oh great um she's like did he ask you permission i was like not really so i don't really know what he's talking about um so he's like okay so the thing comes out is like so we're listening to it and and he keeps saying val you're saying val val val like never say uh right never say my last name and then you and sean go into like this tangent talking about red pill and blue pill or whatever so she's like and so we thought like it said val part is over right she's like okay it wasn't so bad he never mentioned your last name how he's gonna figure out who's val and then after you went off to a tangent with about the pills and you're like oh by the way i forgot to mention his full name let me smell it let me spell it out for you and you literally spelt my last name so she's like i'm to kill this guy oh she was bad yeah she was mad she's she's very she's very she's very nice everything i thought that everything we said you could find publicly and we didn't reveal anything like crazy and um i try to only like i just read your linkedin that's basically all i did yeah you could find stuff but it's you know it's one thing to the information to be out there for somebody to look for it um but it's another one when you're on full blast right like and it's being discovered um so right now by audiences so so that's all new to me i know i i felt like an [ __ ] when that happened i i'm normally always good at that so like if someone if we're out with friends and people talking about stuff i'm like hey is this private or not like they have to make sure they say it's private around me um you're you're a nice guy so i'll let it slide yeah i blew up your spot and yeah i that's something i remember the day that happened i was like oh my god joe i didn't even realize it because sometimes when shawn and i were recording i forget that it's a podcast i just like it's just like friends talking to one and i forget i'm like oh my god i forgot that was i just said that on air i can't believe that so that that was one of those examples but um dude this was awesome what do you think ben this is this is pretty badass this is great it's got me fired up to go i know you're doing your airbnbs this year sam that's kind of your thing though right before this podcast he said don't do it oh really yeah i think i'm gonna do it anyway but he i told him these two ideas that i might work on and he basically said uh dude i was like should i work on going hard on content should i work on this job board idea or this airbnb thing he goes do content and i was like oh that's what i don't want to do i said don't do it now well i didn't actually he literally sent me his response like three minutes before the podcast so i didn't entirely read the i haven't read the whole his whole reply but he's he's like the he's like the the the land thing that's just gonna bog you down that's what he said yeah i think i i i i think something you could do in the future but not now i do feel inspired after hearing for about and from val of like i need to be trying more things like just taking more swings and like putting more experiments out there to see kind of what what lands i like that yeah look at that throw stuff against the wall like see what sticks um what's the worst but when you throw mo when most people throw stuff against the wall it's a half-ass attempt when you throw stuff against the wall like you spend money or you like you said that when you were like when you didn't have much you spent like six or seven thousand dollars on ads to see if this x thing could work whereas most people will like like oh that's i lose a couple hundred bucks i don't want to do that it's like you you actually try but that was an accident like like in that thread that was an accident there were no budget caps back then so i turned it on i go to sleep and i woke up to a 6 000 span yeah but you still did it i mean i get just like most people just don't do your your attempts are like good so when i was going to all these music sites you know how i get their attention i would go to a site and i would just kind of through alexa or whatever i kind of know how much traffic they have and i knew these guys were outside the country and to get their attention i would literally email them and say hey i'll give you a hundred thousand dollars so i give you fifty thousand dollars i'll give you twenty thousand dollars prepaid i'll wire it tomorrow just so you could uh test my ringtone matcher link for seven days if you don't like it it doesn't make you enough money take the link off we never talk again if you if you like how much it generates we'll sign you'll sign a contract um and everybody signed a contract because those two text links were generating like five times like somebody who was making like a like there were sites that were making like top sites for making like a hundred thousand dollars a month i would pay him four hundred thousand a month on top of that and and how many people actually took you up and said all right fine everybody and then i'll put yours they all wanted the money first oh the money um my success rate on that email was just i mean who the heck is going to take money like up front i would be like you know what i don't need you to do it up front i'll give it a try just because you're serious and you actually told the story on pom's podcast because you like you're like bold but you have high integrity because like i think there was a guy who you owed a lot of money to because uh they were a customer of your or they were a vendor and you just had a bill that you had to pay them and they like changed their address or something and you're like dude i can't find you i owe you 60 000 and you like held on to the 60 000 for like a long time and you just were seeking them out everywhere like hey where'd you go i need to pay you your money yeah yeah it pays off like um um we because we had so many international people um in the music business when the great recession hidden there they were in all these countries and uh where their their banks a lot of them were banks were located in weird areas uh we're we're countries like cyprus and they would literally tell us hey stop stop wiring us money we we don't trust the bank we're working with i got to get a new bank account like we held their money for they told us to hold their money for i mean we had millions in our bank account that didn't belong to us and all these sites basically told me told me like i was kind of like their bank for for a while because they didn't want to get paid and they didn't they didn't trust the bank um it was phenomenal to me like i couldn't understand that they they trust us trust me with their money um uh for i mean it was i think some in some cases up to a year we were holding their money because he had nowhere to send it that's crazy dude this is a good conversation i'm happy you came on this is awesome listen you're doing i told you before i love your podcast it's very um it's very like it's it's very like layman terms right it's it's actually takes a lot of intellect in my opinion to dumb things down well thank you i appreciate that it helps uh yeah often times i wonder like i've a lot of my friends are english as a second language maybe uh it's like i'm always amaze can you imagine coming to another country we don't speak the language at like 12 13 14 15 16 and then like just crushing it i just so i think that's just like amazing i've got a bunch of friends who are esls and they'll they'll like i'll help them write stuff because um they're just a little rough and i'm like dude how are you so badass i just i'm amazed that you you're i'm just amazed at some of these yeah and you're one of those people yeah well like whether you're a cell like my english is pretty good now but i still can't yeah put my thoughts together in a way that makes it so interesting for people to understand and you know how to break that down so like you know you you help me with some of my so my you know one of my you know pieces on that so that's that's power well thank you i appreciate you coming on this is badass listen i appreciate you guys having me on [Music] you

Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) shares what he did to grow his Twitter account by more than 200,000 followers in less than a year.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
i sold my startup for less than what my investors had put in now you know the way it worked you know the team still did well and i made good money off of it but like that's not that's the that's not the definition of a successful business because there's a lot of people that have sold their companies for a lot of money we have a we have a handful of buddies that are like uber rich no one [ __ ] knows who they are and like even if they told you that what they did you'd have to like they'd have to beg to speak at a conference whereas guys like you you've got like the daily show reaching out to you you've got celebrities reaching out to you who want to like get on board with you and what i want to know is you can use the example and then you how does someone i guess i'm asking for myself because how do you create so much of this like brand equity uh like you guys have well i think in both cases it's basically you put out you put your thoughts on blast so you know they're the re the real answer and by the way i say that not to make fun of the app i think did sell for a profit so good good for them i'm saying i know that i've gotten disproportionate credit for my track record of success when in reality like the best thing i've built is this d2c company that i don't tell anybody the name of that's the profitable business that's doing eight figures a year but like that's not actually why people my reputation came before that so you know that's kind of weird right so where does the reputation actually come from it comes from two things one is you meet people in real life so like you go meet you know the investors at these different big funds or uh ceos of different companies and when they're talking to you they're making an independent assessment of your lo your caliber you're based on your thoughts so right so so first it's like a hand-to-hand combat thing you meet a bunch of people you earn their respect one-on-one by by you know when they're talking about some deal they're doing or a company they're building you you actually contribute by adding value by pointing out things or or giving them criticism or or giving them feedback on what's really great um or identifying to them other things that are really cool and they say wow this guy really you know i i got a lot out of this conversation so you do that with like 300 people and those people matter right because they have themselves influence and trust so for example um you know uh like josh element is a is a good example this guy was he was early on at linkedin at facebook at twitter at robin hood uh like earlier sean meaning he was he was like head of growth at a bunch of these companies yeah yeah he's a big deal he's been on our podcast and so he's got you know tremendous people have a tremendous amount of respect for him because he's had a tremendous career well both and i have you know on separate occasions met you know met with josh and we when we're talking about our startup and whether our startup succeeded or failed josh knows look you're playing in the sort of like the startup lottery startup olympics a startup can fail and an entrepreneur can still be really great and if out of that conversation josh josh walks away thinking oh this person's really smart and then they connect you to some other people that they they know and those people say wow josh thanks for the intro sean was really great you develop a reputation amongst people who have a reputation so that's the first step through real-life interactions you develop a reputation with people who already have a reputation so that they will retweet your stuff so that they will vouch for you when you have a project or you're doing something and that that goes a long way in the marketplace uh so like for example i've had josh or biology or different people who have their own big following and their own respect if they share me or they they they say this person's great then a whole bunch of other people just inherit that reputation they say okay if josh says he's great he's great if biology says he's great such a unique way of it's almost like credibility hacking or something like that but but that's the thing i think is important is like i'm telling you how the mechanic works but there's the thing you can't just the reason it's not a hack is because your your thoughts actually have to be interesting you have to actually hack like you're you're a hack i just mean like you're you're getting the desired the the process of getting to the desired outcome right the second thing is we both created content so now his tweets are mostly making fun of people who create content and threads and teach courses but before that he was doing it himself right he was he himself was saying you know when you're building a social app blah blah or here's how we grew inside high schools for tbh and i why did i respect him because he released this this memo actually got leaked from inside facebook oh yeah yeah yeah and the memo basically said he was like hey guys at facebook here's some of the stuff we did to grow amongst teenagers and i know facebook wants to grow amongst teens here's some stuff we did at tbh for example for every high school we would create an instagram account for it branded to the high schools it'd be like you know mckinley high you know secrets and that's the instagram account and it would be locked and we would follow anybody who had mckinley high in their profile then they would follow it you know 40 of people would follow us back they would request to follow but we were private we wouldn't approve anybody's request then at 4pm when everybody got out of school one day we would accept all the requests so everybody simultaneously would get a notification about our account so they would all go check it out and then they would all see the link to download the app and then they would download the app and then we and then as they're downloading the app they'd get notifications that their friends are all downloading the app today and it felt like a big deal and that's how we hacked distribution into high schools i similarly have told actually a very similar story about how we would go get our goal was always to get half of a high school to download our app in one day we did it a completely different way but i've shared that on podcasts different places or on twitter threads and people read that and they're like oh [ __ ] this guy's smart that's a really smart growth tactic this guy really understands growth this guy really understands teens this guy really understands social and if so if you just if i like it's that uh quote my buddy jason hitchcock told me once he goes you say one interesting thing i say huh that's interesting you say two interesting things like oh those are interesting you say three interesting things i say [ __ ] this guy's interesting and uh that's really what you gotta do with content is you have to if you say three original interesting things around one topic whether it's bitcoin or media or robotics or whatever if i get three interesting things from you i'll in my brain i will assign that tag to you this guy's interesting worth watching and then if other people endorse it and say this is interesting it goes even faster [Music] you

i think you should go hard on this i so you have a hundred thousand listeners a month you're making single-digit thousands of dollars you would make like six figures a year for sure doing this [Music] um all right good so sean what's good what's going on what's up what's up you got ben still on the line what do you what do you got for ben normally you're like so heat turn off your video we need to focus i'm going to tell you why so ben made a comment to me maybe to you too i think you were here like a while ago a month or two months ago and i've been thinking a lot about it and he kind of made it not a big deal but it's kind of a big deal to me so uh ben i'm not i'm not gonna i'm i'm gonna only i haven't told you i'm gonna bring up this bring this up i'm only gonna like kind of mention the thing and then you could you could kind of explain how you want to but basically ben wilson has this podcast called how to take over the world and you said that a very wealthy person like a hundreds of millions of dollars person has you on retainer and basically tells you the strategy that this person's going to do in business and you tell him stories from history to let him know what you predict will happen is that right what yes yes he made is that crazy he didn't explain it that way but that's exactly what happened it's like a sugar daddy but it's like a history daddy like a history baby i guess sugar baby okay that's true did i get that act did i explain that yeah so here's the full story i get a lot of people who reach out to me at this point basically any fan who's like hey can i talk to you for a little bit i'm just like yeah i'm not that big yet if you're big enough that you want to if you i think i'm important enough that you wanna talk to me yeah i'll talk to you that's starting to change a little bit a lot of people want my time now but this was a while ago um and so i said yes i'll talk to you he's like i'm thinking of starting something out to talk to you about it i was like okay this guy's probably a joker but whatever he reached out to me i'll talk to him so we hop on a zoom and first thing like he's got a glass wall behind him and you can tell he's in like a very very very high high rise in new york city you can see the whole skyline behind him so immediately i was like this is not what i thought it was going to be and uh so he was like yeah i'm a managing director at xyz bank one of the biggest banks in the world um and i lead their x division very very big uh financial division at this big bank and he's like i just randomly found your podcast and you don't know this but i've been listening to you you're my guru now so i want to talk to you about like what i'm thinking of starting and i just want to bounce it off you and see um what you think about it and so he gets to call me whenever he wants to and that sounds more normal sam was saying he specifically wants you to tell him based on history here's what's going to happen is that that's when that's what you you met you go you said you said that yeah like i said i explain it differently but that's what's going on here like he likes you and he wants you to like tell him like how would julius caesar handle this or how did julius caesar handle this tell me like what what to do that's that's basically the angle he's going for yeah because he knows me from how to take over the world so yeah oh my god that is amazing isn't that awesome well first of all hopefully me laughing about it doesn't blow this for you uh but but wow okay but listen i want to ask you more questions about this man but i had the same reaction sean i was like what that sounds like a scam but i've been thinking a lot about this and i actually think that's a great idea i think that that is a wonderful idea what do they say history may not repeat itself but it definitely rhymes if you're gonna tell people what behaviors to avoid or like how other people have had the same move and what happened i think that's great how much is he paying you zero what i think he's paying you i thought you were like a retainer no no no no he's paying me so he so he offered to pay me and i so much of the offer how much did he offer um well he didn't offer explicitly but he's he said he said people he said people who do what you do who who consult people like me often make upwards of five thousand dollars an hour uh i don't think you would pay me because i've never done it before i'm not like a high level coach but i was like well that's a pay range i was not considering i must admit um but he said i will pay you but then uh i ended up telling him no don't worry about it and uh i just think it's better to have the connection and have him think that he owes me at this point okay that's fine i but i actually think that there's like is something interesting here like because like alex friedman or like these like thinker type folks like they definitely could get paid 5 or 10 grand an hour yeah but this to me is more like when you the way you described it it's more like you know in billions or whatever it's like the guy's got a kink and he goes to like get dominated by some shaking a mask with a whip uh to me it's more like that where it's like some rich guy is just like hey uh i need you to when i call you i need you to tell me that i'm i'm a huge fuck-up and i suck and that's gonna motivate me to go into this meeting and prove myself daily and i will pay you two thousand dollars an hour if you are a hot woman who tells me uh you know i suck and you spit on the webcam to me that's that's more where the opportunity is than like telling me about lessons from history no this is good because it's like let's say that um he's like i'm working on this thing my opinion of it is this this and this and he and ben goes well you know rothschild he actually the reason why they did really well because they just got information just a little bit faster and they did this this and this business is so context dependent it's not like you actually need the strategies of the roth house or julius caesar i don't think i think it's motivational to hear these stories right like i i use one story why does it matter if it's motivational or if it's like strategically well that's actually accurate because you got to know what am i delivering right what am i actually selling this person am i selling them strategies from the 19 you know 1830s or am i selling them that hey you know for example ben i use this anecdote you have from from how to take over the world where you talked about um you know edison used to go edison used to be like he was amazing he was like had done so much by the age of 25 and he's like um you know but nikola tesla had already done xyz by this age i'm so behind and even though he was the greatest inventor of our age he personally felt behind because he was comparing himself to someone and then he read that julius caesar used to go look at a statue of alexander the great and be like what the [ __ ] am i doing with my life alexander the great already ruled you know the world by now and to me that lesson was like you know that was actually a pretty important lesson a lot of people feel like they're behind or feel like they they compare themselves to others who are doing better it's like dude there's no end to that julius caesar used to do that and feel that way so you know that's a trap you know that there is no amount where you'll stop feeling that way so might as well just let it all go but that's kind of the same thing you're just talking about life strategy i mean it's kind of yeah i agree with you i'll tell you how it actually went because because what you said sean actually plays into it that he said i'm thinking about starting this thing it's a higher possible outcome but if i stay where i am right now it's just a more steady like i can go from whatever i can go from 220 to 500 hopefully in the next 10 years um but i'm not gonna become a uh billionaire essentially um but if i go start my own thing i could lose a lot of money what does 220 mean 220 million oh that's what he's worth no i'm i am saying number i'm not going to tell you what he's worth but he's but it is in the hundreds of millions sounded pretty specific to me all right sounded like not a made-up number all right and so and so he was essentially like should i do this thing so i tell him i i talk about the i talked about the concept of exactly what you're saying of like so much pressure on you to say something that's not [ __ ] stupid 100 i was literally as he was saying this i was like why the hell are you talking to me like it was so funny to me but he loved the podcast he thought i'd have something interesting to say so i was like literally just grasping in my head i'm panicking a little bit i'm like what am i gonna say to this guy and so i start talking before i even know what i'm gonna say i said uh okay well have you heard of loss aversion and i brought up the idea of loss of version which i'm sure you heard of that he hadn't heard a lost version so i explained to him a little bit what loss of version was explain it for somebody who's listening who doesn't want to go so a loss aversion is the idea that um that you value not losing your money more than you value gaining money so you put more emphasis on it so i essentially said you need to make loss aversion work for you essentially if you believe that you're going to be successful then um you need to visualize that success and say to yourself and realize every day that you delay starting your your new thing is going to make you billions you're losing millions of dollars because you're you're failing to act and uh he was like that was amazing that's changed my whole perspective he was he was blown away i think that you're doing something that's like so common which is and i do it too you uh sean does not do this you uh you you are putting too low value you're playing yeah you're not really how it ends though let me tell you how it ends so um it was like a month later i was in new york city so i said let's meet up let's get lunch we went to a really nice restaurant and he bought me lunch which was very nice and i was like so when are you starting the thing and he's like well i'm not actually doing it and he like gave his reasons why he's not he's not starting it yet and i was like okay well it sounded good when it came out of my mouth but apparently my advice was not that valuable your spit is watered drink it exactly that's when you need to go dominatrix dude it's a yin and yang good cop bad cop sort of thing i think by the way i think that version thing i think the numbers are two to one meaning you you'd have to make two dollars for to feel the same as losing one you'd have to make two thousand to feel the same level of emotional hit as as losing 1000 would be i don't know if that's [ __ ] but i've read that that's the ratio of like how much we value lost more than gain sean do you get asked to consult and like do this type of stuff i get asked i'd never consult anymore but uh i basically run a simple filter which is would i do this for free that doesn't mean i'm gonna do it for free it's would i do this for free so for ben and ben's case ben's like oh this sounds like a super interesting guy he did do it forever i'm gonna learn as much from this guys he's gonna learn from me if not more so you know i'm happy to to do my do this with my time so that that's one thing and then the second part is dude you get paid crazy money for doing this type of [ __ ] like uh sam you do these glg calls have you done any of these i i i used to i think i was getting paid a thousand dollars an hour yeah exactly i set my rate at the max that they let up let me do which is now two thousand thousand two thousand that's what it was and um and dude i'll get paid two thousand bucks to just do like a forty minute call with some re like first of all it's kind of funny because they're like it is this like weird underground dominatrix [ __ ] where it's like i'm a hedgehog manager i can't tell you the fun i can't tell you what i'm looking at i can't tell you my name but like it's like a once it's a one-way transaction it's like i'm the masseuse and they're laying face down i can't see who they are and um and then they're like okay say the word metaverse and i'm like metaverse tell me tell me who's gonna who who's which stock's gonna go up because of the metaverse i'm like dude i don't [ __ ] know and they're like what and i'm like yeah but i could tell you you know here's some things i i think well well whenever i do those things i talk really slow yeah because you just need an hour to pass yeah you i always talk really slow and i'll be like wait hang on let me get my headphones the better way i can't talk slow it's like i'm too nervous like like i said with ben you feel a tremendous amount of pressure it doesn't really matter how much money you have when somebody's paying you something i would never pay someone two grand for a phone call even though i'm sure there's an economic case where it makes sense it's just a big number to me to just pay for somebody to talk to me uh i'm so i'm so i'm so not used to it that when i'm on the other side i'm getting paid i'm like i need to deliver this guy like some insane insight that they've and i put this weird pressure that just is unachievable but i'll be like i'll say my point and i really only have one point and i'll be like another way of thinking about it is that i'll repackage the same idea with like some metaphor or some analogy just to fill air space because like like in reality it's one idea that that's worth it for them or not and i don't have like 10 amazing ideas i have one around one topic you know i don't have but there's there's a there's that's why ben shtick is amazing because sean well you can only consult on your life experience and you like you can't live that interesting of a life all the time and whereas ben can just steal he could just read a book a week and he's going to have like you know 52 new ideas a year the thing that this guy was trying to sell me on was that i should come up and speak to his bank um and he's like you could get paid like easy like 50 grand a pop to come up and give sure that's the point and i do 10 grand for a zoom at home to give a speech to somebody now um and how many of those and now i'm like why am i not doubling my price like uh if they're not saying yes i need to basically the pricing strategy is if unless half the people are saying no you're priced way too low and so right now everybody's saying yes why not price double that i i did one recently it was 25 000 but it was in person yeah yeah how many of those zooms how many zooms a month do you do not even one a month one every two months probably is the the current that's pretty sick to me though yeah oh it's great it's i mean it's like it's great money because there's this other thing ben i don't know what the what the history or psychology will tell us about this but there's extra joy in making money when you can assign what that money gets to go to versus just generally making money and it's going to go into a general pot of a bank account versus like oh 10 grand all right if i'm like i do these two speeches this week this month i'll go buy that car or i'll go get my wife this gift and she's like wow that's great that hey this this work you did was awesome and uh i don't know what the name for that metaphor is but i abused the [ __ ] out of that consumerism just consumerism so you guys can tell me if there's ever a moment like the reason i'm not doing any of this stuff is i just feel fraudulent like going up there and that's normal but yeah maybe i just need to get over it i don't know 100 you need to get over it uh like the way you should think about things is most of your life you're basically underpaid um you're you're underpaid and underappreciated and um you know the universe has this way of evening itself out where like um you know sam will make more money off of like some random investment he thought about for five minutes uh than he would of you know grinding some business that he his apartment finder business he did for two years or three years and so like you know the inputs don't always match the outputs in life and once you sort of acknowledge that you accept that that's like the first thing you have to acknowledge which is like the level of difficulty for me is not what dictates the value for somebody else so that's number one yeah the the the effort is not in proportion to the output it's irrelevant all that matters is the output the fact that you know input is a liability for you uh it is a weird psychological liability you would be better off not knowing how hard it was to say that one thing to that guy at that moment the second thing is that you know mr market will decide what it's worth and like you might be you might get lucky once you might get lucky twice but if people consistently pay you for something it's because that's what it's worth to them if not it's worth not being worth more right they need they need a positive roi on that on that interaction and so just let the market decide and the market over time will balance itself out maybe maybe one one off yeah that was just a fluke but if it happens consistently enough and you should just expect it to happen consistently then it works i i i think you should lean into this hardcore because how much money are you making on ads for your pi say the numbers can you say the number do you want to do it or no um yeah i guess i have one sponsor right now it's full punch punch shout out club lunch go to the culture sam is the one carrying that sponsorship use code ben wilson for i don't remember how much off 150 off something like that um so i will say i'm making uh four four digits per month low four digits okay so one to five thousand a month um by the way also the hack when somebody says how many digits just take the bottom three numbers of that range so if i say i make seven figures i'm saying one to three million if sans we sold for eight figures it's ten to thirty million if somebody say hey right like nobody if you're over half you're you usually say it differently once you're once you cross the uh if you cross over 50 million you would say over 50 million not eight figures or like the figures can include the uh dot zero zero yeah there you go that's a figure nine figure exit bro um so i think you should go and do this ben i think that you should include i think you should go hard on this so you have a 100 000 listeners a month you're making single digit thousands of dollars you would make like six figures a year for sure do your own ad read which basically says look yes you listen to this and i you know people who listen to this tell me they got a bunch of inspiration they got uh you know some strategies they got um they you know they filled in the gaps of something they didn't know about history and they can see you know their place in the world today through that whatever blah blah blah some [ __ ] and you basically say uh you know i used to run ads for you know cold plunges by the way use code ben wilson at checkout if you if you want uh but you know actually what ended up happening and you just basically say this is what this is what ended up happening companies started hiring me to come in and talk to them about lessons from the greatest you know the greatest blah blah in history and um it's motivational for the executive team it's a great addition to any off-site blah blah blah and so that actually ends up making me more money than the ads so if that if you're interested in that you should contact me blah blah i bet if you do that you'll get one of these a month and it will quadruple your current ad um you know ad revenue for the month dude you got to do this man you've got to do this okay next next month uh we'll do another segment in uh ben's first million and uh and look you can make it as simple so my best friend neville medora he has the things that he calls consults and if you go to his blog like copywriting course.com like consult there's just like a checkout page and it's a thousand dollars and you booked one hour with them and you just you pay and then you just like select on calendly and then every like tuesday and thursday from like 9am to like one he just knows that he does that's his call time and uh he makes a lot of money from it a year you could do it as simple as that the other thing by the way you need to do like a profile of how to check for the world of like uh i think you know you've done jobs but i think if you do like pixar uh right and you say you know here's pixar's kind of creativity uh process how pixar consistently has creative hits and um you know storytelling or something like that that opens the door for you to basically teach the pixar way to a bunch of companies that want to be better creative you know more creative or storytellers or whatever and replace pixar with any company that's excellence in x category and you just tell your story as you always do and then that becomes part of your slightly more corporate repertoire that you know maybe they don't want to hear the putin putin story but they they want to hear the pixar one yeah so you select the people by who will listen to this and then pay me money to consult or work backwards from that yeah i'm gonna go to apple and give them the the putin speech and then all of a sudden google employees start mysteriously dying i think i think this is good i think that so right now you're uh you're you're slumming it because you've got a small business that you're just starting and it's gonna take time to get going we this will just supercharged it a little bit i think and by the way i always whenever i give advice the way i explain to people is i'm gonna say some things that make you feel uncomfortable either because you personally would feel nervous saying the thing i just said to a customer or quoting a pr quoting that price to a customer the second reason is your moral code says well that's not what i want to do with my content i don't want to feature pixar because i want to give talks about pic you know creativity and storytelling okay cool i'm just telling you if you crank the commercialization like sellout knob to 12. here's what you could do and then you could decide to dial that back to nine uh or eight whatever you feel comfortable with and uh i always say it differently i say do you want your future kids to have braces or not like you ever been to an orthodontist my friend it's expensive get to work oh that's amazing that's too good all right let's do some other topics thank you ben i appreciate the uh good luck i do appreciate the advice i really do thanks guys that's amazing right that that i was thinking about that for like about a week that's hilarious i had no idea that was going on uh all right he mentioned it to us but he didn't make a big deal out of it what do you want to talk about what do you want to talk okay um i know what i want to talk about well i don't know if this is interesting to you but i've noticed that your angel investing is on a tear our friend suli just said whatever sean what did he what did he say whatever sean joke he was like oh i got this new brilliant investment strategy uh sean invests in something and then he tells me about it two weeks to two months later and then i paid 10x price for the same item for the same company it was great which is and he's like anecdote he was joking obviously obviously that's not great he's like making fun of himself because that's literally what's happened in like i think six or eight deals now where i'll i'll even tell him about it but he just delays responding for a couple weeks or i forget to tell him and i tell him or he tells me about the company a few months later i'm like oh yeah i invested in that he's like awesome can you make an intro and i make the intro and but the price has gone up like dramatically because the company has more traction or more whatever so that's what he was joking about so i we i put you on like an email list for my friends where i'm sending you everything are you getting those no i didn't see anything i sent you two of them so far okay maybe i need to i'll afford it to them one of them i'll send you after this but anyway so i'm i'm starting i'm i'm starting it off where i'm sending them to you so you gotta uh hopefully if you find something that interests me you'll send back but how are you getting such good [ __ ] um i don't know like dude it's amazing so i feel like there's i think the easy answer is oh cool i do this podcast and because of this podcast people come inbound right the bigger this podcast gets the more people uh want you to invest and there's this great um thing my buddy vishal taught me when she goes startups are the only asset class like real estate doesn't work this way stock market like in real estate if you want to buy it you go buy it if you want stock if you want to buy it you go buy it startups are the only thing where even if you want in you don't just get in the security selects you the asset selects you just as much as you're selecting the asset and that one insight is pretty important it basically means you need to build your brand and your like reputation so that people want you in deals um because the best deals are all like kind of like super competitive to get into um and you want people to when they're first thinking of an idea to reach out to you because they know oh you know like for example i did a great deal recently and it's so funny you're gonna hate this it's gonna piss you off so much you've been talking about short-term rentals somebody came to me with a short-term rental startup idea because they thought i was you or something or somebody was like hey bro why didn't you send that to me by the way the subject line that she reached out with was last one in it was like hey i have the smallest bit of allocation left in this motherboard this is a company called hostfully you'll love it because it's it's literally exactly what you're doing you should get it i'll enter you you will get in uh but but basically what they're doing is you if you own a bunch of airbnbs which is kind of like a new market uh it's basically like you're a property manager so you're more than just renting out your home or one home so you have multiple properties but you're not a traditional property manager who owns a multi-family you know like uh building of like 32 units and so this is for people who run multiple airbnbs and it's just like it makes your life way easier as the as the owner of that and they have like few million dollars in recurring revenue the valuation was great founder was really impressive so i was like oh yeah great sas software for people who manage multiple vacation rentals and then you're over here building short sam short-term rental club building this community doing this thing and i got the benefit because people thought i was you that's that's one answer the piss you off answer that's ridiculous that is a piss me off answer whatever it is what it is send me what i'll send you what's the company called can we talk about it yeah hostfully host fully well then i can just email her it's is it uh do they have a bunch of uh uh vcs behind it or all angels um i think this rounds a lot of individuals i'm not sure it was like i was kind of late to the party so i was just pretty quick to just be like okay this makes a lot of sense uh you know the once once you have revenue and a few million dollars that's recurring and they really haven't even like figured out what their marketing strategy is going to be yet it's like okay that's a pretty good signal that this is going to work and uh it's a pretty indispensable tool for a property owner so i like that one but i would say okay here's here's some of the things that have happened one is when i share deals with you you share deals with me my buddy julian shapiro shares like some of the best deals um he's just very active he's very like consistent with it meaning like every week he's sending me some good [ __ ] um that's i would say 40 to 50 of the portfolio is relationships with friends who themselves are experts and specifically people who are experts in one niche so it's like we've been doing a bunch of like sales person software and it's because we like have a relationship with craft ventures who it started by david sacks he's kind of like the enterprise sas guy he built yammer sold it for a billion dollars his fund specifically just focuses on sas companies and what so david sends you stuff dave not me particularly so my partner romine uh who runs my fund he basically has a good relationship somebody at graph so for example when they're seeing something good they're just trading notes all the time and so we're getting to get in on a lot of their deals so if are they giving you the deal because they like shawn or they like romaine in this case it's romaine because uh he has that relationship he's catching up with that guy every two weeks goes get coffee or whatever it is and but then i do the same with my guys right so i do the same with the people in india or the people in southeast asia because i'm like i think that's where a lot of opportunity is and that's where i have the right relationships so we're sharing stuff uh just amongst that so and then the other thing is like themes so for example once i decide that a theme is correct uh like worth worth betting on what i learned from suli actually is the level of aggression you need to have once you decide x is a good idea you need to go invest in that company and then like the five other companies that are like adjacent to it so for example um there's this trend of banking like neo banks right yeah so this started several years ago where people basically were like look banks are something everybody uses but has super low customer satisfaction scores like their apps sucked uh their marketing sucked so basically people are like look we can create like a digital first bank and this started like new bank is is probably the best example of this it's in brazil they're like oh look yeah and they're about to go people are under bank there so they started a new bank a friend of a friend of mine uh was like led their investment and now it's a 10 billion dollar company and it has like millions of customers in brazil and then the same thing happened in the uk with revolut and monzo whatever so this idea of neo banking basically of can you make super slick cus like slick app for customers digitally market to go get customers and basically you're building um you're actually not building the banking part you usually go partner with like some bank like bbva or something like that under the hood it's bbva but the customer relationship is with uh with a company that's really good at taking care of customers and building good user experiences anyway so that's the the short answer is like okay decide that that's a good idea um and that takes many forms so like we talked about this before like ramp or brex these are like brexit i think was the fastest growing yc company in the last few years and you look at it you say is this a good idea you say well what are they actually doing they're basically giving credit cards to some group of people that were dissatisfied with current credit card providers brex did it for startups and they get a portion of every time that card swipes oh interesting so if a million people are spending a thousand dollars a year on it and they're keeping 1.3 of the interchange fee of the debit card or whatever you can come up with some number you say wow this company's going to get big pretty fast so we did that math of neo banks how much is the neo bank customer worth and how much is a credit card customer worth and then we went and did it in every niche we could think of so we we invested in keep which is doing this for canada and then we invested in uh pluto which is doing this in the middle east but but did you holler at them yeah then we go search and destroy basically it's like how do you go hunt for the best companies that are doing this in either this geography or with this customer base so for example and you just dm them on twitter probably yeah exactly we just reach out cold dm and say hey i'm a believer in this for this system this reason what you're doing looks super interesting would love to invest and sometimes it comes inbound sometimes it's oh you got 100 things inbound but you know what you're looking for so you quickly pounce on the four that fit your your thing aren't you out of money at this point from the fun though i raised more money because i was like i was like before i thought dude uh you know will i get a million dollars worth of deals every quarter that are good deals i'm not just trying to invest in crap so i need to invest in good deals so i i was like i don't know how many high quality deals i'll have and now um i realized that like whatever i whatever i had before was too low so now we're doing almost two million a quarter uh we raised more money because we just had better deals man i because i'm starting so i started angel investing almost one year ago well i i did it five or eight companies person the last before that i forget and a couple of them have turned out to be like meaningful like turning 20 grand into like 300 400 500 000 and i'm like holy [ __ ] this is how it works and like but like it it sucks for a while right because you just invest it you're like well that's money's gone and you don't ever hear bottom and then you're like oh nice it works and so i'm like in some of those cases those are huge markups in other cases i'm just now experiencing like two and three and four x markups and i'm like that's awesome what would happen if that was had i invested in this company at a 10 million valuation instead of a 50 million dollar evaluation that would have been wild and like how do i do that well one of the reasons so i hated startup investing for for a while because i was like you know is this the best use of time and money dude it feels like an expensive hobby i'm just spending money and not getting anything in return and then i then i realized two things which is bezos has this quote which i believe he goes one of the biggest competitive advantages you can have is being long-term oriented basically if you prioritize like if you have a 10-year view where you're like okay i'm going to maximize what i can do in 10 years and the other guy is trying to make the most they can make you know for their quarterly earnings call right this is how amazon worked right amazon was basically like we're willing to lose money to invest so that we provide two-day shipping instead of seven-day shipping or free two-day shipping or a larger selection but it's gonna cost us more because we're gonna have more inventory or whatever so we're going to go into all these other verticals books cds whatever they basically said like his strategy was long term this is going to be the most valuable strategy short term we're going to get punished by the market because our quarterly earnings are not going to look great but that turned out to be the like magic you know the sort of like the biggest competitive advantage amazon had was their ability to be long-term oriented i think this is true just in general which is if you're competing in somebody who they need a result in one year and you're willing to be patient and get the result in five years seven years or ten years you can make bets that they can't make so that means you get to have lower price bets um that will pay off bigger just over a longer time horizon so i think if you have the luxury of a long-term present that's a competitive advantage that's how startup investing works is if you need money or you you need to see positive growth in one year startup investing sucks if you're willing to play a 10-year game this can be an awesome game to play and so do you think that well but do you think you you told me you're like man i think i could three and a half x my fun because that's average now it seems like it's gonna be significantly more yeah like you know you think about kind of like what's the floor uh you know i think a three and a half x would be you know a a solid outcome but you know nothing to write home about um but like with a small fund like ours you could see things where you can get a 15x you can get a 20x there are literally crypto small funds like ours that have had 100x they 100x the fund in in the period of time right so so you know you shouldn't really the ceiling is high um but but the floor is is pretty reasonable so the first thing was okay long term oriented is a competitive advantage i i like start professing for that reason the second one is you want to do things that compound so for example if i wanted to beat the market in the stock market right i want to beat the s p 500 i need to have proprietary like intelligent i need to be smarter than anybody else about something and i think just being smarter at a game where money's on the line is just really hard to do whereas if you do um if you basically say hey my advantage comes from my reputation or my my network of people that i know that's just gonna compound every year the more deals i share with you the more deals you're gonna share with me the more companies i have that are winners that's gonna make it easier for me to get into the next winner or for founders to come reach out to me because they'll say oh i saw you did these five indian unicorns i'm an india i want to be the next one of them so you should inve can you invest in me so compounding also comes into play here in a way that doesn't happen in the stock market and doesn't even really happen in real estate real estate has it to an extent but but not in the same way as how fast your reputation can compound and start investing so anyways those are my two reasons why i now actually view startup startup investing as a as a game worth playing because it it uses two of the superpowers that uh that i believe in that i think most people undervalue is it gonna what do you think we'll earn more the ecom thing or this angel investing thing uh probably for me personally the ecom thing because i just own the majority of that company so you know if it sells for fifty million dollars or a hundred million dollars you know i'll own the majority of it but uh whereas with startup investing you know it's like my fund invests a hundred thousand dollars we own point eight percent of this startup i personally have twenty percent of the carry but then i share with romaine and ben and zach so i personally own 14 point something percent of the carry or whatever sure you know so it's not like you know you're owning a slice of a slice of something big versus just owning them you know how it is owning the majority of something that sells for a decent chunk is is just better financially it's so much better and yeah i think that whenever people raise money i'm like are you sure man you might be able to sell this for 50 million dollars and you'll make more money than if you raise money and sell for 500. yeah exactly now you know but i have to operate that other business whereas startup investing is like you know a joy right you just read about cool ideas you meet meet awesome founders and you say yes you write the check and then they go do the hard work so it's a you know just a different thing can i you brought up uh sdr's short term that's what i they're called short-term rental sers have you researched that at all so i joined your club but uh [ __ ] crazy right did you do two things did you used to review it yeah i was i'm i've been looking at some of these posts dude did you see like it's like techy guys it's like people who have like 100 million dollar company by the way i don't know how you founder of facebook but like every time i open facebook whatever you're working on is always the top [ __ ] post on my feed i don't know if facebook just knows that i love you but like if it was true at the top if it's sam talking about his cold plunge it's sam's video of his cold plunge naked at the top like you know the what hits in the facebook algorithm in a way that like i don't understand i've always been like that it's always been that way for some reason i mastered facebook and that sucks because it's the least valuable uh i figured out what you're talking about wow because i can only have five thousand friends on facebook yeah doesn't matter your groups are big okay so but tell me what that group is sick right how many people are saying a thousand thousand people in this group and people are basically posting hey guys here's the properties i own and they show a bunch of cool photos my strat like for example my family owned five big short-term rentals in kissimmee florida which is five miles from disney world so his strategy is basically airbnb near disney world i have a full-time job i'm a phd student blah blah and um and uh and then they're showing like these uh disney themed rentals that they have and people go ask questions at the comments and then everybody's got this like you know you're doing your your magic thing where everybody feels comfortable telling you how much money they're making and uh everyone's sharing a bunch of good info so so i think that's really cool what i wanted to hear from you is give me the top two most interesting stories that you've learned i'm gonna tell you i uh i've gotta be a little subliminal about this um so in that group there's 11 or 100 or a thousand people i met one person that's got 35 million dollars in homes he owns about 20 of them and he's currently making about a million close to a million dollars a month in profit and was this person wealthy before this how do you get to the 35 million dollars worth of real estate they were mildly wealthy they were worth probably 15 million dollars they had a business that they sold yes they were not poor and they invested a lot of it into into into short-term rentals and now they have a staff of a couple people who are full-time and his take is like 800 grand a month and i met another guy who worked at a hedge fund and his name's richard if you google richard he'll tell he has a story in there and he eventually quit his hedge fund now he owns 50 million dollars worth of short-term rental rentals and the themes that i'm seeing are this one institutional capital has not come into short-term rentals a significant amount two the numbers might be inflated because the economy is crushing but i'm not entirely sure if that is totally the case but definitely could be the case three a couple years ago it was people were just buying places without doing much math and the math like worked out when you they're making 25 returns it's crazy now it's a little bit more challenging but it's still a lot of opportunity and uh it's sick man like i i've been learning all about it it's wild so of all the things you've read in here what uh what what seemed like the smartest what i'll call small ball strategy so throw out the guy who's had 15 million bucks and now he's built this big thing who's done a small ball start small grow grow it and maybe in some niche that's a cool cool story out of this or you don't say who but what is the what do they do is a million dollars considered small so if you buy property for a million dollars you're going to put down 150 grand for some of these guys there's a guy in there yeah if you go are you in the group right now search the word coconut there's a guy who bought a plot of land on a it was a coconut farm in mexico and he put four i think tiny homes and he rents them for 150 a day uh in mexico and he did really nice landscaping but not complicated stuff it looks beautiful do you see it is it uh something farms yeah can i say the name or no safa farms yeah yeah yeah safa farms so click it so six cabbages created this like so so it says a tiny eco hotel farm six cabins one house an in-ground fire pit at a pool in mexico and uh it looks cool it's basically like a bunch of wooden cabins that look like really small you know one-person two-person kind of stays and then like really cool outdoor area with hammocks and pools and uh you know common areas and places to go do yoga with like chickens running around you is that wild and he talked about it in the post i don't think he spent a significant amount of money to set that up but he just it's minimalist ish it's kind of nice but it's definitely minimalist but it's it's lovely and so that's a really cool thing i've seen a guy like that like that is really interesting and what they do is they go and stay there a couple weeks out of the year dude how cool is airbnb that it created this opportunity for anybody to say hey look if you can create an awesome experience for people like a great a great place to stay a unique way a place to stay we will give you money you will be able to make money just by creating this cool little farm and huts set up in uh villa corona mexico and uh how sick is that and then on the other side it's like hey you want to travel here's the here's the the buffet of like dope experiences that's not just cookie cutter hotel that you can go stay at like how sick is airbnb that's just it's in respect it's amazing it's amazing and what i'm learning is so basically the order of importance is when you're looking for it's just like content it's just like scrolling through youtube and so if you look at it through that lens you can make a lot of money for example when you're buying a property you go on zillow and you look at their thumbnail pictures you're like what catches my eye and then if you don't see anything there you're like all right that nothing here but like oh they took a bad picture here but if they changed the angle here and they made the light at sunset this will look beautiful and so you're basically shopping for thumbnails and uh and then the second thing that you're wanting to do is you're not shopping in any place in which you have to create demand and so you use air dna and it shows you who has the highest book and booking rate and then um the third thing you do is you pick a very specific niche and you have one unique thing about the property for example you call it a zen a zen thing because you've got like a little pond on the front or what i'm gonna do is you call it like has a fancy gym or has a putt-putt course or has uh like one unique thing right right like deck with view of sunset and so you want that one unique thing and that's the same thing that's the same way how content because it lets you reimagine okay if this home was not for a family of four to live every day and go to go to the grocery store and come home well then maybe this little space instead of a you know a living room that's about you know just two couches and a tv it's like maybe this is actually where companies are gonna come for their retreats and it's actually gonna be different groups of 25 at a time and they need a big sauna in one area and then they need a pool area and a barbecue pit that's like i will over invest on these things and i will i don't need to have these daily utility functional things that a normal house would need right and it's just been so fascinating because i didn't realize how many like tech nerds are into this stuff that group is so cool it's so interesting and uh anyway we don't we can move on but i thought i thought that was i thought it's just an interesting world that i'm falling into so like you know rohan from pricinomics he basically he didn't tell me this but it appears as though price economics is on the back the back burner and all of his time is on short-term rentals and he owns like seven of them um it's it's badass man it's a super interesting market yeah i just want to give money to this group and just be like hey uh you know anybody who wants to like trick out their their place and you know whatever or buy their next property hey i'll just finance it with you and share cash flow if you want to you know how you can have some preferred return that's fine so that is the thing that's interesting to me there's no such thing or there aren't many funds so like you and i have invested i think you did as well in like a blackrock like investment fund that like buys like 500 walgreens and they just make five percent there should be one of those for short-term rentals just because if you believe in that category you can have a reit or skin in the game somehow that's passive right yeah that's wild um okay let's do let's do one other thing uh uh let's see i got a couple let me give you um let's do let's do two quick ones okay um tailgate guys have you ever heard of this business so this this came up at farm con so i go to this dinner with this guy he listens to the pod and he was telling me i was like you know uh i was trying to make small talk at this dinner where i was like okay i hate normal small talk like i'm not just gonna oh yeah how's the conference going good yeah good how about you good good um and i also don't know anything about farming so like it's not relevant to me so you know okay i can ask them a bunch of questions you like corn too yeah exactly you know i don't have much to add so what's your favorite type of corn so i was a bit of an ice breaker i was like um i was like first job like what was your first first job first first first i don't know i asked did you have a side hustle in college and i went around the table i was like did you have a side because everybody was doing something different now and they're all established now but did you when you were in college have a side hustle and everybody had an interesting one so this i put that in my question bank of like ah interesting uh you know fun little combo when you're in a kind of entrepreneurial group so one guy tells a story he goes yeah dude i um i think he went to like ole miss or like what alabama or like one of these like southern football colleges and he's like i created a um like tailgate in a box like what he's basically like yeah like tailgating is huge before the football game people go to the parking lot and they want to grill and drink and play beer pong and do all the stuff and um he's like you know for he's like my family used to like to do it so he's like first my family it was so competitive so you had to go wait like kind of overnight to get your spot he's like so they would send me i'd have to go down to the i forgot what was called the grove or something like that and i'd have to wait in the parking lot and hold my family spot then i started to be like okay cool you got the spot well like well you got to set up the tailgate for us like come on we need uh tables for beer pong and we need this and that so he's like okay i'll i'll get the stuff every week and i'll go do it and he would create a good setup and then the space next to him was like hey dude can we next week can we just will you set ours up and he's like all right uh you give me like 200 bucks i'll get you guys some stuff like yeah sure and then the price goes up and he's like oh my i can basically charge each little tailgating square like each little group of friends 500 to just set up a cool tailgate spot for them turnkey tailgating and so he did this at his college and he's like dude i was making thousands and thousands of dollars every semester running this um and i was like is it i googled tailgate guys did it get acquired so so that was their competitor so there was a nationwide version of this he was doing this at small scale that was his college side hustle just to make a little bit of money he's like yeah tailgate guys tried to come in but uh they couldn't break into our market like we owned our market and i was like who's tailgate guys he's like oh these guys basically took this idea and they started doing it nationwide and i was like that's really smart he goes yeah but how does it work do you have like you just hire college kids and you say we'll give you 50 50 an hour for three hours on saturday we get 50 you get 50 exactly and then do they do the kids go to like walmart and buy the stuff i think either you give them the supplies in bulk or um or they have to go grab it and you tell them hey you need to get this table and these bowls and this beer this whatever whatever and you use like a company credit card something that has exactly and so tailgate guy and what they do the key is they would partner with the school they would say hey we'd like to be the exclusive uh tailgate provider for the school and the school would give them the license and so they had a monopoly and i was like what and it's like yeah actually this is pretty common that schools will basically pick one vendor provider they'll sell the license rights basically they'll let you become the official you know north carolina you know you know the tar heels they link to you instead you call it tar heel tailgate and it's like their thing and you pay them a fee or a revenue share of what's going on but in exchange you get a monopoly you get to be the only provider of this [ __ ] and it's like super viral right because you're just like everybody sees wow that setup looks not bootleg what is that oh they use tailgate guys or whatever okay cool we should use them next time and uh so tailgate guys apparently like i think they got bought out by private equity or something but they um they were doing like i don't know 30 to 50 million dollars a year doing this what and um and i thought what a great example of a college hustle that you then scale up you say all right if this works at my college it's going to work at every college and every college that has a football program that has tailgating and then we have this repeatable sales model of going to the university and we tell them hey these other eight universities partnered with us we'd like to partner with you you get extra income and we will provide a safe uh you know convenient way for your your fans to do this i thought that's pretty this is a really cool little niche business and then i started thinking well what are the other ones what are the other businesses that use the same sales tactic of basically partnering with the school and becoming the exclusive provider so we had a little mini brain mini because the guy listens to the podcast so we had like a mini brainstorm session at dinner where he's like dude this is happening also with scooters uh when like bird and lime came out in cities companies decided oh shoot we should become the exclusive scooter provider on campus like we'll go drop these scooters all everywhere it'll be branded by this with the school the school will get a rev share for every scooter ride that happens and we get a captive market that nobody can compete with us in and so this started happening with scooters and i was like oh damn what else could be done because scooters is cool because it's a new category right tailgating worked because it was a new category so you just have to think about like what's something today that they don't even really have a um like an option for like they're not really there isn't really like a market for it you're creating the market what did he say well we were kind of brainstorming you know he's like you know one of the hard things is now schools have gotten slightly wise to it they won't give the license up super easily meaning like they want to make sure they get a fair shake so once you come to them with the idea they're like great hold on 90 day proposal request for proposal period where we're going to go like see who wants to offer this to us so we're going to go talk to five companies before we just say yes to you but in the good old days you used to be like oh they should be like sure you know you came to us so you get the deal i um i i've learned a little bit about um selling to schools i i you frozen oh there you are i sent you uh this company it's called kira cubby it's kind of a bad name pure cubby but basically it's i just sent it to you actually i told joe to send it to you do you see it no and what they do is it's like the most boring thing ever so basically this guy uh stephen he had an autistic kid his kid was diagnosed with autism and he goes i don't feel like sending him to a normal school i don't think they're gonna do anything so he started a school and he like 20 kids in the neighborhood went to the school and he was like man managing this school so first of all that's amazing second of all he was like man's school is that pain in the ass right and so he so he found another parent in he lives in oakland so the other parents are like tech guys and he found uh this guy who sent his kid to his school and they decided to build this software together that basically makes it really easy to collect tuition payment and also pay your bills so basically like a bill.com or and then plus a quickbooks and then plus eventbrite so you can like check into after school programs and stuff like that and they are crushing it and it's just four guys and they got it up to like 2.4 million in revenue recurring revenue and but he's telling me all about selling into schools and it sounds like a nightmare selling into a school yeah i think it is uh you know the company who i think has done the best of this is mystery science have you seen them is that like a tv show what is that kind of okay so basically um oh wow they got acquired i didn't realize this they got acquired last year no way 140 million dollars good for them they um okay so this the what mystery science was doing was they were like all right um how do we make uh like entertaining videos sort of like uh you know i don't know pick your favorite analogy like blues clues or um whatever you know reading rainbow or whatever the hell that's called um magic school bus whatever and basically it's on every topic so if you're like you know how do why are plants green so they're like we start with a question that any kid would have why are plants green or like um you know how hot is the sun and they're like we're gonna make the definitive most entertaining simple answer to that question and it turns into in some ways like a it's like a game where it's like the teacher can just pick one of those questions and be like hey class today here's the question who wants to know the answer to this everyone's like yeah me i want to know the answer like great we're going to like have this little worksheet and this video and the video is gonna like tease us part of it and then we have to go figure out the next bit then we watch the next bit of the video so it makes it easy for the teacher to like teach a question that people are really interested in and they reached like four and a half million teachers countrywide like i think at one point 30 or 40 percent of all elementaries were using them so they had like dude how did they only sell for 150 million incredible um penetration it was it was absolutely insane um they i don't know why they sold for 140 million but i know that they basically raised very little money and they were super profitable and so i think you know for the guys they probably made you know over 100 million dollars off this deal and um [Music] you know they raised i think they raised only four million dollars like a lifetime uh it was a bit old they started in 2014 so you know seven seven years or so um and i think you know charging money is always is always hard but uh but these guys are super smart talk to the guy keith and i just really respected what they had built i thought wow what a cool product amazing that they've gotten this level of saturation and it was like the way they sold was it was like um you know like bottoms up in a way i think uh where like teacher it was just so like teachers couldn't help but talk about it to other teachers because they were like oh this is amazing it's like normally when i wheel out the tv well yeah it makes your job way easier so guilty i'm like copping out it's like yeah we're gonna watch a movie today class was like this is different this is like it's interactive it's based on questions it's based on science and they're like we're just going to teach science this way and um yeah i thought it was amazing that's so good this um yeah they reach 50 of the u.s elementary school market which is how much revenue were they making wild i don't know at the time i was talking to them they were doing like somewhere between between 10 and 20 million in revenue profitably um and did they make money through ads or they like sold workshops so they sell the like subscription i think to them it was a subscription so to the software dude how do you reach that many teachers but only have and only sell for 140. that's crazy to me yeah i don't know um just wild anyways uh i gotta run dude i got a call with this uh crazy crypto thing that i'm trying to get into so i want to see if i can do that all right we'll talk soon oh uh all right sean if you want to leave you can leave i think ben do i got to read out some names yes um actually just one name all right we did this thing where we gave 60 minutes of shaun and i's time what did the person have to do to win uh they had to review rate and review us on apple podcast great and the winner is is it ss yes spencer scott you are the winner has spencer

so the background is this this guy named kevin van trump he is probably in his 50s late mid to late 50s um and he basically i think he worked in chicago on like the commodities like trading floor so he like traded commodities but he's got a relatively thick southern accent right so he goes to chicago he probably makes eight figures trading commodities so he like sounds like this country bumpkin farmer but like you know he's trading like corn futures and [ __ ] like that makes a lot of money then maybe 10 years ago he starts this daily newsletter where he writes the whole thing by himself every single day at this point like 17 years he's done that is it 17 years something like that it's like some almost 20 years he's been doing this every day and it makes like something like in the world of 20 million dollars a year in subscription revenue just to read it's more i think it's like 30 40 million a year now so i've done calls with him and i'm just and this guy who's like oh hey check this song [ __ ] out like that's what he'll say [Music] okay so uh i haven't talked to you in like two weeks you had covid yeah dude i had i i can't even explain what i had i would apologize because i missed so many recordings but in a way you gave me covent because i got coveted because i went to this conference which is you know a decision i made i didn't really honestly i wasn't really thinking about it code has just been so present that i wasn't really like i didn't do the math of like you know if i go on a plane and i go to a conference with 2000 people what's gonna happen and so sure enough i go to this conference that sam hooks me up with he's like sam's like hey this conference is amazing it's called farm con these guys who run it there's super cool story you know it's awesome and i was like oh i'm in and i was gonna go and i land and i'm like yo i'm here baby let's do this and sam's like oh i didn't go dude i don't want to get covered well i can't i cancelled like last minute i i dude like i thought that you knew that i cancelled but like how would i know that because we we had talked about you going and we hadn't said i don't know we had not really mentioned that yeah yeah and uh i thought you knew i canceled so i felt horrible but like a week or two prior to that's like when omnichrome and all this stuff happened and it's a it's a farmer's conference in kansas city my you know i'm from missouri and i was like ooh i think that uh like that coveted will be there yeah i don't know if i would like it was for sure there it was the you know the the main attendee the main keynote speaker um dude we walked in so i walked in ben went with me and so um we go in and me and ben are literally the only two people in the room with a mask and there's like 2 000 people in there and i was like oh [ __ ] i didn't even really think about it and i was like oh [ __ ] it's here um and i was like well the odds of me getting are pretty high but i'm now here so i gotta just make the most of it so anyways basically i go to this conference uh and everything that could happen to get covid happened meaning like it's like uh conferences in this ballroom great it's two thousand people in one room all right that's not so good they don't have masks on okay next thing that happened i go to the gym in between uh like the sessions we mean ben want to get a workout in we go we meet this guy we're making small talk and we're like oh you're here for the conference he's like no i'm just quarantining here my girlfriend has coveted so i'm here oh my god i was like bro i just shook your hand and what am i doing and so then this guy my gym buddies got covered i was like oh great and then i get on the plane finally to come back i'm like all right i think i might have made it out unscathed i don't know i'm feeling okay plane gets stuck on the runway for three hours someone on a plane in a closed tube with a bunch of other people for three hours i was like all right it's over i got covered and sure enough i get home and uh two days later i get covered now the dumb thing i didn't do was i didn't quarantine right away which i should have just done i should have just said hey even if i'm not feeling anything i've been around a bunch of people i should just like leave but i was like look i just left my wife at home with the two babies for like you know four days i should come back and help and in trying to help i ended up giving my wife covid then we gave both our babies kovid and so for the last 10 days it's just been someone in my house has coveted at any given time um and i've just been literally i haven't gone to a computer i haven't done anything i've just been get it taking care of it ben did not get it i think ben had it like a month ago um so he somehow came out unscathed did silly get it uh he didn't go he didn't i'm going he flaked the night of um and was like actually like it's super inconvenient to get there i have to like change my flight has like a stopover [ __ ] this i'm not going uh we'll do something else so was it and you but you were even though you're vaccinated you got sick i got pretty i got really sick yeah i got some really sick for three days so let me tell you about my coverage experience i uh i got really sick for three days but it's just the flu with a side dose of paranoia because it's like oh this ain't the flu this is this is coven and so uh definitely you know fever all that good stuff whatever then the babies everybody has kind of the same thing but the bad thing is like i don't know how you are but i'm like a huge baby when i get sick me too and my wife is like uh you know never gets sick she's like one of those people just like never gets a cold never has a runny nose nothing and so even with kovid she was like she fought it off pretty good it was like pretty mild you know she was still doing that i think women are generally tougher particularly moms are tougher when it comes to that stuff totally but the hard part is when we both get the same thing and i go down like a you know bag of bricks and she's still complaining yeah she's just like what is this why are you why do you need so much sleep right now i'm like i just can't explain in fact i saw this meme that was so perfect it goes there's this guy and he goes he goes you know it's so good that women have to give birth and go through labor because now they understand what happens when a man gets a cold and that's how it is i'm a huge baby about it and she like toughed it out no problem uh so that was kind of embarrassing did um so how many people how many full-time employees work at your um your company the uh the the the d2c company maybe like seven eight full-time and and these in amer americans full-time and you and you like are running not all americans but but you know people who this is their main job they work full-time and when you're not counting the warehouse staff and do you like do weekly meetings with them and run it like a company or is it really if it's run like sean like very autonomous everything done via slack very autonomous everything done via slack we have one meeting a week that's in slack and i just say hey get in this channel right now but we just did it it's at 10 30 it's like all right get in this channel right now and i just say all right you everybody here and then they just like emoji react and then i'm like cool this is like a real meeting meaning like don't go open 10 other tabs like when i say something i want a response within like a second because it's like a live chat i was like but calls are annoying we all agree calls are annoying so let's just like do like just humor me let's try this meeting style so we do it i kind of like it and basically i just say all right what's everybody's main priority this week like what matters everyone's like oh we got to do this this this i said then i'll be like ah that doesn't really sound that like that matters that much can we punt that they're like yeah i guess so and like we just agree on here's the three or four things that matter this week you're doing this you're doing this you're doing this and then it's like cool all uh i tell one guy i say hey check in on wednesday and everybody just say how they're going on their things for the week and then check in on friday and say how did we do for the week that's it that's how much time does your wife spend on the company she spends a good amount of time like she's uh she you know she's a stay-at-home mom i guess like first job because like so during the day she doesn't really work on it too much just kind of like on her phone in between you know just like watching the baby but then at night she basically works from 10 p.m when the babies are finally knocked out to 2 or 3 a.m pretty much every night she does that and she works on the business and does the designs and all that stuff so when you guys are both sick how bad like who's we did no work you just we just like you just have a a a person who you trust and you say just handle it yeah we're like you know just you do what you can do and then whatever doesn't get done doesn't get done we're not going to worry about it we're not going to add a stress to our life that like says this week we also have to you know work it's just impossible so let's talk about this conference for a second because i have been telling you about this guy for a long time and i think that you sh you humored me and the audience has humored me and they're like oh that sounds neat but when you got to meet him did you understand what i was saying dude this guy is amazing this guy is amazing and what he's built is amazing so i want to go through i have a bunch of thoughts but let's start with with them okay so the conference called farmcon and the families call the van trump family that's their that's their name so it's kevin van trump and jordan van trump uh that's like the two kind of like core principles that's the father and son and uh i'm just going to describe what happened when i got there because it wasn't like a normal conference so a couple unusual things i go in and there's a normal stage like a conference you know like they got that freaking wallpaper behind it that's like every sponsor's logo on step and repeat banner okay cool that everything's normal but this main speaker kevin van trump is sitting not uh not in a chair he's got this like mahogany desk that was put on to the stage and he's sitting in it he looks like a judge of a courtroom so he's got this humongous like oak wood table that he's sitting behind in his thing and he's got a gavel literally and he's talking into the mic and he it's just like a free-form agenda so he'll be like like he would just say something he'd be like i walked in and he's like yeah that's why i don't hire any ivy leaguers you know ivy leaguers here's a problem with ivy leaguers and he'll just go on a rant there's like five panelists that are sitting there and then he'll just like do tell this story and the crowd loves him i loved him he is an amazing charismatic speaker who is smart and very real and he's very he's just a very good speaker like his style was so um likable i couldn't i can't explain the background is this this guy named kevin van trump this is all from memory i met him four or five years ago at a conference and since then we i've kind of brought him into our circle of friends he is probably in his 50s mid to late 50s um and he basically i think he worked in chicago on like the commodities like trading floors so he like traded commodities but he's got a relatively thick southern accent kansas city missouri isn't really considered the south but it can be pretty country so i don't know where he's from so he goes to chicago he probably makes eight figures trading commodities so he like sounds like this country bumpkin farmer but like you know he's trading like corn futures and [ __ ] like that makes a lot of money then maybe 10 years ago he starts this daily newsletter where he writes the whole thing by himself every single day at this point like 17 years he's done that is it 17 years something like that it's like some almost 20 years he's been doing this every day and it makes like something like in the world of 20 million dollars a year in subscription revenue just to read it's more i think it's like 30 40 million a year now so i've done calls with him and i'm just and this guy he's like oh hey check this selling [ __ ] out like that's what he'll say he's like pointing at his new picasso so i've done video calls with him and he's got like this like beautiful like chopper in the background like a fancy customized motorcycle he goes oh we just picked up this song [ __ ] though we just got this home [ __ ] here today we really love the picassos and you like that's how he talks and he's he now his family uh kevin or jordan his younger son runs like this other business but in this the commodities world this like farming world they are gods and i've met a bunch of people who like them and they're like new york-ish type folks who have like 50 100 million dollars and are like traitors and they like revere him and they love him dude so so have you read any of his newsletters they're so good yeah i must paint subscribers first they're like you know it's like it's like a 20-page pdf so it's like not even like a short thing it's like a long thing and it's like he basically is writing about what he thinks is going on so uh in the market so he'll be like you know bean futures or you know rice or corn these different commodities he's talking about what's going on is really important for people in agriculture because if you're a farmer and you're making you're growing corn you got to decide do i hold this corn and try to sell it myself do i need to take on some insurance in case the price of corn drops and um should i sell you know all of my corn you know in these futures in this futures market or should i you know should i hedge but should i take a hedged position against what i'm producing and so you have to decide what you're going to do with your crop that is your like for most people investing is this like side thing it's like you do your job that earns you your money your business energy your money and then you invest in the stock market whatever they're two separated things for a farmer these are not separated this is part of the like core thing of what you do is basically managing your risk and these aren't guys that have like a farm that like they just like get by these are like folks that like supply the corn to like mcdonald's and we're talking like they have turnover of 20 30 50 million like they're here's that yeah he's like you know you'll meet the guy who makes all the rice for chipotle it's like whoa that's crazy that's crazy volume and then i would meet people who were like what you call gentleman farmers they're basically people who don't need to farm they just grew up that way and they're like yeah my family i like living on a farm i want my family to have a farm i farm on my weekends and nights like there's one guy he's a ceo of a large company and he was just farming for fun you know nights and weekends and that's why he was you know like there and it was like such a bad use of like time but it's not it's a it's not a bad use of time because it's a hobby it's a pleasurable thing for him what this manual work is like how he relaxes how many people were there so it's about 1500 people and um so let me explain this guy to their business okay so they have what i'll call three separate components maybe four okay so there's the newsletter the paid newsletter that basically you subscribe to you pay a thousand dollars a year and i think i believe i my guess based on some triangulation is that that's making about 30 to 40 million dollars a year now in annual subscription revenue and he's writing that you know like we'd be hanging out it was like maybe midnight he's at the hotel bar or whatever we're hanging out and he's and i was like so like you know who on your team writes the letter he's like he's like i wish you know i write the letter he's like i'm going to go right up to my room right after this go write that some [ __ ] and he's like you know that's how he talks yeah he's like i don't know why the [ __ ] i did this he's like i created a job for myself he's like i told my kid my son i said you you need to the best job in the world is investing you should invest don't do what i did i created a job for myself and i have to write this thing every day but you know you know i love it whatever and it's really ugly have you seen it it's like it's not mobile friendly it's just a pdf and it's like 3 000 words with like powerpoint uh it's all substance over style uh there's a few memes in there which i like uh it's like you know just some here's some jokes uh and i think that's very on broadcasting it's good the writing is great the writing is really great uh and the insights obviously matter otherwise people wouldn't be paying for this thing right they're genuinely getting value and at the conference he's a god dude people people love this guy they they respect his kind of like knowledge and his content and then they just really like him because again he would say i literally wrote down verbatim things that he was saying because i was like this is just like this is so entertaining like for example um i'm just gonna read you a couple of quotes on uh that he was saying so he's like i hate hiring ivy leaguers because uh they're too afraid of failure he's like they don't well they've done so well their whole life they're not they're not used to looking wrong or looking silly you know go try nfts go go go put your hands on the wheel go get go go fall go scrape your knee he's like that's how i grew up he's like my dad would take us in the car he said no no seatbelts baby that's how we roll he's like he's like we're gonna take some risks we're gonna get skinned up we're gonna break some bones we're gonna fall off the bike he's like that's how you gotta treat your kids even if they're smart kids you gotta he's like because one of the big concerns is how do you get your kid you're you're 60 maybe now and you got your farm your kids 30 they don't want to take over the farm or they don't maybe they want to but they don't know how to do anything well he's like he's like you got to segment off a portion of the farm let him fail but let him have the skin in the game um he's like you know i want to have kids i don't melt down when the rug gets pulled i want to be able to go to them and say hey things things have changed we're changing tonight and he's just like going on this rant and dude i'm sitting there in the crowd and i'm like world star i'm like this is this is such a hype monologue and had nothing to do with whatever they were talking about like bean futures five seconds before that but he would frequently go on these and every time i'm just nodding my head i'm like preach um like we i was at this dinner with them and people were like it was kind of like these guys organized this dinner they were paying for it but then they as you know like sort of what's what's that what's the catch it was we're going to pitch our idea to kevin and a couple other guys who we want to invest in it and they pitch their idea and he's like cool so who's the uh who's the who's the audience who's the customer for this and uh they're like well you know we've done extensive psychographic research here's a they slid over this thing he's like psychographic i don't know what that means man what the [ __ ] you saying who is the customer and they're like it's it's not democrat he's like it's a psychographic profile he's like no like name them do you know five people who want this product like would this guy want this product hey you over there at the table would you want this product and the guy's like no i wouldn't want it and the guys are like kevin you're not like being open-minded and he's like i'm trying to help y'all he's like i've heard this idea ten times and it failed i invested in this one it failed investors and why did it fail because there was no customer for this product and he's like trying to give him real talk and it was so good and the whole time i'm just like wow this guy's core business instincts are very strong and his delivery method is fearless i just i'm trying to do the impression because i want people to feel like what it felt like to hear this guy off the top of his head it's so different than corporate america it's so different than new york sf where everybody's hedging every word and packaging everything and trying to deliver it and trying to make these [ __ ] you know like criticism sandwiches where you say a positive thing than a negative thing that a positive thing to like you know deliver the blow whereas he would just say the thing and he did it in a way that came off great i loved it what uh all right so you have a list of a bunch of [ __ ] that you've learned here let's just rattle them off i found them to be all wildly interesting let's do a couple things so the rest of his business so he tells me so he goes i'm doing i got i know for sure his build business was doing in the 25 million dollar range years ago right so that so there's the newsletter component yeah then he's like well two please by the way i think right and he's like you know i don't uh there's never been a sponsor 15 years john deere comes to me they say we would love to sponsor no trust for the odd he he had these principles he was like these people are going to trust me because i'm not going to be selling them to somebody and so um he was like you know i'm gonna do it this way and i'm gonna stick to my guns and so and he's never done a never like run ads to advertise this thing it's all organic word of mouth one person sharing it with another saying you gotta check this thing out forwarding it to somebody else saying hey you see what he's saying about where the market's going and then that person's like [ __ ] i need these insights and so that's an amazing you know there's probably 90 profit 95 profit like on that on that 30 million right i think i like what's talking about which emails like it's so raw i think he uses salesforce to send it out right like that's his email service provider like it's pretty raw so then the second piece of the business is i think that there's now a secondary thing that's happened many many years in which is like a big company will come to them and say hey you know let's just i'm just gonna for argument's like chipotle's like hey we need um we need somebody's gonna grow soy in this region so he's just like hey i know like they're like you know everybody and so he's like cool yeah i can find you people who can produce what you need and they were like cool if we pay them let's call it five dollar five dollars a bushel you know we'll make it 550 and you keep your 50 cents as the as a broker fee so i think that now produces as much as the newsletter so so let's double it basically let's tack that on um now the third thing is investing so they basically had this you know they're like well everybody keeps coming to pitch us ag tech they know they don't know what the [ __ ] they're talking about we know everybody in this space so they then started investing and i think they just had their biggest hit to something called benson hill or benson's hill or something like that that went public um so you know like the first kind of like you public unicorn that they seated and the last one is the most interesting one of all this is what the sun is doing so yeah ag swag so here's the back story that he tells about this and i'm not saying anything private like he told us on stage he goes i met a guy who he like moved into my neighborhood type of thing and he used to be you know big shot exec at some company and he's like cool like what are you doing now he's like oh i'm uh i'm doing this kind of like either this buyout like leveraged buyout or i'm going to become a ceo of this company called american identity we make t-shirts and hats and he's like all right kind of lame like selling t-shirts now like you've done some big [ __ ] why are you doing that a few years later fast forward that company american identity identity sells to staples for eight billion dollars and he looks at they say what the hell is a that t-shirt company what what the hats custom hats like what what the [ __ ] and he's basically like yeah um he's like who are your biggest customers he was like oh yeah my three biggest customers are cargill adm and john deere and he's like uniforms what's that is that are they making uniforms or they're just making licensed merchandise so like i think by john deere they're just are printing it for form they're printed they're making it for john deere john deere might have employees they have you know two thousand employees they want to say john deere or a vest with a giant green john deere vest or whatever and so he's like those are your top those are your biggest accounts like those are my buddies um like i know all those guys and so after they sell or whatever is him and his son they create ag swag agricultural swag it's the same idea but now they go to all those accounts and they say hey you want like vests and and fleece and hats and whatever and you got you know 100 employees in your office in brazil you need to send some stuff too cool we got you and i think this is going to be a really big business also and so they are doing very well he was saying they outgrew their their warehouse they're trying to you know expand and all this he was telling me so i want to say any of the numbers for that particular you tell me some of just the square footage they need in the warehouse and i know from the ddc space i know if you need that much square footage you are putting out pretty crazy volume so i thought that was amazing as well but what an example of just being a big fish and not even a really small pond right it seems like a niche but it's like agriculture yeah pretty huge niche you know aggregate like my parents are working this industry and that's why i like this guys because i got to know them is like the thing that people like guys like you and me and people listening to us were these tech folks and we dismissed this but like literally everyone in america has an onion in their home or a product made of an onion right and you you're gonna buy it multiple times a week um that's what my dad does my dad sells onions and i remember people i would make fun of him and he's like go look in your cabinet you have stuff that i have owned at one point i bet and uh and so it's not as small as we think oh i mean obviously it's not like for example the uh the founder of square this guy jim mckevin i want to talk about him too he's this he was the keynote speaker she comes on the stage he was also a very good speaker i'm and i kind of have a high bar for that kind of thing but he's he was very impressive and he gets on stage very first thing he says is um just want to say thank you to everybody in this room for feeding my family you know it's like but it's just it's like such an obvious thing but i say yeah of course where all the [ __ ] we eat comes from somewhere and in my mind this is gonna sound super dumb and ignorant but it's true which is like before this conference i really spent zero percent of my time thinking about where the heck the food comes where heck food comes from and if you thought of a farmer you probably had stupid stereotypes of like dumb idiots for sure i was like oh and going into this i was like oh i'm going to go meet a bunch of hillbilly like rednecks basically they do talk like that i'm from there they definitely will talk like that but they like are wearing like a 50 000 rolex and when i get there they're like you know yeah you know put options on bean futures and you know with brazil coming on board with you know i'm gonna i'm gonna take this hedge position against corn and i was like oh wait y'all are like [ __ ] wall street traders wait what and i was like okay maybe it's just a couple of these guys and i was like oh and then i would meet guys in the hallway and i'd be like what do you do oh we have my family i was on a farm in south dakota for 40 years okay cool so i was like do you do this like kind of like [ __ ] soybean soybean oil futures and they're like yeah you got to and i was like what i was like how do you know he said well we got a broker but like you know it's key to the business you got you got to be doing it and i was like holy [ __ ] like you guys are more sophisticated financially than anybody i know like i could go to in silicon valley i go talk to engineers or or angel investors vcs and i could be like hey explain to me how a derivatives contract works or explain to me how a how the corn futures market looks nobody would know what the [ __ ] they're talking about nobody would know what to say dude now now okay so you've you've not made fun of me but you teased me a little bit about like loving trucks and farmers now do you understand why i think it's so cool like these guys are sophisticated and everything but like the people you and i hang out with in our in our coastal coastal cities they don't give a [ __ ] about these folks and i'm like man if you got to make those collide and be awesome right and so a couple couple things like on that note so when i was at one of the dinners they were talking about uh it was the who's the customer dinner they were they're talking about something they and something came up they go uh you know how long he's like how long we've been here about whole foods and uh you know plant-based this and oat milk that he's like this still tiny fringe [ __ ] he goes america eats cornbread and milk at scale this is what america wants they need how much how much volume is the whole food and then i'm thinking dude in my bubble everybody eats like that everybody eats the fringe [ __ ] so it was just awareness of like two things one is like in the future maybe what we're doing ends up becoming more mainstream i do believe that but how not it is is crazy the scale the difference in scale of just like you know corn versus you know the non-whole foods versus whole foods is like to them whole foods was this rounding error and i thought that was hilarious because to me it's like you know it's like i don't know where i shop every day it's it's the main thing and again all this is going to sound really like dumb but uh i'm dumb that's i guess the answer when i was there i was learning how dumb i was about everything um there was so many different things like that that i was learning can i just rattle off a couple other things okay so jonathan write us in the chat is this is this i could talk about this all day i think this is the coolest [ __ ] ever so i'm going to give you a couple of pain points and or business ideas that i saw or heard when i was there or just making up because like oh maybe this um so one thing is even though i'm like oh these guys are really sophisticated there's no way that they want to be that sophisticated about this all these like kind of financial uh products that they have to use for hedging the props they produce and the insurance and all that good stuff so i think that some kind of wealthfront type of robo-advisor that basically just does all the work for them to manage their risk is is going to be like important because every single one of them is like yeah we have a broker we call and we talk to him and he tells us xyz and uh he tells us what he thinks we should be doing and we come up with a position we want to take and then we take it so that to me felt very old and i feel like if somebody has a real advisor thing that's kevin trump had an idea he goes i want to make a rally road and i think we've talked about rally road on here which is basically rally road is like this app you open up and you can buy a fraction of cool memorabilia so it'd be like a sweet old car or first edition harry potter signed book set it's awesome in my opinion rally road has one of the best apps i've seen in like the last two or three years super nice app company i wish i invested in honestly uh i've been i feel like i've been saying that for a year probably should have just done it at this point but really cool product really cool app so he was saying he's like i feel like he's like i think we could do rally road just for our stuff and i was like what do you mean he's like you know just like the the original you know motorcycle from dukes and hazards or you know and again i'm all the references flew over my head he said them really fast but like it was basically just just cool hicks [ __ ] yeah and um and i was like oh that's probably actually a really good idea because these guys got money and they care about this stuff and there's like a network effect of just speaking to that audience dude didn't i tell you um so you know how i used to work for the show american pickers right do you do i don't you were not in the market for that because you were in uh were you in australia at the time whatever but you if if the show was around now you wouldn't watch that you don't fit that that bill but do you know that that show america so for those listening i used to work for the show american pickers it's basically like pawn stars would go up what did you do for them so the main guy in the show his name is mike wolf he's the main character he owned this store and it was called picking and so you go and you just knock on doors and you go to barnes and you find old memorabilia and you either sell it in your own stores or you sell it to antique shops or you sell it on ebay and like the antique shops they have to get it from somewhere they get it from pickers this guy like would buy old bike bicycles that's a big market or he would buy like a old 1936 harley for 10 grand and sell it for 30 grand that type of stuff and he owned the store and he started filming himself pre-youtube for like five years to make the show popular pitching it to the history channel year after year after year getting declined finally they said all right this is cool he's a good-looking guy charismatic guy they pick up the show he gets he was not rich off the pick and stuff but he was like making a living gets rich because he um licenses the show he owns he's the producer he owned all the rights i work at the store where we would sell the stuff that he bought the his picks but so many people would come to the store that basically we sold 30 grand a day of t-shirts and shot glasses and because he was like eventually he wouldn't even sell the picks anymore because he was like i need i need stuff for people to look at when they're in the store and he probably made um i mean his business was probably doing 30 40 million dollars a year off all of his whole office stuff and when the show was on when the show was live it's still live now but it's past its heyday when it was live we were the second or third most popular show on tv on all of tv and we would have people flying from all over the world just to come and look at the stuff that i mean i would have i helped run the store but like half the time i was just holding the door and making sure that we weren't at capacity and um the reason i'm bringing this up is this whole rally road for middle america [ __ ] this is the real stuff and like buying like these rare baseball cars or whatever it is that's the fringe and rally road has built a great business on top of that exactly and by the way if you were going to start this i would i i'd email sam and cc me just so i didn't get to know but b i would go to these guys like mike wolf i would go find these kind of like all-american influencers and i would use them to help promote the app and help get them all get them on board to to grow this thing and i think this is kind of like you go where nobody else is fishing i think there's just not much competition to build technology products in that space um let me tell you a couple other ideas that were that were in there so um any kind of fintech for farmers so part of it's like this wealth front idea but also just like i've invested in six companies that are all just variations of like you know brex or mercury bank so basically like there's two startups that got big that were in the that were serving entrepreneurs serving tech startups one is mercury which is just saying hey instead of going and using bank of america or wells fargo just use mercury as your bank right we have a slick interface it's a mobile app you never got to talk to a banker you know free wire transfer but it's not really a bank it's um they're partnering with another bank and they just layer their branding on top of that they're on top exactly um but they've done really well they're now valued over a billion dollars you know this guy who built it mod he's kind of in our in our friends group he's awesome and um yeah he's great he came on the pod so uh you know so so mercury was bank for tech startups and then brex was visa for tech startups same thing not you know they're built on top of the visa rails or the mastercard rails or whatever but it's just a credit card for startups and it was taking advantage of like hey we understand startups so like for example you might be a startup that's raised 10 million dollars of venture capital but your credit card limit is 5 000 because the bank's like dude you have no income no history no nothing no credit like you know we can't give you money and there's like dude i just raised 10 million dollars i have the money in the bank like spend because they know that startups spend most their money on ad spend exactly like that or things like um you know just the fact like hey you can fill out the application online you don't have to talk to human and it'll be like sent to you in two days or like you know you want this to like easily autofill online like there's do little stuff that makes it like work well for that oh mercury for farmers brex became a multi-billion dollar thing mercury did and i've been i've now invested in versions of either mercury or bricks for teenagers for teens in india four businesses in india for canadians creators is the one that everyone for creators i did that one creators make this for food creators this it would be it'd be so much better to do this yeah it'd be yeah it's gonna be crazy so we call farmers that's what we call farmers we're gonna rebrand farming as the creator economy they're just creating food yeah yeah seed creators um dude it's so much that would be such a better company and they're spending a lot of money right because like all of it the equipment the like you know this the fertilizers these are like huge bulk purchases my cousins i have an aunt and cousin who it's a mom and son they have 1500 acres with like a thousand cattle or so and i've gone out and hung out with them and so they basically raised bowls to it's called bucking bowls so like at a rodeo the bowl that is like it's called that that bowl is bucking and at a rodeo the guy the cowboy who stays on wins money and the bull that bucks the hardest wins money and you can also make money by if you have a really good buck and bowl you get money by getting its semen out there and all the females they kill and turn into beef and they make a living doing this they're i don't they're probably millionaires but uh they are [ __ ] hard workers and when they walk around places like during a work day because like when you're a farmer you're constantly driving to get feed whatever they'll have 20 g's on them in cash wow like they just have just like fat loads like you just need or like when they go to the road rappers and farmers dude when dude when they go to the rodeo i've seen them they have like a they've had like 10 grand on them because they got to like buy this while they're there they do this they got to make their bet anyway these farmers have [ __ ] loads of cash because they are they're still doing stuff with cash so like this is interesting it's a great market yeah uh the other one if uh automation so i think the number one thing that was on everybody's mind is automation how do we how do we get more automation so i think from the beginning technology has helped farms which is like you know before there was tractors everything was like you know horse pulled you know or whatever and then tractors come out it becomes a big deal and john deere is trying to do self-driving tractors and everybody's trying to do automation and so i think if you're sitting at mit or you're at carnegie mellon and you're in some robotics lab and you're like okay i can keep making like you know things that i understand that from you know this gadget that like turns off my light switch in my room because i don't like to get up once i lay down yeah so that's what i'm gonna do it's like dude instead go to a farm for like three weeks and just watch what's going on and then from there come up with the automations and stuff you want to pull i've invested in a few companies in that space um so it's automations and precision agriculture they call it so um which i i think automation falls under precision agriculture that's like the the term i believe and uh it's incredibly interesting so like you talk about like automated car autonomous cars autonomous tractors is incredibly intriguing right there's also like sensors so just like soil qualities like the soil health is like one of the most important things if your soil health is bad your crop is [ __ ] and so just being able to come up with models where you can go put sensors in the ground and get real-time soil health data um and alert people hey this plot in this area is not going to grow very well because of this that also seemed like a big deal so those are some ideas last one is family succession planning so one of the biggest things was like how do you pass down your farm because if your kids don't want to do it and increasingly you know kids don't want to do it what the heck are you going to do with this farm uh and so there's like places that you can sell farms so i think that was one opportunity there's creating your estate your will and all that stuff there's renting it out to other people there was just a whole bunch of stuff around okay if billions of dollars of farms is going to trade hands in the next like 10 10 years who's going to be in the middle of that um and i think working with remember one we had one episode where we talked about picking your customer and we were talking about this company user voice or user testing which one did your mom work for user testing and i was like i think that's so cool because it gives people like your mom like moms who raise kids and don't can't have full-time jobs it gives them work that's admirable that's exciting that's incredibly motivating i think you could i would easily put farmers in that same situation um or in that same category where it would be really exciting and fun to work with those guys right right totally uh there was a couple of startups that i liked one was called acre trader it said these guys now they've raised like 60 million bucks i think peter thiel invested in them and basically it's just fractional land ownership of farms so the idea is you can buy i could go on there today and i could put down a thousand dollars and buy a piece of a farm in north dakota and i can make eight to eleven percent a year uh on that thing and i could diversify i could own pieces of five farms in five different states i do five different things and then there's a farmer on the farm that does the work that's leasing the farm from you you're just owning the land and these guys i think the average farm that they were doing was like two million dollars in size uh and they did like 80 farms last year or something like that so i was like okay that's actually pretty good like they buy they basically buy the land and then fractionally sell it off and they take a broker fee plus they take a like management fee of 0.75 a year on top of that just to manage the the just to be the property manager of the land so it sounds like this conference is badass you you it changed your perspective on some stuff for sure in fact i actually just want to say uh conferences in general i think that the general rap is conferences ways to time you'll see that a lot on twitter especially from smart people people say that either the exact opposite for you i think conferences are pure [ __ ] alpha meaning i think there's so much gains to be had at conferences number one you leave your routine and that's just frees the mind to just like get out of the like get yourself out of the weeds and get somewhere else then when you meet somebody at a conference there's like just meeting people in person like it's so crazy you don't have to do anything you know that i met kevin i spoke at a conference and i was just hanging out in the lobby and kevin van trump came up to me and he was wearing cowboy boots and a ramones t-shirt and i thought that he was like a weirdo like i did think that he was legit but he was like talking like a big game not like bragging but kinda like he told me his business and he had i could he had like a hundred thousand dollar watch on and i was like wait you're telling me he's like yeah i got 20 000 subscribers i was like oh sick you guys make money through ads he goes oh no i paid subscription i was like wait who are you so i uh by the way he remembered you he gave a great intro when he was introducing me he's like i met this guy sam he used to work for american pickers and bo and he just gave he told the whole conference about you and how great you were it's awesome and so anyway i met kevin at a conference which now you've been brought into the fold this is going to influence you in some capacity you're going to bring other people into the fold that's why conferences are cool conference is cool secondly go to weird conference so if you just keep going to the same insular if you like i actually think that going to conferences that are not your industry is something that nobody really does and i've always done like i went to i remember like a restaurant trade show conference and i've been to a gym equipment gym owners conference and i've been to and when you go you just meet a whole bunch of people from a different totally different walk of life you see what are they thinking about what are they what are their uh what are the problems these guys are worried about uh who are and you you know i'm sure out of this i'll get some investors for my fund i'll get some new ideas i'll get i'll get some new perspective and it just makes you a more interesting person and so i would highly recommend going to trade shows specifically but like just different industry niches that are not yours and just go go to a sneaker conference and just be like oh what the hell are these sneaker heads doing like who are these people and what do they do yeah i know it's like a luxury if you if you have the time but um if you work remotely anyways go to one of these things spend four hours on the floor and then spend the other five hours or whatever at night you know working and just work from there for the week um or if you're young and you don't know what to what to do don't just take a job like go dabble go travel around to three of these and you'll just have like a totally different lens of things so so i think that's like a hack um that you know i wanted to bring up uh yeah it's crazy by the way these guys the farmers the best thing i got from them was their little one-liners like they were one guy was telling the story about this investment he lost a bunny bunch of money on people were like damn you like that like holy [ __ ] you must have lost a lot he goes it was a sad day but you know that's why johnny walker makes a blue and yeah you know you just like move on i was just like i'm writing these down like these are bars dude these guys are these guys are amazing can we um are we allowed to talk about i think so why not all right let's talk about so do you want to give the bat we might want to bleep out his name so let's let's bleep out his name well let's talk about my friend well let's let we'll ask him after this but all right we um he there's this guy named i didn't really know much about him somehow i got brought into this group chat that you're in and in a weird way i feel like i'm good friends with them now even though we've only texted yeah he uh uh how does he talk about what happened over the weekend about this app okay so um so basically says here's his short story he's built a couple of like products honestly never really had a big hit um him and his friends have been working on they were working on a startup or they're working as a startup for a number of years and they're just grinding running test after test they're really building a lot of stuff in the social space so he learned a lot of like kind of the he like cut his teeth in trying to build the next twitter next tick tock next whatever right and the they were about to fail the last thing they built the hail mary was they were like oh let's just create this like kind of like quiz app this like superlatives app where it's like oh who at your high school is most likely to you know become a professional dancer or like you know go to jail or whatever and it goes viral and it's called tbh and it goes viral it hits like number one in the app store because this the flow is basically you you open the app you start answering these questions about your friends they would text your friends being like hey sean said you're most likely to x click here to see what else he said i was like oh dude i'm going to click that and then you click that and then it would go on something something along those lines so tbh goes viral facebook ends up buying it smart move by i kind of knew this thing doesn't have like you know legs to actually be the next hit social app but it made them like you know a good not like i i don't think it sold for what it was reported as yeah it's like a hundred million dollars i think but it made you know a lifetime of money yeah exactly so these guys they pull it off in the end right so they went from like literally they were about to shut it down he's like [ __ ] it let's just launch this last thing and um and that thing hits so then he goes to facebook he stays there for like [ __ ] four full four years so he hits the full vest and he's he the whole time i don't know he's probably bored and he's just on twitter and he's like he's what people call [ __ ] posting which is basically like you know just posting jokes on twitter and oftentimes making fun of the tech industry so making fun of the stuff that people in the tech industry are doing and um so anyways he you know people like to follow him because he's funny so over the weekend so he he basically said he tweeted something out last week that was like hey i'm working on i'm going to work on a new project i finally like left facebook whatever um i'm working on a new project i want to work with a designer uh if like i'm looking for a founding designer if you want to like you know build something amazing work with a team that's built you know built apps blah blah blah uh you know dm me something along those lines and when he quit and announced that he was quitting at facebook it said i've been at facebook they bought my app i've been there for four years um it really was just um there was a lot happen and i want to give a thread on everything that i learned any and and it pointed down down like the down emoji and there was no other threat that was nothing there yeah and it was hilarious here's what i learned my four years of facebook nothing um and so yeah that was hilarious and so people are like oh people generally are excited about next your thing especially all the kind of like venture investors and angel investors this is kind of the entrepreneur you like to back which is somebody who you think is smart who um is a serial entrepreneur so not their first rodeo but also hasn't had the big win so they still have a huge chip on their shoulder and want to want to make it big so that's like a great entrepreneur to invest in and he's pretty well networked and pretty well respected so people want to invest in it so he tweets that thing out looking for a designer and then somebody else said uh somebody two days later just tweets like i saw uh you know a mock-up of a new app like holy [ __ ] it's gonna like change everything and this guy also is like a [ __ ] poster this this guy uh i think in his hands like another cohen or something like that and um and by the way you've seen the the image that he's talking about he's posted in our in our text thread before but like you know here's an idea like i might make this thing and and if i put it correctly it wasn't even like it's not a business it's like it's like a it's just like a silly idea and it's a high-level idea still he's still ideating he doesn't exactly yeah so anyways people then start memeing that guy they're like i just saw a new app um new app for the first time and you know this work that i've had on my toe for years just went away and like you know the next person would be like you know uh i showed it to eight children who were starving and now they're you know they're not hungry anymore and so this goes viral as a uh as like a meme on twitter i'm gonna read you some of them that were there the good ones they were great they were great let's see um [Music] there was guys saying like we're happy to announce that it was andrew chen we're happy to announce that we just led an uh a hundred million dollar round new app right i can't believe they're extending um i just got to a session with my therapist she ended up asking me for tips on how to get allocation into a new company and so just became this like meme in the tech industry and then a lot of people were seeing it like what's this app and so and by the way this this idea this like kind of like growth hack it was accidental a but b really effective and it drummed up a bunch of interest and a bunch of hype around what this new app could be and so what he did was he created an nft with like uh i think he's still 16 he's got oh my god he's got this really stupid like image for his twitter picture but it's kind of like funny uh and he made different twitter images based off of his and 69 of them and in if you bought one you get early access as a beta user to his app right i don't know was that the promise i didn't know yeah that's the promise look at the floor price of what those are so he goes ladies and gentlemen i'd like to introduce leadership hosting club a collection of 69 owners will get access to quote app parentheses there is no app it is now available on amazing and so he links it and it sells out um as nfts do and i think he made what did he make off this thing the floor has dropped so anybody who bought this i think is probably not doing so hot um the floor is now only 0.36 e so that's not great but anyway it's still a thousand dollars so 69 pictures per thousand dollars okay not bad so here's what i want to ask you okay i want to ask you a question because you have done something similar i didn't know before you and i you introduced me to him um i knew him as a guy who built an app but it seems like people revere him like they consider him an expert on consumer apps um which not saying that he isn't he certainly is pretty successful but also what the [ __ ] but but also like his reputation like is so big where he's like yeah is anyone that good that's kind of what i'm gonna get yeah and you've done a good job of that as well of creating this like mystique uh almost out of nothing right not that like you weren't successful ahead of time but like you've done a really good job of building what i sold my startup for less than what my investors had put in now you know the way it worked you know the team still did well and i made good money off of it but like that's not that's the that's not the definition of a successful business because there's a lot of people that have sold their companies for a lot of money we have a we have a handful of buddies that are like uber rich no one [ __ ] knows who they are and like even if they told you that what they did you'd have to like they'd have to beg to speak at a conference whereas guys like you you've got like the daily show reaching out to you you've got celebrities reaching out to you who want to like get on board with you and then the same thing because you can make it sound good i could say i sold my sold my last startup to amazon yeah technically i did technically i made money but like oh that's not it that doesn't make it a like a huge success you know it doesn't make me like a thought leader i don't think that's the right way to say it because that you you're you're acting like you're tricking people because you've never tricked anyone ever and i don't think as either but what you've done is you you've both done this really good job of creating a little bit of mystique about and what i want to know is you can use the example and then you how does someone i guess i'm asking for myself because how do you create so much of this like brand equity uh like you guys have well i think in both cases it's basically you put out you put your thoughts on blast so you know they're the real answer and by the way i say that not to make fun of the app i think did sell for a profit so good good for them i'm saying i know that i've gotten disproportionate credit for my track record of success when in reality like the best thing i've built is this d2c company that i don't tell anybody the name of that's the profitable business that's doing eight figures a year but like that's not actually why people my reputation came before that so you know that's kind of weird right so where does the reputation actually come from it comes from two things one is you meet people in real life so like you go meet you know the investors at these different big funds or uh ceos of different companies and when they're talking to you they're making an independent assessment of your love your caliber your based on your thoughts so right so so first it's like a hand-to-hand combat thing you meet a bunch of people you earn their respect one-on-one by by you know when they're talking about some deal they're doing or a company they're building you you actually contribute by adding value by pointing out things or or giving them criticism or or giving them feedback on what's really great um or identifying to them other things that are really cool and they say wow this guy really you know i i got a lot out of this conversation so you do that with like 300 people and those people matter right because they have themselves influence and trust so for example um you know uh like josh element is a good example this guy was he was early on at linkedin at facebook at twitter at robin hood uh like earlier sean meaning he was he was like head of growth at a bunch of these companies yeah yeah yeah he's a big deal he's been on our podcast and so he's got you know tremendous people have a tremendous amount of respect for him because he's had a tremendous career well both and i have you know on separate occasions met you know met with josh and we when we're talking about our startup and whether our startup succeeded or failed josh knows look you're playing in the sort of like the startup lottery startup olympics a startup can fail and an entrepreneur can still be really great and if out of that conversation josh josh walks away thinking oh this person's really smart and then they connect you to some other people that they they know and those people say wow josh thanks for the intro sean was really great you develop a reputation amongst people who have a reputation so that's the first step through real-life interactions you develop a reputation with people who already have a reputation so that they will retweet your stuff so that they will vouch for you when you have a project or you're doing something and that that goes a long way in the marketplace uh so like for example i've had josh or biology or different people who have their own big following and their own respect if they share me or they they they say this person's great then a whole bunch of other people just inherit that reputation they they say oh okay if josh says he's great he's great biology says he's great such a unique way of it's almost like credibility hacking or something like that but that's the thing i think is important is like i'm telling you how the mechanic works but there's the thing you can't just the reason it's not a hack is because your your thoughts actually have to be interesting you have to actually hack like you're you're a hack i just mean like you're you're you're the uh getting the desired the the process of getting to the desired outcome right the second thing is we both created content so now tweets are mostly making fun of people who create content and threads and teach courses but before that he was doing it himself right he was he himself was saying you know when you're building a social app blah blah or here's how we grew inside high schools for tbh and i why did i respect him because he released this this memo actually got leaked from inside facebook oh yeah yeah yeah and the memo basically said he was like hey guys at facebook here's some of the stuff we did to grow amongst teenagers and i know facebook wants to grow amongst teens here's some stuff we do tbh for example for every high school we would create an instagram account for branded to the high school so it'd be like you know mckinley high you know secrets and that's the instagram account and it would be locked and we would follow anybody who had mckinley high in their profile then they would follow it you know 40 of people would follow us back they would request to follow but we were private we wouldn't approve anybody's request then at 4 pm when everybody got out of school one day we would accept all the requests so everybody simultaneously would get a notification about our account so they would all go check it out and then they would all see the link to download the app and then they would download the app and then with and then as they were downloading that they'd get notifications that their friends are all downloading the app today and it felt like a big deal and that's how we hacked distribution into high schools i similarly have told actually a very similar story about how we would go get our goal was always to get half of a high school to download our app in one day we did it a completely different way but i've shared that on podcasts different places or on twitter threads and people read that and they're like oh [ __ ] this guy's smart that's a really smart growth tactic this guy really understands growth this guy really understands teens this guy really understands social and if so if you just if i like it's that uh quote my buddy jason hitchcock told me once he goes you say one interesting thing i say huh that's interesting you say two interesting things like ah those are interesting you say three interesting things i say [ __ ] this guy's interesting and uh that's really what you gotta do with content is you have to if you say three original interesting things around one topic whether it's bitcoin or media or robotics or whatever if i get three interesting things from you i'll in my brain i will assign that tag to you this guy's interesting worth watching and then if other people endorse it and say this is interesting it goes even faster so this is this is exciting to me i think this is a fire episode i'm not gonna i don't want to talk about it entirely right now because i think we should rap here but i so last weekend when you were sick so you probably didn't see this i tweeted out about sdrs so short-term rental stuff did you happen to see that i saw it and i followed what you were talking about look super interesting your facebook group i want to hear more about that uh so i'll save it for another app if you want we'll save it but did you join the group i didn't join the group at no i didn't know the names it's called sam's sdr's or something yeah i just made it in the car like my sarah was driving and i just made it in the car such a smart way to do things by the way like it's gonna sound super simple like i just made this thing because you were curious and wanted to learn about it right like you hadn't decided to do it yeah but it's well i have now but i'm still looking for property though but i um sam's str crew yeah i'll let you in and there's like a thousand or 1500 people it's mostly all tech guys dude i've met some guys did you get these people you tweeted it out just the tweet that's it only that it's all tech guys like it's that guy aj uh who owns uh the the pet business and then it's nathan barry it's marshall haas i there's there's guys in there that i've met guys that are like billionaires like who have sold or rather they've sold company for a billion dollars i met one guy who's making half a million a month in profit he's paying himself six million dollars a year off of his uh a handful of uh yeah there's another guy in there who owns 50 million dollars worth of them it's crazy i'm learning all this in this [ __ ] group it's amazing so you're gonna have to browse through that and i'll tell you some more we'll start with that one next time does that interest you dude of course it interests me yeah that's great it's crazy who would have thought about about short-term rentals and how they're crushing it it's the highest level of interest in me which is where you say what am i doing with my life why don't i do that all right you raise your question your own life is the highest form of interest the thing is the thing is is that like you you don't need to quote be doing it you just need to have done it and there is a world where you not quite set it and forget it but like you just like it's not like you need to do [ __ ] all the time to it right and so i would say like one of the criticisms not a criticism but the one uh my feedback for sean and how sean should like evolve maybe is to sometimes invest in some of these a little bit more boring stable things at least just a tiny portion of your of your money and like this is like a really interesting asset class have i told you about steady no this is sweet i think you'll like it so i i actually i think the website is cool steady i want to say it's deadly.capital or steadycapital.com one second let me pull it up if i just type in study okay do steady dot capital s-t-e-a-d-y how do most tell me what you see it says it's a black screen and it says how do most millionaires build their wealth 90 of millionaires invest in real estate study lets you earn passive income from real estate for 100 okay and you invest in okay so seti is a web dashboard for retail investors to buy shares of income generating commercial real estate commercial real estate make investments and senior financial reports in our dashboard and get monthly deposits from your investments directly to your bank account we do not offer high addressing this is the part i wanted you to read yes we do not offer hi this is this is really good copy we do not offer high adrenal investments we don't have an app designed to keep your eyes glued to your phone we pursue steady returns over hype we are the tortoise in a race full of hairs so beautiful so good so so i read this so this guy i used to play pick up basketball with her he was on my like intramural basketball team he that's got dylan he created this company i just kind of saw his twitter and i was like oh what's the guy dylan up to like and i didn't even know he's a startup guy like he's just a dude we used to play ball with and um has like steady capital what's that and i read this landing page i was like dude what is this i gotta invest literally so i invested in both his company as well as i started putting my money into steady this is why you invested in steady yeah cause i was like dude this this is what i want i was like i want to own i want to have real estate income coming in but i don't want to do the work of like going and finding a property diligencing it underwriting it taking out a loan for myself buying the property managing the property all that good stuff so what these guys do is they basically hand pick um sponsors so they'll have like um guys who have a good track record in commercial real estate commercials they'll be like oh this guy buys warehouses in the middle of texas and they basically diligence the properties for you and then all you do so what i do i just said auto invest so i just say five thousand dollars a month just as a starting point i was like i'm gonna give it five grand a month into commercial real estate cool over the this year i'll have 60 grand put into this and then it just shows me it's like cool you're gonna be you're gonna break even in 18 months but you're going to get your first check next month and the you know basically what they do is they go to that sponsor they say hey you know you're going to raise money for this deal anyways give us half a million bucks we have this cadre of investors we come in as one line item on your thing and we become an investor and then you just like we our investors want passive income through real estate investing and he's like he's trying to do like the robin hood model where it's like robin hood made it where there was no fee you could invest for a very small amount of money so it's like normally real estate has pretty high barriers to entry for knowledge as well as the amount of money you have to put in so his mission is like i want to make real estate as you know investable for even a hundred dollars and even a hundred dollars if you're earning eight percent you're great you'll earn eight dollars of passive income and it's gonna be big you think it looks cool i think it's a really hard business to do because you know you have to it's like a two-sided market you have to have really you know quality deals but honestly like these aren't like like for example with startup investing i don't just give my money to anybody for startup investing because i'm like dude are your deals any good or they all dog [ __ ] with real estate it's like these are like the property there's so much data about the property it's collateralized by the property the the guy's got a track record you're not looking for the next uber the thousand x return you're looking for something that's gonna generate eight to ten percent a year or eight to fifteen percent a year and um cool like that's doable that's not that doesn't take a miracle so i really like steady uh i think there's currently a waitlist or whatever people have to like dude i just signed up for it it looks sick oh yeah i'll email the guy to get you in if people want to do it they should do it i think it's real i think it's really good for people uh like i've had i've had multiple people asked invest in my startup fund and i just say no i'm like if you're not already wealthy don't do this because this don't use this as the way to get wealthy you have much smarter paths to get there if you already have if you're already you know a multi-millionaire cool i you should do this then to get some exposure to startups but i think for most people getting exposure to passive income real estate is a much better place to to build wealth if you're not already wealthy through your business or what yeah that's the this is a good episode i'm interested in city i have a whole bunch of other topics still so i'll save those for wednesday i appreciate you holding down the fort while i was uh it was hard it was hard i think like i had to do it with ben and ben's great and but i had then i did it with noah and noah's great but you and i are i mean you're talented which i talk about all the time you and i together are talented and it was very hard with it was way harder without it it was work i love to hear it i love to be needed it was work dude it was work and like i thought there's been times where i'm like oh [ __ ] i could just i could handle this it was work it was like i felt like i was working by the way if people haven't listened to the episode you did with ben on the silk road it's on our feed it's a special i think it's called special episode silk road i don't know what it's called go listen to that i listened to that while i was sick i [ __ ] loved it uh because i've been meaning to read american kingpin for so long you told me was so good and i'm just like [ __ ] up not reading it and uh so listening to that gave me my fix and it it's like you know the best kind of netflix shows where after it's done you then go down the rabbit hole and research more for like an hour on your phone in the middle of the night under the covers like that's what i was doing about so dude after that one i think we were prepared for 45 minutes it wasn't a lot but we were both so fascinated by that topic and i think you something happened where you weren't able to come and we found last minute and we're like let's just do this ben and so we're gonna do another one on uh a guy called i forget the there's another version there's another like juicy one but uh i just bought the book i'm gonna go read it and like do it that's those episodes were fun and ben's really good at that stuff yeah exactly and you guys play off each other really well the one thing i really wanted to know because while you're here i'll get you how did they catch him so you had said like basically they traced his uh you said okay he had he he had originally posted on this forum saying ah yes hey has anybody seen this thing and then also that um that they you know caught him in the library right down the street from you so i got those bits but i wanted to yeah i know it was him yeah and um yeah like i think there was a bunch of details about like the investigation like that the cop chase basically uh yeah so basically was there more there it was you know it's so funny there's this episode of south park where they're trying to like track this terrorist and the boys are like dude just like do a reverse google search and like like just use google and that's what they did and so the very first post ever about the silk road was written from a username and that same username posted a few weeks prior to stack overflow saying i'm building a website that is trying to do this yeah can you please email me ross albright gmail.com and then they like did they like used a web archive because once they once he once ross caught his air he changed his username from like altoid to like frosty or something like that but it was on the web where like he was asking he used a username to post about i've created a website or no sorry he created username it says has anyone heard about this new thing called silk road and that was the first time anyone ever mentioned it but just weeks prior that same username asked about like how to build an exchange or something like that and then they found out who this ross guy was and then they realized that um oh we just like went to this guy's house recently as homeland security because he ordered like 18 ids with his picture but for like different states with different names let's keep an eye on him and they found out basically was like all right whenever and so they had a fake fb they had an fbi guy become an employee of the silk road right and ross or dread pirate roberts the owner would say all right i gotta log off to go blank they noticed that ross would walk out of his house and go for a walk right like they they just tracked him or they're like all right i gotta go to dominican republic to do blank and they're like oh ross is in dominican republic on vacation according to his facebook right and so they knew the the fbi the day he was arrested he got arrested in the library right down the street from my house in glen park and they said basically the fbi was do not arrest them we got to get a swat team and they're like dog he's on his computer right now we're chatting with him and they like tackle them right like logged in this second we know we're having a conversation with them and so they had two fbi agents he was sitting at a chair uh in the science of this library that i used to go to he was sitting at a desk in a chair and they go they had two fbi agents dressed as kind of homeless people go right behind him and get into a fight where the guy was like [ __ ] what are you doing here and the lady was like [ __ ] you man you don't know like you know like they got like a domestic disturbance and so he turns his back and when he turns his back the other fbi agents one tackles him and the other one swipes his computer from his desk and runs it straight to the van and they plug it they already had they knew that he was using a pc they had the outlet right there they turned the video camera on and they start filming them they go look here's the [ __ ] he's on the dashboard right now as we speak here's us we're literally just talking to him and they plug a usb in and they like they get a lot of the stuff out before the computer goes to sleep and is locked and so that how is there no movie like i know there's like a kind of a shitty movie why isn't there an amazing movie about this there needs to be it's such a good story the the book american kingpin is the best book i've read in years and years is such a fascinating story and it's also as we said in the podcast it's incredibly challenging story for someone like me because this guy ross looks like me right like when you hear about gangsters and [ __ ] they're usually like poor often times minorities and like well that's like the other that person's not you know i i don't i don't relate to that person ross was uh from a good family a white guy a good looking dude who lived in san francisco played on computers had these ideals of like i want to help the world you're like oh he's just like me right but he's a [ __ ] criminal who tried to like supposedly wanted to kill people and sold more drugs than al capone and so it makes you question like what's right and what's wrong yeah dude it's so good go listen to the episode if you if you like that little bit but it was really good so that that definitely got me through one of the one of the coveted fever nights i mean i'm in i got my fever going i'm listening to the silk road i got all kinds of crazy ideas in my head it was awesome all right that's the episode oh um we have to do one thing before we before we go so we um two or three weeks four weeks ago at this point we did a contest on tick tock where we were gonna give five thousand dollars to at least one person who created videos about using our youtube videos and chopped them up and posted them on whatever platform and used our clips so the end result on tick tock alone are hashtags in like the first two weeks got something like 30 million views do you know that damn um and we're giving jonathan confirm in the chat are we giving it two to the people that i think it's the cartoon let me know but the first guy that we're yeah okay and it's the the first guy we're giving it to his name on tick tock i believe was mfm minis i think his name is michael and he posted a bunch of videos a few of them got more than a million views his msm cuts right i'm sorry is it oh yeah i can't get that wrong because there's an mfn minis as well jonathan tell me exactly who the winner is in the chat i can't get that wrong mfm cuts is the winner and this person got something like so mfm cuts that's the winner mfn cuts that's the winner this person got like 30 000 followers on their tick tock channel in like 10 or 15 days millions of views they won and then the second place person who also gets five thousand dollars i think they're called um toon pods is that what they're called say it again pod tune mr pod tune so they turned podcasts into cartoons like south park style we've retweeted a couple of them because they're awesome and they are hilarious they are really good so the best one was where i was making fun of you for not wearing a shirt hilarious really good i have a feeling both of these guys are gonna end up making a lot of money by uh turning this into a business and i bet they already have yeah exactly um good job good job by them by the way mfm cuts the guy he is in university still when i emailed them he's 19. i love it uh good job by them and so can are is this still going can people still end like win next month a different like a different person could win or no yeah we're gonna keep doing it we gotta wait i gotta wait till jonathan tells me we're allowed to announce it but we are going to continue doing it because we saw uh in december our podcast basically in november we were like just shy of a million in december we basically skipped over a million and went straight to two million and i think that that tick tock thing was one of the reasons why it happened one of a couple reasons yeah and did we do this other winner two the 60 minute thing we'll announce that next time okay sounds good uh all right i gotta go good stuff good seeing you again all right i'll touch that episode [Music] you

uh so last year we had our highest day black friday was our highest day almost two million dollars in that one day [Music] are we ready to roll can we roll bro you got to take that hat off though i can't see you all right i was just trying to i wanted to wear a costume of swords like a little bit more spicy you're good like that i couldn't see your eyes do you um i uh do you have an ice bath yeah i have a cold have you not driven in our cold tub so is it called cold plunge yeah the cold plunger i have one too and what is your opinion of it so far i like it i like it i use it about twice a week i use it monday morning for coffee it's basically my wake up thing and then i'll use it wednesdays after a workout uh what's interesting though there's a book i think called endurance yeah i love that and they basically love that book there's a book and i think what they said was that scientifically it doesn't do anything yes and so that's why i have like a problem with cold plunge which is the actual product is amazing like if you want to be cold that it's a good one it stays like 39 degrees all the time but it doesn't i'm almost certain that it doesn't do anything and some people say it impacts your brain if it does anything but like there's still even conflicting research on that i think the big thing that i like about it is that it makes me feel tough yeah it makes me feel good it makes me feel good about myself i'm like noah you're not tough man you're weak and i don't know i don't really have that self-talk in my head but i go into this thing and i was like do 10 and then when i'm about to get to 10 i'm like you could do 15. and then i just feel proud about how long you sit and then i get out and i'm like um it varies maybe like a minute two minutes dude i did five minutes at 39 degrees and it was incredibly painful that's what it said online to do so i did it and i was just like i was legitimately in pain like uh like like more pain than i've ever felt just through exercise how did you feel about yourself i felt tough i felt i felt tough yeah so like i understand why it works but i'm still looking for like peer-reviewed research that shows that it works and i've not found it and so that's why i was asking how you thought about your cold plunge because i heard you had the same way i got to jump in here because i'm i'm a cold plunge spokesman they're the one sponsor for my podcast so i gotta oh wow for their honor here so the thing is dude i'm telling you the cold punch products we're both supporting it i have it too but here's the thing here's where you're wrong though the the thing that you're right about is there's no research that shows that it is good for recovery and that's what everyone says they use it for it's recovery and it's just like not accurate that it's it's actually better to use heat therapy for recovery than cold but like some of the brain stuff there is like more uh research there as well as like um some of the other benefits around um like uh mood and um like have you heard of this brown fat cell storage stuff like that yeah but it yeah i hear you i think it kind of works i'm still i still need to be convinced i it's like it's like a workout the way to think about it is like it's a workout for your nervous system like it improves a lot of stuff that way but it's just not good for recovery i guess i would actually pitch the opposite sam and ben where lately i've been really into baths that's just like been my go-to so like i have i throw i got these bath bombs got a little cbd in it i'll light a candle and then i'll either put on a podcast or i'll read but that lately i mean men especially men because women have gotten they knew about this they just didn't want to tell us uh but like i literally just came from a pedicure if men are not pampering themselves look if you're working hard i'm saying if you're like putting in the work you're working out you're doing stuff at the job like take a little time for that r r man go jump into the pack about it not relaxing at all for me like i don't want someone digging into my nails gross can you see that red white oh my god i did the i did the american flag that's awesome i don't know it's honestly it's fun we're living once on this planet have a good time all right let's talk about um you came on last time i personally thought the episode was only going to do okay i'm telling you i got tons of people that dm'd me ben says that people thought it was pretty good i thought people thought it was great but for this one awesome you have a list of one two like eight eight bullet points but there's a ton of ideas here um oh and we and also people criticized me because i didn't introduce you so this is noah kagan noah runs this company he founded it and is now the ceo of appsumo it's like groupon for nerds it's quite large i think last time you said 80ish million in revenue uh mitchell just said you guys now have 165 employees that's amazing and you also do a uh content so you you have a sick blog called ok dork which i've read for like 10 years and you have your youtube which now has 250 000 subscribers i think right almost 300 000 man it's it's unbelievable youtube.com it's unbelievable that's sick uh and i remember you doing it years ago just like on your phone it was kind of lame it wasn't lame it was just like you weren't trying and then like you started trying two years ago i think right yeah that was it was an interesting journey when covet hit two years ago i was just shirtless at home with my iphone and i was like i just felt good about what was going on and i felt like i could help and so i just started recording on my phone and uploading it and so you know and all the people that are listening to your show i want to start businesses it's like just do now not how you know something mitchell i talk about which is just get going so i just uploaded that and from there now there's a team of i don't know maybe six people will spend about half a million dollars on just the team this year and you know from just me doing shirtless uh in my house talking about how to get your business going your confidence but uh the and so the reason why you're able to spend while you're able to lose money is because you are you somehow it drives traffic and awareness to appsumo which is like your main thing but does the ad does the adsense or the youtube ad at all cover the cost actually it just started so what was fascinating and by the way a lot of people know me because i worked at facebook i worked at mint.com um so that's a little bit of people heard about me so this year let me just pull up our stats right now so the first last year we spent i mean i think around 400k uh i can look how much we made so just getting it going really just getting it's an investment it's like a lot of these things fortunately we had appsumo as our our bankroller last year on adsense we made 121 thousand dollars to 840 year one in our year first hardcore year of having a team around good that's really good it's surprising this year is actually but here's the thing this is going to blow your mind and i think this is a really kind of good good lesson for business we put out 800 and i think 449 videos three of them basically generated all this money which ones isn't that kind of crazy one that's sad either a we suck at making videos or b you know a lot of businesses you keep going keep going keep going keep going aren't all the channels like this though i think it's a lot of business like a power law distribution it's like a few things do a lot of the significance so the three videos that made all of the money the first one was i went and knocked on doors in austin we just released millionaires we just released it but that came out towards the end of the year uh and drove a lot of our money uh asking crypto millionaires how to invest 5000 bucks and then asking nft millionaires how to invest a thousand more or less those three videos uh made us the year but and that was after a hundred and almost 50 videos that's crazy do you um do you so do you think you're all surpassed your 500 you think you'll break even on adsense this year yeah our goal is not that our goal is around a subscriber growth but this year i think we'll lose budget wise it looks like we'll lose around 200 000 just depends how ads do but i'm basically not not really optimizing around that that's crazy i uh i did a call with this lady who has a bunch of youtube channels and she was telling me it's um her and a six-person team i can't say her name but she said that they're doing a million dollars a month in profit from youtube just youtube yeah it's crazy just youtube are you guys i think the thing with youtube youtube is slept on same i mean tick tock is another one it's a different type of audience but you guys have upped your your youtube game yourselves i feel like almost every business out there or if you are broke and you are in any country in the world and you have nothing to do this is the easiest freeze business anyone can so i just signed up to monthly.com has this course with casey neistat uh did you see that so casey neistat has a course where every day he gives you a lesson on youtube videos and i bought it for like 300 and i'm loving it it is really really cool what if what are some of the takeaways well so it's only three days in and so but like in the first or second lesson he just walked around his office he goes i'm gonna show you how i find cool stories and he's just walking around and he goes oh that's a cool idea you guys hear that beeping that's a truck backing up and that ruins like it makes it really hard for me to record throughout the day i'm just going to make a video on that or he'll walk by a guy selling fake louis vuitton purses and he goes oh that's a cool idea let's create a video on how to buy a fake purse in new york city and so he's just like walking down the street coming up with ideas and you're like look i'm gonna create these are just small silly ideas but i'm gonna execute them really well so in the next series he's gonna show us how he's actually gonna execute these small ideas that is awesome kind of cool right i love that you're still learning well no i mean i i think people assume that once you get to certain sizes like you i would assume you don't but i love that you're still curious and you're exploring how to improve your craft yeah well i don't know anything about video i've been making videos for my own youtube just for fun but i'm trying to learn um so anyway it's a cool cur it's a cool course it was only like three hundred dollars yeah i mean it is kind of crazy when you think about the things we spend on and the potential value upside you can get out of it like the downside you lost 300 the upside i mean how much does this make you or you know also from an enjoyment level and i was like i can use the stuff that i'm learning just in the podcast i think how much like what have you noticed or observed in your own youtube channel i know from my first million you definitely you guys have been looking to grow it seems like a few things are i think what i've learned is that like things that like don't seem like big ideas but that can be kind of boring uh can do really well so for example i bought the house the lot next to me and i just like film a video i'm like here's just here's a video of the house and i'm just walking around my iphone here's why i think it's it could be a good investment here's why it might be a bad investment and i just posted that on my personal channel and i didn't have any subscribers oh i sent you that video uh and it uh it got like three four five thousand views but like a lot of comments and i was just amazed that people cared it was my first video i was amazed that people care about little things that are small that are part of your daily life that you don't really think about and so i think what i'm learning with casey when i'm learning with my stuff is that small stuff that you think about throughout the day more likely than not a lot of other people think about that and they'll find it interesting enough to to watch you know what i mean yeah yeah i've always i always think about that with restaurants where they sell their cookbooks like people want to see what happens in the kitchen and you'll be surprised what people want to yeah so anyway it's a cool course uh you want to talk about mud water i do in a second one other thing i'm curious is what have you noticed because i think i don't know this one cares about as well what have you noticed about the youtube channel versus your tik tok channel in terms of the audience and the growth and the oh so let me tell you about the tick tock thing so i have a tick tock but i don't actually like post on it i mean i did once or twice but like it has no views so we did this thing i was texting you about this we did this thing where on the podcast like three weeks ago we said we're gonna give five thousand dollars to maybe at least one up to three people and it's gonna be a combination of if we like your videos and how many views they have and we told people to go to our youtube chop up the videos and post it so far the hashtag that we asked people to use has gotten 30 million views in three weeks yeah 30 million views sounds too easy go on so these kids it's mostly like these like 19 to 20 year olds like one kid in college at michigan he um he's one of the guys i just started talking to him and they create he created a handle called like mfm minis and he started posting our videos and he like would animate them and he has gotten multiple videos over a million views and you know fat fire yeah i made a podcast where i talked about how much i love fat fire the subreddit which i found through you and he uh made a video about that and it got so many views that fat fire made an announcement on their subreddit that said we've been overwhelmed with new applicants or new subreddit people and we got 30 000 people in one day all from the tick tock video where where me sam parr is talking about fat fire all right that's wild man so do you think most people business used to try to do this tick tock stuff no i don't i not most but definitely some right now of everything that i've seen it's the fastest way to grow an audience for sure without a doubt yeah i guess i've always i've been hesitant because the quality of the audience in terms of engagement yeah well it's not even just the young right the young is the future to some extent but it's like youtube i feel like the quality of the people that are like really into it and they're available during your newsletter they want to comment and i feel like dog is just kind of consumption i think that youtube is much higher quality i i think podcasts like for a long time even though we like my whole life was podcasting i was like i would [ __ ] on it i'm like this is not that cool and uh now i've changed because i'll see i get recognized now like three or four times a week and it's because they like listen to my voice for 45 minutes they like think that they know you and so they built they people get kind of intimate with you so it's do you get recognized from youtube i got recognized uh yeah it was cool yeah sometimes i love it man i mean the whole part of the journey is that like uh i would this weekend i went to a squash tournament the houston squash was hilarious and uh it was because this guy watches he knows appsumo.com he's watched some of the videos and and i was i was during the pedicure day was one of the guys from our company and i was like man that's why i do social media to some extent like it really provides a cool magnet and window i don't know if the window but a way to just like connect with really interesting people yeah i think it's awesome like even if it's that not money like it's a great thing yeah i think it's badass so i'm going to continue to do it can i um so basically noah has the sheet that he sent me and it's got a list of a ton of things can i just read off and ask questions i actually want to ask you about chrome extensions because they're like i'm like nerding out on chrome extensions right now have you ever even made one i've bought one so we have one right you have one so on here so i tweeted out so this is a mutual friend of ours by the way but i can't say who it is they were considering buying a company and it was a chrome extension and it was two people who were doing 25 million dollars a year in sales with their chrome extension um it's pretty crazy and then grammarly you know grammarly yeah grammarly i think is like a 20 billion dollar company at this point graham really does like 800 million in revenue that is what i like these sleeper ones that people kind of just like don't know dude grammarly is the best man it's started by this guy named max who's i think he's from like the ukraine and he's a lives in canada and he's a he's a hardcore engineer and i asked him at hustlecon in the backstage like that that they had they bootstrapped it and they raised their funding uh they raised a hundred million dollars at a billion dollar valuation and i was with them backstage and i was like dude that's amazing so you're like almost a billionaire now he goes yeah it's pretty cool like the business is way bigger than than no and he like he like smirked but he was real low-key he's like yeah it's cool the business is way bigger than most people realize like it's going to be huge uh and it was awesome so grammarly is a good business what what's your chrome extension leo.io so it's kind of similar to that momentum one which i think is pretty popular it's the main one when you open up a tab it has like a nice background i think taking a step back on these chrome extensions i think what's interesting um about your tweet which was like this chrome sensor make 25 million or these is what are things that not everyone else is paying attention to that you can acquire for not a market rate like i think ultimately that's how you can have a lot of success in business but that's specifically for for marketing a lot of what i look for um so when we launched sumo.com i actually bought probably about five million installs i think give or take 500 installs of wordpress plugins so i bought like some of the most popular wordpress plugins around oh wait which ones uh i mean i have to pull up our list now but the biggest one was google analytics so it was like a million person yeah so is google analyticator uh we bought wp fonts we bought a construction page so basically would i use wp fonts i used a bunch of those yeah so we scraped the the thing that it's not just copying this because now people are more aware of it but what you're looking for is like one can you get structured data so we went to the wordpress directory and you could get all their rankings so i got all the rankings and then i sorted it by ones that were not updated recently so i said which ones had the most installs that no one's taken care of and i would just email them and say hey you haven't taken care of it i'll pay you for it and because there's not a market for it you can get a cheaper price and then i just sent a blast email to a lot of these people and picked up millions of installs and that drove a significant amount of zuma.com did you even pay more than six figures for any of them for the google analytics one they had a million souls i paid 100k wow that's crazy isn't it that was the most expensive one i i could pull up my price could that could that google so for the people are sending wordpress if you don't use word i mean wordpress is used by like three-fourths of the internet or half half of like the top 10 000 websites and they have this like crazy database of all types of apps that you could plug user or plug-ins it's amazing and sumo was a email capture plug-in yeah i found our list we had a lot of i bought all-in-one favicon just a bunch of random ones um and then we would rebrand them and then cross promo to sumo.com within wordpress um and i was thinking i would do the same and the thing was is there there's not like um these websites where people are buying and selling them and a lot of these guys weren't monetizing it was just hobbies and so i think in marketing and business you got to look for something that's a problem that other people haven't identified and that's also why i bought the chrome extension i bought it for i think 20 i bought it for 25 000 for 40 000 installs uh active installs on chrome but with that one we could not monetize it at all we tried like paid features we tried ads to it we tried to grow it uh and we were not as successful so i pretty much lost almost all the money on that one how much what's the cpm on ads for chrome plugin do you know i don't remember what it was but it was abysmal and it wasn't something that we were able to grow dramatically like i thought we could like the wordpress stuff was really cheap like we were getting that stuff super cheap back that's crazy there's this guy like i think there's this guy who i bet you know who you definitely know i think his name's what's his name syed uh his last name starts with the b and he owns this thing called awesome what's it called it's called awesome corp or something he owns wp beginner he's like the wordpress underground mafia he owns a lot of wordpress blogs let me explain the story the story that i know it as so basically he's only he's young he's i think he's from pakistan and he's only like 28 or something or 29 and he started this thing called wp beginner which is a wordpress a site on wordpress so if you like how to install blank on wordpress he'll show up number one it gets like five or ten million uniques a month a ton a ton of uniques a month and using his blogs he would see which plugins would get the most install so he would say like here are all the best like uh forms for wordpress or here's all the best like font plugins for wordpress and he would just see which are the best he would buy the best ones and then just promote him extra hard on wp beginner and at this point i bet you he makes 50 million dollars a year in all of his wordpress stuff i wouldn't be surprised i mean i love these industries that like everyone's sleeping on like i think the that wordpress stuff is really interesting it probably is still a decent category what's fascinating though is the other side of the sam so i actually try to do the same strategy in shopify apps so i went over to shopify and we were launching sumo.com on shopify and i was like man i'll just go buy all these people over there uh what was interesting was that a lot of the people on shopify were a little bit more savvy and they had recurring revenue so they were like we want 10x the price where like 10x price of their revenue where the wordpress plugins they weren't really making money so i was like hey i'll pay one cent for every active install you have so i was getting them for very very cheap but the shopify ones like i couldn't i literally couldn't buy almost our friend andrew wilkinson bought a couple of them and he rolled them up and eventually took it public and it currently it's in it's public on the canadian stock exchange right now probably for 600 million dollar market cap it's called we commerce and they do like i think 30 million dollars a year in revenue just off shopify apps the shopify ecosystem was interesting i mean it's interesting if you can create something really easily and other people can copy you really easily um and then you don't control the payments it was a whole wild experience in there because shopify controls all the money you don't you have to wait for your your grandpa to give you your nickels uh and they control the whole the whole thing so we were like let's get the hell out of this world but yeah we commerce looks like uh 535 canadian which is what like 100 million americans no not that bad yeah like what's the conversion of monopoly money to usd no i think it's i think it's almost one-to-one um what uh so are you bullish you're into chrome [ __ ] chrome plugins i've pulled no i'm not as excited about that i think what's what's interesting is like what are the areas that are either super early on uh that like savvy people haven't gotten into so like for example one of the older stories for me was facebook news feed ads so look for these ad channels or places that not a lot of people are like kind of all paying attention to when newsfeed came out no one was doing it and we went bonkers on it and that was a huge driver at appsumo for a lot of our growth because it was just so much cheaper because not everyone if you're paying if you're playing in the market you're going to pay market rate and that's not how you're going to what did you use to get clicks for on facebook oh man let me pull it up pennies or um yeah i mean i wouldn't say it's pennies but it's definitely like dollar email subscribers and then like low 10 figures for paying customers and now i think appsumo would have to pull up our dashboard but i mean i think we're paying like 60 dollars for a paying customer now it's so expensive when we start so we got to like 200 000 subscribers just through blogging and then we started doing paid marketing and i think we paid a dollar fifty uh when we sold it might have been like four dollars and if i had a guess now i wouldn't be surprised if it's six dollars to eight dollars yeah i still think there's opportunity i mean the opportunities are always there it's just like you have to be creative you have to look so like for me i was thinking about this recently like if i was trying to grow a newsletter um i probably would go try to sponsor like super micro people on tick tock and youtube like these guys that are guys and girls that are like sub 10 000 subs like like if your your channel has like 966 subscribers like you'd be a perfect person because you have like an engaged audience you're super smaller you don't know how much money you're supposed to be making and the fact that i'm giving you attention um it's kind of like what i did at mint.com we've done this with appsumo mitchell on our team is doing it with appsumo currently i think that's still a really affordable way let me ask you a creative way to get a lot of let me ask you about mit so min you were like the one of the first hires there right yes number four and min eventually at the time it sold for like 120 million dollars or 200 million dollars something like that right yeah one second and at the time that was considered massive it's still a lot of money but like particularly then it was like it might as well have been a billion and i loved mint it sucks now though like i don't like man totally why what would you do differently if you were running the show now oh wow i mean aaron was running the show to be clear and he was really impressive i got to give him props when he started it and i want to talk about this because i think your audience i don't know i've been thinking about this a lot i think it resonates with your audience aaron worked alone in his room by himself for six months building a prototype and then came out and convinced the world to come check out this product and i just have a lot of admiration and respect for people like him like we have an intern george he's living in my i met him he works didn't he yeah he's working from miami or sorry from hawaii to live in he was living in another room his his desk was an amazon box right now his desk is my washer and dryer that's awesome right and he's like i mean the point is i think with aaron patzer as well as you know these people as well as myself i was living on floors look at my aunt's basement there's something to be said for like the sacrifice and the the dream and i have a lot of respect for aaron and george and you know even back in the day with where i was at uh getting all this stuff started uh with mint i think i mean look at how big some of these these finance look at plaid right so we used another company before plaid was ever a thing and platt is now 10 billion i think some of the stupidest companies that are big that i i don't get is like brex or ramp they're like credit card branded companies they're like 10 billion dollars why don't you understand that it's pretty simple they just convince you to sign up for their credit card and they split the one percent fee with mastercard on all your spending i know but the fact that that's a 10 billion dollar industry i mean it just kind of it doesn't seem like there's a lot of value add but it's almost similar to the mint thing which is they took a product that existed which was this bank information and they they printed it up um so i think mint could have been a much larger role the vcs were definitely disappointed when mint sold out um i thought mint was gonna sell for that price that's why i left early why why did you think it was gonna sell for that price um i thought the vision for it's always interesting to think about people's visions like mark's vision at facebook was always this big and it's interesting to see different people and like how big they're thinking and aaron thought big but it was like hey we're gonna sell credit cards and we're gonna sell people turbo tax and i was like okay this at best scenario is gonna sell for half a billion just in terms of how big that company could actually be and i just did the math to think about well i own one percent so max i'll get five million dollars pre-tax which post tax means i'll get two million and i was like i think you know in in four years do i do i think i can generate two million dollars for myself and so i was willing to take that bet did uh that's that's kind of interesting because i don't i don't think that i think that big i mean i would say like most people would think one 500 million is a pretty big exit what would what would he have done differently to think bigger i mean what would a bigger example be and so let me let me be clear i don't care like i don't care what people's visions are per se and everyone should have whatever dream they want like if your dream is to make 5 000 a month or 500 a month or i'm not hating on anybody's dream um it was just i think there's look at how many how big fintech space is today right like plat alone just almost got bought by visa for seven billion uh you have robin hood which is whatever 15 billion so what mint did which was really interesting was it acquired a lot of customers really cheap i think if they didn't sell out to intuit as early there would have been a lot of different avenues that they could have parlayed uh this audience of young people who are interested in personal finance into a lot of different avenues um at the same time though dude if someone came to you and you're you know you did take that you did take it which is a good thing too like was he wealthy you can make no how old was he i mean he was definitely educated but he had a chance to cash out i think he cashed out 30 to 50 million bucks and i also i think he like moved to some like remote area new zealand and he's just living there now yeah well he started like a ambulance company like a software for ambulances or something like that but like aaron he's a creative guy he actually tried to start a uh a sky subway system that's crazy so like in cities like in austin instead of like having an underground subway it would be an air-based subway oh yeah he's just crazy creative like but look i think everyone's got to figure out what it is they want their own life to be like there's no bad or we're selling out stuff uh i guess lately i've been just thinking about like with this one period of time we have here on earth like how interesting do we each want to make it yes but i will to play devil's advocate it's also how hard do you want to grind so like do you want to like because i think that in order to make in order to make cool [ __ ] i can't decide how i feel at the moment actually for the longest time i was like dude in order to make something huge and something amazing you gotta just lock yourself in a room for like three years like you just have to grind now my thinking is i think you actually only need to do that early on and then you can somewhat let up so where's your opinion on that do you have to grind like all the time in order to make something happen or do you think that you can you could have a little bit more balance because if you have to grind all the time that's just exhausting i only have that so many times in my life yeah i mean i don't know i guess i'm just trying to think of different examples like for me if you would have told me when i started out sumo like hey no you'll be a millionaire but it's going to take 10 years i probably wouldn't have started sure and most of the people that i've seen like one of my buddies is now making eight figures as an investor um it took him probably about 10 to 15 years to get to that place and so the reality i was thinking about today like there's one of our guys who i we got pedicures today he's on the sales team and i was like look you can be as big of a life in a career as you want it to be it's just like what path do you want to take that on and are you willing to to put in the work but i honestly i think i kind of think the opposite sam i don't i think of like what i'm doing with appsumo on youtube it doesn't feel like a grind like i'm actually like your podcast what you're doing now does this feel like a grind most of the time no but it doesn't feel great all the time like some days i'm like oh i don't feel like being happy like i'm in a pit like here's an example shawn my co-host who's out with kovid he's late every single time he's five minutes late every single time every once in a while it'll put me in such a bad mood that i don't want to record and on those days i'm like i [ __ ] hate this i don't want to do this i gotta like snap out of this mood and be in a good so anyway it's not always fun i i mean i think about my buddy adam gilbert it's like the times that you don't want to show up is when it counts like i think about that a lot of times when i'm like it's the things you're doing when no one else is watching that matters and that's like going to the gym when no one wants to do it or like last night at 7 30 i didn't feel like doing a podcast um but i'm you know it was like okay it needed to get done and i think that you know that'll help you separate whether you want to get some of the things in life you want or not like are you willing to sacrifice and for how long and i think that i don't know i was thinking about this equation like i wonder if there's a time time sacrifice equal success equation plus a little bit of unhappiness and if you could do that for some period of time you'll get success i think um it's it's the way that i the question i ask myself is what am i willing to pay in order to achieve blank so like to me that that's like what am i what i'm what's what price am i going to pay in order to get to to this particular goal and i ask myself am i willing to pay that price and sometimes i am sometimes i'm not so like at the current at my current stage in life it's do i want to grind for a long time on a software company in order to achieve x amount of money and i'm like no i don't want to pay that price at the moment maybe like in the future i would and for sure when i was younger i would but not at the current point in my life i think with all this stuff it's better to be not to be naive and just get going well just find the things that you're curious about like if it's you know you your your audio editor benji and be like look i like making these audio shows i'm just gonna go for it or lately you know like i've been really enjoying appsumo work um or doing the youtube stuff and it's better to just not almost not think about it because i think you'll psych yourself out like one of the stories we were talking about on the sheet was like this mudwater guy yeah what and this guy just had like a dude this is a crazy yeah i mean it's just it's basically indian chai tea you ever heard of indian chai dude it's delicious i love it yeah you have a really good video i watched the video of you testing it out and i bought it because of that oh oh yeah cool and um i wasn't sponsored it wasn't affiliated or anything it was just this guy with one product which i always find really fascinating i think a lot of us get so excited to have like 18 business ideas but apple uh a lot of other people uh are making a significant money just with one thing and so he was having it i think he was at an agency just a regular day job and i think everyone should get a day job or get some basic income uh and then he i think what's fascinating was what's a problem you have and what's a big ass category and like coffee is one of the biggest categories in the world and so i love that he kind of said all right what's the angle against them and he created his own version literally i think buying products off amazon and just mixing himself together how's it going he's not like some coffee what's that i think he's i mean last we heard it was a 60 million revenue which revenue is always different than profit as i'm sure you you know uh but it's just fascinating that he found one product line and did great branding and just really went hard on 60 million is so much money it makes 60 it does 60 million in sales that's crazy i wouldn't be surprised if it's more i think what you know when you're thinking about business ideas number one what's problems that we have ourselves that's always just like the easiest way that i try to solve it for me like one problem i had recently it was like i'm trying to be a doomsday prepper same and i want like a doomsday i want a doomsday prepper in a box like i just do bro we had a total episode on that clearly you read tucker max's article we had a talk i did see his i had to see his article this is this is a little bit before because we had our snowpocalypse same and i'm looking at generators already because i know it's i'm afraid it's like yeah i just got mine uh did how much did you spend like a thousand dollar generator it was a thousand i'm thinking about getting two dude those generators are not that strong they only charge like four things like they can only be used on like four things at a time i'm just gonna basically have a generator to a tent and then when the doomsday comes just like come knock on my tent door dude i would love a doomsday in a box i'm so on board the problem is is that a lot of the doomsday stuff they assume that you live in like the country and i'm like no i need like the urban version of this so like tell me like how do i store water how do i uh like like should i have a gun or should i not have a gun what type of generator what do you use the generator for all that type of stuff yeah i mean i think coming back to what we're talking about it's like with mud water and you know business ideas it's just like one just go to the things that you need help with right and then just start thinking all right well how you know how do i do that today right so you if for this doomsday idea i'd go hit up you i'd hit up neville i'd hit other friends in austin and say hey i'm starting to put together a thing do you want something like this and see if i can get anyone to buy into it before i start and then from there if that works then maybe launch a shopify site uh or just start doing youtube content around that yeah you just wire cutter for the end of the world honestly that it's a huge category especially like nowadays like all the stores are out i think people are a little bit more aware that that can happen we have this friend named ryan dice and ryan dice started digital marketer which is like a pretty sizable business that does all types of stuff and he owned a conference that he sold for a lot of money but pre-pandemic like two years before the pandemic he owned a website called like survival something oh yeah it was i forget what it was called and had he who would have known but had he held on to it towards like covet times it would have been sold for so much more because now it's so much more popular but he had this website and it it talked all about uh like article it was basically articles and affiliates on like which flashlight to buy like for the end of the world and i'm almost positive that he sold it for around the eight figure range that's remember that site what was it called i guess i don't remember the exact thing survival or something so i remember seeing it i'm like oh that's shady me too i thought it was just it wasn't how i won it yeah it wasn't shady it was just i didn't understand it i think sometimes i'll dismiss people or dismiss businesses about that but i think coming back to like business ideas and like one-person businesses like i was thinking about the crypto space as well and or just all this stuff if like you don't have money and you can't buy it you can always just document it just go review it like you said it's like your idea be the wire cutter of these different categories be the tick talker or youtube or whatever that is what's the best selling product ever for appsumo oh on the digital side dude i'll also tell you another business idea i would love for someone to start um i'm going to pull up our forever list hold on i'm literally just i'm pulling up our back end the top product of all time and this is a shocker probably five yes or stickers okay ben do you have a thought i have no guess no nothing maybe fine let me see something involved with photos photos or fonts maybe there it is so our top sell ever uh so last year we had our highest day black friday was our highest day almost two million dollars in that one day on black friday which we paid out half of that uh at least half of that to creators which is [ __ ] wild um the top product oh this is interesting top product was a video editor so a lot of video content so if you want to get a video editing the second one was photos what i'm just looking at what are some other interesting trends like oh wow have you guys do you ever invest in companies just because you're able to look at the appsumo stats so that's something we've gone back and forth here's another well taking a step back i know a lot of your people want you know to make their first million and beyond here's another product category tools for agencies but if you think about what that really is so i can't say the product because it's his private numbers but basically stuff to help agencies manage their project management um but the real thing well one of the things about what's a tangential bit what's another example that you so like um so like like basically asana for agencies yeah like click up like something like a click up like a click alternative we have a lot of that on up soon but anyways the point that's interesting about that is and this is this actually surprised me when i came back to work at appsumo was what are things that you can sell to help people make money well our friend neville uh has says a slightly different he says well because neville has a course and he's like well i sell this course and people like it but like really what i'm learning is like when someone gives me money for a course i'm just putting them to work and if you really wanted to make a lot of money i would just do the work for them and charge them [Music] and that's how we explained it which is similar but uh so what are some of the other top ones on appsumo yeah i'm looking them up so dude the so one photos stock photos is a sleeper i i'm shocked at how many people want like stock audio stock photos stock video secondly is video editing which if you're not technical that's probably harder to do this is this is the area that like this blew up a lot last year and it's still going which is all this gpt 3 auto content stuff so auto ads auto writing um so like copy dot ai alternative i'm an investor so we promoted writer happyscribe um i'm looking up the other major ones around that those are just some of the ones that i'm just like shocked at how well they've done but i mean i think cool part about sumo and like people check it out is like there's a lot of new products that you honestly can just check out what's getting popular and then make some type of alternative or make training around those types would you ever invest in stuff based off the appsumo data oh um you know i've actually invested differently so we've talked about this over the 11 years of the company like hey they're doing well instead of us taking a split of the sales what if we took equity instead um and i would have liked i mean dude think about this we've promoted hoppin they're eight billion dollars we promoted udemy mixpanel optimizely mailchimp fresh i mean if we took some splits it would have uh be a different trajectory for our company but it's just not something we've done uh i do it differently i invest in the companies uh that we use in our company sure like uh so like uh like what atlassian i went and invested so when we were building shopify apps five years ago i was like i don't know if our shopify apps are gonna work but i'll put ten thousand dollars in shopify stock when it just started so if our apps suck i think the shopify thing will probably work and that shopify stock now is like 60k um but atlassian hubspot i bought a lot of hubspot stock once we started transitioning a lot of our team to hubspot but i think what i just think about is like where do i have an advantage or understanding that other people may not yeah i how many products have you guys promoted on appsumo like hundreds or thousands thousands i mean we've been 11 years i think right now on appsumo we have 11 000 products um yeah it's definitely gone a little wild uh has become a software marketplace that's crazy but uh 10 493 products so when we um like years ago or a couple years ago we had zoom was one of our advertisers and this was before they went public and the ad crushed it it was so good and we were like damn dude people love this product they love zoom and we ended up buying stock right before or right at ipo and it like knocked it out the park i think there is like interesting stuff where you can where you can see like in you you can see interesting information because you're like wpbeginner because you're like appsumo because you're like the hustle and you can see inside of the stuff yeah it's like and for everyone out there it's like where do you have an advantage like where's maybe you're in discord all day so you know what the nfts are going to be popping maybe it's going to be out there on twitter world so you know like the different stocks or different people that are talking about different things i think just finding some advantage or like area that you can get uh you know an unfair competitive advantage what other ideas interest you i'm trying to think about just like uh the stuff lately i mean that's interesting is basically like three or four areas one i mean i still think software is gigantic what specifically there's just so many what specifically um i mean for me content creation is definitely the area that i've spent a lot of time in so like i would love software on like how do you figure out which topics are gonna be popular like we spend i don't know how many people hours probably like 10 hours a week just to figure out which video to make each week and so there's got to be a more uh optimized way to do that i think with appsumo it's the same kind of idea like we have a team of i think around four people that full-time just try software all across the internet what their only job yeah they're they're called like ldrs like i don't even know what their titles are anymore they don't tell me uh but their little job is like go to product hunt go to google go to twitter go to all these like beta lists go to all these different sites try the different software all across the internet and then see which ones are worthy to get you know blasted on appsumo.com and so that that feels like that should actually be a software solution so i think a lot of it is just like what are the things we're doing manually that we could automate so for me topics is big finding products for appsumo is big um i'm super excited about you know i think a lot of people are crypto space so uh one of the things i'm looking for is like how do you scrape twitter and reddit and find the new next thing before everyone else so kind of like a google trends or like a discovery thing for these crypto nfts how do you do that now i don't got it i mean it's just too hard manually right now what i do is that i text my friend who basically just spends 16 hours a day doing nfts i'm like which one are you buying so like a few days ago i bought a hippo that'll work did i tell you about i bought i bought a five thousand dollar was it how much was it i spent on that i think i said no it's only almost two thousand dollar hippo but it's part of a casino so if you as the casino makes money if you own one of the nfts you get a cut of the casino rake so sean it feels like a scam john created an email list the other day and he called it the milk road and i don't know i don't know if it's daily or if it's weekly but sarah's been getting it and loves it and it's all about crypto and he tries to talk about like the latest and greatest from a trustworthy point of view and it's it's pretty great the milk road is awesome that's a great idea the milk road what is he recommending i haven't read it yet because i don't like crypto but sarah's been reading it and like he'll just say like people are tweeting out like so the weird thing about crypto and nfts is like it's on twitter it's like in uh groups that like you have to be like on the inside to know what's legit and so there's like these like stupid discourse groups dis uh discord groups and uh like these weird tweet twitter folks where you gotta like know who to follow and he'll be like blank is tweeting about blank that's interesting because of and then he'll explain and so it's kind of interesting i think what i think was interesting about a lot of these side hustle ideas and we put together like top ones around crypto if you're poor meaning like if you want to be in a crypto but you have no money like there are a lot of ways to do it uh and one of them is just documenting a lot of this stuff right like you could start a newsletter just like researching and putting out like hey here's things that are interesting that i'm seeing about it and eventually that's how you do become an expert in these different areas how many the other go ahead no how many coaches do you have in your life oh right now uh not as much so i have a ceo coach so there's a guy i've been working with named ken coleman out of the bay area uh what's what's this is that torch or is it he's just an independent so ken's like old school like he's not tweeting he's not on youtube uh he's just been around silicon valley in a lot of these different kind of companies and a lot of his stuff is very like um like really obvious euphemisms like leaders noah leaders lead basically yeah he's great man he's great uh who other coaches and then i have like a ceo advisor so this guy named raj who works at indeed he's phenomenal he's a little bit more operational so i go to him with different people that were um i'm like yo here's things i'm seeing today what do you think i should be doing about it and so him i have a hebrew coach right now i'm looking for a squash coach i've been really getting into squash it's actually that's kind of been a harder coach to find so i um you like you've always been into coaches and you've always done less i've always done lessons and so like you've always you've always had like flight lessons or like oh yeah i think you used to do boxing and so after we started boxing's on friday so after i talked to you i started hiring coaches and coaches are pretty sick so i've got a bunch of them now and they are badass it is absolutely upped all my most all my coaches are fitness related but like if i do want to learn something i always hire a coach now it's 100 the way to go dude i'm glad that's cool to hear that man so you have your fitness coach well for your box i have like a boxing yeah and like we like and so he's because i'm like trying to fight and like prepare for a real match and so he's like helping me and then i have a fitness coach as well and then for a little while i did my body tutor but i have a different nutritionist now so yeah i like i'm all about coaches i think where for people especially if you don't have money to do something like that it's it's more also like how do you get someone to hold you accountable right at the end of the day like one of the things that i've found really was just having an accountability buddy so if you're trying to start a hustle if you're trying to be healthy um if you can't afford a coach like that's an easy way to find someone to just help you make sure that you you're going on your bed what do you use like maybe it's in your the hustle facebook group what do you use to track all your all your stuff that you have going on like you have two or three or four coaches at any point you've got your work you've always got [ __ ] going on do you have some weird way that you track all this i track all of it i think the i mean i just have most of my stuff is just automatic so i don't really have to track it meaning that like every friday like my calendar is is pretty much as automatic as possible and i think i've talked about this in the past like it's coded right so every friday at 10 a.m is boxing so that's just automatic and then generally flying is going to be every other week and that's yellow so that's one of my learning and then hebrews on thursdays therapy is wednesday every other wednesday at 11. that's yellow so yellow is my learning category i do squashy steamy where we play squash and go to the steam room uh that's not really with a coach but i think if you can have more things on autopilot so you don't have to think about it then you don't have to track it the only thing i think i actively aggress not aggressively but i've tracked for 15 years as my personal finance what do you use so every single i use a spreadsheet everywhere if you go to i think on yeah okay door.com where's my money uh it's literally just like what's my assets what's my liabilities uh and then what are some action items i want to take in the next 30 days do you when when you're tracking any of that do you count privately held stock as anything um and then we can talk about appsumo kpis because there's some interesting stuff how we track there and then the youtube tracking so more business related stuff um in my network sheet i only track the cost basis so i don't track like how do you have a valuation no no so i'd literally just track how much i invested in it so i invested in like circle invested in buffer just an lmnt huckberry um i only invest in companies i use i don't invest in anything i don't use um and so i just tracked that like i put ten thousand dollars in and that's just what it is i don't track like the appreciation on that at all buffer's an interesting company so buffer when i was when so a lot of people who listen to this show are young when i was like younger when i was younger when i was 24 25 buffer was the most badass company because they did this thing where they revealed all of their revenue and at the time that was like revolutionary um like some small-time bloggers were doing it but buffer started doing it but their company has totally stalled hasn't it like their revenue that's a tough one like 25 million every single year for like the last three years yeah i invested them because i love leo i love joel they're i mean they're very innovative at the time i think what people don't give like zuckerberg and some of these people credit for is how do you stay relevant and consistent same with tim ferriss like how do you stay relevant for 15 years it's very easy to come out hot but to actually kind of have that stuff um how does zuck do it you know for anyone out there well i think for anyone it's just like you have to stay consistent with it and you have to kind of keep staying on that edge of where you're a little bit uncomfortable um i think with buffer there's they basically my my guess is that they hit a market saturation of how valuable that is for people to pay for their tweets yeah i'm looking at it like maybe it's not as valuable it's gone down since 2019. yeah i mean i think they have here's the interesting thing they've gone down but canva is a 40 billion dollar company and it's pretty much the exact same thing canvas canvas is the same thing as buffer are you on drugs what are you talking about canva is amazing canva it's the same thing it's how do i create content that i can then share or post in other places but i think where they evolved past buffer which buffer was like i'm gonna help you make your content for twitter twitter or facebook which really didn't make a difference and then canva was like well what if we can help you make these templates that you can just use in social media but as well through a lot of other categories and so i think that's kind of like market size is where they i think iterated better than but not iterated but picked a better market same as appsumo we got lucky with this one canva is going to be software canva is going to be one of the most valuable uh publicly traded companies i think in the world when they go public dude have you seen their numbers they've just crossed a billion in revenue and it's like doubling really canva is killing it man they've raised money at a 40 billion valuation because they grew their revenue from 500 million to a billion in a year and it's on a tear man canvas amazing that is bonkers man what's crazy is the founders are husband and wives and they bootstrapped it for a long time and so the husband and wife trio or a couple is worth like 15 or 20 billion dollars right now good for them it's not good canva is a crazy story we're gonna have to cover canvas last time because they're growing like a week i have no idea how they grow so fast one one thing i did want to come back on sam i was talking to mitchell on the back end um one thing i do in tracking that when i've told people i always find it pretty interesting is like i do monthly life and reviews i told you about this every month yeah it's actually been i mean it's kind of dude so every month and this i've done this now for about seven years um and it's basically an email i sent to tynan nick gray and my buddy jimmy and leo and you basically just review your past month and you i actually started sending it to like my brother my buddy johnny and a lot of a few other close friends but it's pretty fascinating to track what's happened in a month and um it's been fun to go back super like years ago to see what was happening in my life but it's also interesting to be like okay look at all the photos from the month what happened in the month what can i understand about myself and then what do i want to have upcoming in this in for me january what do you but i think that's been one so what i'll what i'll do reveal in that email i'm going to copy that so you you have yes so i don't share my photos but basically what i'll do is i'll pull up my photos uh from december look through december to the end and i'm like damn a lot of hap a lot of stuff happened versus what i think happened um i'll start the so let me just start the december one i put december was a [ __ ] month uh six out of ten um it may not be my greatest but maybe it was actually better than i think and then i'll start the email with what are the things i said i was gonna do december and how did i do against them so a few of them was like at peace with my drinking uh and my i was not at peace with my drinking i said i'd go to a niners game which i did um lock in my 2022 bucket list which i did and then i'll just try to do like a little bit more of a stream of consciousness reviewing of how the month actually went about themes work travel family i've tried it with categories and i've tried also just free flowing there's not whatever works for you i think the important thing here is having like a group of people that you can send it to that don't even have to give you feedback like they don't you don't need their opinion but it's just like here's my life how's your life and if you want opinions you can ask would you ever make that point and also this is way too raw to make public it's like um such good content i would love to like the research oh this i mean i'll send you i'll send you the december one just don't share it but it's just like well i'm just saying like i'm i'm thinking like would i do that as a blog it's pretty cool the end of year reviews for a lot of people the reason why i started thinking about syed recently that guy the wp beginner guy is because he has this end-of-year review and i always love reading his end-of-year review i didn't really i'll look him up um some of this stuff has like we did this like wild therapy out in mexico on the beach which was just like psychedelics and that some of this stuff is just really sensitive uh yeah i don't know if i'd want to make it public i'll send you let me ask about that really quick and then we'll wrap up but did that stuff make a difference just don't doing psychedelic therapy which i don't i told a story about how i almost did it one time but i got kicked out of the group did it get kicked out this lady used to work at lehman brothers she was like worked at the banks that like helped destroy america at one point and she got mad at us for talking about money too much and like she was saying how like her medicine needs to be free for the world but was making me pay two thousand dollars and i was like lady you realize how like country or how like hypocritical you are like you're talking about like how capitalism ruins everything but you're like you worked at lehman brothers and like you're making me pay you two grand to do drugs with you like come on like don't act like your [ __ ] don't stink and she kicked me out of the group so i didn't get to i didn't get to actually do it with her you couldn't have your self-improvement yeah i didn't she didn't let me do drugs with her um i do want to and mitchell mitchell is messaging me he's like yo you got to do your favorite purchases or websites wait but tell me really quick did the therapy work so i've done a lot of different therapy like i've done ayahuasca which i put i put that article out that went viral and if you read that yeah i if i remember correctly the takeaway was like it was cool like it made somewhat of a difference but like it wasn't that great um no it's definitely impactful it's just intense i mean i think what you know there's a lot of different ways to eat a reese's peanut butter cup i always think um the it was lsd therapy and um i think the main theme that i took away from that specific experience well a theme in general for me is like how much should we have life be super predetermined like i want to go make this much money or i want to go on this vacation versus how much should we just let the day like unfold and uh i think that's where that was definitely a theme i was trying to just understand i think the big theme from that specific experience was like how do i let more joy in my life right like my word of the year is smile like i was gonna have an intent yeah like to have an intent or something there and for me smells just like yo i just enjoy it right we're all gonna die someday just like enjoy the grind enjoy getting to chat with you today which you know i was like this is probably the highlight of my day i have a buddy coming at 6 30. but i was like i really want to talk to sam today like i'm looking forward to it um so that was the main theme for from that experience i think there's a lot of ways to learn about ourselves i think you know mdma or lsd therapy regular therapy journaling there's a lot of different ways you know whatever is calling people at the right time what are your uh all right mitchell was telling telling he also told me this or he wrote it in the thing about best stuff to buy for under a hundred dollars you and i are the same in that we buy lots of crap just because like we're up we're both obsessed with gadgets um by the way you sent me over so i told noah's gonna go camping and he sent me over this massive tupperware container with like all these gadgets there was candy in there that expired in like 2012. like i went camping is any of the gadgets in there yeah i went camping and i used your lantern and i used like one of the flashlights and a headlamp and uh i saw i found some swedish fish or something like that but it like expired like years ago i'm more of a sour patch kid guy now that's what it was sorry it was sour patch kids it was it was like it was it was that type of candy yeah um different purchase i don't know i was trying to pull up some of the different things that i've bought that i'm like man i like these and i use them a lot um the coal plunge i didn't buy it it was expensive as [ __ ] it was like five grand um but in my opinion if you want to be cold it's a pretty cool gadget i like it i just i guess the question is that like i think retail is 5k i p so this i think you'll appreciate this i hit them up and i said hey i'm a social media influencer which i find ironic oh my god i i say it as a mockery i didn't actually say that i was like hey i'm interested in your product can i actually just pay cost and then i'll promote it because i figure like i want to support them as a business so i think for people out there that want to get free crap like just pay cost you get it a lot cheaper and you can promote it if you like it that's good um i like it but i don't know is it worth 3k probably not i like my i've been using the bathtub in the hot tub a lot more often yeah come over here come on do a longer workout oh dude here's the thing that i think people are sleeping on but some people are using it have you used apple air tags i just got one they're pretty great dude they're like secretly amazing like i throw it in my luggage and in my backpack so if it ever gets lost in like travel or someone ever jacks my backpack there's like a little secret tag in there dude i've been using tiles for years but the tiles are only okay the air tags are what's the difference i never use those just the interface and how loud the beep is oh that's it yeah just that just those two things they're pretty dude you can actually uh i haven't messed with 3d printers too much but tynan he puts out a dude tynan's gear list if you don't check out tynan.com's gear list definitely one of the top gear lists ever like t-y-n-a-n-com so his gear list is awesome he has like a lot of usb stuff and like what's the smallest charger to be using um but he what you can do which is crazy on etsy this is a really neat hack you can buy a 3d printed thing where you can put an apple air tag and then secretly attach it to any of your bikes so if you're a biker for like 15 bucks you can buy a secret thing that attaches to your water bottle and no one will ever know it's there so you have a tracker on any of your expensive bikes oh that's sick but does the air so the air tag only works so if it's in within bluetooth of a iphone of any iphone that i think that's where there's a little bit of like controversy but it's any apple device that's good all right i think is the internet connection or bluetooth mesh i think i thought it was bluetooth which is kind of like [ __ ] up if you think about it bonkers right dude well i mean there's these stories where like someone put it on someone's car and then they're tracking them home i think that's obviously like that's messed up um but i think just the technically like it's just a fun tool to start playing with and just start experimenting with all right so what else have you gotten dude you know what i've gotten really into tea why i'm like i don't know man i've been into like chinese tea so i bought um a snow peak bottle it's called snow peak is the brand it's like super uh good for like travel and stuff and then i buy um it's called a guy wan i can't believe i'm talking about this publicly i don't know just so nerdy it's like what creepy white dudes do um i mean you want these guy ones you have like a little chinese tea ceremony and it's really inexpensive you can go to aliexpress buy it for like 10 bucks um and i bought it a travel one actually so you have one for home which you can buy an aliexpress for like literally 10 bucks or from keith titanium you can buy a guy one that's for camping that's like 200 bucks uh so when i travel i'll bring tea around and i get it from this place in the bay area called old waze tea is that well yeah oldwaystee.com that has definitely been something i'm uh way more hyped on and i've definitely been drinking a crap ton more tea this year um a good thing that i bought recently which i'm almost positive you have as well what brand chair do you have i think this is an autonomous same we have the exact same one so uh so basically these chairs that i was looking at they're like fifteen hundred dollars like a fancy chair like are they really an aeron i think it's called uh it's like 1200 to 2gs they're really expensive and so autonomous is a new startup that's making chairs and desk supplies and it's basically as good i think as the really fancy one but for like 350 bucks yeah these are definitely affordable one thing one thought i've had sam is like what have you bought in your life that you're like man this is luxurious i was trying to think of things that i'm like like i bought this levi's jacket because it's getting cold in austin it's got the little fur it was 89. and i probably looked for a coupon and i'm like yo this is like i look like a cowboy like a real cowboy this is obviously kind of a joke um and so i was just trying to think like what are other items in my life where i'm like man i can't believe how rich i am even though it's not that expensive and definitely that jacket isn't exactly dude amazon oh you have these amazon basic moccasins i got those because of you actually yeah they're sick dude those are 20 bucks i'm like i walk around my house i'm like who's the king who's the gig i love that um one thing that we do at my house is we do costco socks and we'll buy like 50 pairs and just never match socks again and then at the end of a at the end of like half the year or so we just throw away all the the socks and get new ones because like if they wear out or if because i i hate matching socks and so i hate you know like it's just stupid why do i gotta like spend all this time like putting them in a ball together like just give me like a huge bin where they're all the same and i'll just grab two it's stupid matching socks is stupid i'm i i take a stand against that and so anyway i just don't match socks anymore and so that's my splurge is i uh i spend like 200 a year and i just get fancy new socks also another thing that i do that's pretty amazing is i do the same that same thing but with x aficionado underwear so like you know like dude you know when you put underwear on and there's like a pair that's always like the last to be used because like the band is all stretched out or you just like don't like it or it's like stained or it looks ugly like you're just done about it so i just threw all those away and i only bought one style one color but like 30 pairs and i spent like 500 dollars to do it because x aficionado underwear is like 20 to 25 a piece did i only wear saks underwear i think it's the same kind of same kind of thing but it's got the whole little ball holder stuff yeah i like those too i like sacks they're a good brand and they don't stretch out as fast but they still do wear out a little bit i definitely feel pretty luxurious in them do you ever mess with lululemon socks yeah i'm all about anything lululemon dude little lemon socks like these no-show socks because they always other all the others always get holes in them i'm always just like frustrated about that but the lululemon ones um home what other stuff you bought they're like yo this is rad and i do want to spend at least five minutes i know we're gonna end here um i wanna spend five minutes like how do we grow your podcast let's like brainstorm like i know something you're aiming to do so let's do one two one of these items and like i don't know well let me all right let's do that now let me tell you the numbers now so in december we did uh uh right about two million views um i think or two million downloads uh of which like i think 600 000 was on youtube and the rest so 1.4 million was just people going onto itunes or spotify okay so what's your those are what's your current goal do you have a goal this year around the the audience or podcast yeah i think three three million uh consistently getting at least three million downloads a month would put us in like the top like five business podcasts in the in the country what what's been the biggest thing that's helped you grow it this is like the way i'm just trying to brainstorm with you what's helped you get the biggest delta and new subscribers so one of the shitty parts about podcasting is that i've done a lot of growth stuff it's been crazy hard to grow it and so the biggest thing that's done well is we've just invested more time and more energy into good content so sean and i like prepare we research a ton our our chemistry has gotten better so that's just like one big category of just like improved content the second thing that we've done that's starting to work really well is we're buying ads on other people's podcasts and so we've learned this strategy from jordan harbinger jordan harbinger has 15 million downloads a month of course he's in like a big category it's just like culture i think is the category he's in and he basically spent nine hundred thousand dollars in his first year buying ads on other people's podcasts and that's how he got big hmm okay um you should sponsor okay my podcast or i'll just put you i'm i mean you're coming on next week for free here's a question sure yeah i mean how many downloads did you get i think it's about 10 000 an episode dude so like we're a little bit bigger than that now but like just getting to 10 000 is really hard podcast do you agree are podcasts the hardest thing you've ever tried to grow that's why i backed out of it that's when i went to youtube dude it's so hard but it's super sticky like every podcast that we launch is going to get at least 50 every episode we'll get at least 50 000 views i think all right here's like one simple thing that i don't know why you don't do on your i think one of the ways to think about one it's always easy to get people to come from medium to medium so podcast sponsoring means they come from one show to the other super easier how come you don't promote your podcast or newsletter on youtube well not so like the newsletter but what do you mean the podcast well no no so think about it as like a gateway drug so someone on another podcast is highly likely to go to a different podcast because you already know that they're behavior-wise so sponsoring podcast is a great one getting on other people's shows is a great one but you're getting like you had a video recently where you got uh how i retired over 20 million by age 31 had a has 140 000 views but in the description there's nothing that says check out my newsletter of my podcast yeah that's stupid we should do you're right that's low-hanging fruit that we should have solved for i would think that's a pretty easy one and then um on your about page on youtube you don't link to the podcast really are you sure it says website well it says website where does that go yeah i mean i guess that's okay it says website twitter instagram facebook i might want to actually just put the link for podcast i would also consider i mean this might be more of a stretch but i would consider do you strategically try to really intentionally grow youtube and or tick tock pick one of those probably youtube and then really think of that as a way to get people into your newsletter which is like the first step to getting them onto your podcast no it's been the other way around uh like lately we've been going my first million has become like almost its own brand i think yeah here's what i think is gonna happen i think in the future like in within one to three years me and sean in hubspot i think what we're going to do is sell the podcast or do some type of licensing deal there's like no reason for me to think this other than this is just like a crazy prediction i think that we're going to do some type of crazy there's a world where we would do a crazy licensing deal i'm hoping that's a public company so i'm not actually just so everyone knows i'm just [ __ ] guessing like i'm not this is not based on anything hubspot maybe would do a thing where in three or five years we do some type of licensing deal with like spotify or whatever you know kind of like to call her daddy uh podcasted do you know what that podcast is call her daddy yeah so they did a licensing deal for 60 million dollars over three years and i think there's a world where we would do that uh with like spotify or uh one of the other big public uh platforms and i think that's i like that as a creative at home but why did you say getting people to uh come on to your to to like grow the youtube channel or tick tock it's not worth it or not as important you were like yeah it's not good like what do you mean there um i well what we've found is that i think it's better to grow to send people straight to the podcast because if they if they click subscribe then they're notified whenever there's a uh four minutes they're notified whenever there's a new episode you know what i mean no yeah but don't you think like like the amount of people available on the youtube that are like hey i want to hear more about this then come on i mean think about how much like joe rogan got found because of youtube well and the second answer to that is i mean we're trying it's [ __ ] hard if we're trying i'm like the efforts if you look at our youtube page look at our videos like the effort's there like they just don't get that many views all the time it just it's taking a long time i mean how many views look at our youtube how do you think it's going in my opinion recommendation do you want recommendations yeah i would say it's going okay at best okay so i think what you what you're doing is you're uploading podcast to youtube you're not actually creating content that people watch on youtube right so if you look at it at our channel like youtube okay dork the content is like made for youtube so the two things that i would i would tell your team here's what i would recommend you to do over the next like three months look at your ctr like the click-through rate of all these different videos and that'll basically show you if you're picking the right topics and then i as well your thumbnails what's the baseline uh if you can hit a five percent ctr you're you're doing very well you're doing very very well so like would you say three to five is decent i mean three is decent i think you want to get to five you want to be like hitting a really high number so like our recent like uh awesome videos are hitting five um so i would i would basically just start tracking your ctr your click-through rate on these things and the second thing you want to this is just the the start with this stuff is that i think this is a way of explaining the pie that people find out about you and then they're like oh in your description about page go to the newsletter go to the podcast which i would just update your top 10 videos here you don't need to do all of them but do them moving forward the second thing is your your average view duration so the the saminaj one had it's a two hour video there's a reason it got 26 000 views it's because it's long as hell and i'm guessing your average view duration was like 20 minutes how many does that have 20 000 26 000 wow where you know the serial killer got busted through 23 me one i don't know how that's relevant to people making a million it's not put that on your own channel bro come on don't blame me for all this stuff i've you're who's in charge i don't know anymore well anyways i think the second thing is just look at your average view duration do the same thing just look at a line graph so like how are we trending and and don't worry about super optimizing just where like each month or so can we try to get both those numbers moving in an upward direction and the other thing i think you were able to do that what's that anything else we should do i mean your your thumbnails aren't really i'm pretty sure we're using your thumbnail guy yeah it might be the thumbnail guy but you're like how much are you actually spending to make a great thumbnail so like every one of our thumbnails now we go and do custom photos so at 4 30 i'm literally it's the third time going out with a photographer to take a thumbnail for the same video dude that's so much work isn't it isn't that crazy there's so much work to make it like a youtube video i just dismiss it as like oh you're just [ __ ] around it's so much more work than i thought yeah to be good i mean i'm not gonna say some cliche [ __ ] anything great is worth working do you feel like an idiot though on the side of the street doing this space where you're like hands on your head and you're like freaking out about the 2022 stock market now it's gonna go down well i think i mean the other thing with no it's honestly enjoyable and i find it kind of like a science it's like a game where like it's a game where you in a sense like how do i win this game and doing that it gives me an advantage so hell yeah i want to do it and i find it enjoyable i think you know topics you should also just kind of consider the topics you're putting out on youtube like how much do authors make it's not something that i think people are really like gonna immediately stop and drop everything to watch but like solana billionaires right now crypto and nft and stuff like that and how to get rich is always popular on youtube we're just like whenever we talk we're just going to chop we just chop [ __ ] up so like it what we could do is like have pre-planned topics that we think would go get popular on youtube it's just a little bit harder to do that naturally in a conversation but i think we can do it but yeah our goal like i'm predicting the future we're gonna get to like the 3 million range by the end of the year and once there um i think we're going to be end up being like one of the big i think we'll be like in the dave ramsey tim ferriss category inside the next year and a half here's a oh yeah we can end it one thing i find fascinating is there's people who are huge on youtube that no one knows but a lot of people know who tim ferriss is kind of something i've just been reflecting on what does that mean well he's been in the game forever and he also what entered the game when the world was smaller so like in the niche of like tech and startups there and and this whole like make money online thing there weren't that many people on it and there weren't that many people who were famous for it and he was definitely one of the first that was famous for it do you know what i mean yeah i mean yeah that's interesting the world gets bigger it's also getting known your niche like i have a friend who's popular in the spearfishing category how about right i think what's that he's got like few hundred thousand followers on tick tock he's got a full-time business now it's called sick cast cast it's called [ __ ] group for nerds i want to be a spearfish influencer this guy is cool as [ __ ] man if you ever want to go spearfishing but i think what fascinates me about him is like he's on tick-tock he just does this you know you talked about this in the beginning where you documented your house he likes spearfishing and he likes fishing and so he just started videoing it put on tick tock got like i think he's how many followers you have on tick tock in i think he's got like 200 000 cast and spear 289 that 285 000 followers he texted him yesterday i don't see his revenue but he's got a you know not a seven figure but a pretty healthy business selling spearfishing gear now i think instead of getting big at tim where maybe people are responding i want to be known or i'm an expert i've got imposters and i'm just like do the thing you're already excited about document that and i think people will be shocked that they can make a lot of money doing it like my brother he does insurance claims for hospitals are talking about this no so when you go to the hospital you get a bill and the hospital has to fight with the insurance company about how much to pay yeah so he reviews the bill to optimize to make sure that the the insurance company pays the full amount okay cause he can be like no they didn't need to do this procedure they need to do this and now he's so i think one of the things is what do you have in your day job that you can make a business out of and so he's exploring how to help individuals optimize well not optimize but reduce their medical bills so if you got a medical bill and it's like five thousand or one thousand ten thousand he'll review it for free and then maybe take a cut if he's able to reduce the amount of money that that's actually a great idea there's this company called buyer.co and our my friend started it and it was called negotiating as a service and they would negotiate anything on your behalf and take a percentage of the savings and the company sold to ramp so if you go to buyer.com it redirects to that web the company you said you don't like ramp and uh it's not that i hate them there's something to do and buyer the guy he started he's like i sold out too early but i didn't have any money and it was like a cool way to make money but um he was like i this could actually be great i would do like a negotiating negotiating as a service and have um my health bill be one of the big ones uh another great company is called do not pay and they're doing this but for uh a variety of different things oh yeah i saw them i like do not pay yeah do not pay the the robot there's also like vendor.com then there's like a similar one you give me your bills they negotiate and they just take a cut of whatever they see dude i love those services i love notebooks win-win no one's down like quickbooks or uh not quick in uh turbo tax mint yeah turbo intertext a little it's like oh it's free it's free it's free guess what if you really want it it's paid for they don't like but they don't take money from you they just take a percentage of your refund yes which i like yeah that's fair so i did want to say though dude honestly for your show because other people out there are trying to do it i think obviously you said go on other people's shows podcasts i think optimize these lower these other platforms um we're going hard on the thing the tic-tac thing definitely has worked but has it driven people i think ultimately is it helping me with my goal is it driving people to the podcast unfortunately i have no idea that's another shitty part about podcast is it's hard to know what works because i can look at my charts and see how many downloads we have it won't tell me how they heard about us it's not like google analytics where i can see like the person who bought this came from google because they searched blank on this type of phone have you done uh url genius no we've done chartable is that the same thing well url geniuses i think we use this on our show sometimes it's app.urlgene.us it's deep linking so it'll link deeply into the podcast on spotify i don't know if it does itunes as well and then you could track i think how those clicks are actually looking so you can put that on tick tock or put that out on the the youtube world i didn't know about that all right i'll look into that um all right samuel we're gonna wrap up i love seeing you dude thanks for doing this you look good dude thanks for having me did how many people reached out from the last one it got ben messaged me he said it got 65 000 or 70 000 views really yeah dude you guys are man i told you the first time i ever came on your show i had like an ex this girl i went on a date with was like i can't believe you're on the show yeah he messaged me he said he got 65 000 views or downloads all right i think this one thank you for having me man this is excellent all right we'll talk a little bit talk soon [Music]

all right my last question um how many of these folks building software companies that you see yourself included are non- technical well that's a great question and and if they are non technical what do they do yep um so I'm a developer or was I haven't written code in years but we actually as so we do a state of independent SAS survey and we put out a report an like an industry report and we asked the question do you have at least One technical founder right or you know and yes or no right and the number of SAS companies kind of bootstrap dish SAS companies with Z with no technical Founders is like I believe it's 20% 25% it's very possible it is and usually what the expertise they have they either the subject matter expert like we're going to build software for accountants I was an accountant for 20 years we're going to be software for ux designers I was a designer for 10 years they're either that or they're sales or marketing that's what they should have now we've seen where there's a developer and then there's like the business person the business guy or G anything this is yeah usually winds at meeting you're not actually that helpful and you probably shouldn't be a co-founder you know if you can't sell or Market or like have input on the product you know or or develop it like those are really the four roles um You probably shouldn't be so if I'm if I like I'm not Tech I'm not technical but I um I can like tie stuff together and use zap your and I'm super creative how do I start a start a software company without hiring or I if maybe hiring is it but without having a co-founder right so for you since you have money you would either acquire something because there's always stuff for sale that you may want to acquire and then just grow if you have a Content marketing expertise or you would hire you know a developer or an agency or something to build it if you don't have the money uh a lot of people non-technical will work a day job and actually funnel money to the side to basically pay for a developer to do it um the other two approaches I've seen are exactly what you said which is I'm going to build my minimum viable product using zapier and notion and chewing gum all right and I'm just going to Cobble it together to the point where hey if I get a few grand a month in Revenue this proves it and I'm going to use that to get it built it's a harder way to go but it's possible the last one I've seen which is genius and this is what the founder Casto did CU he's not he's a single founder not a developer he worked a day job he started a product IED Service Podcast editing and he h he got it up to I forget what the number with 30 or 40 Grand a month in productized podcast he was one of the earlier ones it was called podcast motor he was working a day job the whole time so then while he was was he actually doing the editing or he would he did it first and then and then got someone overseas exactly yep yep or he even even has folks in US and Canada doing it um and there was enough profit margin that he then started reinvesting you know and said well now I want to build now that I'm doing podcast hosting he actually was in the podcast space someone says I have this WordPress podcast plugin for podcast hosting on WordPress and I want someone to kind of adopt it type thing since he was doing something in public they approached him he bought it for not very much money and then he built the entire you know what again as a seven figure business he's raised you know three aside from us he's raised three qus of and it's growing fast so that's the other way to do it is like I even I was a developer and I had to do it nights and weekends too you know and I was pulling money away from the day job for the agency and de and hiring a de developer what what's the best way to do that do a lot of these folks like a lot like when I was starting everyone said like oh just go on odesk and hire someone in India to do it and I'm like I don't know man that doesn't sound like I can like like yeah so like what you what what what are there any agencies that you like or for hiring devs are you hiring someone by the hour in America what what's what do you typically see yeah I typically see I see a lot of people going either through referrals like you get into a community um microcom connect or Indie hackers or whatever Dynamite Circle and you ask and you say who has used someone whom you trust right so you try to get that referral it's not just a a flat look because going to upwork which used to be odesk is kind of a show these days the other thing is there are now these refer Services aggregators there's one called trust Shoring which is run by a guy who attends microcom but he basically knows a bunch of Eastern European Dev agencies and if you come to him and say I want to build an IOS app he'll say cool I have these three agencies that I that I refer to he's almost like a broker in a way but like he's a good dude and he knows them you know and so he and he's vetted them and then there's one called cloud dev.com and they do the similar thing for Latin America and so the do you like do you like top tow or anything like that top tow is good it's expensive um right cuz I think it's hours so it depends on budget and all that if you're if you're scraping by I haven't used toptw but I've had friends use it and I heard quality was really good in the early days and of course like anything it gets you know less and less but um that's certainly something you could try too how much would you budget to create an MVP it depends on what it is you're talking like a sass app here's the other thing man if you're if you are non-technical and you've never started a startup before I would say don't build a SAS app it's too hard like go I have this thing called the stair step approach to bootstrapping which is like start small with like a WordPress plugin a HubSpot add-on a Salesforce add-on a Heroku add-on and go build that cut your teeth at it it's way less expensive way harder to maintain and way easier to maintain you get the experience you get some Revenue then grow it to enough that you can buy out just buy out your day job eight grand eight grand a month maybe 10 grand a month then now you have experience you can double down and um and do it this is awesome to your to your question of building an MVP of a SAS app 10 to 30 grand I to throw it out but and you think a non-technical person could actually maintain that and understand what's going well no then you'd need to have that agency sticker right that's where I'm saying if you're non-technical um you either need some money I mean this is why folks you build it and you're you pre-sell it you get to the point where there's enough Revenue that you can then justify you know raising funding right if you're if you're non technical or you have a side job that's uh putting money [Music]

i have a friend uh who used to work work with me and i caught up with him and his story he basically went from like uh average like an average job like you wouldn't look at this person say oh that's a star career and um they're good they're doing well obviously but they were doing like normal person well and they went from normal person well to making like to personally making like 15 million dollars in the last year just by the they basically quit their job and they went down a crypto rabbit hole and started betting on things in defy and they started playing with all the d5 projects investing their money in d5 and they didn't have a huge base of capital they have you know call it half a million dollars that they put in and to turn a half a million dollars if and if you have no path in your career to being like a you know a deca millionaire right like if you don't have a path or you're like yeah i'm gonna have [ __ ] you money to go from no path no no like reasonable storyline that makes sense there you have a job at a company that pays you good salary and that's that to that is amazing to me and awesome and like you know just like blew my mind more so than these guys who become multi-billionaires who were like prodigies and like invented the protocol or invested 250k in a random token it's like this is somebody who just took their own money out of the stock market and was like instead of investing in apple google and facebook i'm going to investigate crypto and turned a normal amount a normal like life savings amount of money into a life-changing amount of money and i want to have him on to tell his full story because it actually has like a bunch of twists and turns um that are like kind of amazing so i'm gonna ask him if he'll come on and share it do i know they're willing to uh yeah you know them um i don't know if they're willing to share but if they are it's gonna make for an amazing episode uh i'll ask them if you'll do it next week did they um did they earn the did they uh sell do they have usd or like some type of stable currency um no they're they're still in crypto like 100 or 100 plus percent because they you know but but is it stable like a bit like a a popular thing uh it's a mix of popular things and like something they could sell at least everything's liquid if they wanted to cash out and say i'm done i'm going to malibu and i'm going to chill i'm going to pretend that this year never existed and i basically won a lottery they could do that because we have a buddy in our chat group who said he made all this money in some crazy coin but he's like i can't sell it so it's like that's different that's like uh those are like either illiquid like oh there's this coin but it's not listed yet or it's liquid but there's like no trading volume whatsoever on this coin and so like yeah if you have 10 million dollars and you go to even 100 000 it'll crash the price of the coin that's not what this is that's that's a different thing um that's a what that is is i i make a million coins i keep 999 000 for myself and then i sell one of them for a dollar and oh now the total value of my thing is a million dollars and it's like no it's not really you there's such a lit such a small amount of the supply out there being sold it's not indicative of the true price this is what i'm talking about is not that situation is there any other person all right so you have a story of someone who did 500 000 to 15 million i just told you about this guy who in like two years this person non-technical never was a trader or financial person like they would own like a index fund or mutual fund before that didn't know how to spell blockchain um you know like this person is that's why this blows my mind it's not just this like i know that amount is not the craziest amount of money it's an awesome amount of money for anybody but what's crazy is point a to point b it makes no sense it's like how could those two points connect in that amount of time it's mind-blowing to me so i told you a story about this dude chris who did 250 000 up to a billion you just said 500 000 to 15 million do we know anyone else that has this like crazy crazy journey uh personally you've talked about this guy you talked about somebody right that you're yeah and a friend that that they made 1 million to 100 million yeah so at its peak when bitcoin was uh 60 000. so i don't know whatever is that discount it okay i have another one uh there is a kid who i call him a kid because he was actually a kid he i built this a product called blab back in the days like kind of like clubhousey you could basically go hang out chat with people and this kid used to come home every day from school he used to get on and chat and he didn't chat in the other rooms that had 13 year olds he came to our rooms because he loved technology startups he wanted to be in the startup scene and i think he was maybe 13 at the time okay so fast forward it's been like six years since then so now he's like let's say 21 or something like that it's been it's been a while and um he created some but he was he's a technical guy he created a protocol like i was like oh what you been up to like how's your startup going and he's like uh it's yeah startups okay we haven't been focusing on it for last few months i was like i know man it's tough you got just hanging in there buddy you know just pivot he's like actually like we ended up creating this thing anonymously on one of these random like side chains and it was like blah blah some bunch of terms i don't even understand you know it's a it's a derivatives perpetual contract for you know adding liquidity to this blah blah i'm like okay i don't understand what you're saying uh he's like yeah the market cap of it like you know basically like the market cap of it is like 900 million right now and you know i think he cashed out 10 million dollars in this he's like he's like dude it's been insane the market cap went up like crazy now it's at 200 million and he's like i was able to like take out like a life-changing amount of money he i took out 10 million he was he was like he was asking me because he goes i heard you guys talking about charities and charity water you told the charity water stores really moved like i've set aside seven figures to donate you're like what i was like you've set aside seven figures like like are you seven years old how did this happen where what if what has happened to this amount of time like i used to talk to you when you would come home from eighth grade and get online like you're donating millions of dollars to charity now like what is again a and b it broke my brain and i don't mean this as an insult to them like if they're if they were only 15 then so they're still only like 19. yeah i think they're 20 now or 21 something like that it's been like seven years since we've made that thing so um you know it's not it's not mind-blowing to me that this person is successful in both cases i i really like this person that's why i used to hang out with them that's why i used to work with one of them i think they're really smart and we're going to be normal person successful it's like when you know i went like my sister went to high school with this girl lily galici who's like this super famous instagram star now she's like has her own tv show on bravo and it's like wait that's the lilly girl who used to come to our house after school like she was just like a normal girl like wait that's her like that doesn't even look like her anymore like yeah she's had some work done right it's like just mind-blowing to know a normal person who's like yeah that's a cool normal they'll do well in life to be like no actually they're like one of those crazy outlier stories and in a way that you wouldn't have otherwise predicted you know it didn't make any sense like you know it's not it's not that that was their skill set and they tried try tried that thing for 10 years and finally hit it's like just i don't know where they just did this thing and it hit and crypto is this amazing thing like that so by the way um i'm going to say something when i first talked to my friend i caught up with my friend i felt insanely jealous i was like so j i was happy for him and i like him and all that but i was also like i was like in my head i was just like what the [ __ ] have i been doing with my life with the the friend that used to work for you both of them both the same reaction yeah because it feels weird because you're like oh wait you kind of looked up to me yeah now i'm like you know way less successful than you uh so like what just happened you just like catapulted really crazy like yeah between the last time we caught up and now there is jealousy there it's easy and i just want to say like you know an interesting thing to observe is what is your reaction to hearing stories like this um there's a part of me that i'm not proud of which gets jealous of it but that used to be like it used to be i would feel that i wouldn't really acknowledge that that's what i was feeling and i would kind of find reasons why it was like ah that's just luck or um like you know well they probably are taking a bunch of risk and they might lose it all and i'm kind of secretly rooting for it to not not all work out just so perfectly as it has that's gone but i still got a little bit of that like jealousy paying left and i'd say the interesting thing is my coach said this to me he goes uh you know you'll encounter people in your life where your success just reminds them of their failure and they're not focused on your success they're focused on their fail your success has reminded them of their failure or your abundance has reminded them of their lack and uh if you notice that in yourself you want to be aware of that and change that and if you find other people and you're like oh these people are haters like uh you know just understand what's coming out they don't actually hate you it's uh your success has reminded them of some failing that they have in themselves and that's where their attention is gone and so uh yeah i wanted to share that because i definitely felt this like crazy feeling that i hadn't felt in a long time but these stories were so mind-blowing that i could i was like wow this i don't even know what to say i feel lucky to know who i know which we have the same group basically that i've like these stories that sound unbelievably true i'm a big yeah i know that person um i saw it it was wild so like an example is mois ali selling native deodorant for 100 million dollars two years after starting it i was in he we shared an office when he was starting it and i saw him try to learn facebook ads like i saw the thing come to fruition i saw it right in front of my eyes every single day for like six or ten months um and that was almost half the journey [Music] you

all right so i got curious about something i saw this so there's this guy named mark manson mark manson has this book called the subtle art of not giving a [ __ ] then he created a couple spin-offs from it so i'll tell you a quick a funny story so this book uh was the best-selling book of 2020 i believe or 19 either 19 or 20. i forget the exact year um and it or maybe even prior before that actually but it just sold like many many millions copies of books i actually had uh dinner at a conference with tucker who we were just talking about and mark manson sat next to me and i was talking to him and i was like so what do your parents think about your job and he goes well they kind of make fun of me and ask when i'm going to get a real job they don't really know what i do they just think i play in the computer all day and i play video games all day they don't truly understand like what i'm doing but they kind of understood it this year when they released a report for new york times saying i sold more books than hillary clinton so that's when they that's when they kind of understood what i do and so uh that's a funny story about mark but i looked up uh i was i was curious about something about him and i googled and the first article came out that he had a condo in new york city that he recently sold for 14 million dollars and i got curious about that because i think that book i was like books can't make that much money can they and atomic habits this year sold or so far has sold around five million books in total and this year atomic habits was the best-selling book on amazon in 2020 um or 2021 and i was curious about how much bookmakers uh authors make so i i have a friend i can't talk about his name but he sold 30 000 copies of a book that was published on a major publisher and i want to explain to you how much money he made by the way and that 30 000 that's a ton that's like in the top one percentile you know yes this book is in bookstores and it's probably in the airport and things like that so they were given they didn't have a book before they were given a 250 000 advance which is basically just like uh here's 250 go yeah and go write the book um off that 30 000 in books they have not made a cent in royalty or licensing fees and he told me that when he was looking at the contract he doesn't even entirely understand when he's gonna get paid past that amount and he only gets paid like pennies on the dollar for every like fourteen dollar book sold right and he said he's like i he goes basically i get paid they spent a certain amount of money to help me make this book and they get paid once it's i get paid once it surpasses that amount but i can't even understand in the paperwork how much they spent like including everyone's salaries on doing this and publishing and things like that but i have made he said an additional four hundred thousand dollars this year on selling other stuff like courses and coaching and consulting which wouldn't have happened because uh which happened because of the book but basically on 30 000 copies sold he has not made a cent other than the 250 and he told me that his editor wasn't that good that he had to spend a little bit of money uh get getting their his own editor and that their marketing people weren't that great and i found it to be very interesting and so i looked up dan blizzarian dan bilzerian you know who he is the instagram guy he self-published his book and so dan bazarian's book it costs 35 and he has a shopify store that sells it you can't buy it on amazon and it works for dan blizzarian because he just posts a link on instagram and he goes viral but david goggins did it as well and so anyway this whole publishing kind of thing got me interested because these people do not i guess mark manson he must have crushed it somehow but for someone who sells 30 000 books they don't make [ __ ] off their off their books and i found it to be incredibly fascinating i guess if you're like ryan holiday i heard that he makes he does good but a lot of people they just don't get paid well i think it's two things it's if you take an advance the econo and it's your first book the economics can be super skewed against you if you um if you have multiple hits like a ryan holiday then you know by the time you negotiate your third book deal you're gonna have much better economics in the thing you know tim ferriss probably made more of his last book than he did off the first book which is the best seller um and then the last thing is self-publishing you know changing the game in a way so you know let's say a book sells for 13.99 or whatever 14 bucks um you know i think it's gonna be like probably uh you know seven eight bucks of just the cost of the book plus shipping to get it to a customer and you know so you're left with four or five bucks at the end to play with now whether that goes all in your pocket or your publisher's pocket i think that depends on how you negotiate but even if you just take four bucks per copy um you know five million copies sold for atomic habits you know i would believe that he's grossed you know 20 million 30 million in sales uh i'm sorry like gross profit off that now i don't know what his deal was if he's i don't know if he's self-published or what well five million books times fourteen dollars is seventy thousand seventy million so the the revenue on that i would bet is in the 50 to 100 million range yeah that huge ballpark but i don't know what a guy like him would make but i bet you he could get paid like many thousands an hour to come and talk i mean i bet you even cost him fifty thousand dollars to show up at a at a board room in new york to give a discussion to get yeah i just got paid eight thousand dollars to do a zoom call for one hour um really to give a talk and so that means that somebody who's you know the author of atomic habits is definitely commanding you know 25 50k per person that's crazy that's crazy so anyway i thought uh i thought this was interesting and uh it shocked me writing a book because you're going through this i know i know you're thinking about going through i don't know how far how far you are i basically paid to write the book and now i gotta write the book this year so that'll happen uh and so yeah i don't i would predict that you don't make money directly off of it but i imagine there will be money made in some ways yeah i think a book is a pretty horrible way to make money so i'm just doing it for fun [Music] you

there's a lot of online communities anyone can start one you get a few hundred people together there are so few people who not only run in person events but who do them well and if you can do that it is an incredible competitive advantage [Music] okay uh sean's not here what are we gonna talk about uh a few things oh let me tell you something sorry i asked you a question that i interrupted you but let me tell you something so i'm doing something cool in 10 days so on the pod and on twitter i talked about how i'm buying a piece of property and i'm turning it into like a thing like a like a hotel airbnb fitness thing i had this guy i'm not gonna say who it is yet because i haven't asked his permission but basically he bought uh like five 000 acres in the south in a state in the south let's say georgia and he is turning it in to an airline hotel or an airline neighborhood soon with hotels so basically they're putting an airstrip in the middle of this piece of property and then they're lining up houses along it so you could buy a house and then soon it's going to be a hotel and then they're going to have an airplane hangar there so for all airplane enthusiasts you can keep your plane there and take off and land on this you know right outside your home so it's basically like having a uh a house on a golf course except instead of a golf course it's an airplane runway and hangar but here's the kicker he asked me if i wanted to come check it out and i said yeah sure he goes all right meet me at the teterboro airport in the like outside of new york on you know january 25th and we'll fly my jet down so i'm flying private down i'm going to go up to new york just to fly back down just like it creates it but nice isn't that that sick so is this um is it like super rural or is it uh kind of just outside of a major metropolitan area it's an hour and a half outside of a major area got it so and most of these people most of these houses is this gonna be these people's like full-time residents you think no no probably not it's a lot of like older people you don't have to be you don't have to be like rich rich to do this i think you have to like be able to afford a 200 000 plane or something like that that could be your hobby so you have to have some money but it's not like gonna be necessarily like incredibly wealthy people yeah so enough to afford like a cessna or something like that and you just fly in and it's just somewhere to fly and then you stay by your airport and just hang out and chill yeah that's kind of neat right yeah it is kind of cool how much do you think he's in on this project um uh i'll i'll say it and then if he says i can't but uh nearly eight figures is the money that he's had to use his own money to do that and then he'll uh raise some more money and then how many houses and he was like he was like oh it's just like a side project and i was like what that is huge that is uh how rich is your friend what does this represent for him i don't know i just met him um like wealthy enough to be able to afford that but not wealthy enough to like i i like if he loses that it's not it's like will be really bad do you own any uh like vacation homes or secondary homes or anything like that well no no i own um my house that i live in i own and then i own some uh uh like rentals and like a uh now a vacant lot that i'm building a house on to sell but nothing like this no plain vacation home no no i don't i don't i think that vacation homes only make sense for me personally only makes sense to me if i buy them and rent them out and so if i can find a place in new york or california that i like and i could rent it out and make a profit then i would do it so i met this guy the other day who was a billionaire or close to a billionaire and this person has an apartment they don't live in new york but they have an apartment there and it's really fancy and then they have a place in park city and they rent it out when when they're not there and it pays for itself and they're still like it's like a wealthy person i think that's the way to go as you but not everyone's comfortable doing that it's interesting to me because this idea that you're describing sounds like the inverse of what i would want like i want to be able to fly places so that i could stay there like i want to fly to new york so i can go to new york but this is the opposite they're setting up somewhere to stay so that they can fly does that make sense well it's not just that just imagine you're like 65 years old and like you want to like spend the weekend at this area and you want to fly there and stay there and hang out and then go on trips throughout the day and just hang out with a bunch of other airplane nerds that are like you yeah sure so it's like if you're like 65 and this is your passion i think i think that people who are into this [ __ ] are so into it that they just want to be around other people who are into it yeah i think there are a lot of opportunities like this as people as more and more people because it sounds like this is mostly retirees but i think you could also do it towards remote workers of just like people have lived places for no particular reason in the past and i think as people can now choose where they want to live they're going to start congregating more in groups of like i don't know group around their hobbies or like vegans how they want to eat i don't know like random niches i agree i think that will happen too the the day that new york allows short-term rentals so in new york you're not allowed to rent for under 30 days um or you got to like jump through crazy hoops but the data that's allowed i'll be buying a place there but not not until that's allowed oh okay you want to talk about this uh elizabeth holmes thing yes i do uh so you see you sent this to me you want to give the back story well let's see what happened yesterday so uh yesterday you sent a post to me and sean that you were on the front page of hacker news yes they had go ahead i meant like what happened to holmes yesterday oh so elizabeth holmes uh convicted of like three or four crimes um i don't know if she's been sentenced yet but she could serve she will serve years of hard time potentially up to 20 years yes well there's 20 is three three counts that were carry sentences up to 20 years and one that carries up to five so i don't know if those are additive or if it's only up to 20 i don't know how that works but yeah so yeah and what happened yesterday it actually happened on sunday night i got a text from a friend who goes hey you're on the front page of hacker news if you don't go to hacker news it's basically like reddit but like if i said reddit for nerds you would be shocked because reddit is for nerds but this is like really for nerds like nerd nerds and it's all like computer nerds and of which i am one of them and i uh i got a text saying that my article that i wrote in 2015 was on the front page of reddit or on hacker news and it was getting which means you'll get millions of visitors and the headline to my article was the coverage of theranos is utter [ __ ] and i wrote this article defending theranos theronos and defending elizabeth holmes and it did not age well that article but let me explain what the article do you have the article in front of you i just want to talk about my favorite uh like sub headline which is you called it a minor pr hiccup yeah so i call this a minor pr hiccup so i wrote this into so i was uh like 24 i think or 25 when i wrote this so whatever you know i've grown and i read my writing i was like oh my god i i wasn't bad then but i'm way better now and so i was a little embarrassed but um the article basically was written after people accused holmes of at first doing something wrong and they were hating on her but previously in the in the previous month in the previous few years she was on the cover of all these same magazines and the point of my article was on the on the on the surface it looked like i was defending her and i was defending her but what i really was also doing and i say this in an article is i was defending this idea that like it's i think it's nonsense and crazy that we build these people up and say that they're like the next you know the next steve jobs or whatever it is and we like want small businesses to win and someone starts a business and we want them to win but then once they get really successful or potentially like uh they're considered like a winner we turn on them and we just hate them just because they're doing something like that seems really weird and they talk funny or they look funny and i thought that's [ __ ] so i stand by that second half because now that's even the whole anti takazi thing is even bigger but yeah i was wrong i i was so wrong about her yeah it's just you see so many cases of a lot of these hit pieces that are totally not fair to founders that like your guard was up enough that you didn't see that this was the time that they were actually right she fooled me man she fooled me she she took you in with her deep voice and those big eyes dude she got me i was so important here's why i was on board with it and the reason why i was on board with it is really a i can't decide if it's a good reason or a bad reason and you tell me so their biggest backer was tim draper i don't know tim but i used to be friends with his son and his friend's son billy is an awesome dude and from what i've read about tim tim seems amazing i know that he's like this like high integrity very honest person he seems like a great guy he don't party on drink and he's known for like being one of the first investors in spacex i believe first investor in hotmail so a bunch of these like really amazing companies that helped found the internet and create the internet and everything and he was super on board with the theranos for a long time and so i was thinking well there's no way that tim draper would do something um or like would be tricked by this because he obviously didn't know but he's like there's no way that tim would be tricked by this and that's why i was like on board yeah and just to back you up uh just reading from the article it's expected that a young company that's attempting to change a massive and archaic industry will mess up it appears that theranos made a bunch of mistakes and i'm not defending their actions i'm also not saying that the media shouldn't point out the truths about theranos's mistakes either you just go on to say uh talk about how the the cycle kind of flipped on him so yeah i mean it is true what you're saying but it is still funny to have an article up with that headline and i didn't delete it on purpose so brown three years ago someone made fun of me for that article and i was like i'm not deleting that well keep it up it's all right i got it wrong if i'm gonna if i'm gonna take swings i gotta let people see the misses too yeah absolutely um all right wanna go one more topic yeah we got four minutes so all right so you tweeted out something that was pretty cool what was it okay so it was essentially we started a new family tradition in my family this year which is well and it was just my wife and i doing it because we we started we're going to try and roll out to my siblings and my parents didn't she make a presentation yes so what it is is that i decided it was kind of my idea that at the end of the year we're going to make presentations about how the past year went and essentially what our goals are for the coming year in our resolutions and that type of stuff and we're going to present it at like a family board meeting it could be a slide deck it could be like a memo but it's essentially called the board meeting the family board is sitting there and you have to present on your ear it looked like she was presenting to a bunch of people yeah it was just you it was yeah it's just me oh my god but okay so and i should say we're not totally crazy like we did it kind of funny all right i dressed up as steve jobs gold glasses uh i'm not criticizing you i think it's cool i don't know the wrong idea that we were like getting hardcore going over our numbers like a lot of it was was kind of funny it was played for chuckles but it was a good opportunity to just reflect on what we've done and uh and what we hope to do this year and and uh and go over so what was the uh did is that effective yeah i mean some of the stuff so let me read some of this stuff actually um because i do the same i do the same thing so my wife actually collects the stats and your wife's pretty alpha right yeah she graduated from uh a top law school in the country and then for georgetown um yeah it's good it's good law school and then she works for a big law firm now so she took stats she like tracks all her mother stuff because we had a baby last november um and so i couldn't believe some of the stuff so like gallons of milk that her body produced in 2021 350. gross isn't that crazy how does that make you see your body do that that is crazy i know that's that blew my mind 350. my god so much there's so much so you're trying that's all there is you track how much milk your wife made yeah she also kept track of how many nights she slept on the floor in our daughter's room because like sometimes she wouldn't sleep and so 104 nights almost a third of the year yeah she slept on the floor in claire's room um the number of hours she spent nursing her was 1800 um and then we wait 1800 in one year yeah wow man being a woman is so much harder i know that that did help me realize like wow that's just like that's another job in addition to your job like holy moly that's crazy what else uh any others yeah um she counted the number of times my daughter was obsessed with this book monsters come out tonight which is halloween book she read it 62 times why does she do all this your wife just because she wants to show your kids i don't know she's just compulsive actually she is she's the type of person where in the morning she'll go do you know what today is and i never know because she always knows weird anniversaries in her head she's like oh it's it's ten months since this happened and i'm like how do you know that um but she like compulsively tracks little numbers in her head so she apparently tracks him on her phone too dude your wife's rain man that's sick she's like like a lactating rain man that's love that i might have to delete that i don't know i'll have to think hard before i decide whether to publish an episode in which we call her a lactating rain man um that's cool so what do you mean it's a compliment though right you mean as a couple yeah well it's neither a compliment well the rayman is the lactating thing is just fact um the rayman thing is definitely a compliment um do you uh do do you is she care is she earning more than you as you start your business yes that's pretty sick right it's nice i don't mind it you uh is she paying for everything um no so she's actually still net negative because she just graduated in um whatever in the summer and didn't start school until october um so i my goal is for us to never have a year where she earns more than me not for any like sexist reasons i just you know it's a gold mine so i got to make more money than her this year but yeah in the last quarter of last year she made more money than me so all right and that's actually like i think there's a lot of guys who are self-conscious about that i uh feel the opposite i'm like i want you like i want to be the lazier of like i want her to earn more and just maybe like not have to work i am self-conscious about it i i do like i'm happy for her to have a career but like it's not so much like uh self-conscious about her making money but it is like a little bit of like a step it up you got to get your business into a place where you're out earning me like look what i'm out here doing you know that's sick though it's pretty sick i think you know how like there's articles that talk about like your best financial decision my opinion is the best financial decision you can make of course this is a good decision for a lot of other reasons but the best financial decision is marrying the right woman amen or picking the right spouse rather or just staying married right did you have you had the millionaire next door where they're like no what did they say it they look at all these factors that like most millionaires have and this is not silicon valley millionaires it's like auctioneers and construction com you know company owners and they say like here are all these factors like most have never purchased a suit for more than i think it's like 800 most have never paid more than 200 for a watch most in the vast vast majority of them never got divorced don't get divorced then that's great crazy and i think even if you get a prenup i don't think that that like it it doesn't does a prenup only work for the earnings that you made before you got married yes so then who cares in most cases exactly because you get married i got married at 25 i was worth jack [ __ ] right and all the money that i've made in my life has been since i've got i've been married 21 years so does a prenup cover if you start a business and it's worth nothing and then you get married and 10 years later it's worth a lot does that do is this which one does that count as that i do not know what i do know is a friend of mine got married got a prenup and he had crypto and he specified like this my hundreds of bitcoin are excluded and they've gone up in values and they're still excluded but i don't know if company shares act the same way i would guess they would but you know we'd have to get a lawyer on here why are we streaming [Music] it's like the worst sad topic no here's why we're covering it because um ben's ben quit his job to start a podcast a popular a podcast that's going pretty well and he works for us part time as a producer and he his wife is a very successful lawyer and i asked him i said you know like a lot of men might be self-conscious about that about your wife earning significantly more than you how does it make you feel and uh i was just curious has your wife ever earned more than you rob well that's a good question um well your businesses are like family businesses kind of right yeah i mean she runs her own thing dude i actually think i mean yeah so when i left drip two years ago i sold a company and then i left it in 2018 i didn't work for six months but it's like so i wasn't hurting anything but then even after that like starting tiny seed i didn't take a paycheck for a year and she was making several hundred grand at her business so yes she has but it's also like yeah but i sold a comp i i think i'm excused at this point you know i uh my wife became a millionaire a liquid millionaire before i did that's awesome because it did by two months was it like stock or what would you she worked at airbnb for a long time and then it went public in december and i sold my company in february so she beat me by two months you didn't feel you didn't feel bad about that at all did you dude i was pumped for her i was so i mean the way that everything is ours so it was like frankly when she got paid i was like oh i just got paid too i mean i thought it was awesome um we're live now by the way rob uh great are you okay with that absolutely sir i'm always i'm always i was born ready yeah so uh this is rob walling rob you uh you i was just on your pod like uh two weeks ago did it go well yeah i got a lot of positive feedback actually what was interesting is someone said a couple people said you guys have real great rapport and i said which is funny because we've never met it's not like we're best friends but they said you sounded like you were friends you're naturals you know and i said i think it's it's easy to have a podcaster on a show because they're just entertaining naturally and i've been reading your work for like 10 years um and so or i forget how long but basically ben we so this is ben ben works with us um he's filling in for sean today we uh i sent rob like an email like in 2000 and i forget he like pulled it up but i sent like my first email to him like years ago saying how much i loved his content and then i was finally on his podcast like eight years later so it worked out yeah and that helps that familiarity certainly helps i know that people who listen to my podcast and then appear on it know what to expect and they're able to to roll with it which is why before coming on here i i i've listened to your show on and off over the years but like i listened to like the last four episodes just so i would have some familiarity what did you think i think they're great you gotta get a show here i think you should change the name of the show is what i think you should i think the names off the name is horrible i know it's tough and man i have you know my podcast is startups for the rest of us which i still like but it feels long now and i've debated whether to to change it have you guys actually considered it because i'm curious what would go what would need to go into a name change the problem is is we considered it like a year ago when we were smaller but then we were like back then we were like uh we're too big back when we were did that we we were at like three or four hundred thousand units a month and or a visitor or um listeners a month and we were like oh but we're too big it already is stuck now we just in december we crossed two million uh lessons a month and we're like now we're definitely like we're definitely too big and darmesh who is the founder of hubspot who now owns a podcast he was like you gotta change the name and i'm like darmash it's way too late and he's like no it's not and so he thinks we should do it i think it's too late in the game frankly i think a bad name sometimes is a good is a good thing but the name is quite horrible and i feel embarrassed to tell my barber and stuff and they're like well what's it about i'm like i'm not sure but not much but yeah it's not about making your first million that's for sure yeah it's not get rich quick it's like a real business podcast and that's that's the thing is since you have subscribers because what i've thought about is like let's say we change the name of you know of startups for the rest of us i think i just changed it in the rss feed i change it with apple and spotify and then it just propagates i think people i need new line you know liner art or whatever i think people be confused for a few weeks and i guess all the incoming links would say sort of the rest of us are my first million but aside from that i just don't know the backlash it's it's it's less of like changing the name of a company is really hard right because of the brand you've built but changing them a podcast i think is so i i'd like to think it's simpler but i've never done it our friend nathan uh started this company called convertkit which is amazing and i'm an investor in and it was crushing and he changed the name to something i forget what he changed the name yeah which apparently does that mean something offensive in hindi it wasn't offensive but it was it it it has like a spiritual meaning and so the back he had backlash right and it was about cultural appropriation was the kind of phrase that was used yeah it's like a it's a word in a different language and people were like you can't name your company that and i he's not a he's like at the time was probably like a 50 company they probably did some research but they mostly like just probably read the definition in a dictionary thought it sounded cool and then like a week later they changed it back to convertkit which i think is a great idea convertkit's a good name yeah it's that's that's the other thing with the name change is okay so you're going to change my first million what are you going to change it to because naming is really hard right are you very hard i know some people who are really good at it most people are not including myself i struggle with naming i always go too literal we would hire i would hire one of those like naming firms i actually think that i think a naming firm is actually a great idea yeah at this level and at the at the the kind of reach that you have and the stakes and the race i guess the resources you have it would be a no-brainer yeah really good i don't i don't know do you listen to tropical nba podcasts by chance yeah i like those guys yeah they had a really good kind of lower budget naming person i say lower budget let's say five grand 10 grand versus you know you can pay a hundred grand or more um she was super sharp it was such a good episode and she had like an ebook on how she does it and i was intrigued by that just because look you and i are going to be putting out new whether we rename things or putting out new stuff for the rest of our lives so how do we get better at this right that's something i want to do yeah what were you saying ben i i you actually answered the question i was gonna ask which is how much is a naming service but there you go but i mean you know i i think like the thing about my first million like you said sometimes a bad name is a good name because the thing is it forces someone to react like someone has to have an opinion about my first million they might not like it but they're not gonna just like forget about it they're like oh what's that but dude my companies are called the hustle horrible name hustle con horrible name once i'm at a conference on content i call the con con no a meetup series called pizza and 40s uh our subscription service called trends like i'm not good at like i i like i've done trends is good the hustle has been bad the rest of them are tough because the hustle hustle now has this negative it has for several years this hustle culture right has a negative connotation so i guess if you're leaning into that at least it gets attention but it's a tough one to do so rob how do you describe your your who you are in a professional sense how do because i was going to introduce you but you're you're pretty eclectic that i don't even know how to the proper way to do it yeah i mean bottom line man i used to be a software developer and then i didn't want to work for other people so i started startups and first it was i mean in 2006 it was downloadable software there really wasn't sas and then it it became sas right that's what you do now if you're in software um so i became a founder serial entrepreneur launched a few acquired a few and along the way started blogging about it as you know as you were saying i wrote a couple i've written three books about bootstrapping startups i bootstrapped everything i never raised funding i'm not anti-funding i'm not i think funding has a time and a place but i am anti the narrative that in order to start a startup you have to raise funding because i that is just not the case i think one percent of companies one percent of tech companies need funding and the other 99 really shouldn't shouldn't do it so around 2011 then started a podcast and then uh no that's 2010 and then 2011 started my events called microconf and um and then just a couple years ago launched an accelerator for sas bootstrappers so you um i wanted to go to microconf years ago i remember that and i didn't have enough money to to go so i'm gonna have to go soon but how what were the name of some of your software companies i know drip and can you reveal like how big some of these grew to yeah drip crew into well i mean drip is tens of millions now but i sold it in in 20 what year was that 2016. grew it to a few million bucks before i sold it you grew to three three three million dollars a year in revenue and then it uh now does tens of millions of dollars oh yeah absolutely i mean this is email email service providers or really any type of sas um if you double down on it like and you stick around for a long time this stuff just it compiles it it goes up every month if you're doing it right do you regret selling it no never never a day have i woken up and thought i really wish i was still working on that like i learned we were a team of 10 when we sold it and i learned what i needed to learn and it was enough money that i never had to work again and that had been a goal i was 41 maybe when i sold it and that was a lifelong goal you know to have enough money to not work again yep and i knew i would i knew i would work well what was your number well i don't want to tell you how much no but you don't tell me what you sold for but like in like when you said my goal is to earn this much like what was the threshold of not having to work oh that's interesting you know when i was 25 i just thought it was millions i never actually calculated it and then as i got into my 30s i started saying well what's this four percent rule thing that you hear about in personal finance right and i actually think the four percent rule is [ __ ] um i think you need to be you need to be a little more cautious so it's about three three and a half percent so then the rule is if you need if you want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year to live on and you have five million dollars in the bank then the idea is that if you do the four percent roll you can take out 200 grand a year and never um touch the principal because stocks and bonds and other investments or are do and inflation are working there so a three percent rule would give you about 150 grand so i'm not using my numbers but you get the idea so it quickly became apparent to me that when i was in my 30s of like i think somewhere it's somewhere between 5 and 10 million i think is most people's number depends on where you live depends on how you live um but i think anything north of 10 is like like it is excess i'll say that i i'm north of 10. and i and i feel like i my life didn't change there was some point in between five and ten where it was like yeah that's enough you know i still like having the money and i do things with it but um definitely it's not like i would have had to work again even with a major stock market downturn or something that's pretty cool three million with ten employees is a pretty sick business when it's software it was very efficient we were also really i mean i was bootstrapped i should have raised a round i should have raised a seed round because it was way stressful and i was uh i burned out pretty hard on it and that was part of there were several factors into selling for me and i'm curious if you you know have talked about why you sold as well but for me it was like number one if i can never if i can have enough money that i control my own destiny for the rest of my life that was a big win it was the only way i would sell that was the only reason why i sold is it's just like take the cash off now you can do anything i mean i started a damn startup accelerator right so i we fund uh bootstrap sas founders i'm not gonna make money from that and that's a five to ten year play to make real money right to actually get the carry back i take a salary but it's like a token what i could be making somewhere else um and so i can now do play long ball with it because i'm not thinking oh how am i gonna you know how am i gonna do my big score i never wanted to be worth my goal was never i need 100 million or i need a billion it would be i'd be fine with that but that's not that wasn't the goal it was to have that freedom i sold to have that but i wish the thing about my company is that i loved it i mean i still i'm still here and i love it um like i hate it and i hated uh like there was days where i'm like this sucks i hate media i hate dealing with people of course i had like those normal things but like the thing is is that like i started my company because i was just blogging for fun when it didn't make money and i didn't actually think it was going to make money and now that i have something i still do this because i just am a compulsive and i love it and so i love my company i just wish i wish i was wealthy that i didn't have to sell it do you know what i mean yep and so because now i know i'm gonna go and start it again one day you're gonna have to start something and that one you won't have to sell right you'll be in a position where you can decide to to do it or not and you can make bigger bets because if it goes to zero it's not like you're sitting where i was in 2015 where it's like i am literally worth millions and millions of dollars on paper and i have actual liquid net worth about 400 grand in retirement savings between my wife and i and i have about 50 000 in the bank and our house which had no equity because it was you know it had gone down or whatever so that was it so i was like i felt way overexposed to something tragic happening when you are doing three million in recurring revenue um i'm not sure if how you do like if people pay up front or what what not but like i've seen convertkit's numbers like all the public stuff that they reveal and they're they didn't have a significant amount of cash in the bank was your was your thing the same way where absolutely wait wait because like tenant you think 10 employees making 10 uh make it 3 million like oh you should have like plenty of money but what was the truth the truth is that growth choose just destroys cash like no matter how much cash we made i've i was spending on aws bills i was spending it with send grid i would hire another contractor i would hire another employee the moment we would grow by 10 grand in a month let's say of a monthly recurring and i'm like great now i can hire another engineer because oh my god we are understaffed so at 10 people we were way understaffed um and yeah i'm trying to think uh and that's where like my decision at that point was i'm either going to raise an angel round like a seed round or we should sell it and that was that was the decision of do we double down on this business for another two to four years or am i ready to to you know make make that choice of letting it go and that so that i was a drip user who owns it um well what's interesting so leadpages bought it leadpages had raised um 38 million in venture and they it's actually a parent company right called avenue 81 incorporated that owned leadpages and then acquired drip so there's two products under one umbrella well pretty soon within the avenue 81 you know ceo realized the opportunity here is drip like drip is a multi-billion dollar opportunity whereas landing pages are you know the whole market at the time was 80 million maybe 100 million and that's that sounds like a lot to us but they're venture backed so they need to get to billions in valuation so they actually sold off lead pages and the company is now trip so drip owns drip now you know what i mean like it's it was a turnaround i don't know if you i don't know if you ever heard that this happened with best buy where they acquired a greek squad and now like best buy would not exist without geek squad because that was like all their net profit through the you know last 15 years that essentially that essentially happened with drip they just refocused the whole team they had 170 employees and i got to start hand picking people from the leadpages team and pulling them over to help grow the team so when i left there were 100 and some people working on trip do you feel like see remember like when you're a kid and used to date someone and then you see her with another guy and you like feel just like that that jealous you feel like anger and jealousy and you're sad do you do you still have that do you have that emotion when you see drip i don't and but but i will say that there have been some things that have happened that have that i haven't been happy with so they like raised prices and they didn't do it very well right after i left like a few months after and i was like you guys are better than like i would have done that so differently and if i was in the room i would have said don't do they just did it really fast they didn't grandfather you know they just made kind of all the 101 mistakes and that sucked and i and then there was a huge backlash against drip which is part of my legacy like drip drip is you know what it's like the hustle will always you will always be the founder of the hustle right and i will always be the co-founder of drip they've messed with the ui they've reshaped it and stuff so when i go in now i'm a little bit like ugh i liked it the old way but but i don't feel it's not the ex-girlfriend thing it's more of a i did have to let it go you know and just and just let it go i still use it i i mean i'm in it every day it's such a good tool do that that's a good sign do you um and then microconf was that a big business because i when when i started hustlecon i like research you guys to steal ideas but like also like to make sure it's a good business and i was like well rob's pretty savvy and he's doing it so like yeah i could probably make a profit off this yeah yeah it was definitely you know it was a side project like a hobby all this time right until about two years ago where when i left drip i had this big decision of like i have this podcast at the time i had a co-host with the podcast i'm solo now um had microconf do i sell all of that i literally thought of just leaving the whole entrepreneur like blogging podcasting thing and going and like i was going to acquire a tabletop gaming the second biggest tabletop gaming website all right what's the tabletop yeah you know like settlers of catan or like dungeons and dragons so it's like not like a board game is monopoly right but then there's like the levels above that of complexity and stuff and so which are booming right now huge well covet helped but also they're just they're super popular and so i was like that's a hobby of mine and i was like i really want to do it and then i started talking to the owner of this site who's great great dude and i'm like what are your numbers and he started giving me the numbers and i was like this makes no money this may and he's like yeah dude tabletop games make no money like that you know there's the few there's the katan and there's d there's like 10 or 20. everything else kind of is i mean i'm over generalizing here because certainly there's other but it's not like startup like we are so spoiled with startups where we don't manufacture physical things and and you don't have returns and you don't have excess inventory and you don't have a warehousing and all that stuff and the profit margins are thin and etc etc so that's when i double down um on all of that and so yes your initial question was is micro company good business yes will we sell let's see we'll sell seven feet like low seven figures like a million million and a half dollars i think in top line this year maybe somewhere in that range i need to look at the budget you can tell that i have someone running it because i should know that i would know that number if i was actually like will you be able to and could if you do 1.5 i would i would hope that you probably do like 300 or 400 in profit i think so although here's what we do see we are not running it as a profit machine we are running it almost it's become like a service to the community um and so we run a bunch of the events at break even or lost like our local events are where we go to san jose or atlanta or austin texas we do a one-day event those tend to break even or lose money and we're doing it to try to just expand like the mission is to increase the number of independent startups in the world right that's what we want to do bootstrap startups used to be the term but it's like it's not solely bootstrapped some people raise small amounts of money and to do that we got to get the word out and so we run it at a you know 10 to 20 profit net profit margin and we could make more money we used to make more money um five years ago or whatever but there's just no need to at this point that's a pretty sick uh side like a good hobby it was good it wasn't bef when i still had drip we weren't doing a million because we were you know we're going to do 15 events this year when we were when i was running drip we were doing three but they were big they were big events we would have trying to think of what our top line revenue was even and i was happy you know let's say half a million 600 grand across three events so it was good but it's a brand right man it's like the first year we in 2011 we went to sell tickets and we were like we're gonna sell 200 tickets at 800 a piece or 500 a piece and we sold like 70 at like five years terrible and second year everyone's like you're going to make money off sponsors and yes you will it's going to take you two or three years though to trust you yeah and we almost what i didn't realize with events was they buy like a year in advance so like our first sponsorships were like 2k a piece then we started getting the 50k and 100k but they booked a year in advance and i was like what so like it's a it's a crazy business yeah i personally wouldn't i kept saying to my i had a co-founder with that and then our event producer and i kept saying i don't want to be in the events business right we we had one event and then we expanded it to two because we wanted to do one in europe and then we expanded to three because we went at an earlier stage event and i kept saying i don't want to be in the events business and they kept telling me that's the business this is an events business you've started one you know but i did it more as a community i wanna i always thought of it as a community because that's like microconf has an online community and youtube channel and all that stuff look ben you look like you're about to say something no no i was oh you're laughing uh yeah i was just laughing who who starts a a business an event business and doesn't know it's an event business but uh dude that was the same way i started when i started high school i was like this is this is stupid this is just a means to an end we're getting out of this immediately and then it's like uh it's it's kind of like when you see all your friends starting software companies you're like dude events are embarrassing why would i want this like this is stupid it doesn't it's too hard but then once you get a little more confident in yourself and you're like well if i accept it for like for what it is it's actually pretty neat um yeah and there's nothing like it like in this even let's say pre-covered from 2011 until until this year over the last 10 11 years there's a lot of online communities anyone can start one you get a few hundred people together there are so few people who not only run in person events but who do them well and if you can do that it is an incredible competitive advantage and not even that we have that much competition but it is it's not just like i'm gonna run a business and make money it's like the community of microcomp is so tightly knit and it's because we meet in person you know what i mean you just you have i mean you you've experienced this where you go to an event you meet someone in person and we the retention rate was 60 or 70 so you come back to the next year and everybody kind of knows each other and then you get new blood and you know so there was it built a way better community than if we did not have in-person events so because your job this is your career you see a lot of like crazy software companies some of which maybe aren't necessarily huge but they are could be surprising because you're like i cannot believe someone's making this work and you probably are able to spot lots of opportunities we asked you if you knew of we asked you ahead of time and i'm curious if you ever think of any any software companies where you see and you're shocked at that this is like a problem that needed to be solved yeah i see a bunch so i have some i have some both ideas that i haven't seen implemented that maybe we can dig into later yeah we'll do both of those yep but there so i'll talk about a couple so tiny seed is a startup accelerator i run and so as a result you know we've had across what four batches set right four batches we've had two or three thousand applicants so i've seen a lot of sas companies come through wow and what i've uh i've been surprised by a ton of them let me just look at one right here so crm or kind of customer interactions applied to any niche and the smallest niche you can imagine so like home improvement contractors the founder of builder prime is the size sas we funded it with tinyseed and he had a home improvement project and he said the experience dealing with the contractor the contractor was fine but the communication was like text and then email and it was anytime there's a bunch of text and email that can be a product what was the name bill the what builder prime builder prime builder prime yep and so it's in essence i think he might call it crm for yeah he calls it best crm but really it's not only the sales process but then it's the communication during a home improvement project and so like shouldn't you i would say well shouldn't couldn't use base camp is it like project management or could i use microsoft project like online right because you could but it's like no this is a strongly typed version of that that is completely built for their needs how's this going it's going really well i can't disclose revenue but um i'll say anyone in who's in batch two any of those companies are gonna be you know mid six figures into seven figures right the um founder of hubspot brian halligan came on the pod and he told us that when they i i'm gonna paraphrase the story i might get a little bit wrong he said that when they first started hubspot they were like at a fork in the road and not sure which way they were gonna go and for a minute i think they even created it and even had some sales but they were like well let's like hubspot is a crm but then let's create like lost spot so it's like uh hubspot just for lawyers so instead of like making it one for everyone we're going to make an individual one for different industries and so let's create law spot and just get lawyers to use it and that's kind of basically what this company builder prime is because you would say like why can't you just use hubspot why can't you just use assa whatever you wanted whatever it is i understand and so all right this is a cool company how big is a team on this what what ben my other question is um like do you have any companies rob that you work with that are building apps on top of salesforce or hubspot that are like building in those ecosystems or do you think they should always go the direction of builder prime and just build their entire own ecosys ecosystem we have one who is built on heroku we have one who's kind of built he has a wordpress plug-in kind of built on wordpress they're actually doing really well it's castos it's podcast hosting they're they're into seven figures but there's no you know so the thing is is with building on hubspot or salesforce there's this platform risk right because i had an angel investment that was doing really well was built on shopify was a shopify app and they started killing it and then shopify came and knocking and said you got to start paying us big chunk your revenue or we shut you down i mean really you know i i would say it's shady [ __ ] but it is what it is it's platform risk right um so that's where we have to be aware like if you go to sell a sas company and you're solely built on top of a platform you sell for a lower multiple than if you were on your own so as a result what we say when folks come in and apply and say hey i'm only on heroku or if we see shopify apps come through we had to have seen salesforce apps come through i don't remember hubspot one to be honest but what we say is cool it's not a non-starter but how are you thinking about this are you building for what other platforms are you building for how do you escape that because by the you know when you're 500 grand a year no one cares when you're 5 million a year on a platform they notice and that there's there's a danger there that's that's pretty cool that's interesting i i mean i knew that was true but i didn't know that shopify could change the prices that they charged seen it happen firsthand yeah what else is just go ahead yeah there's another one um this one's interesting it's called scraping b and the cool part about them is they are public with their revenue so i can actually at least give an idea so they crossed a million dollars in annual recurring uh just two three months ago and if you look at what it is is it's they allow you if you want to um scrape the web right if it's like well i want to get all you know the products off of this particular e-commerce site you can go in and it's not a gui like you need to write a little bit of code but then they have all the servers that allow you to get around being blocked by apis or whatever and when you think about this idea it's it's like well that sounds like a nice little 510k a month idea right they're doing north of uh you know probably a hundred hundred grand a month right now i haven't looked at their revenue recently like it says yeah it's two employees it's the two founders they're doing it's crazy we're encouraging them to hire actually because here's the problem let's say they wanted to sell i'm not saying they do but if they wanted to that's a problem like they would they would be worth more if they or a team of five or ten than if they're only two because they're making a bunch of profit but it's there's risk there right do they is this like uh one of those uh public revenue things on like the bare metrics or whatever you know i think they just disclose it on twitter pierre to wolves yeah and it's like every couple months he'll say when they hit a milestone he'll be like we hit this and um the co-founder i mean co-founders pierre and kevin are really cool and transparent and they talk a lot about its content and seo and they have grown crazy fast i believe and my memory serves me correctly that when they joined tiny seed they were at 4k a month and this was two years ago tops 18 months two years i'd you know so it's like to go from 4k to ostensibly what 90k 100k they're in that range a month um pretty cool these guys should raise money maybe yeah they should they could if they wanted to it's up to them right but the valuations right now for a company that's growing quick that has a million in revenue is like 50 to 100 million dollars yeah it's nuts i know so like if you could raise five million dollars and just do five i mean that's kind of interest that'd be that'd be easy to justify right but it depends on the founder right it's like that's one of the things that a lot of bootstrappers they don't want to get on that once you raise that money now you're on the venture track right and it's like i gotta raise every month yeah but we're different tiny seeds for bootstrappers and so with tinyseed folks can run their business and take profits out we actually fund llc's and they can take profits out if they want or they get paid we get paid if they take profits out because we we you know buy a percentage of their equity so basically if they take dividends out we pros you know serve pro rata in those or if they were to sell the company again we own stock so or units and llc's so we get that percentage uh when they sell but is that actually going to be profitable for you you think more so than um trying to get trying to do the traditional model where you throw [ __ ] at the wall in 10 maybe works right well we we are still in the traditional model of we've funded six 59 60 companies to date and we will fund another 100 and we have enough money right now to fund another 120 150 in the next three years so we are still in that model of making a lot of bets what we're what we see is that our bets like i don't think we will have a billion dollar outcome i just don't see that being reasonable i think we have a lot of 10 to 50 10 to 100 million outcomes and the num we've run a bunch of models and in fact if you go to tinycity.com thesis you will see my co-founder is a data was a data scientist phd computer science and we ran a bunch of back testing on anonymous sas data uh i think it was several thousand companies and looked at our our funding approach versus you know what it would return and it will return venture-like returns with i believe lower downside risk because we invested we invested the early stage at low valuations in essence wow what else is interesting to you um yeah you want another another company no tell me what ideas do you think there's opportunities in yes all right so here's so i always when i start with ideas i'm i'm such a b2b sass founder right so i start with the problem right and so first any time i see someone doing something in excel or or a google sheet i think to myself that could that's an idea right if you take it or if there's a bunch of email you know or text back and forth um those are because it's communication or it's just storage there's a couple things that um i'm pretty fascinated by so one is podcast apps are doing quite well like we're in riverside now we've funded i'm invested in squad cast which is a competitor of riverside um both of them we're using riverside now we use squad cast we use zencaster i was with them before yeah with squadcast and then of course podcast hosting right there's castos and lib liz libsyn and and others and i think even podcast editing like alex we use i use audacity and then my editor uses adobe something or other but like ali2 ali to use podcast editing in the browser so like the stack starting to get there we have disparate tools to do things but when hubspot launched so i so i know darmash right darmesh and i were bloggers and speakers we met at bos in 2008 or something so i remember when hubspot launched and i remember thinking but all of these things exist like in the early days hubspot was like it was like a a blog i think plus a marketing website plus google analytics plus i don't remember what something email capture form or something like that it was very simple but i was like i could but i remember saying darmesh but i could build that you know with mailchimp plus wordpress you know and he's like yeah but business owners don't want to do that they want a bundle and he was right i think and he was right i said they're public and where you guys are an amazing company i think of the same thing with podcast production where i right now i mean i've been running a podcast for 11 years and i have you know people helping with it and i literally am in notion dragging this thing over here and then sending an e that sends an email to my producer to do something that we then log into castos to upload you know what i mean it's like where's the hub spot for that where's the bundling of the podcast stack i have a strong opinion i have two strong opinions the first is i'm almost certain no i'm partially certain that for the most part podcasting software and podcasting tools is a horrible business because a few reasons very few podcasts are successful and most all of them are broke here's my here's the counterpoint to this right because i would like to because i am an investor so i see the numbers all right um squad casts doing several million a year in revenue and they're not doing it on the fly fishing podcast think of the three avatars for a podcast there there's the hobbyist my dungeons and dragons podcast my fly fishing and they're gonna they're broke and they're gonna pay nine bucks a month right and they're gonna churn like crazy because they're gonna start it's too much work all right then there's the next tier up which is startups for the rest of us i'd say my first million is in that where it's like a single show but if i go to pay a hundred dollars a month for squad cast riverside 100 a month for coasting it's not a big deal to me right and i don't think it is to you there so it's not nine dollars but for you it's like a hundred i think if i were to say oh my first movie should pay 500 a month for each of these you start to feel like i'm not sure that's worth it but there's a number there okay so there's a and they and we don't churn i mean i've been doing it for 12 years you guys have been doing it for several it's like the the the s b of of podcast it's the smb that actually sticks around there's hobbyists there's smb then there's one level up so there's i heart radio there's espn's podcast there's the kevin smith podcasts smodcast right there is kara swisher has a whole network gimlet media npr like once they especially once they went remote that's the enterprise but how many of those are there because for example like vox i think vox was trying to sell their cm like it's all media companies are like oh we built this proprietary technology to like get our articles shared better and like things like that and like cool i would love that technology but they want to go out like washington post is doing this they want to go out and sell their software and i'm like how many [ __ ] media companies could pay 100 grand a year for software most media companies are broke and so that's my same thing to podcasters but all right i agree those exist i want to be i need to be convinced that there's like enough of them ben was going to say something we should let him say i was blown away so we got a pitch from one of these recording companies one of the ones that rob mentioned i won't say which but i assumed that the pro tier that rob was talking about would be like 10x what a normal plan was and it was like 100x it was like it was like plus a month for um a month a month a month for some of these features yeah and um the squad i was blown away i could not believe it i was blown away but anyways you know it's worth it for for a lot of people so anyway for that type of company you don't need that many customers i think is is maybe the point really do you get crazy amounts of features with dollars a month i mean they're cool they are cool features they're cool features wow that is crazy that does sound high i will admit that's crazy that's where you don't need that you don't need that many okay so podcasting is you're saying it's a good business because there's actually enough customers to to make it work right yeah yeah and podcasting has this other thing that that is i think undervalued or just not talked about enough it's this concept of a dual funnel or a split funnel where you have you know who else has this is um electronic signature e-signature has this where you have this super wide funnel there's either free users or very inexpensive users on the low end and so a lot of people use it thus you build a brand and you just have five thousand ten thousand customers whatever uh some are just users summer customers you also if you have any type of viral loop that's amazing right you send the link to squad caster riverside you send a link to get a document signed oh a little bit of virality but then on the top end with the signature similarly you have realty mortgage brokers who i need 8 000 documents a month signed and suddenly that's at 10 20 30 grand a month that dual funnel is incredible because when if you're just enterprise then you're enterprise right and it's like oracle in the old days it's like all right so we need to close 500 deals this whole year but each deal is a million or two million bucks right i mean that's it's like these massive deals and it's just this grind of enterprise sales but when you have the low end funnel and the high end funnel it's um it feeds on itself and it helps you have a more stable business the companies that are able to charge uh six figures a year in software do you think that a lot of times their software is actually better than the five dollar a month tools that are in the same category but for different people like is it is it you know if a coup if it's five dollars a month versus five hundred thousand dollars a year is it actually a thousand times better no it's not and i would it's not um five dollars a month i would say or whatever a more accurate one is like you know is if i'm paying 250 250 a month versus 25 000 a month let's say that's it's a 100x difference those are probably relatively similar and in fact a lot of the pricing advice we give to our founders um or i give on the podcast as well is the moments someone approaches you a potential customer and says cool we like your software we need to redline your terms of service or we need uh to invoice with pos or we need single sign-on or we need a salesforce integration or we need there's there's this whole list of things that instantly should trigger you should pay about a hundred times more that your price should go because the sheer headache of dealing with procurement and going through that process and the maintenance and all the you know the interaction it's not that the software is better it's that the the time and the headache and the pain of making that sale and maintaining that customer is um that's where it's at right that's where the money spent but is it that hard to like uh do the single sign-on or like isn't there is there not like an 80 20 thing that you can do whereas like it works for most high-end customers well there's two things right it's are we pricing on value because i price on value right there's price you can price on cost you can price on value what's a third i forget what the other one is anyways but certainly i'm not pricing my sas on cost because i would have no margin right so i'm going to try to price based on the value and um i could build single sign on it's like hey let's let everyone have it but it's a trigger that that company has the ability to pay and frankly are going to get a lot more value out of it than a one-person team using it right you know it's like gimlet media versus rob walling comes to you know sign up for your podcast recording it's like gimlet media should pay a lot more than me not because they they need that many more features but they just should their whole business is built on it and they're making millions it matters more to them yeah any other ideas that interest you at the moment oh yeah um so i gotta be honest man i mean this is not even a sas idea i'm just gonna throw it out you know you do you know the website examine.com my favorite website out there yeah i would put it in top ten i'm a pain i'm a paying member there's a new one that i'm looking at called uh consumer it's like examine.com but for uh brands for vitamin brands anyway examine his nutrition information you can trust so i interviewed the founder uh on my i love soul self he's great i interviewed him on the podcast sherry my wife's been friends with him for several years since i met at an event so had him on the show and i was fascinated by it because i'm like it's nutrition information you can trust right and you know that but i'm saying it for the audience where is the examine.com for crypto and nft like for web3 stuff because i feel like there's so much crazy info out there and there's so many opinions and religious you know not truly religious but like religious fervor and the and the bitcoin maximalist and [ __ ] and it's like someone can do this right in the business so let's talk about that examine i've talked about examine on the pod a ton because i think it's one of those sites that i see i don't think i know how big they are i mean like i would imagine like not big like two or three million a year in revenue but i have no idea that's just a guess but i know it's not big because they don't hire a ton of people and i was like this is one of the most under monetized sites i've i know well i actually think that their examine could be significantly examined could be a hundred million dollar a year business i think how how do you think so there's a bunch of so i would i think that they for one they don't do any affiliates so something like wire cutter you know wire cutter uh so in um in new york times you know they're a publicly traded company their the wire cutter revenue got classified now as uh like other revenue so i've been trying to like decipher it and figure it out and they do something like close to nine figures in sales from affiliate affiliates examine doesn't want to do that but i think they i think they could i think they could do it a tasteful way and it could work wonderfully because what examine doesn't do is they don't tell you which brands to buy but i think they should because that's what i want and that's what a lot of people want additionally i think you could sell to doctors so there's actually another company out there that does like four or five hundred million dollars a year in sales and they sell to doctors and when you go to the doctor and you have like a rash they just like it's like wikipedia for doctors they like look it up and like the latest studies are there on that interesting and examine you know i didn't talk to us all about that but they don't want to do it because they don't do they not want it to taint the they want to become a review site i mean that's why we don't trust review sites right is that but i trust some i trust wirecutter yeah i mean i think i think there's this way to solve for that like like dude like if casey neistat is a youtuber who i like if he tells me a cool product and then there's an affiliate link there i don't care that it's an affiliate link right but anyway uh exam i also think examine.com could work for injuries oh like medical like hey my knee because to get the definitive yeah this is that or just illnesses in general right you google symptoms and like rehab yeah are you sick or injured enough to make that a thing that you would pay monthly subscription for not me well i don't know i i don't know if you could make money through subscriptions with that but i do think that like when you have like an achilles injury and you're like i'm desperate i'll do anything i just need to learn like because i remember when i was researching for my like i had a pain in my leg i was like i like i went to all the studies and i just read all the studies i'm like i'm just going to figure this out i'm not going to read like a how article and how to do this i'm just going gonna go to source and like what's the what's the thing that i'm reading about the studies but how does uh rob do you know how does examine.com operate like how does that literally work because all they do is they like pour through all the studies and find the ones that have a good sample size that have definitive proof and they make a list of like these work for sure and then they have another list that says these seem like they might be able to work but we can't say for certain and then these are [ __ ] don't trust pretty much yep and they their big hit early on he said all this on the podcast it was it was all seo right it was organic and then they took a google dive at some point i don't know when it was but um they had already implemented their subscription revenue i don't even think that they had ads at one point i don't know that they do anymore i'm actually on the site looking around but yeah that's it that's how they write the topic and their what is their value it's the brand it's the trust you know what i mean that's why everyone goes to it because they have built that brand that you you trusted and i trust it but but how do they do that though do they literally just have one hey go uh all right editorial team this week you steve your writer your writing topic is um um building muscles so go and research everything that helps you go research creatine protein so if i were them i would be looking they've been around for a decade now all the topics have been covered i'm only looking for new information right i'd be monitoring all the journals all the whatevers and have subscriptions to all that i don't know exactly how to do it but that that would be it right it's having having a google alerts essentially for all the new medical stuff to just update you just want to keep it updated that's crazy i can't imagine there's a new topic they haven't already covered in their thousands of pages and this would actually make way more money in crypto totally i mean there's several there's several niches where this this would be interesting the hardest part is there's a bunch of crypto news sites and when i go to them i just don't know i don't trust them yeah i don't know like are these guys like these like hardcore libertarian the world's gonna end [ __ ] money like [ __ ] uh cash because it's just stupid or it are that you know like a great way to explain it is like basically do you remember like the mac versus pc ads where there was like uh like a cool looking mac guy versus a nerdy pc guy and you remember that animosity created between mac and pc guys now imagine if each person who owned a mac or a pc had a million dollars of apple stock that's like that's like the the that's like the vibe that you're gonna get that's right and it's religious fervor with money behind it and so it's very hard for me to hear a cryptic guy even sean shawn's one of my best friends and he but i know he's got a lot of crypto so i'm like but is this because you are you telling me what you want to happen or what you think will happen right so it's actually really interesting what would you do to build that i would start so first thing you have to do is build credibility you have to start there so i'd probably start a podcast so that people could hear my thinking week to week um i would definitely be attending all of the crypto events anywhere to get into the network to build trust because if people don't if you're anonymous like if you try to build this anonymously no one's no one's going to believe it so i would get into the network and then follow the model i would look at what did exam and do we know anyone who has done this model what did they do in terms of of uh content and then obviously just hire writers and look at the white papers and give our opinions and this is actually a cool business because this business could last a hundred years so like if you look at like um consumer reports consumer reports has been around for a decade decades they still do well into the nine figures of revenue so consumer reports is a you know review site that people pay money for they're a non-profit so all of their expenses are public all their revenue is public and everything and they're still growing and so like if you do a good job of building a brand like on this topic and you start reviewing stuff and you do a good job you can review many other things and last for a very long time it's kind of a cool company yeah yeah they are still kicking anything else interests you i am interested in i mean this you know normally i'm boring bit boring businesses are my favorite right because it's like b2b sas is is the way to go um i think anytime you can take a concept like we've said with builder prime um you know where it was just like crm for customers we have another company we funded called client hub which is basically project management crm for accountants and then we have another one that's called gymdesk which is basically run your gym business on that it's like kind of crm and communication so it's like where how many niches are there where that works some of these are going to be seven or eight for your businesses some of the niches are going to be very very small um but that's where you just have to pick it's like hey am i a lifestyle bootstrapper because i want a 10 20 000 a month business um but i like these ideas of you know it it depends on your ambition but if you want to stay small and just build an incredibly profitable business with two people working on a you know 100 grand a month i mean you can enter a less competitive space if you want to grow big and grow faster then you enter a space like electronic signature or like calendar scheduling links which we've funded companies in both like calendly competitor and you know and hello sign competitor or whatever they're a lot of competition you have to move faster but the market opportunity there is just tremendous do you what do you how do you decide if it's going to be a eight figure idea or much smaller is there a metric that you look for yeah that's an interesting question i usually so with tiny seed companies when they apply we say if your ambition is to build a seven-figure annual recurring revenue company then you're in the right place we get some people who say i really want just a half million dollar business it's like great that's going to be a great business for you but that's not really fundable for us it just doesn't make sense um i think a big piece of can it get into the you know and we'd love to see mid seven figures and up right um but a big question of can it get there a lot of it it's less about market size because most markets are big enough there are few markets that are too small most of it is uh the metrics of the business is where we look at the churn and we look at the pricing and so if you're if everybody's too price sensitive to your point earlier if everyone's a fly fisherman podcast and everyone's paying you in you know 10 to 20 bucks a month and that's kind of where most people are and then your churn is 10 like i you just can't you know almost impossible to build a million two million dollar business but when you get to the point where hey my average revenue per user is 100 or 500 a month and your churn is two or three percent you would have to own the whole market like there's almost any market is big enough that that can be a 5 million business all right my last question um how many of these folks building software companies that you see yourself included are non-technical that's a great question and if they are non-technical what do they do yep um so i'm a developer or it was i haven't written code in years but we actually at so we do a state of independent sas survey and we put out a report and it like an industry report and we asked the question do you have at least one technical founder right or you know and yes or no right and the number of sas companies kind of bootstrap dish sas companies with zero with no technical founders is like 20 i believe it's 20 percent 25 it's very possible it is and usually what the expertise they have they're either the subject matter expert like we're gonna build software for accountants i was an accountant for 20 years right we're going to software for ux designers i was a designer for 10 years they're either that or they're sales or marketing that's what they should have now we've seen where there's a developer and then there's like the business person the business guy or what just means it's like anything yeah it usually winds up meaning you're not actually that helpful and you probably shouldn't be a co-founder you know if you can't sell or market or like have input on the product yeah or or develop it like those are really the four roles um you probably shouldn't be so if i'm if i like i'm not tech i'm not technical but i um i can like i stuff together and use zapier and i'm super creative how do i start a start a software company without hiring or i would if maybe hiring zip but without having a co-founder right so for you since you have money you would either acquire something because there's always stuff for sale that you may want to acquire and then just grow if you have a content marketing expertise or you would hire you know a developer or an agency or something to build it if you don't have the money uh a lot of people non-technical will work a day job and actually funnel money to the side to basically pay for a developer to do it um the other two approaches i've seen are exactly what you said which is i'm going to build my minimum viable product using zapier and notion and chewing gum right and i'm just going to cobble it together to the point where hey if i get a few grand a month in revenue this proves it and i'm going to use that to get it built it's a harder way to go but it's possible the last one i've seen which is genius and this is what the founder castos did because he's not he's a single founder not a developer he worked a day job he started a productized service podcast editing and he hi he got it up to i forgot what the number was 30 or 40 grand a month in productized podcast he was one of the earlier ones it was called podcast motor he was working a day job the whole time so then while he was actually doing the editing or he would he did it first and then and then got someone overseas exactly yep yeah yep or even even has folks in u.s and canada doing it um and there was enough profit margin that he then started reinvesting you know and said well now i want to build now that i'm doing podcast hosting he actually was in the podcast space someone says i have this wordpress podcast plugin for podcast hosting on wordpress and i want someone to kind of adopt it type thing since he was doing something in public they approached him he bought it for not very much money and then he built the entire you know what again is a seven-figure business he's raised you know three aside from us he's raised three quarters of a million dollars and it's grown fast so that's the other way to do it is like i even i was a developer and i had to do it nights and weekends too you know when i was pulling money away from the day job for the agency and hiring a developer what what's the best way to do that do a lot of these folks like a lot like when i was starting everyone said like oh just go on odesk and hire someone in india to do it and i'm like i don't know man that doesn't sound like i can like like yeah so like what are you what what are there any agencies that you like or for hiring devs are you hiring someone by the hour in america what's what do you typically see yeah i typically see i see a lot of people going either through referrals like you get into a community um microcom connect or indie hackers or whatever dynamite circle and you ask and you say who has used someone whom you trust right so you try to get that referral it's not just a flat look because going to upwork which used to be odesk is kind of a [ __ ] show these days the other thing is there are now these referral services aggregators there's one called trust shoring which is run by a guy who attends microconf but he basically knows a bunch of eastern european dev agencies and if you come to him and say i want to build an ios app he'll say cool i have these three agencies that i that i refer to he's almost like a broker in a way but like he's a good dude and he knows them you know and so he and he's vetted them and then there's one called clouddevs.com and they do this similar thing for latin america and so do you like cocktail or anything like that top towels good it's expensive um right because i think it's under 15 hours so it depends on budget and all that if you're if you're scraping by i haven't used top towel but i've had friends use it and i heard quality was really good in the early days and of course like anything it gets you know less and less but um that's certainly something you could try too how much would you budget to create an mvp it depends on what it is you're talking like a sass app here's the other thing man if you're if you are non-technical and you've never started a startup before i would say don't build a sas app it's too hard like go i have this thing called the stair-step approach to bootstrapping which is like start small with like a wordpress plugin a hubspot add-on a salesforce add-on a heroku add-on and go build that cut your teeth at it's way less expensive way harder to maintain and way easier to maintain you get the experience you get some revenue then grow it to enough that you can buy out just buy out your day job eight grand eight grand a month maybe ten grand a month then now you have experience you can double down and um and do it that's awesome to your question of building an mvp of a sas app 10 to 30 grand power to throw it out but and you think a non-technical person could actually maintain that and understand what's going on well no then you'd need to have that agency sticker that's what i'm saying if you're non-technical um you either need some money i mean this is why folks you build it and you're you pre-sell it you get to the point where there's enough revenue that you can then justify you know raising funding right if you're if you're not technical or you have a side job that's uh putting money into it well thanks for coming and talking about this i you have a good view of what's going on in in this space i think it's badass ben what do you think yeah that's great thanks so much for coming on rob appreciate it absolutely thank you guys i really appreciate so good this is awesome um do you want to give a pitch where do people follow you most so i'm on twitter at rob walling and frankly they listen to this podcast they would probably like start up to the rest of us it's more focused on you know sas and startups but 35 minutes every week for 590 episodes that's badass i'm a fan i've been listening to you for a long time almost 10 years it feels like thank you this is awesome thanks for coming thanks so much sam boom that's it [Music] you

it's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy there's so much talent being sucked into this thing these guys are gonna build things that actually have use cases actually it's actually gonna make it all work um you can't have this much talent spend all day thinking about this and building in this and have nothing come from it [Music] all right we're live what's going on i'm self-conscious now because we're blown up on tick-tock i just look at myself i'm like i should have shaved and uh now that i have to see myself and i see people and also the tick-tock comments are brutal um they're they're good but they you know they're like just want to argue with every point that gets made so let's talk let's talk about now when i see myself i'm like [ __ ] this is going on tick tock i better i need to shave for the next one so basically 10 days ago or 15 days ago something like that like not long ago we told everyone that we're gonna do this contest we're gonna give five thousand dollars to like three people who take our clips and turn them into videos the best people are on tick tock so i actually posted the tags down there for you so i must have made a mistake i told people to say to to use the hashtag mfmclips but then i also i must have said clip as well without the s and so people are using two hashtag clips and clip mfn clip and mfn clips and some aren't using both but if you use those links i i showed you we have um in the ballpark of around 15 ish million impressions from these videos and it's mostly young folks who created these tick tock handles from scratch took our our content and some videos have over a million some of them have hundreds of thousands of likes they're great and uh do you read the comments no what do they say do they make some of us any content creator you go through the cycle of like you get excited and you read the comment and the early comments are good and then the more popular you get the comments start to turn mean and then you just you everybody reaches a point where they oh no then the third phase is you say you don't read the comments but you secretly do and then finally you know whatever these are the seven stages of grief or something uh social media grief you finally stop reading the comments because you're like this is just too toxic so yeah they they basically just [ __ ] on us for whatever we say like if we say um you put down 20 to buy a house then all the comments are about ways that you can oh oh you can also not put down 20 if you do this it's like all right okay tic.com enter you got me you are smarter than us you are gonna constantly find some like edge case loophole or um you know mistake in what was said do they make fun of how we look or talk or anything like they insult us no they don't really they're either like uh these guys are annoying like they'll be like let's say somebody cuts a clip of one of us breaking down you know our monthly expenses or something like that and then the comment would just but they don't know like the vibe of the pod they don't know why someone would just say that out of the blue right it's not something people normally talk about so they're just like why did he feel the need to tell us how much he's spending on x or like why is he telling us his body fat percentage whatever they're just like there's that kind which is what a douche nobody asked you know why are you doing that then there's the comments that are like you know actually actually it's this other thing and then there's some comments which are like bro i don't i don't want that future no no thanks you know because we'll be like uh here's how things are changing it'll be like dude companies just only think about money and like you know comments like that so those are the three flavors of hater we get so far luckily so far nobody's just [ __ ] on our like face and body oh that's good that's a that's a surprise that's a win as far as i'm concerned yeah i and it's in general sticks and stones may break my bones but words about my appearance do hurt me yeah just like don't make fun of my teeth or like hair you can make fun of my brain they um this promotion has been a home run like i i thought it was going to be pretty good i didn't think it was going to be this good and so what we'll have to do is there's like a couple people who i'm recognizing because i watch them that are killing it we're gonna have to have them on the pod and explain how they got so many views it's pretty amazing right and let's talk about this for a second because um i think there's something interesting to learn here so you have said many times i've grown a lot of things i've grown an email newsletter to multi-millions i've grown a subscription business to multi-millions i've uh you know grown uh whatever you're like a podcast is the hardest thing i've ever had to grow and you say that i think it's just kind of a cool thing to say in general i agree with it in the sense of it there's no like easy growth hacks to growing a podcast um there's no just like button you can push paid ads don't really work nothing really works like that the good news is once somebody actually subscribed to your podcast they become like a really loyal fan and they like feel like they know you so it's got a lot of value but it's hard to get that easy growth this is the first and we've tried a bunch of [ __ ] we've tried we did nothing initially then we tried placing it in our email newsletters we tried uh bringing on big name guests we tried um paid ads we tried a whole bunch of different things none of which really like kind of felt like it was really working but the pod kept growing organically this is the first thing oh by the way we also tried making our own clips paying an agency tens of thousands of dollars a month to be making really awesome animated clips of our content and they were great and they were high quality clips but it didn't lead to this this was different this was hey anybody open playing field just go for it and we'll give out prizes to the people who are actually good at it merit based right and what they're good at is they understood tick tock whereas like we suck at tick-tock we don't know how to create content there they pull clip they pull the right clips because they're actually listeners and fans of the show so they know which clip is actually going to be interesting versus like you know some random employee at our company being like uh you know at the 42 minute mark let's use that one for the clip these guys will put like 10 that they think are interesting and put them out there and um and they're motivated because they're like [ __ ] if i do this good i can get a million views on this and i could go you know i can get five grand from these guys like that's a pretty sweet deal for for doing something you know pretty fun so this has actually worked yeah it's pretty wild and like some there's one guy who basically took our rob dierdick episode and i looked at his feed and he i'm not i don't think i'm exaggerating it's 50 clips in a row of like he basically just took it and just divided it up and like three of the fifties all he did was he just took our talking out and just fight every time rob talks he grabs a clip which is smart yeah and in his whole feed i looked at his feet it was all that one episode and like three of them had like 500 000 views yeah so go follow them i think mfm cuts is one on on tick tock and twitter there's mfm clips and there's a bunch of other variations of that name all right i want to tell you about something interesting i got a few interesting things to talk to you about okay um so let me tell you about something that i was thinking about this weekend so i've got a buddy uh you kind of know them and we i'm not gonna name them but a few years ago he did something he was accused of doing a crime that was a horrible crime one of the worst crimes you could commit and he was the uh he was an executive at a company and it made the news so six months later after he went to court and with the trial the government dropped the case because it was a horrible misunderstanding he didn't do what he was accused of doing and they exonerated him and they go we're sorry we were wrong we we called this one wrong and the first time the story went out it made all the headlines and if you google this person's name it came up on top but what didn't come up on top was like six months later it said charges dropped uh the the misunderstanding came about for this reason this person lost their job because of that and lost obviously a lot of money and i was i've always thought about this and i listened to a podcast this weekend and it was called um the right to be forgotten and it was by radio lab and so this is this idea of the right to be forgotten and it's in europe it's actually a law um i don't know exactly what the law says but it says like if something isn't particularly newsworthy but you're writing about it anyway and it really hurts that person more than that provides value to the comment or to the a reader you have to take it down and there's a couple of newspapers like the boston globe as well as uh in this particular podcast they looked at this uh company uh this newspaper in cleveland ohio and there are stories of like a cop emailing them and he's like look you wrote about this time that i lied about uh some paperwork i ended up getting fired i didn't hurt anyone and now i can't get a job at another as a police officer anywhere else can i fill in the gap on the right to be forgotten for you here yeah so so basically it's a law that says search engines should have to remove links about your past if under certain circumstances and it came about because there was a woman an actress who was in a movie and then he got dubbed um so there was that the film was called the innocence of muslims and then her her original line um uh her original line got dubbed over and then they made it made it so that it looked like she was saying is your is your muhammad a child molester right so that was the clip and she starts getting death threats and like people go crazy about this and she's like what is this like why like okay this thing got dubbed now this clip got on to into the search engine and it comes up if you search my name or certain things and um it's causing you know like harm to me in my personal life and so she sued google in 2014 and ultimately they they upheld it which was um you know uh like she would like to have it have the film forgotten and [ __ ] from youtube unfortunately the right to be forgotten which is recognized in the eu is not recognized in the u.s and so it's a the eu does respect this as they're tighter on privacy with gdpr and things like that and the us does not so yeah and so in the us we don't have that but it's kind of interesting because i personally have seen this hurt people but you think like right now like let's say that you're at a bar and you're drunk and you call someone like a really bad word and it's on uh reddit and they find your name you're screwed like to the point of like your life is gonna be hurt meaningfully for like the next decade and like you should suffer some consequences for someone's calling something something rude but not like that serious you know and so i've been thinking a lot about this business about this reputation management business have you ever researched it yeah my former co-founder used to work there so he used to tell me stories all the time great i want to hear all about it and i know a little bit about this because listen to this so one of the companies is called reputation.com so there's this porn star named sasha gray so do me a favor type in sasha gray on your google and click images sasha gray doesn't she's not an actress anymore not a porn actress anymore but she was like a very prolific porn actress when you clicked images what do you see here we go i'm here okay so i see a bunch of head shots of her i see no real porn well i guess i guess some scandalous stuff but mostly porn yeah mostly just pictures of her fully clothed or like in a bikini so one time at the hustle right when we first launched i helped write this article about sasha gray and she hired this firm called reputation.com and she basically wanted to retire from pornography and become like an actor and whatever else something different uh and she hired reputation.com to hide or like basically blog a bunch and write a bunch in order to get the porn images to go down and i remember when we wrote this article reputation.com did something kind of funny and if i would go on my google analytics at night i would look at real time and there would be thousands of people reading this article and i saw that they searched sasha gray and so reputation.com manipulated it so the article that we wrote about reputation.com and sasha gray came up number one if you googled sasha gray and at night when people were gonna look at porn they googled sasha gray and they landed on our article it was pretty wild i would see it at night every week or every night it would go up and so i got crazy fascinated about reputation.com and so for this segment i wanted to talk about reputation.com i think there's yext and their sprinkler and these are businesses that do like four or five hundred million dollars a year and all they do is reputation management what do you know about reputation.com so he used to tell me stories like you know i asked him i was like oh what'd you do you know before this what was your job before that and eventually he said reputation common i got fascinated like you i was like what is that so he told me he's like you know here's a scenario you're uh a senator and your son who has the same you know john chambers junior sorry sorry danny john chambers out there it's a hypothetical so your son who has the same name as you basically gets a dui or gets arrested for battery or something like that so now anytime somebody searches john chambers this mug shot's going to come up or this bad news story's going to come up and they basically they go to reputation.com and they say i would like this to disappear off the front page of uh i would like this to disappear a repetition.com says i can't make it disappear the internet sort of is uncontrollable but i can get you off the front page of google and they're like that would be amazing and they say for the low low price of 120 thousand dollars 75 000 whatever it's expensive expensive significant because they know people are by the time you're at reputation.com you're bent over the barrel you they can charge pretty much whatever they can get away with so like you know a nascar driver a politician whoever people of interest people who wanted their their names or their kids names to get out of the bad news and so they had a team of engineers that were just it's a constant cat and mouse game to figure out how to beat google so like my co-founder told me he's like one of the big the biggest days at the company was when we figured out you know google has to auto complete right so you go yeah you type sampar it's going to be sampar the hustle sampar net worth sampar wife sampar is gay it'll be like all these likes the same 10 queries for everybody right and what he figured out was that when you type you know sampar if it used to say felony like f would now say friend instead of felony like it would they would figure out how to even finish the autocomplete because even when they were good at getting you off the front page by blogging by promoting other articles whatever getting them higher ranked if the autocomplete was still always suggesting felony then people would click it and they would search for felony it would be reinforcing then google would search for it more so they needed to clear that so there was just constant cat and mouse game to understand how is google doing how's google deciding what goes where and then how do we content farm or manipulate this in some way that will change what the first page results are cause 98 of people don't go past the first page or something like that yeah and so it's amazing to hear about that and then there's a company called yext y-e-x-t they're publicly traded and they do i think that they are just a direct competitor to reputation.com they're publicly traded they did 390 million dollars i think last year in revenue their market cap is not very good it's like four or five times revenue um are you looking at it i'm i'm on repute i went to reputation. i just wanted to see the latest like you wouldn't even know when you go to this um what they do because it says this is their headline first it looks like a hospital website like a nice health tech website or something like that then it says a world of interactions demands a platform of action it's we're a fixer is what i should say so but here's the problem by the way maybe they change what they do i don't know i think they still do it i think they offer like a a smaller package um uh like like when we wrote the sasha gray article that was in 2016 they have like a 13 000 package um but the problem is there's there's kind of two problems with this the first is that the results aren't guaranteed like you can't guarantee that it's going to work which is i guess that's not a problem but that's just how it works you know you when someone calls you i get these calls all the time because i own domain names and i forgot to hide my name it's like hey we'll put you on the first page of google that's a scam you can't just promise that but the second thing is that if you're an individual if you're just someone who like said some stupid drunken thing to someone one day and now your name's all over the place you you it's really really hard to to like unless you're willing to pay a hundred thousand dollars which is what a lot of the stuff costs it's incredibly challenged to manage your reputation if you're just like a person and so i was thinking about like is there anything interesting in that space i actually think that there could be something i like this company called uh do not pay do you know what do not pay is yeah i love do not pay that guy the guy behind it's awesome and it's a great idea so do not pay it's started by this guy and i actually didn't research this so this is on the top of my head it started by this guy josh browder i think powder and he's young like i've when he started it i think he was like 21. maybe oh 25. okay well no now i think he's like 25. when he was started he was even younger yeah he was obviously and uh he was like uh like it was like a prodigy type of thing and originally the business existed to help you fight parking tickets automatically but now they have a bunch of features like it's likely basically all sticking it to the man so another feature is like we will um sue uh we will sue cold callers on your behalf or something like that right we'll also do like um you know we will unsubscribe you from stuff that you're not using that you pay for you know just ways to save ways that you do not pay which is why it's a great name and a great idea and i think there's a world where like a do not you could use a do not pay service like this to help manage your reputation online and this is a need that i think we're actually going to see more and more and more of it it's like a very like exponential thing where it's like more and more people are going to be written about and more and more people are going to need this and i don't know it's just something i've been thinking about what do you have any do you have an opinion i don't know where the new opportunity is in this one because i think it really depends on it's kind of like you need google to exist for reputation.com to exist and so really it's about thinking okay there was a version of this on social networks that people were doing like um i remember this one guy came to me and he was a great entrepreneur he ended up not doing this idea but like i always thought it was a great idea others have done it which is um when you everybody has social media where they post stupid stuff uh when you're younger or when you're just drunk or whatever and so what they do is they go to companies and they say hey we ran a check on all your employees and we found these red flags and um you know you should be aware of how you're what you know who you're hiring as well as what they're saying and representing your company how they represent your company elsewhere so they end up getting contracts with companies to monitor and clean up uh and they're not like tattletailing they're sort of like and hey like an insider helping you out saying hey you have this employee who's saying this you may want to take action but the action might just be to letting the employee know that we we flagged this as potentially controversial and maybe they want to delete it and so it's a monitoring service for social media reputations and social media controversies which i think is shitty great great idea it just sucks that you got to do that well it sucks that the world is the way it is it sucks well some people think oh it's good he holds you accountable but in reality it's just a bunch of like you know don't don't say what you really feel is really the result of most of this because people just get afraid to say anything because they're worried about getting cancelled um so you and your buddy liked working at reputation.com but they like they were by the book he was like technically it was super interesting to figure out how we do all this stuff uh you know he's like he always says this thing at one point we had indexed every person on the web and uh we had like them and their cluster and their reputation um and so you know i think it was technically very interesting but obviously like sort of soul sucking and boring as well so he you know bounced yeah i think i could see that but it is an interesting problem i've been thinking about um all right let me tell you about one more thing um all right so i was reading the information uh the information.com and they had an article about solano so i told you about this on slack so there's this solana sorry i don't know anything about it really other than don't out yourself here as a yeah i'm not crypto nobody yeah i don't want to act like i'm an expert here i'm not i just i i i've read a lot about it though but news articles so chris mccann i knew this guy named chris mccann because he had this thing called startup digest and that's one of the reasons why hustlecon became popular is because i would email chris and i would say hey can you please put this in the email and he had this email called started up digest it started in san francisco and he would email email each week different uh events happening in san francisco different startup events this is when the startup community was much smaller and everyone wanted to go to events and it was just here's a roundup of cool events happening he eventually expanded it to different cities he sold it not for a lot of money probably a hundred probably six figures i bet but he kind of worked his way into benchmark where he like was just an employee there and somehow or another invested hundred and fifty thousand dollars into uh uh what's it called is it solano or solano salon i'm a [ __ ] noob he invested 250 000 into solana and the information wrote an article about how that 250 turned into a billion dollars is that crazy in probably i think three three years maybe four years max uh yeah it's insane i sent you um i sent you somebody else who also has made multiple billions of dollars from their solana investment i said that uh last week to you but but basically solana has gone oh like the fun yeah so solana has gone from let's see i mean it was like sub a dollar um not long ago and now it's two hundred dollars uh per coin it's basically it's what is solana solana is a competitor to ethereum if you know what ethereum is if you don't know what ethereum is just fast forward this segment you probably don't care so um salon is like a competitor to ethereum and as recently as okay so this time last year solano was a dollar 54 and when it launched when it did its ico was just under a dollar i think it was and so um and that was only that was you know a couple years ago two years ago or something like that so basically if you even just take last year a dollar fifty four you put a hundred thousand dollars into that and now you have i think twenty million dollars something like that um i'll i'm actually gonna do some public math here for everybody yeah 20 million dollars so um solana's had this insane run-up and it sounds like he i think through he's in this fund called red something red circle [ __ ] like that a race yeah race something um they were like the seat investors in solana and um you know that's the right project to be a seed investor and is a crypto project that becomes a you know multi-billion dollar crypto asset and sure enough you could turning 250k into a billion dollars that's kind of insane i don't think it was his personal 200k necessarily but even if it was the fund the the article made it sound like it was but even if it's not that doesn't change much the insanity yeah it doesn't change much because he still is gonna walk away with nine fig over 100 million some bigger like there but this article i was reading about it and they're basically like saying there's like a lot of really high profile tech folks at traditional tech companies giving up amazing things in order to like flee to this crypto thing and i'll get and i want to ask you a question about that but example like this woman sandy carter vp of uh amazon's cloud computing she left uh to join unstoppable domains brian roberts who was the cfo of lyft he left to join open c and he said i've seen enough cycles and paradigm shifts to be cognizant when something this big is just emerging and that we're only at the beginning and it's just gonna get bigger we had david marcus he basically led uh facebook's cryptocurrency thing he bounced to start his own thing uh the uh this one dude left uh google in order to become coinbase's chief product officer and when it went public his stake was worth 600 million dollars and then of course jack dorsey bounced from twitter in order to work at square and it's like definitely involves crypto just renamed they renamed to block because they're focusing on blockchain but um it's crazy and my question to you is this have you ever seen someone create that much wealth that fast and do you have any stories of people who you know or know of that are doing this and like what their stories are because this is crazy well i'll say the first thing is that you're right that there's basically a giant black hole that's sucking up all the talent in the world and it's called crypto and it's almost a self there's a lot of people who don't believe that crypto is a thing or they think it's massively overhyped and they say you know give me one example of a real use case of this thing nobody's actually using it for payments or web three there's no real web three products and it's sort of there there's some truth to what they're saying i i wouldn't say that they're completely off base it's like a valid critique um i don't think it's true but it's a valid criticism but the it's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy there's so much talent being sucked into this thing these guys are going to build things that actually have use cases and actually it's actually going to make it all work um you can't have this much talent spend all day thinking about this and building in this and have nothing come from it that's like the biggest like takeaway for me of like even if you're the biggest crypto skeptic there's a self-fulfilling prophecy here which is that it sucked up all the dev talent sucked up all the smartest people suck it sucked up like 20 billion dollars of venture capital every year now and uh all that funding all that talent is gonna is gonna create things that actually do work and do hit beyond what's already there today so there's that now to your question have i seen somebody get rich this quick i want to have my buddy on i have a friend uh who used to work work with me and i caught up with them and his story he basically went from like uh average like an average job like you wouldn't look at this person say oh that's a star career and um they're good they were doing well obviously but they were doing like normal person well and they went from normal person well to making like to personally making like 15 million dollars in the last year just by they basically quit their job and they went down a crypto rabbit hole and started betting on things in d5 and they started playing with all the d5 projects investing their money in d5 and they didn't have a huge base of capital they had you know call it half a million dollars that they put in and to turn a half a million dollars if you and if you have no path in your career to being like uh you know a deca millionaire right like if you don't have a path where you're like yeah i'm gonna have [ __ ] you money to go from no path no no like reasonable storyline that makes sense there you have a job at a company that pays you good salary and that's that to that is amazing to me and awesome and like you know just like blew my mind more so than these guys who become multi-billionaires who were like prodigies and like invented the protocol or invested 250k in a random token it's like this is somebody who just took their own money out of the stock market and was like instead of investing in apple google and facebook i'm going to investigate crypto and turned a normal amount a normal like life savings amount of money into a life-changing amount of money and i want to have him on to tell his full story because it actually has like a bunch of twists and turns um that are like kind of amazing so i'm going to ask him if he'll come on and share it they're willing to yeah you know them um i don't know if they're willing to share but if they are it's gonna make for an amazing episode uh i'll ask them if you'll do it next week did they um did they earn the did they uh sell do they have usd or like some type of stable currency um no they're they're still in crypto like 100 or 100 plus percent because they you know but but is it stable like a big like a popular thing uh it's a mix of popular things and like something they make yeah everything's liquid if they wanted to cash out and say i'm done i'm going to malibu and i'm going to chill i'm going to pretend that this year never existed and i basically won a lottery they could do that because we have a buddy in our chat group who said he made all this money in some crazy coin but he's like i can't sell it so it's like that's different that's like uh those are like either illiquid like oh there's this coin but it's not listed yet or it's liquid but there's like no trading volume whatsoever on this coin and so like yeah if you have 10 million dollars and you go to even 100 000 it'll crash the price of the coin that's not what this is that's that's a different thing um that's a what that is is i i make a million coins i keep 999 000 for myself and then i sell one of them for a dollar and oh now the total value of my thing is a million dollars and it's like no it's not really you there's such a lit such a small amount of the supply out there being sold it's not indicative of the true price this is what i'm talking about is not that situation is there any other person all right so you have a story of someone who did 500 000 to 15 million i just told you about this guy who in like 200 years this person non-technical never was a trader or financial person like they would own like a index fund or mutual fund before that didn't know how to spell blockchain um you know like this person is that's why this blows my mind it's not just this like i know that amount is not the craziest amount of money it's an awesome amount of money for anybody but what's crazy is point a to point b it makes no sense it's like how could those two points connect in that amount of time it's mind-blowing to me so i told you a story about this dude chris who did 250 000 up to a billion you just said 500 000 to 15 million do we know anyone else that has this like crazy crazy journey uh personally you've talked about this guy you talked about somebody right that you're yeah and a friend that that they they did one million to a hundred million yeah so at its peak when bitcoin was uh sixty thousand so i don't whatever is that discounted okay i have another one uh there is a kid who i call him a kid because he was actually a kid he i built this a product called blab back in the days like kind of like clubhouse-y you could basically go hang out and chat with people and this kid used to come home every day from school he used to get on and chat and he didn't chat in the other rooms that had 13 year olds he came to our rooms because he loved technology startups he wanted to be in the startup scene and um i think he was maybe 13 at the time okay so fast forward it's been like six years since then so now he's like let's say 21 or something like that it's been it's been a while and um he created some but he was he's a technical guy but he created a protocol like i was like oh what you been up to like how is your startup going and he's like uh yeah startups okay we haven't been focusing on it for last few months i was like i know man it's tough you got just hang in there buddy you know just pivot and find something he's like actually like we ended up creating this thing anonymously on one of these random like side chains and it was like blah blah some bunch of terms i don't even understand it's you know it's a it's a derivatives perpetual contract for you know adding liquidity to this blah blah i'm like okay i don't even understand what you're saying uh and he's like yeah the market cap of it like you know basically like the market cap of it is like 900 million right now and you know i think he cashed out 10 million dollars in this he's like he's like dude it's been insane the market cap went up like crazy now it's at 200 million and he's like i was able to like take out like a life-changing amount of money he i took out 10 million he was he was like he was asking me because he goes i heard you guys talking about charities and charity water you told the charity water stores really moved like i've set aside seven figures to donate you're like what i was like you've set aside seven figures like like are you seven years old how did this happen where what if what has happened to this amount of time like i used to talk to you when you would come home from eighth grade and get online like you're donating millions of dollars to charity now like what is again a a and b it broke my brain and i don't mean this as an insult to them like if they're if they were only 15 then so they're still only like 19. yeah i think they're 20 now 21 something like that it's been like seven years since we've made that thing so um you know it's not it's not mind-blowing to me that this person is successful in both cases i i really like this person that's why i used to hang out with them that's why i i used to work with one of them i think they're really smart and we're going to be normal person successful it's like when you know oh i went like my sister went to high school with this girl lily galici who's like this super famous instagram star now and she's like has her own tv show on bravo and it's like wait that's the lily girl who used to come to our house after school like she was just like a normal girl like wait that's her like that doesn't even look like her anymore like yeah she's had some work done right it's like just mind-blowing to know a normal person who's like yeah that's a cool normal they'll do well in life to be like no actually they're like one of those crazy outlier stories and in a way that you wouldn't have otherwise predicted you know it didn't make any sense like you know it's not it's not that that was their skill set and they tried try tried that thing for 10 years and finally hit it's like just i don't know where they just did this thing and it hit and crypto is this amazing thing like that so by the way um i want to say something when i first talked to my friend i caught up with my friend i felt insanely jealous i was like so i was happy for him and i like him and all that but i was also like i was like in my head i was just like what the [ __ ] have i been doing with my life with the the friend that used to work for you both of them both the same reaction yeah because it feels weird because you're like oh wait you kind of looked up to me now now i'm like you know way less successful than you uh so like what just happened you just like catapulted really crazy like yeah between the last time we caught up and now there is jealousy there it's easy and i just want to say like you know an interesting thing to observe is what is your reaction to hearing stories like this um there's a part of me that i'm not proud of which gets jealous of it but that used to be like it used to be i would feel that i wouldn't really acknowledge that that's what i was feeling and i would kind of find reasons why it was like ah that's just luck or um like you know well they probably are taking a bunch of risk and they might lose it all and i'm kind of secretly rooting for it to not not all work out just so perfectly as it has that's gone but i still got a little bit of that like jealousy pain left and i'd say the interesting thing is my coach said this to me he goes uh you know you'll encounter people in your life where your success just reminds them of their failure and they're not focused on your success they're focused on their fail your success has reminded them of their failure or your abundance has reminded them of their lack and uh if you notice that in yourself you want to be aware of that and change that and if you find other people and you're like oh these people are haters like uh you know just understand what's coming out they don't actually hate you it's uh your success has reminded them of some feeling that they have in themselves and that's where their attention is gone and so uh yeah i wanted to share that because i definitely felt this like crazy feeling that i hadn't felt in a long time but these stories were so mind-blowing that i could i was like wow this i don't even know what to say i feel lucky to know who i know which we have the same group basically that i've like these stories that sound unbelievably true um a big yeah i know that person um i saw it it was wild so like an example is muay's ali is selling native deodorant for 100 million dollars two years after starting it i was in he we shared an office when he was starting it and i saw him try to learn facebook ads like i saw the thing come to fruition i saw it right in front of my eyes every single day for like six or ten months um and that was almost half the journey it's actually pretty amazing you know and i think about like this isn't like a one-to-one correlation because there's other components here but like i was thinking about this i'm like jamaica is a very small country there's not a lot of people there but they just dominate the 100-meter dash and obviously there's some genetic there's a lot of genetic factors going there but it can't be significantly different than america and um and i was thinking like man one of the reasons being is they just are just surrounded by like it's just normal to be great at something and then and that makes it normal to work hard and you're like well i should be running these times in practice and you don't like freak out you just get it done because that's what's expected and i kind of feel that way in terms of making money because of our friends are who they are it's like well you just want to spend something up and if yeah if you're willing to dedicate three years like you definitely can add eight figures of net worth to your like for sure like it's easy it's not easy but it's simple and it's kind of cool to like be around people where you start seeing like yeah look it's really simple you just do this this of course you gotta dedicate every right you have to dedicate tens of hours you know 50 60 hours a week for like many years but yeah it's very simple straightforward well the first example you gave with moyes was starting it literally at the table i think he sat at the table next to you right like in the yeah yeah and founders dojo or whatever those hacker dojo founder dojo founder's dojo like i think he was interested at first if i remember correctly he was like what should i sell should i do mattresses and he was like ordering mattresses and like measuring them and like seeing like oh that's too much work measures are too big what else is there by the way the public story is like my sister was pregnant and she couldn't find a deodorant that would have didn't have chemicals which might harm her baby so i wanted to create that product it's like dude i know you you were like all right how do i build i want to make a business i want to sell some [ __ ] what do people want oh people like kleenexes mattresses ah too big to ship okay yeah scratch that off the list deodorant small under one pound ships easily people will use it every month it's a renewable and there's a niche and there is a genuine problem for it but like i know you dude there's a there's a real story and then there's the narrative it's just like stories not narratives it's not bad he was just like seeking problems to solve like boom found it and i respect that uh i i like that and that's how i think so you know it's normal to me the there's something to when you see it being built day by day brick by brick you're like there's a just a respect and and for me like total joy i never feel the jealousy in that case like for example i remember when you started the hustle i remember when you were doing just the event and then you were like i'm gonna do this thing and then i came to your office with you and john and it was like like it was like we went into a room that was like a conference room that was like the size of a bathroom and like you had a presentation and like i listened to it and i was like okay this is cool but like what about this this and this some of you guys are like i don't know we'll figure it out and then you like you started with these like long form your original thing was long-form stories and you like kind of was working but not really you're like i'm thinking about switching to this like newsletter thing just daily news skim is doing it it's working these guys are doing it i think we could do it in our nation i think it'll be even better and so seeing that then it's like cool seven years later sam whatever i don't know how luck's been seven years was it seven uh we sold it at about five okay five years in sam sells the thing and is successful nothing but props respect and and joy of like wow that's so cool i got to sit there on the journey with you there's a difference of that watching somebody build it brick by brick and a difference of actually this happened in 12 months um you didn't get to see the hard work that was obviously going in and the risks that were being taken so you all you hear is like i tried this thing it just hit 100x 200x like what uh you know it's it feels more like a lottery and it feels less like the hard work thing and i think that happens a lot in crypto there's a little difference there the second part is i remember when uh i moved so i moved from australia to silicon valley without having a game plan i think you were kind of the same way didn't you just like come to silicon valley like showed up just showed up i did the same thing i was sitting in australia i went i remember specifically i went to a meet-up and they asked me to speak about the about lean startups about startups and i went and i spoke and everybody at the end was like yay you know great talk people afterwards were like wow that was really great talk and in my head my buddy was like what's wrong because he could see i was just like kind of upset he's like what's wrong he didn't like it and i was like i was like i don't know anything about startups and i'm like the thought leader here this is like i'm doing something wrong like this is like i feel like not imposter syndrome i feel like idiot syndrome it's a blind leading to blind it's like these guys know zero about startups i know point one about startups but if i'm the smart guy here then that where are the actual smart guys they're not here and i asked i was like yo what are the success stories in brisbane about like startups you guys are not yeah these guys did great oh where are they they don't come to these events no they moved to san francisco these guys moved these guys moved and i was like oh all the smart people move okay maybe i should move so i changed my phone number first just to mentally be like all right i have a silicon valley area code i don't know why for me that was just like i think i could just do it like over like i did it in one night before i could move it was like faster than moving was just to change my phone numbers make a statement and then i remember being like all right i'm gonna move there i'll figure it out and i quit my job you know on the spot and i was like i'm just gonna move there i play poker for three months to hold myself over while i applied for a job literally one job and uh they didn't hire me they were like kept stringing me along and i was like i'm [ __ ] up this was the one i ended up working at monkey inferno there was like a slow process two-month process so finally i was just like all right [ __ ] i'm just gonna move there and if this doesn't work i think i'll get this job but if it doesn't work i'll get some i'll do something else what was the title which is product manager uh like i was it was first pm there so i i finally came and when i came they were like all right why'd you move like why'd you why'd you come here and i was like well uh you know i wanted to see what's in the water here right like if this is where all the smart people are that's where the startups are like what do you guys know that i don't i don't know and i was thinking it's about tactics it's about operations maybe people are just like literally this is the cream of the crop these are just the smartest people and there's certainly some of that but i'll tell you what to me was the actual this was the actual difference the thing that made coming to silicon valley work i went to this coffee shop you remember the creamery or there's like a it's like this like yeah that's where everyone would be an ice cream whatever it was in south park second in brandon i think yeah exactly so this place called the creamery it's kind of famous for where people take meetings and i went there and i just sat there for like half a day i was just eating i didn't i didn't have anywhere to go i didn't have an office i didn't have an apartment so i was like well i'll sit here and then i'll go search for apartments later and i remember just seeing table after table next to me somebody would come in and they'd be like just pitching their idea to either an investor or a buddy like trying to make a co trying to like a co-founder or two friends catching up or an investment pitch and it was always like these like hair brained ideas it's like oh you know linkedin but for you know cat doctors or whatever this is these stupid ideas and i remember just sitting there thinking oh that's a stupid idea that's a stupid idea and then i was sort of realizing like oh that's actually kind of cool like the normal conversation here the coffee shop conversation here is i get to i got this idea i'm going to change the world i got this idea it's going to be huge i was like everybody kind of has bought into this and like if you go to hollywood that's what happens like the waiters and waitresses i'm going to be a star and new york is a different thing and it's it's silicon valley it's basically i get those i got this idea it's going to be big and that's normal whereas before everywhere i lived if you were the guy who's got an idea and you're going to quit your job to go do it you're crazy you're the crazy guy here you're the normal guy here if in silicon valley if you're like i work at jp morgan you basically have to like bow your head in shame uh you have to like come up with some excuse it's like you know because my wife is pregnant with twins and i've really got to pay the mortgage but as soon as that's over you know like i'm back in the game i'm going to go back into the startup game like if you're a con if you work for mckenzie anywhere else that's great if you work for you know mckenzie or deloitte in san francisco you're like the low class person you're not the high class person because the high class person is the founder with the idea or the angel investor who's betting on ideas so the just that culture where that's normal and possible to just constantly quit your job have an idea throw everything into it maybe get rich um that's what makes silicon valley so awesome or at least that's what it did and what you're talking about where like if your friends group has these types of success stories and is doing this type of [ __ ] your brain will just automatically change into thinking that's possible that's normal that's super doable for me too and that you can't underestimate that i think for some people that's what this show is it's like if you hear us three times a week at least that's like part of your friend group that talks that way thinks that way and will make it feel normal to have ideas to bet on ideas to make a bunch of money to make huge investments whereas in your your geography may not be people around you and your neighbors and stuff like that may not think that way yeah it and it basically changed my perspective from um like this only happens to other people to obviously this is obviously i'm going to matter of time yeah i'm going to achieve the desired outcome it's just um a like for on which swing am i going to get my hit and b uh which thing do i want to dedicate five or ten years on right because if you like work eight years on something and you're around the right people and you've been like going like i felt like living there i was like i was in school so it's like well i'm in school i know like i know it when i see it and i can just keep working on something and then i'll see right away that it's working and then i just spend time on it and just give it time and it works it will always work that's kind of like the attitude there's um uh i i think i've told the story have i told like why i did the e-commerce thing and why i think it worked no so i was sitting with our mutual friend i think i could say his name maybe we'll bleed this out later but uh i was sitting with him and his backyard he had this you know he has that awesome and when he lived in california this awesome backyard with a basketball court and like a putting green and pool and chickens stuff like that and we were just chilling for the day and his dogs are running around and uh we were talking and while we were talking the shopify cha-ching kept going off on his phone and he would have that thing all the time i used to yell at him i go turn that [ __ ] off too yeah so it was like and then like two minutes later and then i was like i was like what is that he's like oh my bad i might like i'm sorry i totally spaced i didn't even realize i didn't like i'm so like i'm so numb like i didn't even realize that was happening like that's obnoxious my bad i go no no leave that on what is that he goes that's the shopify like every time we get a sale it does that i said i leave that on because you share i was like yeah leave it on so it went on the whole time it goes off the whole time by the end of the i we were talking about some other [ __ ] completely we're talking about dogs and family and kids and like whatever by the end of the hour i was like all right man i gotta you know whatever i gotta go um but i'm definitely starting at a shopify thing i want my phone to do that and he's like he's like he's like yeah you totally should i was like just literally that experience if i did not have that and the jealousy worked to my favor right the jealousy was a signal of if i want that more than what i have maybe i need to make a change right because i was like i'm gonna go back to the office where i earn a fixed salary it's a great i was making great money but like it is capped i will make the same amount whether i do a good job or a bad job whereas for him it was like he got to chill it was making money passively and um and if he did a better job he was gonna make more money so that was the first thing it made me maybe decide i'm gonna do this and then i started like moyes i was like what can i sell what can i sell all right what can i sell okay what were the other options of other ideas i had to sell yeah um i remember going through candles uh candles are kind of an amazing business but very competitive candles are same thing as deodorant you you use them and they burn out they they literally melt away and you have to buy them they're so expensive i just bought a hundred dollar can't candle yeah they're they're high aov they're super high margin so they're not expensive to make they're just really you could charge a lot for them you can have a whole bunch of skus very easily that are all the same they're all just different scents um there are the high end middle and low end there's candles that are like you know oh this smells like your hometown of missouri there's like a bunch of gimmicks you can do this whatever so candles was definitely one that was on my mind i told you about the crystal story i was basically like because i asked my buddy so i asked that friend and i asked others i said how do you think about this they gave me some frameworks of how to think about it right like look you're gonna the reason this whole thing works is facebook ads so that means you're gonna acquire customers so something like this dollar amount all right so you need to how much was that dollar amount so like 20 bucks at the time it was like 20 25 bucks something like that but now it'd be higher now it's higher now it's like 40 45 bucks something like that but it's like all right let's just say in a best case scenario you're gonna break even on the first purchase so you want a product that's gonna have 65 to 70 gross margins so that means the actual let's say i don't forget public math but like let's just round numbers here a candle let's say the cost of goods is five dollars you want to make sure that you could sell that thing for thirty dollars or whatever to have that type of gross margin so uh and then you're going to have you know let's call it 15 to 20 is your cost of fulfillment so that's like packaging it um you know picking it in your warehouse and then shipping it to the customer and customer and um okay cool so then you take all that out so basically you end up with a break even the question is if you can break even on the first purchase meaning it costs you 25 let's say in facebook to get a customer then you want that to be your net profit on a single order uh then you're basically that's like the that's like a great position to be in because you're breaking even on day one and then everything you purchase you build up your customer base by recycling that cash flow on this you know every month you're not going you're not going deeper and deeper in debt and then as you build your customer base when they come back and repeat purchase and you want that repeat purchase rate to be high so like you know one of our friends has a thing that doesn't have hyper refrigerate the other one has like deodorant has amazing repeat purchase rate so if they repurchase that means your lifetime value will be higher for your customer and all that extra every next purchase will be much more profitable all right and this business would be more valuable and then little things like hey the way that the shipping works in the country is like you know things that are under one pound um they ship at this low rate once it's over a pound shipping is like much more expensive like there's like a normal usps usps like whatever priority mail that if it's under a pound it's like whatever five bucks or four bucks or whatever so there's like certain little things that help and so like if you talk to moyes moyes used to like change his packaging so that he would be at .99 pounds right like he was like i want to be just under one pound and that was like his his like keith one of the key things that helped control cost so anyways there's a whole bunch of frameworks so i went through a bunch of product ideas to figure it out and then the ones you're gonna like you know the easiest thing to sell on facebook is stuff that appeals to like white women in middle america so like how do you sell to a 35 to 65 year old woman that lives in texas and like that's the that's the persona that's like the most easy to fish for on facebook you can obviously sell anything to anybody facebook's huge but like if you can get one for white women in middle america like your gold like because that's what the majority of your customers are yeah uh ours are a little younger than that but like uh yeah that's like the the white ladies why women in middle america is like a great market and most of silicon valley makes a mistake they go for what is la new york and san francisco millennials single millennials like me and that's such a expensive customer it's an expensive customer there then their lifestyle changes very quickly and they don't need your [ __ ] anymore um and they're competing with uber and lyft and [ __ ] like the ad spend it's just too hard everything is very competitive it's just like i guess the way to think about is not necessarily that one is that much better than the other i wouldn't actually say that it's just more like don't narrow your scope to your single lifestyle as like a 25 year old dude in san francisco who like orders you know every meal on postmates it's like you're not representative of the world so you know like don't limit yourself to just that um because like you know it might be truckers in middle america that love you know that buy xyz or whatever there might be just like a different market that that's really lucrative that you're not really paying attention to right now so pay attention to other groups so anyways the second thing that happened was i asked them i asked so we had two buddies that were doing the same thing two was enough where i was like oh if he can do it he can do that i could do it no problem and um and so i was like i asked him i was like what are your sales and you know it shocked me right it's like oh you know the business we did seven million our first year 21 million our second year and 41 million our third year i was like what the [ __ ] is going on i was like and they're like oh yeah we didn't raise any money it's just profitable you know i just take a dividend out i'm like what like what are these words prophet you know like where i come from silicon valley we don't we don't say that word that does what's that what's that p word like you know the prophet like jesus like muhammad what are you talking about so so when i heard that i was like all right and then that became my normal like i was like okay i'm gonna do seven million my first year i'm gonna do 20 million in my second year i'm gonna be like that became my what i thought was achievable and normal if i hadn't heard that from them i would have never scaled as fast and sure enough we did you know seven million the first year now in our second year hopefully we'll get to 20. like i hit this exact i hit the exact thing to the point where i'm like maybe i should have shot higher maybe maybe just hearing their number created like an artificial ceiling but i definitely created it are you how many people work there full time at yours um that's a couple right yeah like four or five are you happy with e-commerce i've asked you this uh like every quarter are you happy and i say the same thing it's it's a great business in one way and it's a terrible pain in the ass and the other way you know like you know whatever like right now everything is it's a lot of headwinds are going against e-commerce so facebook's getting more expensive shipping anything around the world is getting super expensive and slower um so those are the two core costs right getting a customer and then fulfilling your product all the material you're doing physical products and guess what with inflation everything gets more expensive so like there's a lot of headwinds against e-commerce right now um and it's very competitive so you know there's a bunch of reasons why it's bad then again it's working and like you know i'm happy with our business so you know it's good but would i recommend it to the next person not necessarily i think if if you can do software do software if you uh if you don't really want to like do real work uh don't do don't do ecommerce because ecommerce has real work like we have a house you know it's annoying let me tell you something really quick before we are prep i just invested in i don't ever do d2c companies like these consumer shipping companies but this guy listening to our podcast i bet you he reached out to you too it's called the good crisp company yeah so he sent me like i guess on the podcast i mentioned that i love snacks or something i don't know well we know we were talking about better for you snacks right so so junk food that's like keto keto cookies whatever so he's got pringles that are like better for you than pringles but they taste like they send them to you yeah they're awesome i ate this entire box of like and it was like a lot of chips like it was it was kind of messed up it's a can of pringles yeah and i was like dude this is awesome the valuation was like two times sales i ended up investing in it i really wanted to invest i'm just too i told the guy i was like you have to amaze you have a great business i would totally invest in this i'm just completely obsessed with crypto and like every dollar every extra dollar that i could put into something speculative i just want to put into crypto i don't want to put into anything else what's your crypto stuff that you're that you're doing now then dude i bought luna luna's just been like on fire i don't know if you follow luna how much should it go up by well depends which time verizon but mine is basically i don't know up 40 in like two months or something right it's like amazing but uh and and i think it has like a long way to go still not again not financial advice i'm just like gambling so you're here imagine me saying here's what number i'm betting on in roulette just take it as that don't take it as like you know my word but um i think there's a lot of interesting things about it i heard i had heard about it from a few interesting people and then i was like all right um what is this thing actually and um i can explain it if you want but basically i i'll refrain for now that's the that's the thing i've been interested in good and you didn't do good crisp that it was a cool company man the problem with all ecommerce so our mutual friend has this great phrase which is e-commerce businesses are great to own horrible to invest in um now i wouldn't say not horrible but it's like it's great for the owner of the business it's not great for the investors and that's only because the upside is somewhat limited so even native which sold for 100 million dollars it's like these almost never go for multiple billions but they're often valued at the same valuations as like a software company which can become a multi-billion dollar company and so like you know you invested i think uh you know i don't know about that one but i was looking at other another good deal that was in e-commerce that i liked it's like oh we have you know we're doing 10 or 20 million dollars in revenue you know 20 percent of that is is profits or ebitda um you know we're valued at 50 billion or 60 million it's like it was a good company it was definitely going to work like the business was working and was gonna probably keep working and um you know the reality is that that it's unlikely that that will ever even sell for 600 million let alone six billion right so it's like you get these like 2x 3x 4x of revenue like sales um or sorry evaluation sales and that's just not super compelling when you have better options like if you can invest in software do it you know and in a couple weeks we're gonna have this guy on i lined it up aj patel from high key cookie and zesty paws that guy's amazing he's one of the most impressive people i've ever read about um and he was an owner of one of those businesses and by the way i should say two other things there's all there's obviously exceptions to every rule so you know i'm like there are there are definitely some e-commerce investments that are going to do awesome uh like native did awesome because it sold for 100 million but it only raised i think 2 million bucks or something like that a million dollars so you know he was super capital efficient whereas most of these are not they burn a [ __ ] ton of money on marketing and inventory uh second thing the only other bad thing about ecommerce is like even when i say oh we did seven million ten million whatever this year that doesn't mean hey that's revenue not profits and b almost and whatever you do have for profits gets reinvested back into the business because you're buying inventory for the next four months so if you're buying ads for the next month and like so you're always cash poor until you finally turn the corner and there is a corner that you turn when you're a good business but early on you don't have you turned it we have not turned that no um because we're like we are like oh great we need to buy double or triple the inventory for the next season and for the next season and after that and so you know it's gonna stressful as [ __ ] yeah like you know but it's cool it's like it works but it works if you don't need a bunch of cash to pull out um and you're okay being cash poor for a while real estate's like this often too you could be cash poor in real estate but be like you know have a lot of value yeah but it's not gonna go to zero yes real estate is slow way slow but it's more liquid and um it's not gonna grow fast but it won't go away so it's a little different whereas your thing can go away in the sense that if the valuation drops then you know you're more you know you don't make a profit it's not that it goes to zero but you're you're what you owe the bank is the now the value of the company and so your equity can go down right like yes but a a ecom business can double or triple in a year real estate likely will never do that but that econ business let's say that like something's made illegal or there's an embargo who knows like there's a world where it can go out of business yeah for sure um i have a couple more i don't know if you want to stay on we could just split these into you know we talked about just like releasing these as like segments instead of all right hour-long episodes do you have time or no yeah all right have you seen this thing that happened uh called sos sos token no what is it all right i gotta tell you about this this is genius okay so there's a there's a there's an app called openc or a website called openc you've heard of openc it's basically not that big it's ebay for nfts um so it's a place where you go and buy buy and sell nfts and openc is um it's in crypto but it doesn't do some of the things that crypto people like so it's like it's not fully open source uh you know all the code is not open source like they like the website the way the website works i think it's you know proprietary it's uh that you can't just fork that code and just put your name on it the second thing is that they don't have a token involved with it um and the third is that you know they raised a bunch of money from private from from traditional venture capitalists and in the crypto world that's like a uh you sell out type of yeah um so andreessen horowitz i think put money in it's a multi-billion dollar marketplace and i think it's gonna be like it's gonna be huge i think they did like um ben you can look this up but they did like i don't know eight billion dollars of transaction volume in like one month this year so it's been it's been growing like it's like crazy it is one of the best startups you can invest in right now would be openc now what happened so they their cfo they hire this hotshot cfo cfo goes on some shows some either podcast or some talk show and he says you know we're looking at potentially going public and he's saying it because that's a good thing for the company and immediately the users are like oh you're using the old route of like getting liquidity that's going to make you guys rich but all of us users who have built this into the most popular nft marketplace we're going to get nothing from that like we don't own stock in your company so you go public we don't get anything we built this thing and again that's against the uh it's against the core the ethos of uh of your everything yeah ben just found it 10 billion and 10 billion in trading volume in august alone so that's insane same same numbers um so uh oh sorry i think it's yeah i don't know whatever so basically um so what happened so this group of people got together i think the guy the guy who's behind it his handle is like um 9x9x9x or something like that right so this guy comes they create something called the open dao if you go to the opendao.com and they say they created a token called sos so openc is the name of the platform so this is like sos like save our ship he creates this token called sos it creates a hundred trillion tokens and he gives them out and what they did was kind of genius so on like two days ago anybody who was in crypto twitter anybody who buys nfts started seeing oh there was an airdrop which means if i look in my wallet i'm going to have tokens it's like finding 20 bucks in your wallet and so they did an airdrop to all the users of openc based on how much you use openc so how did they get that information it's the block it's on that's the beauty this can only happen in crypto so because i know but i would have thought that like i guess you could just scrape the website and just get a list of everyone's wallet no no no it's not not the website all open c is just like a website that accesses the ethereum blockchain so all the transactions happen on the ethereum blockchain the buying and selling of the nft the minting of the nfc is on the blockchain the buying and selling is all there and the blockchain again is this open source public public record basically that you can go access you can go i can go type in your wallet address like your public wall address and i can just go see how much money is in your account right now if i just go into ether scan and so now you might have multiple wallets but like that's one thing you can do so what they did was they went they looked at every every transaction on openc all the wallets and they said okay sean's wallet has spent 10 eth he's done five transactions um so he should get x percentage of it so they took of the hundred trillion they said half of it we're just going to drop to all the users of openc so i woke up and i had 58 billion of these tokens are there at a point oh whatever price my total was whatever like 300 whatever it was like 500 because i don't use openc a ton i didn't do too many transactions but if you're one of these people who's like an nft collector or flipper who um is very active on the platform who buys and sells you know you know board apes and things like that people made like three thousand dollars five thousand dollars fifteen thousand dollars so it's like finding five thousand dollars in your wallet and you're like what is this ah i got this for free money and it's money that they minted and they basically it was almost like it's a marketing stunt but it's almost like a hostile takeover so they basically went out there what they were saying was here's what opencv should have done they should have given all the users some tokens proportionate to their usage basically so based on how much you've been using the platform you get some of the openc token and that and then the openc token will be publicly tradable so you get to benefit and the core team will keep some of the openc token like the company will keep 20 of this that's how that's like the normal way in crypto so the genius part of this is that some third party just did this on their behalf and it's like and now what and they so now there's a liquid market of like hundreds of millions of dollars i think it was like 300 million dollars the the group okay so here's how they did it they said 50 goes to the users um 10 goes to the stakers and the liquidity pool uh 30 goes like the stakers in the liquidity pool and 20 will stay with the treasury of our of our foundation and we are going to build an open source version of openc we're going to build a competitor to openc and all you users who are power users of openc you now have a stake in our new openc that's to come that's going to do things the right way but they've got to build i mean building now they have to build it's [ __ ] hard so i mean how many people work there 500 people no no no dude these things can be built by like you know four motivated developers if you needed to then why the hell does airbnb 5000 people it'll take a lot to maintain it and do customer support and all those things yes though that will take time but just building the actual product that will start to get people to shift off of opencv to do this a team of five to ten contributors can actually do this if they're great developers that are focused now that's tbd it's like a kickstarter it's like hey we give your money in a kickstarter are they ever gonna build the thing well it kind of depends are they honest and are they gonna work hard i don't know we'll see but these guys basically they they essentially raised it's like they hijacked open c and they raised their share was 20 trillion out of the 100 20 they have 130 million dollars now in their treasury that they can pay their development team to build the open source competitor to this who's who's the guy behind it the people behind it this uh 9x9x9x and then someone else who's x dot xyz that's that's his handle i think that's who's behind it and so they um i think it's look i don't know if this is gonna work but i think it's something that's only possible in the crypto world because again this is one of this is one of the reasons why people are like um you know uh decentralization is cool it's cool because the users can always pick up their ball and leave they can go to another court and so openc does not own their their wallets it does not own their nfts they have no lock-in to keep the users there except for behaving well and treating them well and if somebody else says i'm going to treat you better over here it is very easy for me to take my wallet take my nfts and go over here and then even better that other group can incentivize me to come over here and try it out by saying hey here's some free tokens that we minted out of thin air so i think this is possible takeaway it's like a hustle takeover it reminds me of i had a buddy who was gonna do this to a company called ripple have you ever heard of ripple yeah but they they're shady right okay so ripple was this thing kind of like started pretty early on um and they had this like you know honestly not a bad idea they were like look uh you know the way the international banking system works today is off this thing called the swift standard ripple was like we're gonna be a bank to bank communication layer that uses blockchain right so they're like we're going to use blockchain technology with a real use case which is banks sending money back forward to each other so that was their idea they got a bunch of funding from founders fund and others and they released this thing called xrp that's the name of their token all right so whatever nobody cares about that how it works nobody cares but the interesting part is xrp has like was worth a lot the founders of ripple became billionaires overnight before like that's the thing with crypto you can get rich before like this open down has 130 million before they have a product in ripple those guys became billionaires before banks ever used their product which is like a really [ __ ] up incentive and which is why sometimes [ __ ] doesn't actually get built in crypto because hey i already got the millions i could just run away i could just do a half-assed job it doesn't really matter at this point i went public on day one so ripple um has a market cap right now of um 94 is this right 94 billion dollars i think i'm reading this right 94 billion something like that no no sorry 44 billion dollars 44 billion dollars right that's like that's like the market cap of like you know bank of america or some [ __ ] like that so obviously ripple's not actually valued at that but ripple had believers and they had early momentum they were very early in the crypto games they had a lot of pr and the ceo would go on cnbc and talk about how this is going to change the game so what happened in the crypto community people were kind of like poo pooing riptil they're like this is like centralized they they took way too much share for themselves they didn't give enough to users that's why these guys are billionaires their product kind of sucks and they're kind of shady whatever whatever so the reputation was ripple anybody who was in the know encrypted crypto pretty much the general consensus was ripples full of [ __ ] and uh so my buddy had this idea he was like he was like i'm gonna do the first hostile takeover of a crypto network i was like what do you mean he goes look i can see every single person's wallet who owns ripple i was like okay that's kind of interesting here you go i go but you don't know their name and all that because i don't need their name i was like you don't have their email address because i don't need their email address i could just put something in their wallet and they'll wake up and they'll open their wallet and they'll see that they have something in it i was like okay he goes so i'm gonna go out there i'm gonna say xrp is stupid for these five reasons number one the founders took anyway people anything you can include a message in the transaction of giving them the thing in the memo of the of the thing but like the way you do it is you first drop the token you tell people hey if you held ripple you got this token today and then you write your manifesto on your twitter or your website about what this is all about so you it's kind of like somebody put a 50 check in your wallet you're like what's this all about it says go to this website to explain why you just got this 50 so that's how this that's how this marketing mechanism works so he was like i'm going to put some money in there i'm going to put my currency in all the ripple holders wallet and then i'm going to tell them ripple is stupid for these five reasons the founders took too much this other problem this other prop you know their the right the token is inflationary blah blah blah so i'm gonna change all that we only take 10 we are not inflationary we do not do this sketchy [ __ ] blah blah blah my five-point plan of how to make ripple better um and we're we're calling it our own thing and here's the deal if you own ripple if you send your ripple to my wallet i will send you back five times your value of this if you're in the first for the first thousand people that do this then for the next ten thousand people that do this you're gonna get four times your your ripple back and for the next ten thousand people you're gonna get three times ripple back so basically there's this urgency of like okay if these if this is gonna become the next ripple if i send my money in now i'm gonna get five i'm gonna get a 5x multiplier on my money and what he was going to do was just he goes when you send it to this wallet we're going to just dump it we're just going to sell it and we're going to put so much cell pressure we're going to crash the price of ripple so if you do it do they do this or someone finish the story so here he goes if you do this early you're gonna get five times your amount and you're not gonna sit there holding the bag while we dump this thing it's like a prisoner's dilemma game through it was so genius he's like he's like here's the math if you're if you're holding this thing you have to assess are other people going to take them up on this offer if they do then the ripple i'm holding is going to go down like crazy i'm going to go down like 5 to 10x if i jump if i jump ship i get a 5x multiplier on my money and i don't sit there holding the sinking ship and the game theory of this i think was gonna work so he has his plan and he starts and he starts uh and so he's like okay well he needs to be credible so he went to some very very wealthy people and he got about 50 million dollars lined up to do this hostile takeover and he was like he needed it to be like 200 million and so he's like i need to create this huge war chest so i can tell people look we have this much money so you this it's backed by something come on board and he's like dude he's like basically i'm going to this investor i'm saying if you give me 200 million dollars i'm gonna take down this project i'm gonna absorb all the value of this project that's currently worth 40 billion right so he's like it's a huge return for those investors and they and they also don't even believe in ripple so what was this high stakes [ __ ] james bond [ __ ] what the problem was one of the investors that he had went to for this leaked the plan to a journalist this guy uh dan primack or whatever he's like pretty famous journalist yeah from axios axios axios writes the story ahead of time he says hey there's somebody planning a hostile takeover xrp and here's how it's gonna work and xrp obviously the ripple team obviously sees this and they're like okay just in case they so they sold some amount of their ripple um to create a like few hundred million dollar buffer so that if somebody tried to do this and tried to tank the price they had enough liquidity to buy back the buy back the tokens and keep the price high so it kind of foiled his plan where they the only the only way it would have worked is if he had caught them by surprise and he could have done it in like a two day period he could have tanked the price of ripple and created this competitor and had all the momentum on his side but because they had heads up they could create enough liquidity and they could be able to like support their price before somebody could do this to them but how crazy is that dude this is like some barbarians at the gate [ __ ] like this is like 1980s like drexel um like hostile takeover where they like were like what's it called the green mailing have you ever read like these like 1980s finance i have i have the book barbarian i haven't read it yet uh yeah that's basically what they did like it was like it was like warfare i was like this is some george soros [ __ ] you know that george soros broke the bank of england yeah i was like that's actually what he was telling me he goes this is some george soros [ __ ] and i was like what do you mean he goes george soros broke the bank of england by doing something very similar to this and as he was explaining i was like there's no way this works he's like well you know it's risky but like if it works who who did it and so he didn't he didn't end up doing it um but i mean who who's that it's an artist is it public uh i don't know if it's public but i'll tell you actually it's our friend who remember we went to dinner after our live show in miami it's our friendly way yeah okay okay yeah um that's crazy i thought uh if if dan would have wrote about it he would have named him yeah i think he didn't know the name or he i don't think he included the name of the thing but how [ __ ] nuts is that that's crazy if you can if that person could have pulled it off that's wild this is barbarians at the gate [ __ ] hostile takeover stuff yeah i love it um all right i have a couple more topics if we want to do them or if we want to go we can go all right i got i can do 15 more minutes all right let's do one more um okay i got two random ideas for you okay here's the here's the first idea all right this idea is my gift to the uh chief marketing officer of gucci you know you're welcome courtesy of shop party okay i see this headline [Laughter] all right so i was thinking the other day i was i was sitting there and sitting at the at a restaurant and as i do i'm just watching i'm just people watching i'm just watching these crazy creatures called humans what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] are they doing and i saw all these people that had fancy bags gucci bags louis vuitton bags it's very different from my world i don't i don't give a [ __ ] about that but they obviously do i was watching this then i came home i'm watching this show selling sunset funny show on netflix about real real estate teams dude i watched it too man you know i watch all that [ __ ] yeah so so you know i dabble and uh if you notice every day they come to work they're wearing like the craziest like what nobody wears to work they're wearing like five thousand dollars dress with like a five thousand dollar bag and they put the bag right on the middle of the desk it's like there's no laptop there's no computer it's like a desk with a chair and their purse on top and then they just close up with each other right that's where the show is at this point so i was thinking about this like luxury thing the luxury's just caught my eye i said what else what else could you do and and i don't know how this came to mind but here's a crazy idea it's really a marketing stunt it's not a business idea it's a marketing stunt for gucci so here's what you're gonna do every year there are over a million joint replacements in america so people getting hip replacements knee replacements people getting you know they they fracture their foot they get a steel rod put in there are over a million people a year that get this done i got it done you got that what'd you get done i've got screwed i broke my leg i've got screws and a little i got metal on my feet now you're not the right person to ask but is there a version of sam that might have paid an extra 500 bucks to have that be a gucci nail the answer is yeah of course the answer is yeah the answer is yeah so we're talking about i thought you were gonna go with like gucci prosthetic legs yeah but you're talking about like just brandon on the internet that's actually a cool idea inside and you only see it on the x-ray like you you have the picture before it goes into your body right so you get the instagram porn of okay hey guys i'm doing well post surgery here's my picks and as you're swiping it's an awesome phone it's a [ __ ] louis v hip that's coming into your body that's an awesome flashlight dude you can always see that in airplanes they do something so that exactly in x-ray you'll always see an emblem on the thing now i don't know how uh doctors will figure out the science of how this works without [ __ ] up here pretty great that's good how good is that dude that is that is amazing this is just an extra little revenue line tons of news because everyone's going to say this is what's wrong with the world you're going to take over and guess what there's going to be a bunch of people out there who are going and getting surgeries done that are going to say yeah okay it's the average knee replacement is like 25 30 000 like all lint uh i think that you know maybe it can be as low as 12 to 15 000. you tell him in the actual part itself that goes in i think is a 5 000 part that the hospital orders you're telling me i wouldn't get the 7 500 supreme [ __ ] you know the nike logo come on yeah come on yeah that's just licensing revenue for them it's working it's it's influencer candy dude it if people get grills if rappers go get diamond grills if they're if you know somebody out there like me some some guy like me out there was like yo diamond braces what yeah diamond braces actually [ __ ] it not even for braces just diamond teeth diamond teeth worked if diamond teeth worked the louis v hip could work dude this is a good idea this is pretty funny this is brilliant this is actually a good that one was for you for tic-tac that's for you tic-tacs out there that was my tic-tock segment that's actually this is actually a fun idea all right wait who who did you research this is that even possible i have no idea if it's possible i've got like i don't think you could i don't think you could see stuff like that i've got x-rays of my screws and like you can like look at them but i don't think i i don't know how that would work but it might have to be a striping it might have to be a dots polka dots it might have to be something that will show up there might be an emblem that's just on it a tiny emblem uh but you know like the red bottom shoes uh for what's it called you know like yeah i don't know yeah we're [ __ ] nerds but the the black uh or the red bottom shoes they rap about them yeah exactly whatever people will find a way to see the [ __ ] and you just if that's the only problem with this idea we got a good problem to have so um and also by the way tattoos i think you could also do this with tattoo parlors i think you could drop branded official licensed designs of tattoos for brands and be like yeah if you get this one it's actually that's like actually the brand because like you people get tattoos of brands like yeah like a louis vuitton i think jake paul has a nike swoosh where his like sock would be on his on his calf that's hilarious actually and i was like that's funny he got a brand tattooed on him and i think i was also like yo why wouldn't brands actually drop tattoo designs just like they dropped bag and shoe designs like i feel like that should happen that's interesting that's another interesting idea all right two for two all right i have one more for you okay this one's less fun but i think it's still good do you remember glamour shots love them did you your mom have glamour shots do you know anybody who has no but i didn't do it but like my sister did it's hilarious it's like napoleon dynamite [ __ ] where you go to the mall and you wear stupid makeup and a bad haircut and you take these awesome pictures of course do you know the business behind glamour shots no uh okay so is that is that the name of a brand glamour uh glamour shots was the name of the company i think okay so here's the here's the quick backstory i did like uh you know two seconds of research on this so could be wrong started by a frat party photographer who was like you know taking pics at frats and i was like all right what else i got so initially starts it calls it party pics then when they were like kind of looking at trends they were like oh people are liking this like high glamour style like big hair loud loud clothes certain backdrops and so they were like all right um he's like so renames it to glamour shots and it's physical locations and within first year it already starts working by year three seven million in revenue and copycats popping up everywhere hollywood headshots freeze frame you name it there's different portrait shops popping up at one point it just expands through the franchising model expands to 380 stores taiwan japan everybody wants a piece of glamour shots and the trick the thing that like really made it work was most great name most professional photographers you would go well there's a couple things made to work one was the style was iconic the second was so it wasn't just come i'll take a picture of you was come i'll make you look like a hollywood star with the hair the makeup the clothes and it was only like you know top half up so you would be wearing your jeans underneath and then your top would be like this denim studded jacket or whatever with the collar pop or whatever so backdrops with the colors everybody knows the look fan blowing your hair that whole thing so that was one one innovation the other was instant gratification so you would take the photo and for most photographers they're like great i'll i'll go you know get these exposed then i'll um i'll uh whatever touch them i'll pick the best ones i'll get i'll get you you know some some options in a few few days few weeks glamour shots they used a special like kind of camera technique or whatever so it was actually taking a video i think and it would grab an image and you could see it right there on the screen in real time and you could pick and be like oh i want that one that one's so good they got you in the heat of the moment when you were in peak state when you were already caught up in the frenzy and people were dropping 300 400 500 inflation adjusted for on their glamour shots um [Music] average customer spend so it was like highly lucrative because that's basically like you know for like a 30 minute shoot you're making you know huge profits and they had these like six categories of styles that you got to pick from the names are hilarious one is can't wait to be touched another spontaneous tailored elegant bold and that's where these like classic looks come from so there was some genius behind the person who really understood what the customer wants behind it whatever happened to the company so it gets to 100 million in sales by 1994. by 2001 it's now dropped back down to 93 stores now there's like 40 stores left it's basically withered away and dying it didn't didn't last didn't keep up with the times here's the idea right rebooting glamour shots and we're rebooting glamour shots everything nostalgic from the 90s is crushing oh you're rebooting spider-man batman x-men you're rebooting home alone home alone's getting rebooted we're rebooting glamour shots that's what i'm telling you i'm on board so there's i'm looking at it now there's only five so there's only five of these locations left yeah they're we're down to the last stones you know remember the alamo where we're down to the last stand so the question is how would you actually rebuild glamour shots so i wanted to brainstorm with you for two minutes how would you reboot glamour shots i got a couple ideas i don't know if you have one off top your head otherwise i'll go you gotta do it in person i think i think that's that's part of it um do what do you need to do that's different i mean you just do an ad campaign with really cool celebrities or some celebrities and you'd be like here's what they would have looked like like you know a modern a modern person what they would look like with a glamour shot what would you do so i i'm going to reboot it i'm not okay so nostalgia is one cat one one angle you could you could just say this look would come back uh but i think that's that's short-sighted i think what you got to do is you got to work backwards so my mom had glamour shots on the wall the end product was a framed picture on the wall of her looking like an 80s soap opera 90s soap opera person basically with the hair blown out and crazy lighting and crazy dress well what is the what's the end product people want today instagram baby they want epic instagram content so we've talked about museum of ice cream we've talked about some of these i think those are secretly glamour shots reboots i think you gotta go all in on the glamour shots reboot so you're gonna you're gonna make somebody look [ __ ] amazing for social media i know how people out there are throwing up in their mouth they're like oh this is everything that's wrong with well guess what people people care what they look like how they come across on social media if you if you hate that fact cool delete instagram but if you still got instagram you're still in on this idea okay so how are we gonna do it one idea was could you get airbnbs convert them into like basically like dope lifestyle looking airbnbs and just rent them out for shoots instead of you know renting it out for seven hundred dollars a night you're renting it out for a hundred dollars an hour and you're doing 200 an hour and you're doing shoots for people where they get to look like they live in a dope lifestyle they look like they're living but that's that's different than a glamour shot a glamour shot is like supposed to be funny it's not supposed to be funny dude that it looks funny now when we look back like i look back at your dad with an afro or whatever like actually you had an afro in high school so if you look back at your own high school that's supposed to be funny at the time i don't know if you were trying to be funny but for glamour shots like they are they're trying to be grammar but that's different with these instagram things you're talking about be like lying you're trying by looking cool yeah so so that's one one angle to it i think you're lying you don't live in that fancy-ass house yeah but you're not saying i live here you're just posing a picture like people do this we're gonna have like a like people rent fancy cars and they take pictures with it and then they've returned the question you know anyone who does that personally thank god no have i seen the people who do that on instagram yes i've seen people do it on instagram tons of people do that on instagram it's like uh what you would need is people write dresses for the day you know dude you would just need like a like one airline seat and like what yeah dude you've seen that right the half private jet it's like a movie set it's like where they film pornos exactly so so there's that i think okay but that's a little capital intensive to get airbnb's maybe you do it with a green screen so i think one one way you can do this is you could just have someone come take pictures with a green screen and you just do it where once they take the pictures once in one of your locations with a green screen very cheap to do then you cgi them into like a whole bunch of different looks that becomes their collection of of like they could be power suit they could be it could be boss mode they could be party mode they could be whatever but you just have green screen props and scenarios and you show them exactly how to pose to look good most people don't even know how to pose myself included when you meet somebody who knows how to pose you're like oh like that's [ __ ] half of it the other half is like lighting and [ __ ] props but like and editing right like but do you remember when the guy came to take photos of us at the miami thing he was like all right stand here half squint your eye you're like why yeah i was like i was like down syndrome what do you mean he's like no trust me kind of squint your eye he's like then you know like protrude your neck forward i was like no this looks like a turtle he's like no look watch i got rid of your double chin you know you look like sharper and like more powerful okay look at this angle this this gives you confidence look from this angle specifically whereas for me i'm like the [ __ ] nutcracker if i take a photo it's like stand straight look straight hands on my side smile cheese like that's how i take all my photos right but there is an art to posing and most people don't know how to do it so i think there's a there's a version of glamour shots that somebody could reboot that just gives you an end product that you want for social media i don't know exactly i would just say i would just say bring back the classics i think that you could just you could just do it as is what happened to the company so did it dude you could just do this with like dating profiles and stuff whatever um i don't know the company still exists but i think it's kind of like just gone down the drain i don't know i i don't know the ending of that story i wonder what happened to the founders does he have like some his name's bob does he have like some huge like mansion now in la like that glamour shot money one thousand percent he's going to have a huge mansion advantage take two seconds to just google that i bet you i bet you this guy's got to have a thing in l.a and if he doesn't we're just going to edit this part out uh i can't see but is it actually bob ooh he lives in texas in dripping springs texas which is near austin and it's where like it's like where moms who get glamour shots live it's like the suburbs of texas by the way that's the glamour shots is still thriving in texas i think that's the only place where it's still like a thriving business i think i read that dude this guy's awesome that's all i got those are my topics this is awesome we got to get bob on here um all right that's the pod [Music] you

dude that's crazy that that that mistake that's a 10 million dollar mistake [Music] um andrew what's going on dude i'm are you pumped to do this i'm really yeah i'm excited i've worked out this morning and phil feel good it's a nice sunny day we had a big dump of snow here which is actually incredibly rare usually it like never goes below freezing so uh yeah it's nice what'd you do uh no i actually went on my treadmill i started i it's weird i was kind of feeling like a little low energy over christmas and i realized this hadn't worked out and so i was like i'll take you know am i eating the right thing am i doing the right routines am i doing my gratitude journalism can't relate what supplements am i taking you've never had and then i just worked out yeah i just realized like working out is all you need to do there's a there's a great quote it's in um this book i was reading called the body and it basically said like if we could put in pill form all the benefits that exercise gives you you it'll be the it would be the most successful medicine of all time right and the whole point of the book was um it was called the body by bill burst and i by bryson i love that book and uh he's just he's like basically like sleep and exercise are the cure to most everything yeah it's crazy i love his writing he's uh he's great um do we want to get into this sean yeah let's do it um we did this last year and uh i think it was probably my favorite episode last year we called it the millie awards we did an awards ceremony at the end of the year andrew came on and we did it in 2020 at the end of the year and i actually went back and i listened to it which is you know it's cringy to listen to your own voice recorded but it was a really entertaining episode and we made a bunch of predictions i actually even kind of noted some of them down i don't know if you guys saw that like some of the um some of the things that we had said last year and uh and so we're gonna do it again and we're gonna try to make this an annual tradition we'll see how it goes and uh all right so without further ado here we are the 2021 milli awards we are back and uh we got about the way it works so we got a bunch of different categories the three of us did our research did our thinking about who we think is the winner for each we did not tell each other did not show each other so if we have the same answer it's just coincidence um great minds think alike and we're going to react to kind of how each one goes and i have a little side game here which i'm going to play as little notepad i'm just going to kind of take notes of who i think wins each category in terms of their answer so we'll see we'll see who brings the heat uh during this thing i got sam i got sean i got andrew and i'll put a little tally for and i'm the only judge or you guys can chime in on that but i'm just going to keep note of how we do for for this whole episode all right so did i miss anything sam are we good to go yeah and we what i'm i all right so i have up i have two documents i have one document with like my answers and then i've got the other document that have last year's answers and so i think what we should do is you can lead and you could say like the the category and then you could say here's what last years are right okay so we'll work all right so we'll start with uh we'll start with uh breakout company so uh this is the 2021 breakout company it's a company that kind of like exploded wait no billy of the year is first sean okay you want to go in the actual order we can go to the actual order all right so billy of the year is number one then we do billy of the week sometimes on the pod so this is billy of the year it doesn't have to be somebody who's a new billionaire but it's just a billionaire who had a hell of a year last year sam said chuck feeney who is um who's check video he's the guy from blockbuster and all that stuff or that's somebody else no he's just a he was like he started a business where they sell [ __ ] at airports but he gave away free yeah duty-free but he gave away all of it giveaways we gave away 10 billion andrew had mark leonard who's i think the ceo of constellation software is that right who's you know maybe uh yeah you know somebody you respect who runs a similar playbook to you buys great companies owns them for a long time very stealthy secretive guide you shared a bunch of cool stories about how he keeps a low profile and then i had eric yuan who was the ceo of zoom because i thought zoom sort of saved the world during the pandemic and let the world continue to run and um and so i had eric eric you on so who do we have for this year we'll start with sam billy of the year who you got darmesh the cto and co-founder of hubspot he came on our podcast sucking up to your boss well yeah i mean i guess but he uh he just had the idea outlook on life and i think he had an amazing job like he basically said no one reports to him and he doesn't report to anyone i think he i don't know what what's he worth like two billion dollars whatever hubspot stock is worth i thought he was pretty amazing at a good outlook and what was the outlook that you liked i thought the most interesting thing about dharmesh is exactly what you said that instead of i think so many entrepreneurs are like okay i'm either all in or i'm all out and he kind of said you know what i'm just going to do this stuff i like and he's kind of a floater like he just kind of floats around within the company and i thought that was really cool and he was nice the thing about darmesh is that he's nice and he's friendly and he's calm and i really enjoy that about him he's not a type a or he is type a and that he's competitive but he's not like trying to alpha people he's very comfortable in his uh all right andrew who you got billy of the year so mine it was actually a guy i randomly met so i was at this cocktail party at a just a house in my neighborhood and i was talking to this guy and i started asking him what he did and he said he was in the the kind of beverage space and he started saying names that i kind of knew like mission hill winery which is like a big winery up here and anyway it turns out this guy's worth 8 billion dollars and he owns a beverage focused holding company called mark anthony group this guy named anthony von mandel and his story is pretty crazy so he started a little like wine importing business in vancouver and uh made enough money to buy a winery called mission hill took out a ton of debt the it was like dirt floors had only a few barrels of wine turned it around turned into a real solid business and then he hit it big when he was trying to diversify and he started a company called mike's hard lemonade which i'm sure you guys have heard of and this is like an insane story like in the 90s people would have fights in the liquor store over the last couple bottles of mike's heart uh it went into the states uh and sold by the way in america we like make fun of people who drink like it's like a joke like mike's heart totally well the idea the idea they had was like men are too embarrassed to drink coolers so like let's make a cooler they can kind of not be too embarrassed to drink but anyway he ended up building that into a massive business uh he ended up also starting white claw a couple years ago which is like the same idea but healthy and now they do 1.4 or sorry 4 billion dollars of revenue uh last year in 2020 uh and the craziest thing about this guy is he owns i believe a hundred percent of the business and he has no debt because he had been almost in bankruptcy multiple times so it was just totally crazy local entrepreneur who just knocked it out of the park and i'm obsessed with these guys who have just like taken a risk they've done it 100 themselves they didn't have vcs they didn't have investors uh so just an amazing story wow that's a good one that's a good i didn't realize the mic's hard the company has mike's heart also does white claw which is amazing it's basically a reboot of the similar concept um totally okay all right what about you my billy of the year so i had two all right so i have um i have the eye roll one which is elon musk but it's not for the reason that most people would think um as you know one of the maybe top three slogans of this podcast is bet on yourself and elon several years ago did a bet on yourself comp compensation plan that you guys probably remember i don't know if everybody knows about this i'll summarize it and i'm kind of hand waving through some of the details just to be quicker about it but basically tesla at the time i think it was five years ago was at about a 50 billion dollar market cap and people the rumor was elon's gonna leave and he might uh you know go just focus on spacex full-time and he had a negotiation with the board and basically said okay i'll stay but here's the compensation plan i want and he sketched out a plan he said look you only pay me if i increase shareholder value yeah no guaranteed money and he basically did it where in rough strokes every 50 billion in market cap they added he would get another 1 of the company and so it was at 50 billion so he'd have to get 100 billion to get anything if he got to 99 he got nothing and so he had to get it to 100 to get any more for all his hard work and uh i remember there's a great clip if you go to youtube and you just go you just you just search for uh elon musk compensation plan uh you know cnbc there's this clip of the anchors making fun of them because they're like oh yeah and like you know this plan is it's unprecedented it has this far-fetched idea that if he could get over 600 billion you know elon would get this huge unlock if he gets to that reward but you know i think we could safely say like you know it's never going to happen like you know why even include that in there and sure enough this year tesla crosses all that he hits every single part of the compensation plan i think it's a it's now a trillion dollar company uh and basically the guy called a shot he bet on himself and uh and hit all of it so i really like that like the betting on yourself aspect of it so that's why i give it to elon but what was the second one the second one uh again a little bit of a of an expected answer but not not for the reason you think so vitalik buterin who's the co-creator of ethereum he's worth himself probably 1.6 billion i think as of the based on the like the value of ethereum today something like that one or two billion dollars but he was uh one of the like there's all these new projects constantly launching and one of the ways that projects were trying to get hype in marketing is that they would just send some of their project into vitalik's wallet his public wallet and they would say look vitalik holds our coins so you should too and then the other thing that they would say that was the first marketing scheme people do like and then people fell for they're like oh vitalik's investing in this i'll invest in it too but like he didn't actually invest in it they just sent it for free just shoved it in his wallet the second thing that people were doing was they were using vitalik as sort of like a lockup they were like look we sent it's a one one uh coin that came out the shiba inu coin which is like a dog another dog coin like dogecoin they sent i think six five or six billion dollars worth of their coin uh to vitalik's wallet to essentially lock it up they're like look that's all there it can't be sold um and so yeah you're not i can't be sold like it's there so you don't have to worry about like you know who owns this thing vitalik owns this thing and um it was partly marketing it was partly their their way of like locking away some of the supply and what vitalik did was pretty awesome india was going through a really tough patch in covid so he got this thing and what he did was he donated a billion dollars of it immediately to india and then he dumped the other five billion and just burned it and just said uh you know so so that like it would so that the price if if he sold it all on the open market it would um it would crash the price so instead he took five billion and just eliminated it from the pool and gave a billion dollars to india kept none of it for himself and helped a lot of people in india out and he did this like overnight as soon as he got it and i just thought that that was like you know a pretty remarkable thing from a pretty you know remarkable guy who he's that guy's amazing it's really cool that guy and the sam bankman guy are some probably the two most interesting people i think in the world at the moment yeah the cool thing about that for those who don't remember the sam bank but freed guy he's currently the wealthiest person from crypto um wealthiest known person from crypto so you know nobody knows who satoshi is but sam banker freed is the next one he's got like 15 or 20 billion dollar net worth from crypto including the exchange he created and um he if you talk if you listen to interviews he's like not like any other crypto zealot he just is like uh he's like yeah i don't care about crypto like i don't i don't i believe in it not believe in people want this so i made a product and like that's his whole mindset and he also is like obsessed with this idea of like i forgot what it's called there's some like a philanthropic thing he's really into like uh sam do you remember the name of this it's like charitable ambition or some [ __ ] like that it's like yeah he basically he was basically uh basically the idea is like i'm just gonna get as wealthy as possible and give it all away to different stuff and it's okay for me to be incredibly ambitious and do this thing these things i don't really care about because i'm just giving it away anyway and he's giving away like during his lifetime said last year's all right breakout company you go for all right breakout company i have um i have open c so just to give you a sense of open seas crazy growth i had that too by the way started in 2017 and the the bear market hit like pretty much immediately and i know people who were building like their competitors and they ended up folding because it was just like there was no interest and these guys were like you know the cockroaches that just stayed alive and in 20 uh basically they in 2020 so last year they did 24 million dollars in gmv pretty small overall um and they get uh 10 of that uh they have i don't know what their take rate is something like i think it's even lower than that i think it's five percent or something they it's in that range so it was very small 24 million in gross sales across the platform that's not their sales that's what people buying from each other so they just get a small take this year 15 billion so going from 24 million to 15 billion in one year that's 650x to me that's uh that's a breakout company i know we've talked about them before so it's not a big surprise but i had to give it to him so i had that as well but i came with the backup because i actually thought that you were gonna pick that so i had open c as well i think it's amazing that they basically just kind of created a market and i think that's pretty badass um or at least they were part of a market that is was non-existent a couple years ago all right so my second one is someone who we talked about i'm gonna botch his first name but his last name is levels what's his first name peter peter p is it peter is it just peter okay i think that's peter i thought it was a weird let's call him pieter just about i thought it was peter to be honest but i'm gonna call him peter all right so this guy is peter like theater that's how we're gonna call that's what i thought it was i thought there was an eye in there in some weird area um all right but we talked about this guy a couple episodes ago but i've actually been paying attention to him for like three years and as far as i can tell it's a one-person business and for the longest time he would reveal all of his revenue and for years it was like two or three hundred thousand dollars a year in revenue and he has a bunch of different products he's got nomadlist.com remoteok.com workers.co he even has a cool website called rebase which is all about going to uh portugal moving to portugal so he's got like eight different websites for the longest time only like three four five hundred thousand dollars a year in revenue like neat but not that cool this year he got close to five million in revenue and for a one person internet business that's pretty phenomenal and the remote thing has basically kind of caught up with him and he's crushing it and this guy's an artist i love him i think so he's kind of his own entity and i think that he for me was the breakout person of the year behind opens yeah i think like that guy kind of has my dream life which is funny that i say that because i do own similar businesses but i've always i've always liked fetishized the idea of being a one-person entrepreneur and being able to do that level of revenue i just kind of got ahead of myself and it's so interesting i think i have a lot of respect for him because i think he still shares his numbers most of the guys that get to this scale they almost always stop sharing because everyone realizes how much money they're making i have a story of a guy who's going to come on the pod soon and he i've been talking to him and he made um 10 million a year in profit in the early 2000s from uh a a lyric website that was around for years so i have a one person is it maloon maloon tesovic no but he is a similar similar story he's a he's a russian jewish guy that guy a russian jewish guy didn't didn't yeah i also make like a dream i don't know he's not a drinker eastern european oh my god no okay that guy balloon didn't he do something else that's really remarkable now like he did the lyrics thing and isn't he doing some other interesting stuff he works at expo right he's a partner at expo gotcha uh all right andrew who do you have uh sam has this like weird indie breakout company that's not a company it's just bro i chose open c that's the most obvious one i chose that i chose that one too so i had to get used to so far i'm mr obvious sam's mr suck up and uh let's see if andrew's got something good here so i wasn't trying to be better i was just trying to be different so so if there's one thing i really really don't like it's middlemen realtors uh investment bankers that kind of stuff so i love this company microacquire for a long time if you wanted to buy a tech business you were going to these crappy listing websites with really like really sketchy sites with really low quality businesses uh and this guy andrew basically came along and started this company called microacquire and it's for uh generally like profitable sas businesses uh on the web and he's just done a really really nice job of doing it i'd say it's kind of like zillow for buying a tech business um and i i you know he kind of replaced flippa and all these other kind of crappy websites so i'm a big fan of what he's doing and fighting just raised like 10 million bucks or something like that we're all investors i think right i am i didn't invest but but uh i think it's a good one well i invested a small a very small amount like five thousand dollars or one thousand dollars or something like tiny but he uh he's picking fights with people online too he's kind of making himself to be a kind of a villain to a certain group of people which we'll see if that ends up being uh a good idea who's he going after i forget the funny thing is i think he's going after like uh he's basically saying like he went after two groups so he's like first like bootstrappers need like some love like you know if you're a profitable company like why is that getting no attention and then the second thing is he's going after techcrunch because they don't cover those types of companies they just they basically work for the vcs it's kind of like his angle it's like he's a good angle he created a rival publication i think called the bootstrappers to just take a shot at techcrunch um i'm like i will cover these companies if you guys aren't going to but then the only hypocrisy is that he's raising a bunch of venture capital so i think you know that part you know breaks down a little bit uh but i think he's doing a good job of picking a fight and there's this general's twitter strategy which is if you like totally sell out to your mission which is like both a good and a bad thing you could just like there's a guy who um uh i i was friendly with chris heard he created a company that's around remote work and they help basically like manage companies like laptops and desks your desk setup when you work from home they'll help you as a company manage your workers desk setups and uh so he just every tweet is just about how remote work is taking over and how everything else is gonna die and it'll just be he's just that's the propaganda machine and you just keep beating that drum every day every day he just keeps talking about how the office is dead remote work is going up but he cannot be wrong and yeah and it's just like you know a total like brainwashing of content but you know it's it's pretty effective when people do do that i can't really bring myself to do that exactly but it works okay so who um i would give it to open c oh i'm getting it okay great i love it right yeah great microacquire is cool but open c is just there's levels and micro honestly i would do yours man i think um yours is the most unique right i think open c had a big win but it's like you know i think venture-backed kind of like of the moment crypto stuff mine i think everyone knows about but i think what peter's doing is very unique um and it's just when you think about lifestyle i think he has the best possible lifestyle of any of the people here what's a story where a guy goes to a party hosted by whoever like you know some rockefeller type it's like you know his friend is saying this guy's the richest man in the world he's got everything he's got this he's got that he's got cars he's got servants he's got everything and then the guy who's the guest goes uh yeah but i have something he'll never have enough enough and um yeah that's the kurt vonnegut yeah it was kurt vonnegut and joseph heller i think right so that's the version of you know andrew you had peter levels but you you didn't have enough and so you kept going and there's a part of you that envies that lifestyle still uh all right we're giving it to you and once you start once you start once you get in office once you have employees you have this beast to feed whereas peter could just check out right one of these days we should do a story of someone who has done that who went one way and they just said ah [ __ ] it we're gonna go the opposite and went back i love those arms all right i get this one uh all right so uh the unsexy simple business that you saw this year i'll go first we talked about it this guy named quinn i think his name is quinn emmett is that the guy saying spider right is it snyder i don't remember what it was actually but he had a vent he had a vending machine business and he started he was just working in sales at like some tech company and i i did like a little checkup on him he's doing like thirty thousand dollars a month in revenue and half of that is profit and he basically started with fifteen hundred dollars he's got uh some vending machines throughout uh his city i forget where he is california i think started with fifteen hundred dollars now he has software that tells him when the things need to get refilled and he says he only works 10 hours a week on it i think that's pretty cool i think that's pretty awesome i love that by the way quinn snyder is a basketball coach so definitely he's definitely not quinstein or something else i think it was emmett quinn uh andrew who you got for best unsexy or simple business that you saw this year i feel like you see a ton of these so this is probably the easiest category for you i see a lot and i looked i looked at a bunch of ones that people had brought us and i just i can't really share but this is one i came across recently that i think is genius so some guy um he went and he basically built a fake interior of a private jet in los angeles like they used like a movie set or whatever and then they just rent it out to influencers so that they can take photos where it looks like they're on a private jet but they're not and they charge 70 bucks an hour i think it's booked out like 12 hours a day probably doing like 20 to 40k a month and i can't imagine the margins would be less than 80 and i was like that's [ __ ] amazing you could just build this thing hire a bunch of people in the movie business to build it over a weekend and then you know you can own that for like years what was it called uh it's la private jet studio it's on pure space which is like a um a photo photo uh shoot like a studio listing that is so that's a great one um all right i have one i'm gonna steal this from our friend of the pod cody sanchez uh sam you sent this link earlier and i think this is a great one did you st take the one that i sent you because she has a bunch of that's the one that's what i'm taking it was better than the one i had so i was like oh this is we'll use this one instead so she by the way her tick tock is blown up so she's always on my i know she's crazy dude her last one just got 10 million views that's insane like her she has half a million followers on tick tock i always see them when i'm because i use tik tok a bunch and i'm always like oh like i was in my head i would just see like i don't know 30 comments i'd be like oh you know tick tock's so hard and like when i saw that it actually has added up it's just you know yet another reminder of the value of just keep going compound the the wins over time so she was doing this thing she goes here's a boring business that um that that you love and um it's called american striping and all it is is this woman owns this business and it just paints the white line that you need for like a road like lane basically or like a parking spot you know it's like i need to paint these white straight lines and so she has this company american striping i think it started about three years ago and uh you know four hundred thousand dollars the first year seven million the second year 15 million almost the third year and just crushing it just absolutely crushing it and according to cody seventy percent profit yes exactly somewhere 60 70 profit margins i don't i don't know i don't know much about it because again my research was watching this tick tock five minutes before this pod but uh what a beautiful business and what a you know what a great reminder that like you know you you read about elon musk and you're like oh i have to like send rockets to mars and then you read about the girl who's like i drop straight white lines and i can make millions of dollars a year and it just reminds you you know you can win the game any any way so she's my pick i love that i am i would vote for that one okay i'm gonna take that in honor of cody so we are at one one one right now so we're one each by the way i have a a little honorable mention here an unsexy business that's done extremely well have you guys looked at crocs stock yeah crushing it thanks to post malone dude 2020 when the pandemic happened so march 2020 you could you could have bought a pair of crocs for i don't know how much crocs go for let's call it a hundred bucks maybe there's a little less uh you could buy a pair of crocs and you could buy the stock for ten dollars a share it's now up 13 x in one year just during the the pandemic was good to crocs and uh i just thought that was like an amazing winner uh out of this like pandemic time is it possible is that who's driving it he was he kind of hopped on that trend really early and then they created this new thing called like crocs i forget what they're called but they're like charms that you put on your crocs and if you drive around the midwest or in the south like how do we make every glare what could we do oh let's dangle charms off of them do you know what i'm talking about like my wife is obsessed with these and she buys them for our kids and puts them on yeah it's like like a you get like a soccer ball like pin or like a football pin or like some cartoon and the kids are obsessed with it and they're crushing it right now post malone uh started making them popular and a lot of country um music people like luke uh combs so you probably have no idea who that is started wearing camouflage crocs gotcha yeah who knew uh who knew by the way sam i got another real quick pop quiz for you hands up so i see you're not you're not looking it up i want you to guess the monthly visitors to onlyfans.com 20 million a month okay you're close it's 250 million tell you're off by 10x an order of magnets is it really that was gonna be my other unsexy business was actually the business of sexy uh which was like i had no idea they they get 250 million visitors per month that's insane that'd be one of the top websites in the world then there's another one called chatterbait that's it you know a broke man's version of only fans i gets 300 million oh my god it's insane um so you know but it didn't crazy didn't only fans did they say that they're no longer allowing nudity they did for a second and then they reversed course stupid like no more porn yeah facebook's like no more photos you know it doesn't work that's so stupid um by the way average visit duration four minutes all right we'll go to the next category your best investment okay so what was your best investment of 2021 uh let's kick it off with andrew so um i would uh the boring answer is aeropress i think but i've already talked about that on the pod um we we bought that maybe four or five months ago and that's been awesome so far but that story hasn't played out yet so the one and we haven't really done that much in the last year so the best one thing that i've been buying myself is actually a company called pershing square holdings i don't think i've talked about it so i have about 95 of my net worth in tiny and our kind of core businesses um but i've been quietly building kind of a backup forever rich retirement portfolio of stocks real estate brick and mortar businesses we own a chain of restaurants we have a hotel wait what a bunch of conventional stuff uh i just known a bunch of restaurants in victoria i know what is that we own a hotel in st louis oh marshall yeah yeah with marshall exactly is the hotel business cool it's amazing basically we bought this uh that we bought like a apartment building and converted it into all airbnb and we took it from we bought it super cheap and now it's yielding and you're a billionaire maybe you're my billy of the year uh i don't think not yet working on it it sounds like uh something you had to think about it that means you you might be round upping to it no i i no i i don't think i am um i don't really i i don't really have like a good picture on that stuff that's a good answer though i know businesses if the answer is i don't think i am then the answer then that's a good sign yeah what's that people say i don't i don't i don't spend a lot of i don't spend a lot of time on that stuff because you know a lot of people who are billionaires on paper like you know it doesn't really matter right you could invest in some startup it could get valued at 20 billion dollars you can own one percent whatever like i i just don't i don't spend too much time on that so anyway i i've been thinking about this and i go if everything goes pear-shaped i want to still be rich and i want to have enough money to live a great life and so and that's by that guy you like right bill ackman yeah yeah so i've been following bill for five or six years and i found that he had this holding company called pershing square holdings and what he did is really smart so he he had a hedge fund and when you have a hedge fund you have a whole bunch of investors and they give you cash to invest but at any given time they can freak out and they can take their money back so you could be in a down you know down you could own an amazing business and you could be forced to sell at the wrong time because an investor redeems and so he created this holding company in amsterdam i think he raised four billion dollars um and he called it pershing square holdings and it's basically a public holding company that just owns a bunch of stocks and it owns really great stuff it owns chipotle domino's hilton lowe's restaurant brands international so like burger king popeyes that kind of stuff and universal music and so it's this really diversified blue chip stock portfolio and as i dug into it i realized that it perpetually trades at a discount to the net assets there so if there's a hundred dollars worth of stocks it trades at about 70 meaning that the market could go down 30 percent before you've lost any money in the in the portfolio and then on top of that you have bill ackman managing your money and he does crazy [ __ ] like he last year he turned 25 million dollars into 2.7 billion and i got to ride along with him on that so anyway i've been buying that almost exclusively i've got probably like 60 percent of my portfolio in this and i just keep buying more and more every month uh and i've quadrupled my money i think over the last couple of years did he do this awesome that that crazy trade that he made last year the covert trade was that out of these vehicles or that was out of a separate vehicle yeah that was in this vehicle and anyone could have bought that and he did the universal actually last year or something like that yeah you've talked about this you like um okay great so that's a good one uh sam what you got your best investment um i bought a i bought a a big lot in austin kind of boring but i bought a big lot in austin i used um an asset-backed loan so i used cash to buy it like i told them i bought it in cash in reality it was a loan at a one percent interest rate and i it's not the story again hasn't played out but it's already appreciated because i've gotten offers on it but i'll make about five hundred thousand dollars in tax free profit with very little work and the work that i've been doing on it is fun i'm learning a skill i'm learning how to develop a home profitably um so uh that that's gonna be my it's probably not my best just like investing in the s p 500 that's up 30 that i mean that's but that's not much of an investment i didn't do anything and so the uh my my austin real estate project will be the most like actively i think active thing that i'm managing and make the most that's a good one uh by the way the youtube video on your personal youtube channel the uh this is sampar or the sampara yeah just my name you you show the the lot the kind of like the rundown shack that's there today it's great uh it's fun right it's way more in watch that and what you just said will be way more entertaining it's great but i also i feel like you might make 500 grand but if you'd made 5 million passively it wouldn't feel as good as exactly that's why i'm saying you've done it it's better because it's fun like it's i'm basically developing a skill uh and it's been quite fun and the tax implications are quite nice yeah that's great um okay good my my best investment i'm gonna go with this startup that i invested in so last year i think it was last year last year i created a rolling fund and it was basically said hey if anybody wants to invest in startups alongside me you know you don't have to have the network you don't have to have the knowledge all you got to have is the cash you could do this and i was like okay i wanted to start it i was like i want to start this off i want to make it enticing for somebody to join because you could invest in a number of people who are professional full-time investors who have been doing this for a decade so i was kind of thinking like why would somebody invest in me and so i said let me juice it up a little bit let me put three of my personal angel investments into this deal uh into this like fund and uh so they'll be able to say look i i get to sort of like great i get grandfathered into these deals that you've already done that's a very kind of you and i was self-serving like i wanted my fund to get subscribers quickly so i was like how do i provide more value here here's here's some free value now looking back it actually has turned out to be very kind because the very first deal that i put in is a company called deal d-e-e-l and what deal does is it's the easiest way to hire a contractor um so like i was paying i wanted to hire this guy in australia the guy who actually first was editing our podcast like how do i pay this podcast editor in australia and so i was like oh um you know do i need to go get a lawyer to make a contract and how do i pay them in his local currency and then what are the compliance rules around that how much taxes do i need to pay like i don't i don't understand all this so i went to deal and literally in five minutes i was like uh here's the guy's name here's his email address here's where he lives it's like here's a contract it's like would you like to add a confidentiality clause yeah yeah toss that in it's like guac on my burrito like you know i'll go for that and then it was like great it's sent for signature and the payments will come out of your bank account and it'll pay him in australian dollars automatically every month and i was like wow that was like kind of magical it basically replaced you know what a bunch of humans would have to do so i loved it so i ended up chasing down the founder and i was like yo your product is amazing um how do i invest in this and he was like oh you know i'd love to have you and i didn't invest right then and then you know when i followed up he was like oh dude we just closed a thing sorry i forgot like you know you didn't follow up so so i missed the first round and then i almost missed the second one what was the valuation of the first one first one might have been i don't remember exactly but it's like a startup you know like maybe 12 million cap or 20 million cap something like that and so uh he's like don't worry i'll get you into the next round i was like okay great so he messages me one day he says brother like you know i got your spot for you next round's coming together let me know i'm like oh i'm in 25k no questions asked he's like great got you in and i was like i was like actually you know one question i guess what is the valuation actually what does it happen to be and he's like you know i don't know if i can say this probably i can say this it was like a million and i was like what and i was like uh and i was like okay and i didn't want to go back on my words i i like the product i like the founder a lot and i was like i said i'm in so i'm in and i was like ah [ __ ] okay whatever and then i was like you know do you have like crazy traction like how are you getting this this thing he's like you know we're doing well but like you know he told me the number and i was like that's an absurd valuation for this thing i was like who's doing this deal and his andreessen was doing the deal he's like these guys are nuts uh well i don't know why they're doing this but whatever i wrote the check did it anyways it that it was valued this year at five and a half billion um like you know two years later they said he and the founder tweeted this out so i can share this they ramped up revenue from four million to 50 million in arr in one year and um they went from 50 employees to 550 employees in one year and so this is just like an insane amount of traction that's like you know actually andreessen knew what they were doing they you know they they bet on this before because i think the revenue was definitely less than four million at the time it was re it was valued at 200 million and so you know the value investor and andrew would have been dying in that moment it just didn't make any sense it didn't make sense to me even but this has turned out to be a pretty amazing deal uh you know so if not including dilution which is a big factor here so take that for what it's worth so 12 million into five and a half billion is 458 so your 25 000 in that 12 round would have been worth over 11 million yes exactly and my buddy my buddy ryan uh did that deal at that at that round and uh reminded me as such about like the crazy markup and so you know the 25k has turned into half a million but man that's the difference between half a million and 12 million was following up oh my god all right so wait is this my best investment or worst investor maybe this is my worst investment actually i mean 25k to half a million by the way well it would have been good and then i put it in the the rolling fund so now you know most of the economics went to my investors dude that's crazy that that that mistake that's a 10 million dollar mistake yeah and it was by the way this was a period of like i don't know less than a year between the between like when when one round happened and the next round happened so you know could have uh could yeah coulda woulda shoulda all right so who are we giving this round to best investment me okay for my sob story at least i have at least i have this to lean back on all right let's go to worst investment what was your worst investment of 2021 i'll go first mine's easy zillow i bought silver on that one yeah i i only bought three stocks individual stocks this year one was playboy and playboy kind of makes sense because only a billion dollar valuation 200 million in revenue and i thought the brand was easily worth that i'm actually thinking about buying aston martin stock at aston martin is only valued at like one or two billion dollars it's like the cheapest car maker but i think they're gonna have a resurgence so i'm thinking about doing that but i bought playboy thinking that was my logic and i was wrong but then zillow was way wrong zillow was wrong because i bought at it's the most expensive point tell people why we bought this stock we bought it because we're in this chat group and our friend nikita and austin reef were like zillow's the greatest thing ever and so i bought like 25 or 50 grand worth of zillow and i agreed with them i thought yeah you know you're right like whenever i go to a fancy neighborhood i just pull up zillow and i like browse it all the time it's kind of a category definer like defining company like i'm on board with zillow i thought how much were they worth when we bought like 15 or 20. i don't know it's down 56 percent so i bought 100k and now my 100k is 44k uh left it made sense like i don't regret it like i'm on board with it but the problem was is that it went down just because like we were wrong then it went down because they [ __ ] it up with buying all those houses and it went down even more yeah so we were wrong like twice and by the way they they lost 56 of their value in a year where the housing market went like bananas so you know it's not like there was something out of their control and their industry that was doing poorly you know didn't didn't rich barton come back or something was he the guy he's the original founder and a really great investor and a great leader great entrepreneur yeah and and he came back and he tried to do the house buying stuff i would still i would honestly maybe i think it's a great company it's awesome i think basically what happened was a bunch of bad stuff happened including one tick tock went really viral explaining how like they're evil because they're like big corporations buying hundreds of homes and that totally [ __ ] them if anyone's tick tock is the winner here the fact that they haven't disintermediated real realtors though like the fact you can't or maybe you can and i'm just not aware but i just want to be able to list my house on zillow and then have an open outcry auction one day like where you say like on this day i want to have an auction everyone's going to bid and then we'll get the maximum price and they do all the paperwork like that would be i invested in money i invested in a company that does that they were called rumor it's kind of a silly name but they re-change it to also a silly name it's called dorsey so yeah it's i gotta call this is not bad i like darcy so don't doors it's like the word door and then s-e-y and uh it's a live home auction and uh it's started by the guy who started hello alfred kind of a cool company i just sent it to you in the chat yeah so zillow was your worst investment hey just before we jump i want to know about playboy so what's the what's the thesis there like they still have the magazine obviously it's kind of a you know there's a lot of legacy because it can't be the magazine like where's the money coming from yeah merchandise basically and so they own the they they own the playboy mansion which is worth uh nine figures i believe and they recently did a spec in 2020 and so they reported 200 million dollars in revenue in 2021 or that's what the forecast is going to be when i invested i think their market cap was just a hair above 1 billion and um basically my my logic right now it's one exactly 1 billion my logic was basically like i'm pretty sure that brand is worth more than that like if they just like put their logo on stuff i was like i know young people don't really care about it as much but i think that brand is pretty valuable and i couldn't put a value on it but i thought it was above what they were trading for so it was kind of i kind of just made a kind of a gut call but it's down half wasn't it it was a guy the guy who bought that was the guy who bought twinkies or hostess or something random like yeah yeah like um yeah he was the guy who bought twinkies made a ton of money on it then he bought pbr i think it is a i mean it's a very iconic it's a really iconic brand yeah i know that like they tried i had a friend that tried that almost bought uh this guy the guys at the chive almost sold to playboy and they told me about going to the mansion and they told me that they playboy was thinking about selling the mansion and they told me like how much it was worth and it was it's like a crazy high number and i thought well [ __ ] just with this stuff like this is worth more than the if you're only fans why would you not just buy playboy i think it's really interesting you don't need it that brand i mean what's it worth that you know i don't know 500 million people know your name and associate it like that's got to be worth to to a company that has a money plan if you are a money printer what what does it take to accelerate your brand like that that i don't know that's well let's be let's be real i mean tai lopez is gonna turn into some sort of cryptocurrency all right where are you what's yours andrew yeah so mine i can't say what it is we didn't actually announce the business but so the mistake we made is we bought an ember what i mean by that is it's like this little tiny ember and it could turn into a bonfire if you blow on it a lot but you have to be very attentive and we're not set up to be attentive we're kind of management by neglect we buy these businesses we plug in ceos and then they go on to do great and the problem is when you have this little tiny startup this is a business it was a real business with real revenue and profits but it was very small and we liked what we saw but the problem is we couldn't attract someone great to run it and so the business the ember just kind of burnt out over time and we ended up spending like a million bucks so it was just a total money bonfire uh and pointless and unsatisfying and so the lesson for us is just board a cruise ship you know don't don't try and build your own boat that's a good announcement two good analogies ember and cruise ship um all right my worst investment uh i'm gonna give you the fast answer because i think we're gonna run short on time all right mine is holding coveted winners for too long so i had this amazing run-up on zoom stock fastly which is a like uh edge you know like a cloud or what's called a cdn um and agora which does like you know voice and video um sdks so they power clubhouse and things like that and i own these stocks they ran up like crazy you know 2x 3x or whatever in like a very short amount of time and then they've all come crashing back down to earth um you know in the last six months or so and so i lost money just by holding on to the coveted winners for for too long even when like for example with agora i got in because i knew clubhouse was growing but then i was the one who kind of almost like famously called the clubhouse is gonna fail and it's gonna gonna tank and yet i still held my agora i forgot to sell my agora stock and it's cut in half um you know so that that sort of thing so i would say my i lost a nice chunk of change holding my covered winners for too long how awesome would it be if you could short private companies like imagine if you saw clubhouse and you could go and short it and maybe maybe there is a way to do it if anyone has any ideas i'd love to hear them but um stuff like that is quite obvious uh that if you have you ever used poly market it's basically like a crypto betting it's like a like a bookie basically but you could bet on anything you could bet on sports games you could bet will joe biden get coveted uh you could bet whatever and it's only a yes or no so there's so and the market sets the line so basically if everybody thinks yes then proportionately no will be rewarded like if you bet no but two-thirds of people bet yes you're going to get a payout more than one-to-one on your money because you're taking the underdog side of things and um and so there's a so this idea of prediction markets works really well in in crypto and uh and so there's a few of these that are out there um i love betting on poly market dude we should do we should do an annual uh betting episode where we all make predictions and bets and then we put it on poly market and we have to put our own money up that'd be awesome do you still stand by that is club what's the update on clubhouse are you going to be right yeah it looks like it like the charts all you know it's a it looks like mount everest right it's like goes up and then it goes straight there's there's not a world where like it's just like maybe not growing a ton but they still have like a million people a day using it or something like that uh well look you never count out an entrepreneur those guys are really talented entrepreneurs they can always pivot uh it's that you know the product as it is today did not become what people bet on it to become right andreessen put it a four billion dollar price tag on it basically betting that it's gonna become like a twitter it's gonna become a facebook or a snap and uh it's not happening uh that has that hasn't happened the one good thing is that they they have the same kind of like hype cycle or not hype i shouldn't say that but like uh trend fad cycle in different countries so like in india they'll get like it happened in america they got super popular and then usage faded it wasn't super sticky and then the same thing will happen in india it'll get super popular and then it'll start to fade in popularity and so the overall numbers aren't like totally zero but it's the problem is if you're a leaky bucket you're a leaky bucket it's just a matter of time tall the water's gone and uh that's i don't know i think i think i'm right but i don't honestly don't pay too much attention to it but people will often tweet at me charts of their downloads going down to be like you're right so that's all i know it's basically people cherry-picking evidence andrew andrew chen's got to come on the pod you know that right oh is he yeah will he be able to talk to me or am i blocked from the pod too we'll see he'll he'll block you he'll meet you all right uh who's the winner on that one um i'm gonna go i like i think andrew had a good lesson in there all right we'll go with that oh that's we're gonna go andrew there all right let me um i'm gonna uh i'm gonna combine the next one can i do that yeah okay so i'm gonna combine it with favorite digital tool favorite physical tool and best product under 100 and above a thousand and i'll go first so favorite digital is true bill andrew you should use true bill you said that you forget subscriptions true bill is awesome like just today i didn't realize that me and my wife both had an amazon prime membership true bill i paid like 50 bucks oh no or 10 it's like really cheap and it's a sick app that syncs your bank account and tells you the subscriptions that you have and it makes it easy to cancel it have you heard of that sweet they just got acquired i don't i don't know if it works in canada but you just gotta acquire for 1.3 billion by rocket mortgages your guy dan gilbert um so pretty awesome favorite physical tool is this is kind of physical is a 50 app called camo that's let you use your iphone for uh like high def uh video calls pretty amazing and then favorite product that was above uh that was under 100 was lock a box it's a 38 box that i keep in my pantry that my wife knows the code of and she puts things that i don't want to have that i don't have self-control so she'll put like uh sweets in there and sometimes if i want to lock my phone for the weekend she'll put it in there so that's awesome and then above a thousand i bought a fancy car a mercedes amg station wagon that i love dude that was great okay uh andrew so we're doing a digital product physical product or kind of like a cheap or expensive thing you liked okay so um digital product uh consumerlab.com so it's like 49 bucks a year and it's basically wire cutter but for food and supplements so everything from like vitamin d to seaweed snacks to baby food they buy every single brand they test it and it's pretty shocking like i just today learned that the seaweed snacks that i've been giving my kids you know have like a bunch of arsenic in them right so it's just crazy stuff that could affect your life my favorite physical tool is this amazing thing my wife gifted for me randomly that i never thought i would use it's basically this game called the loser game and you play with friends and you basically all draw a card and on each card is a really kind of [ __ ] up deep question so for example how have you blamed someone for an issue that was if you're truly honest largely your fault or name a surprising basic embarrassing gap in your knowledge or anyway you go around in a circle you answer this i did this on a retreat with a couple friends that i did and these were all guys i know really really well and i left going holy [ __ ] there's just so many cool stories and interesting facts that we don't know about one another and this game kind of elicits it so that's been awesome and then physical thing that i bought this year i bought a house up at the lake about 40 minutes out of town here and it's been the best thing i could ever do just great place to go and hang out with family and check out of work and even though it's close it feels like a whole other world away that's great and i've seen the house it's awesome but i got a quick story on that thing you just said uh my first business i started with my two best friends from college and uh this is the sushi business or whatever we we met the chef and the chef goes all right here he goes he goes you guys are you guys man i love your guys's kind of like vibe like you guys are i can tell you guys really like each other he goes how long you guys know each other like did you just meet or while we're like no we've and we were just saying now we're thick as thieves we've known each other for years and he goes you can see you guys know each other pretty well huh and we're like yeah like why why he goes he goes uh sean what's uh what's the hardest thing trevor's ever been through i was like uh i have no idea he's like you know like just name something maybe and i was like i honestly have no clue and we did and all three of us had no idea of just what's the hardest thing that your your best friend has been through and um [Music] and he's like oh he goes he goes he goes yeah i kind of noticed this he goes y'all talk but you don't have conversations oh and i was like oh [ __ ] do mike drop and he goes he goes so you know you don't need to do this now but he's like but try it like go go a little deeper um just ask yourself these questions and we did it that night we kind of asked each other that question and then by the end we're all like dude i didn't know that about you like i feel like i knew you way better you know like i really i really know you now um and so that was a great reminder of like sometimes these questions can can take you you know further with your friends totally it's a superpower one of the questions i ask people when i have lunch i'll have like a small talk you know first time lunch with someone and i'll just randomly try and ask them are you happy or are you happy with where your life is right now and it's weird they will just go down a rabbit trail and tell you all sorts of crazy stuff you wouldn't normally tell somebody are you just mind [ __ ] people throughout victoria all right so i'll it well it just builds builds connection right i'll do mine okay so favorite digital thing uh this app called othership uh it's a breathwork app i do it every morning i love it it wakes me up it makes me feel good it's it slows me down and it speeds me up at the same time it slows me down from just rushing into my day feeling behind and then it speeds me up because when i come out of it i'm like i feel just like electric i feel like i'm on fire i could do whatever i want now so other ship is the name of that app i love that app um favorite uh what is it favorite okay my favorite physical tool is um this is gonna sound stupid all right so i grew out my hair and um you know i grow my hair just to like do it just to kind of have a like i don't know just have a change to do something different but i don't know anything about how to take care of hair and i'm like a really messy disorganized person who doesn't like you know i don't look in the mirror until 7pm that night i'm like oh i didn't haven't even looked at myself today and that doesn't really work when you got long hair like high maintenance hair so i went to a stylist and i was like you know can i get a little trim and uh she was like what do you want i was like i have no idea i have no idea what i want and also uh what i really want is like can you just like cut the haircut like half an hour short and just tell me what i should be doing like with my hair and she's like what do you mean i was like i was like so like i get in the shower if i want to do shampoo like here's how i do it you tell me if that's correct and i went through like these ultra basics with her and she was like what do you mean and then she was laughing but then through that conversation she's like oh like no no when you shampooed like don't be doing it on the roots because you're gonna end up stripping away all your natural oils like just do your conditioner and shampoo like from the middle to the end and like oh you're sleep you know your hair is really frizzy and you probably don't know why but like do you sleep on a cotton pillowcase and i was like yeah of course and she's like you need to switch that for silk because imagine you're spending eight hours a night rubbing your hair into this thing so she gave me these like three little things like a silk pillowcase this like uh curling cream she's like just use this because your hair won't look like it's just black or white white dude we have silk things in our in our house all over well yeah because if you have a black girl thing yeah no it is there's like this whole thing the curly girl method and [ __ ] like that so anyways i learned so much about hair in like half an hour it was amazing and i felt so relieved i was like ah this is like this class of life school i just missed and like i'm too embarrassed or too like kind of busy to like think about it but like taking the time thinking about it was awesome and so you know the little silk pillow and a couple other things were great little wins for me when when you go to restaurants what i do all the time is i just say they'll say what do you want and i'll say i just want meat and vegetables give me whatever's popular or whatever's best do you ever do that no but well i'll often ask what's best or i'll say the best question is uh you know what uh like what do you eat after work like what's the best thing that you like to eat dude it makes him so uncomfortable though i ask that all the whenever i order i almost always do that it makes them very uncomfortable and they freak out just like you did like when i get a haircut i'm like what do you want i'm like just make me look sexy you know just like make me look hot just like yeah whatever chef's choice is a hella underrated way to live life so is but it makes them so uncomfortable not you might be putting them on putting too much pressure on them i tell them i say look this is where i am it can't get worse than this don't worry i trust you and i tell every haircut i said don't worry what you do my hair grows fast i take a lot of pressure off them same thing with the food you know tell me what you eat after work uh by the way i'm not picky and i'm already in a good mood so i'm gonna love whatever you give me and then you know take the product that's that's a good one i'm gonna say that all right and then your last uh you're you're over 100 and under 100. the uh what's let's see over a hundred uh oh i hired a chef so i don't know why more people don't do this like dude that's such a conceited thing to say no no yeah cancel me and be like yeah because i can't afford it no what i mean is if you can buy a nice car or you know like i would never buy a nice car before a chef like my order of operations [ __ ] you drive a bmw [Music] no no no i don't even think that's the right comparison i think it's a lot of people who are middle class or upper middle class have a cleaner a chef is just slightly more expensive than that it's not crazy expensive that's pretty expensive to have somebody who who preps meals and i don't do it every day so you know you could do three days a week or you can do you know whatever um it is the biggest life quality change because you get your time back plus you eat healthier plus it's actually tasty because you probably aren't a great cook or i'm not at least plus like you know they prep little things for like my dog or my baby who's like a picky eater and like it just saves so much time energy and mental like kind of like uh mind space i guess to do this so for me i'm like i would cut 10 other things before this so like if you got some money right you can't do this you got no money but you got some money you got some money to play with like don't angel invest hire a chef you know don't don't buy like a go buy like a used kind of like middle road car don't buy like a nice car if you're buying a tesla get a chef that's why that's my like you know if you're in that game those are the kind of trade-offs you can make and above uh below a thousand uh oh jambis i think i've talked about this before oh my god i love these things you don't like it you don't like jammies like they're just boxers with pockets very soft boxers with pockets and no hole uh do you wear them do you wear them though day-to-day or only when you're at home well i'm at home every day what do you mean well let's bring it out you know if there's no if there's no hole and you put them on under jeans i don't know just a shitty version of this replacement for short so i like to just walk around my boxers all day that's like when i'm most comfortable so this is the socially acceptable more comfortable they're like a little longer so you're not showing too much thai there's no hole they got pockets so you can carry your phone around so it's like the best way to just wear your boxers at home like you're saying like your mother-in-law your mother-in-law mother-in-law's going to wear boxers around the house because if you just wear shorts they're just as comfortable and you'd look like sean's effects he's been talking about these things for like three years now i i've worn them they're very very comfortable i have a pair i like them but i wouldn't wear them like if they're people in my house i wouldn't wear lemon shorts instead that have like the underwear in the uh as the light they're still comfortable we're not all trillionaires so we can't all get lululemon we can get jammies right all right can i can i batch the next one again yeah all right so check this out so um we're giving that round to sam all right i'll take that uh thank you a thing you learned about yourself this year and best relationship hack i'll go first because mine are going to be really fast best relationship hack this year i do weekly meetings with my wife using this best self journal and it's just like a prompt it's an hour-long prompt of questions and you get to know each other better exactly what you've talked about with your buddy it's been awesome that's the best hack i've had and the one thing i learned this year i'll say two things one i don't ask you a question about the relationship one yeah are you both equally into it or is one of you like more into doing it than the other we're both equally into it okay i think that and so like i've always been a fan of therapy like i've gone to therapy like regardless if i'm healthy or unhealthy it's just like going to the gym and so i was like we should do couples counseling even though everything's great and but i didn't really judge we didn't jive with anyone and so i thought this one is actually better it works yeah and it's like 25 for one time and then so sean i mean i totally relate to what you said though like i'm projecting he's not into it and i tried to do this with my wife do like uh you almost want to do like a weekly board meeting like hey let's talk about our relationship my way well it's not run like a business meeting exactly but like it just has like like like you know like the five languages of love like that's like one that's like one conversation that's like you'll have that one week and then the next conversation will be uh uh tell me about your childhood right i think i think someone needs to build like an operating system kind of like how you would have board meetings and all this stuff for marriage eos right like what does our family stand for yeah exactly exactly that was a great idea yeah and then one thing i learned about myself which is i actually don't like owning as fancy stuff it kind of stresses me out so i like bought a fancy watch and i was like oh my god this is horrible it's freaking me out and but what i learned this year is i had a number of net worth in my head and i was like if i hit this number i'm never going to worry again and i'm not going to chase money i hit that number i still worry and i still chase it's never enough yeah and now now it's always 2x you know and there's a the new yorker didn't did a study where they like asked a bunch of wealthy people and like it doesn't matter if the person had uh 1 million 100 000 or 50 million they always said they'd be more comfortable if they had 2x yeah all right you want to go sean uh yeah okay so best relationship hack uh uh i literally just wrote this as soon as i read it i go shut the [ __ ] up uh i learned this year how to really just shut the [ __ ] up in a relationship meaning like not everything needs to be talked about not everything needs to be said not every like you know pot needs to be stirred not every issue needs to be discussed not every like worry needs to be a thing like just shut up and uh like just shut up and enjoy it just shut up and listen more um and just shut up and like don't complain don't don't talk about like constantly improving and changing it like just shut up a little bit and so that was my relationship backwards there's many times where you've got you probably know this because you know me pretty well sam i'm kind of a pot stir um and i like to like i don't feel alive till somebody's like you know laughing or angry or whatever in a conversation i'm like yeah now we're doing it that's true it's not how everybody is but your intentions are mostly always good which most your mo your intentions are mostly always good if it's if you just want to call [ __ ] it's just because you feel like laughing yeah i'm trying to amuse myself the difference is are your were your parents debaters and that was kind of how your sister because in my household my my dad's a potster so my dad would say some outlandish thing we start yelling and that was like almost his love language and my problem is i've applied that into all my relationships and most people find that horrible you just said it perfectly so that was the lesson that was my relationship this year was the lesson learned was was what if i didn't try that what if i did something different um the thing i learned about myself i'm gonna do one that's not um not good so you know there's a lot of lessons that were like ah yeah i learned this and now i'm better for it this is one that like i just learned was kind of like a shitty thing about me so i've now had several friends that um i've considered to be my close friends or like they worked for me or whatever like i've kind of mentored them in some way and then they go on to do like really great things but like you know they called everybody except for me to like kind of like share the wins that they were having or or let them on board or to invest in it or like you know just i wasn't in the loop beyond once our once our kind of relationship once are like once the transaction was done like once we stopped working together in my head i'm like oh yeah we're super tight and in their head they're like they had a different opinion because i had lunch with a buddy and i said he was telling me about like this crazy journey he's been on like dude can i ask you something kind of weird i was like i've noticed this happening a bunch of times like you had this crazy journey and i feel like i thought we were super close and we're just now talking about it like i wasn't i wasn't in the loop like you didn't let me know like you didn't share these awesome things that were happening or the crazy bad things and like you took other investors i feel like i could have been like your first check into your thing like i was like is there something i do that makes you feel that way and he's like yeah can i get can i guess what he said yeah go ahead i just thought that you were too busy yeah that but like uh a less generous version of that is you uh you blew me off basically it's like it's like yeah like i messaged you a bunch of times and like you didn't really respond in a big way so i just figured like okay he's like he said it perfectly he goes i he goes i felt like i figured out what i am to you and like i thought we were close and you thought we were saying you thought we were close but like you made me feel like we're not that close and like once our engagement was over you know it seemed like you put me in some place that like you know you didn't want to engage as much as i wanted to and i was like why would you talk about not me good old sean no way you know this is whatever and um and then sure enough i scrolled back in our dms and it's like him saying something him saying something him saying something me saying one line him saying something and like asking something and me never respond never getting back how do you come back combat that because like you've gotten very popular but it's not that it's like well this is this is the problem this is the problem is like so much of becoming friends with someone is where you're at in your life and how much time you have for the other person and whether you're in sync or not so some of my best friends they were you know we're both single we're both drinking and partying you're super super close and then you have kids and life's different and you kind of drift apart and the same thing can happen with texting if they're texting you all the time and they want you to engage and then you send a one-liner back they immediately take offense they don't realize that you've got 300 other people texting you and you just want to be friends with everybody and it's funny you mention this because i wrote my worst habit of the year is writing blunt one-line responses to dms and text messages because i'm busy right i'm just trying to rip through them all and i'm tired but it's way it's way better to not respond at least then you're mysterious and oh maybe you didn't see it the one liner pisses people off so much it's a little it's a little better it's shockingly better if it makes you feel better sean i perceive you as a person who's in the loop of everything though yeah i don't know i i basically i re i realized my self-perception of kind of where these relationships were at and how uh good of a friend i was being back i realized like oh no i'm actually i'm kind of a shitty friend back uh i i can make people feel bad when without really realizing it um and and also that that costs me like that i don't get to share in the wins and and know the stories and be kind of friends and and get these opportunities that like you know would otherwise have come from this and so that's once i have it like five times i'm like okay the problem is me i'm the common denominator here one of the habits that i've realized there's two things one one is like using a smiley when you say something takes the edge just immediately even if it's a one-liner takes the edge off the other thing is a friend of mine does this he's very very busy super spread thin big personality lots of friends and he will just every once in a while text me and say hey man i was just thinking of you uh or you know or you know let's say it's new years he'll say hey thanks for your friendship this year here's something i really appreciated or took from you and it comes across as very authentic and i've looked at that and gone okay i need to really learn how to do that because i'm like you exactly as you're saying this i'm just nodding along i think i come across as distant and cold and too busy and i don't want to and i just want to make everyone happy it's so sad you know bracket first name i was really thinking about you yeah that's what's going to come out from us this year yeah someone listened to andrew relationships and um learning about learnings yeah okay so um my biggest relationship hack honestly my wife her love language is acts of service and it's really interesting like often she'll start picking at me about some other thing i'm doing that pisses her off and will have a fight about something and it ultimately came down to the fact that i left towels on the floor or i left the kitchen dirty and so now i'm just trying to whenever i have that moment where i'm like i see the kitchen's dirty i'm just unloading the dishwasher and trying to enjoy it and get it done the other thing no no no no no i'm not a slob but i always say to her i'm like what's the point of making money if you use your time doing things you don't want to do right whereas my wife is much more like i don't want our kids to grow up without them seeing us work and you know doing stuff so so we don't really have any help around the house we have a nanny but um you know we have a cleaner who does all this stuff we don't want to do besides we still do all the shows we have it's all us no we don't we don't we don't have any of that we don't have we're not fancy like you um and then the school of life uh which they make that card game i mentioned before i love that so much that i bought this one called the connect card game and it's for couples and my wife and i have been doing it and it's basically five stacks and each stack is like you know one is sex one is like general relationship one is personal whatever and so you roll a dice and you go through these questions and again it's just this great way to penetrate through you know you might be in a bad spot but when you answer these questions it kind of unlocks everything and builds connection between the two of you and that's been really really good for us because my wife doesn't like doing the meetings or couples counseling even a lot of the time but that's been a great thing for us that's baller yeah ours are me and your we have the same thing dude i totally i really that's cool you said that about the um people thinking you're a dick or checked out because i i have that exact thing and you you said it really nicely uh yeah it's kind of it's hard it's hard and you know i've even experienced that with you and i've probably done it to you as well but it's like you know you and i we've texted and we've had these long exchanges and then there's other times where you text me and i'm like one line yeah or vice versa and it's it's i think it's one of those things where like i would i maybe i do take offense i don't know but like in my head it's like i'm so i have so much faith in the in the relationship that i'm like there's not like it's not gonna like affect my score you know in a way um yeah and also like i hate the kind of excuse if i'm busy because basically to me when the phrase i'm busy means i'm poor it's like if i think wealth is freedom of time and to be able to spend how you want then saying i don't have time means i'm poor and so i'm like i don't want to accept that that's also reality so you know i'm trying to figure it out well it's also there's two i've what i've noticed is when i don't work with somebody i text them differently when we do work together when we work together it's like there's total filter i'm not going to be nice i'm just gonna be super blunt and we're just gonna grind it out and that's just business and whatever and not i'm not being an [ __ ] i'm just being very to the point but i think that can come across the wrong way and i i think people sense a shift they start working with me and i suddenly become this like super blunt person like what happened all right so i was back okay so i got uh i got the categories here okay so let's keep rolling we have i think three big buckets left all right so we're gonna do these together so book of the year and or and then that's the first one and then the second one to do is you know a podcast newsletter or a person you started following you start subscribing to so a book and something you started subscribing to that you really loved let's do uh let's do andrew first okay so i read this really great book that sam i think you'd love called clash of the titans it's from the late 90s and it's two parallel stories one is ted turner and one is rupert murdoch right from the beginning and the stories are kind of interwoven and at various times they clash and uh you know try and buy the same businesses and stuff um but it's two different wacko billionaires so these guys are both insane in their own ways you know murdock is like quiet calculating 100 focused on profit uh but very slick and smooth ted turner's like insane unpredictable emotional all about building a brand name uh and making an impact but it's really about him reviews on amazon it yeah it's like totally weird i had to buy it in print although i found it on um audible but anyway it was a really really great read i didn't know that much about rupert murdoch before this and i gotta say he's obviously evil but uh really amazing um billionaire business person and that he's been going since 1957 and he's somehow only now this is a huge number he's only to us he's he's only worth 8 billion and you see these other people who are worth like 30 who have been going for like five years um so it's it's uh it's pretty wild but anyway great great book i met rupert murdoch once have you met him andrew yeah you told this story you went to some symposium or something to get because it was sharp right amazing basically what he does is they own all these properties they own like whatever wall street journal fox and like a whole bunch of other things i don't know what they own exactly but it's like a bunch of huge media publications and uh they're all these different businesses they're all spread around the world and he um he gets everybody together once a year and he rented out the top floor or top two floors of the wind in vegas and he puts all of the ceos of all the execs basically all the all of his different properties puts them all up it was during ces but they didn't attend ces they were not down at the conference floor shaking hands or anything like that they were in his room which is like the presidential suite or whatever and um they would just start at 8 a.m and they would go from 8 a.m to like 6 p.m or something like that and it would be back-to-back talks 30-minute talks they would just bring in some some somebody from some other field to give us to give a talk and they would grill them with questions and they'd be like thank you so much for coming next and it would be like um you know the number two guy at facebook would go yeah you went with like the skim this game was they then they have like three or four startups as well because it's like before before us or you know it was like ceo of slack stuart butterfield went and gave his talk and by the way talk is like you know there's 30 people in the room or something like that so it's not like a presentation it's like just someone kind of spitballing about what their what they do in their view of the world and um and then they get asked a bunch of questions and so this goes like eight or nine hours straight and if you look around the room because i i got there early and i just stayed we were talking at the end but i just sat in and sat in on the whole thing it was amazing and i looked around the room and people you know oh there's the president of fox and he's his attention's drifting and this person's you know they own the new york post and they're they're on their phone and rupert murdoch is like the star pupil he's front he's in the first row he's you know sitting in the first row he's doesn't look at his phone he's attentive the whole time he's taking notes he asked the best questions and he had the most energy like this guy went eight hours straight he was like 87 years old at the time he's 90 now i think and um he's the oldest guy from no bathroom breaks this guy i don't know what this guy's going to be since he's seen succession i've seen season one and it's so yeah loosely it's amazing kinda yeah and they like this old guy in succession he grinds man he's they're they're like working like 24 hours a day and it's always serious [ __ ] and very and is just like that and when i hear that i'm like this seems miserable how are they on all the time they have so much energy right well not only that but rupert murdoch he's brought all of his kids the reason succession is based on him is that he's brought all of his kids in to the business and then his kids have one by one failed to become the heir apparent and fought each other and they all hate each other and leak stuff to the press and it's it's really horrible i think rupert murdoch is a great uh he's a great way to invert you know what do we not want i don't want to become rupert murdoch because it doesn't seem like fun to me although maybe his personality uh maybe that works for him i really respect him uh okay so then you're uh you subscribed to andrew so uh podcast newsletter or whatever so uh yeah and there's not really i i kind of got off twitter although i've been kind of getting back into it a little bit um and i haven't subscribed to any newsletters at all this year i've just i od'ed last year the person i um i really have been enjoying their tweets is uh your friend nikita nikita buyer he had a really great tweet recently where so you know all these people they do aqua hires to facebook and facebook basically just buys companies to shut them down right they find promising social networks that might compete with them they go buy them for tens of millions of dollars before they turn into anything and they bought his company and it's kind of like a prison for entrepreneurs they make you sit around for three to five years and vest your stock and a lot of people hate it and he had this great tweet where he says oh i'm leaving uh facebook after three years here's a thread of everything i learned points down and there's just nothing there i thought that was awesome you know he was sitting on that one for four years as he vested out he's like here's how i'm gonna go out um okay great sam what you got book and podcast newsletter whatever book uh i'm gonna go with endurance story about a shipwreck and then i'll also go with empire the summer moon it's about the comanche indians they're just and and the texas rangers and how they fought and they're all just [ __ ] savages the rate dude endurance is so good and by the way when i said savages i mean the native americans and also the texas rangers they're all they treat each other horribly endurance is amazing it makes me feel like my life is meaningless and soft um and then things that i followed this year um okay the first laird hamilton i learned all about him this year that guy has the ideal life in my opinion he's surfer businessman pretty amazing cool dude the second is how to take over the world ben wilson's podcast one of the best things i've subscribed to and i'm gonna suck up even further sean the the five bullet for or the uh five tweets tuesday baby that's freaking awesome i like that too so those are the things i started following this year all right love it uh okay so mine uh book okay i just started reading this book so this is gonna sound a little silly because i'm 10 pages in do you read thank you do you read uh i i dabble i basically have like you know i'll buy 50 books in a year and i'll read you know 10 to 30 percent of 10 to 30 of them so it's like i read one book at the end of the year um so this one i've read 10 pages so far and in the first 10 pages this book has more wisdom than anything i've ever read and i'm not saying i read a bunch of wisdom so that's the caveat but uh is this book called think on these things it's by this philosopher guy named krishnamurti and um [Music] i don't know where i think of all maybe mentioned this guy's name as christopher murphy and i just went bought this book it sat on my couch for like you know a year i didn't look at it and then i just picked it up one day and 10 pages in i literally i've reread the first 10 pages three times and i like i just don't even want to go on i'm like oh this one principle these two principles that are in this first 10 pages are so good that if i internalize these you know my life changes and it's just amazing i just i'm looking at it now sounds awesome i just bought it yeah i mean i sold it pretty hard yeah all right so that's that's the first book uh second uh the thing i subscribe to this is kind of a again a little bit of an expected one but i listened to the all in podcast uh i don't know if you guys listen to sam i don't think you like it right or you don't listen i don't listen to any business podcasts andrew do you listen i feel like this might be up your alley yeah i find i i love i love all in but i found it was like um it's too stressful the time i listen to podcasts in the evening and the last thing i want to do is get pumped up on deals and what's going on in tech so yeah i listened to it and specifically i would actually say david friedberg on the podcast i actually find uh the rest of them to be very smart and very entertaining but very obnoxious to me personally um like you know like i'm sure these are they're obviously successful they're obviously you know probably you know fun to hang out with and things like that david's like the real nerd but he's the real nerd and he's the only one i feel like there's never is never presenting a face he's never virtue signaling or like building their brand by saying certain [ __ ] like i think chamoth is amazing but also i think he virtue signals a bunch um you know i think that uh you know jason kind of says he's a man of the people but uh like i think he's kind of likes being high class and likes hanging out with high-class people and doing high-class [ __ ] um but that's what that's what makes it good is they're all they're they're they're all like best friends but they're horrible to each other and they're all great and they're all they're all very they're very complicated personalities every single one of them and i think that's exactly it's like a great tv show where the characters have flaws um and uh yeah david sacks is super smart but then like super [ __ ] political and uh kind of like an extent and he's always just looking for some story that like supports his point of view uh and usually that point of view is that everybody else is biased but like you know clearly just constantly searching for information about how other people are biased um so anyways i think that there's i love the show i enjoy the show a lot and those characters but i think david friedberg is actually the one who uh is kind of like a star discovery for me this year of like super smart gives great information about science and stuff like that is very balanced and fair in his like pov um while still being saying interesting things and isn't i feel like he's not trying to build his personal brand and popularity through the through the show so um you know to the extent that everybody is when you create content like i think he does a good job of not um and one of the reasons by the way i criticize those other guys for doing that sometimes is i do it right you spot it because you got it it's like i sometimes will say something that like i know makes me look good or you know presents me and assert myself in a certain way so you know i see it when other people do it too um so anyways all in is you know maybe the thing i i enjoy the new thing a new show i've enjoyed subscribing to that's great all right do we want to what was the last one was okay i got i got two more so there's this is a quick one mfm guest of the year so who was the best guest that came on the pod and then your person of the year somebody you really enjoyed getting to know hanging out with working what about industry and company that's gonna be the last one all right i'll go first uh rob diernick and ariel helwani for guest of the year rob dierdick blew my mind ariel he was the biggest fan i'm the biggest fan that was a like i'm the biggest fan of his of all everyone we did and then what was the second question uh someone person of the year just your personal your sam's person of the year who dude i'm gonna suck up again i gotta say ben and sean i've been i'm like so we just crossed like two million uh listens per 30 days um i think we hit 2.1 or something like that um i'm very very this is the thing i'm most proud of that we've done and uh so i would say uh and and with ben i think we found the perfect third man so shout out to were you tearing up just a little bit there it seemed like you i've been very kind to sean and uh like all the people involved in this podcast where they're like why are you being so nice i'm just really proud of of what we've done it's something i've been very proud of dude when we went to miami for the live show so the other bend the bend works me my my partner he he came with and he's like i'm finally getting to meet sam i've heard him on the pod for hours and hours i've never met him and i was like yeah he's great and i was like you know but like hey if sam like gets like impatient with you or like anything like that don't take it personally like you know it's just kind of his style like you know when he we're doing a live show he's gonna want it to go well it might be high you know high pressure and i've seen him kind of like go off on people sometimes if like you know whatever and we get there and sam was zen sam he was so kind so thoughtful so nice so happy and ben was like what the [ __ ] were you talking about dude i was like i don't know where this came from this hundred percent happy sam but like this is amazing and i feel like the whole i don't know if it's the acquisition you know whatever the working out i don't know what you're doing but dude you've been so much happier this year it's amazing it's part acquisition and and we're getting the results we're finally getting we're finally becoming as popular as i thought we should you're you're not you're not um threatened anymore right like before if the hustle failed or anything went bad that directly hurts you and you're that you have safety right so you're not you're like a dog you're like a dog you have ample food now you don't need to it's just like it's it's been two years it hasn't been that long since we've been doing this maybe two and a half years i forget and it's finally like coming to fruition and it's the hardest thing growing the growing the hustle wasn't that hard growing this has been very hard dude i just want to say i'm so i'm so happy for you because i thought you're going to sell the hubspot and be out of there in like three months be bitter upset you sold your baby and it's so cool to see the podcast going so well the hustle going so well trends going so well all the people still there and you actually like the guy you sold to that's yeah i mean i think i undersold so i definitely have some regrets but i don't regret it at all and i'm i'm happy i i intend to do this podcast for a very long time investing is a hell of a drug wait did i go off script do you the thing you paid me to say earlier about it did i have to say about doormat all right andrew guest of the year and you're just your favorite person you got to hang out and interact with so my favorite guest was um steph smith is always amazing like i i tweeted this out but i think it's like she just drops thousand dollar bills on the ground for amazing entrepreneurs to pick up there's just so many great ideas uh and i think for you guys the best format is a shitload of quick hits and ideas and i think she always delivers on that i don't really always love it when you guys just interview someone about what they're doing the other one i loved was huberman for that exact same reason just like you know i got him on your thread right now you tweeted that you love him and i also like him and i just said hey andrew dm me come on the pot it was on your thread yeah no way oh that's amazing yeah he's he's amazing he's been my actually i should have said before he's probably my favorite podcast subscription i just love his stuff it's so in-depth um and then what was the other question person in your life your favorite person of the year non-family uh so i would say well i may have talked about him before but this guy kimia who uh we started a business with uh last year we started this negotiation business called fire with him and i just freaking so i'll just share basically what happened so basically he met this guy super scrappy entrepreneur told me he wanted to start something and he told me he loved negotiating randomly in like some conversation and so i started testing him i'd be like hey i'm going to you know i'm buying a nice car can you negotiate it for me or uh hey we're buying a bunch of desks for the office right and the guy would just save me like 40 on everything and hustle and he's awesome and so i was like okay dude this should be a business like negotiation as a service you need you know a lease negotiation sas software whatever so we start this business called buyer we go 50 50 on it i promote it and talk about it given the rails and accounting and stuff and we literally i think we started it for like 50 or 100 grand and we sold it to ramp about maybe six months ago now for single digit millions and so we went from like 50k to you know single-digit millions in a year amazing exit for him i would have loved to keep owning the business but this is what he wanted to do and it was just so cool watching somebody actually take the baton and then run the marriage uh and the guy's just freaking awesome you know i don't know i mean we were we were already profitable i think we could have made a couple hundred thousand dollars of profit in the first year um i told him i was like look like i think we should hold this but uh for him you know as a it was the first time he was ever going to have a good one like that and you can't undervalue uh he's he's working a ramp so yeah and you just can't undervalue you know getting a couple a couple million jeans right uh i think it's still i think that's a great i think that's a i think they've rolled it in someone should just copy that yeah yeah it says right here yeah they've like integrated it into ramp buyer.com or no buyer. someone should just do that again i thought that one had legs uh if anyone's listening and wants to restart that business with me because like i don't think ramp would care like we would even say like we won't do sas or something but just i want someone to negotiate a car or a lease or you know these big ticket things you're you're trying to mine okay so guest of the year i had uh uh hassan minhaj i thought he brought it and uh what i loved about it was i thought the episode was good but i love that he genuinely listens to the pod and uh like it was a conversation it wasn't an interview almost every guest is like they show up cold they usually have never they've heard about the show but they never listen to it or listen to one episode just to prep for it and um and the ones who do like dharmesh he listens to every episode when he came on guess what he's fire right steph listens to the episode so she knows the vibe this was the same now he's not like a business idea machine but um man the feedback i got from that episode of people just being like dude that conversation it literally felt like i was in the room i thought that was something cool that was something are you guys like homies now yeah we text all the time and isn't that funny what's the what's this story so he listened and then messaged you or how did you crazy connect the dot story actually so there's a another guy who's a comedy writer for a tv show his name is azar and he he writes the show remy on hulu um and so he listens to the show i don't know how he discovered it he listens and he was like dude this is great now his network is people in kind of like hollywood and like specifically maybe like brown hollywood and so he tipped a few people off to it and and i took like a random meeting with him you know i have this one block every week just for random spontaneous meetings with cool people that are like in my orbit and so i took this meeting with him we had great vibes we connected great and uh i think he then told hussein dude you got to listen to this show and so then he started listening from there and then he reached out he dm'd and was like my a couple of my twitter threads went viral like the clubhouse one and then this other one the metaverse one and after each one he would reach out and be like dude that was like that was so good and one time he just called me and at the other that was like dude he's like he's like we got to meet he's like i'm doing a show in san francisco let's come and i go great can you uh stay an extra day and let's record the pod oh you know really so that's what he that's what he did he's like yeah he's like as long as it's in person i'll do it i said great can you extend your trip one day and that's what he did he did eight shows over a weekend and he stayed an extra monday and then we recorded it god that's pretty badass isn't that awesome that's one of the greatest talks about this another example see this is this is why i don't understand why anyone does public speaking like you look you look at this and you're literally reaching millions of people and it's all these random people you'd never expect to meet yeah when's this crazy episode is over i'm gonna like click close and then i'm gonna go like feed my daughter lunch and like you know not have to be on a flight somewhere you know albuquerque to because i gave a talk well one of the one of the things i thought was weird so you talked about this on one of the episodes where you said you know you brainstormed with him business ideas or whatever why why would you if he doesn't like touring like you were like oh yeah you could tour make all this money but dude like i think that seems miserable flying from city to city to city staying in hotels i would say it's a it's a good and bad i talked to him about it he's like well obviously the feeling of like a live crowd is a thrill and exhilaration like musicians comedians athletes are really the only ones who get that like yeah insane love from thousands of people while you perform your best work like that's a pretty good feeling so that's addictive it is definitely cool when you're single too and the other upside is you make a [ __ ] ton of money off of it so touring is a great business model it's basically the music industry makes all its money off touring now live shows so touring is where you can make a substantial amount of money compared to online stuff the the bad the downside is he just had you know his second kid and you're out of the home for like a significant period of time and you know you bring on the road can get really tiring and your health blah blah blah well it's also linear you know you're limited to the number of people that can fit in this so i don't know if you did you hear the idea i gave them which was to create you know hamilton for brown people yeah the hamilton i thought i liked that that's great this is the winner all right let's do the last two right last two so the last two is company to watch and and or like a prediction yeah crazy prediction for 2022. so company to watch for 22 or crazy prediction and or no so then it's sorry you you're missing one so it's company to watch industry you got your eye on next year and then prediction yeah something like that yeah you can do those three all right let me go first prediction i think san francisco is going to be cool again by the way can i read out our predictions from last year yeah um because i think we got something wrong so our prediction for last year you said san francisco will bounce back continue to be the center of tech for decades i said that yeah you said that you go uh you said and then your second one was that pornhub and large companies will it'll be normal to pay pay subscriptions for porn uh okay i think san francisco went down the drain this year so far and uh i don't i don't know anybody paying for porn really except for i guess only fans uh you got that part right that's huge yeah only fans that's literally true you got that one um just not pouring up then san francisco's still gonna come back i still believe it andrew you said you said uh no one's gonna give a [ __ ] about covet in a year or it's gonna bounce back much faster than people think and they're gonna forget about it and i was like yeah me too i agree with you andrew that was mine as well i think you're wrong we were both that's i think it's true if you go to the states right now i mean no it's like everything's open nobody cares about it it's totally normal not this week the fact that we've done an entire episode we're living in a pandemic and nobody's mentioned anything about it in an hour and a half right and then what was the other one uh that was it so mine was mine was a cop so andrews i said my prediction all right company to watch this youtuber named meet kevin i've been watching this guy he has a 51 million portfolio and he reveals the whole thing and now his business is making 30 million dollars a year with four employees i think that sean said one day there's going to be a billionaire youtuber i think meet kevin is the guy who but potentially could do it and then industry that i got my eye on at home diagnostics i'm incredibly fascinated with at home diagnostics i've been i've tried all of them i think a lot of them are really cool and i think it's going to continue to boom and i think it should continue to boom because we need it okay great andrew what are yours uh company to watch um crazy prediction and what was the other one what uh industry to watch yeah industry so um company to watch i mean it's exciting to talk about all these new new businesses but what i'm actually interested in is all these companies that were incredibly hot like three or four years ago that raised a ton of money and and they've been kind of quietly building so for example superhuman uh you know everyone was talking about it two years ago i haven't heard anyone talking about it but i know they're doing very well i i can't wait to see what they do with all that money uh and then same thing with pitch pitch was like you know huge two years ago uh and i think they're in a building phase so i'm excited to see what they do when they come out of that uh pitch pitch.com it's basically replacing powerpoint it's like a good version it's awesome uh well you guys put down prediction or opinion oh oh this is prediction oh yeah here we go um i think that uh this high salary inflation is not here to stay i think what's happened is all these companies down in san francisco are going oh crazy we can hire cheap people in canada but they're not yet going oh hey we can hire people in india and the philippines and i one of the things i've realized is that people in india and the philippines are obviously just as smart but they're far more motivated and the cost is like a fifth or a sixth of what a north american employee is and they really want the job and they care so you can either give you know you can pay an entitled millennial 150 grand or you can pay someone 30 grand in india and they'll do a better job and the money means more to them um so i think over time i think uh this work will be democratized across the world and that salaries will come back i agree with you i just don't think it's gonna happen next year by the way i forgot one one category that's a great one which i mean overrated thing thing you are betting against that other people seem to be into do you guys have one there mine was the creator economy and nfc i had nfts in the creator economy and and and web3 image image and give us your quick why nfts why you're saying it's the one you think is overrated most overrated trend right now well i think um it's obviously the technology is fascinating right so that's amazing um but i think it's kind of like digital beanie babies that are easily replica replicatable at least a baby baby is kind of hard to replicate these are just like images that you can download that anyone can use and i think that over the long term they'll be really cool once there's a standard so if every metaverse or every app uses one api and everyone agrees that this is the way to access images or whatever and it's verifiable i think that'll be incredibly cool and powerful and i love the idea of like taylor swift saying like hey i'm selling you know my song rights to my my fans and whenever anyone transacts i get 10 10 or whatever that's amazing um but i just i just think right now it's all half baked and all the protocols are all made up and won't exist in five years and i think i'm going to win our bet okay remind reminders ten years right five years or ten years uh what was the exact bet yeah we we have a bet i believe you chose a piece of digital art and you said it would be worth more in the future and i said it'd be less yes um great yeah okay so i have uh all right company to watch uh i have a company called um uh terra which is terraform labs they've created something called luna so one of the biggest challenges in crypto is that people are like oh bitcoin it's cool but like it can't be used as a currency because it's too volatile and the solution that the cryptic community came up with was something called stable coins and so stable coins are super important they're you know billions and billions of dollars are transacted every day uh you know whatever i don't know about day maybe it's a month uh using stable coins with significant volume and there's a stable coin called luna that i think is um the stable coin is called us ust uh but luna is the the token that backs it and i think luna has been on this tear it started the year at you know maybe a dollar it's at currently you know 100 so it's about 100 x in a year uh it's been a great investment for me and i continue to believe that that it's gonna work interestingly it's actually being used in the real world which is one of the other criticisms of crypto so in korea in mongolia in a bunch of different places um people use uh this stablecoin without even knowing that they use it so they just use their mobile app to pay they don't realize it in the background it's being done on these uh crypto rails and so there's an app in korea called chai i think it is that has like a few million users payments app that uses um uses this stablecoin uh as the as the thing underneath it so it's it's the company to watch i think in the next year because if you can actually crack the stablecoin use case uh you know bitcoin cracked the store value use case became you know fifty thousand dollars a coin right now going up ethereum is the you know programmable network uh it's the compute layer it cracked that and uh you know four thousand dollars a token last year it was at like 200 so that's been an amazing investment and luna is the the number one contender right now i think for stable coins and so i'm keeping an eye on that okay and what are the others uh industry i got my eye on is actually vr so uh most people think vr is just dead or doesn't work but i don't know if you guys know this but oculus outsold xbox this year um so oculus sold 10 million units which is about 4 billion in revenue for facebook on just the hardware for getting the games in the app store that they have now xbox had some production shortages so probably would have been more but like just to round it up oculus did about 10 billion uh sorry 10 million units and playstation did 14 million so it's like it's not that far behind um do you do you remember when um oculus or sorry when xbox had that like weird little bar that you could put over your tv and you could like move your hands connect right that was a huge bestseller right but it was still gimmick like i bought one everyone thought it was cool and the exact same i remember i played it for like a day and then i was like whatever this isn't ready and i did the same thing i've bought an oculus every single year for the last three or four years and i every single time i feel sick and uncomfortable i feel wide awake every time i use it it's cool and then it's every time i use it every time i use it i say to myself it's not there yet but i i i buy it i buy into it i think apple i think apple's going to do a couple of signs i think apple is secretly the industry of vr there's a couple signs i think are really promising one is that over 60 games made over a million dollars on the platform which i think is pretty impressive and six games made over 10 million dollars so i think that's also pretty impressive uh growth there so i think vrs is something that most people are thinking is it's not happening and it's growing like rapidly so i thought that was pretty good and then um let's see what's it crazy predictions uh okay my craziest prediction is that the winklevi uh the winklevia end up richer than zuck so here's the case of how the wink of us get their revenge in the end oh my god they own about one percent of all bitcoin in circulation they also own gemini in exchange that's probably valued at somewhere between 20 and 30 billion dollars they own one percent of bitcoin they want one percent of all the bitcoin they also own a substantial amount of eth they haven't announced how much and uh if crypto actually like has its like you know its heyday and bitcoin goes up to so here's the here's what you need to believe i don't think there's a 2022 bet at all this is more of like a five-year bet but if you think that facebook is peaked and facebook you know um doesn't grow or even maybe drops you know 15-20 percent uh in value and um because they're priced at a very as a growth stock and uh if you think that bitcoin gets to 500k eth gets to 50k gemini ends up going public they will actually be worth more than zuck who's worth 130 billion dollars today and i think that that is just a crazy you know the sequel to the social network movie is that these guys actually end up uh you know wealthier than zuck in the end um so that's my crazy prediction should be hilarious all right that's good and then oh my my overrated trend by the way like my overrated trend is spax so uh you know in the last 10 years but 10 years before you know the spec trend there was like i don't know i think it was like 40 billion 45 billion of spax total in like 10 years then last year there was 80 billion so doubled it doubled and this year there was 160 billions i doubled again and if you just look at spack performance like um just if you just take chamath specs chamatu i think you know really started this trend year to date i think his average is he's down 30 year to date and did he make money off that yes he made a ton of money yeah that's people guaranteed money this is why it's messed up they all you make you make the money in the matter you know heads i win tales you lose uh setup uh i don't really like it and that's what happened here is that the sponsor the promoter makes money either way and uh you know his stocks are down his his stacks are all down 30 and the the overall s p500 is up up 30 so you know it's a massive you know massive delta there um so i think that's you know i think spax are the overrated uh trend or the thing to uh the bandwagon i don't want to be on uh if you're not the promoter i don't think it's a great place to be right now how does that make you feel andrew as a specker well i'm not a spacker i don't wait ecommerce wasn't a spec no no no bloomberg misreported us as a spec we we did something called a reverse takeover which is kind of like a spec but instead of having a spack where the sponsor gets 20 they're getting like point zero one percent of your business there's just these little shell companies so no we're a promoter not on a typical spec uh it's like a hundred million dollars right 20 20 of whatever they raise so i don't know 20 of the the future company so if you have a billion dollar company you're literally saying i'll give you 200 million dollars to take me public and the math on it is it with a spec you can show projections which is really really valuable for a growth company and it's a little more flexible and the timing is a little shorter you get to show your fancy projections yeah whatever you think the future looks like and you i think you only have to buy in for two or three percent but you get 20 so that's your spread as the promoter you pay two percent of the price and you get twenty percent i don't know about house packs exactly but it's something like that all right this is a good episode i think ben what do we think well uh this it was a a long one but i think it's gonna end up being a hit was last year's a hit yeah last year was a hit yeah i wasn't here for last year but um i thought this was really great what was that you mentioned this really cool podcast sam what was that one called again how to take over the world baby how to take over the world if anything it's the best intro music i've ever heard yeah there you go um no it was a great episode um my first time attending it but andrew brought the fire and uh the predictions were like a little a little predictable i will say that um but other than but the recommendations the companies the products were all good [Music] you

it created these dopamine rushes where like it sucked it sucked it sucked and then like one of our articles got like a million views and i got so pumped [Music] all right sean's not here so ben and i are doing this ben producer ben what's up what's up how you doing sam um so this episode is kind of special because i've got people who ask us questions um okay should we uh should we uh do some of these okay uh i'll read them okay and all as you're answering them i'll go pick up some of the new ones in case anyone has responded with more stuff on twitter um so first one is pretty open pretty generic what do you want to learn more about in 2022 um [Music] in 2022 i want to learn more about how to get popular on youtube that's what i'm going to do and in 2022 i'm going to take more adventures i'm going to do more trips so that's what i'm gonna figure out do you have an answer uh i do but i actually just wanted to follow up on the youtube thing um you are a self-professed wannabe fitness influencer is like that a part of it are you also trying to learn instagram like where's your head out with the i want to vlog i want to keep a diary of my life i think it'd be fun to look back in 50 years and say yeah like you could see there's a period of my life that's all in video and i could watch it and see how i behaved i think that'd be really exciting so that's why i want to do it that's interesting let's uh oh yeah go ahead what's yours uh i was just gonna say like i'm pretty much laser focused on my podcast right now i'm growing it but the other thing that i'm like super interested in and i think is gonna be a big space for the crypto type people uh going forward is this idea of like startup cities autonomous cities um like kind of building a new way of living from the ground up and people are doing interesting stuff there with um there's something called prospero that you've talked about that peter thiel is trying to build down somewhere in central america there's praxis i've talked to those guys a little bit there's some interesting things going on and i i would like to learn more about that and see what's happening in that scene what are some business related uh or what's an idea and trend that you think is over hyped um i'll go first i think it's um well how about this i'm actually going to say what i think is under hyped because that's also part of the question you know what i think is under hyped recycling i think it's i think current ways of recycling are over hyped so did you know that the most most of the you know how like you have a blue bin at your home yeah that's [ __ ] it all gets thrown away and burned they don't almost all of it like the vast majority like 90 of that gets burned and they don't use it the only reason we do that is because it makes us feel good and so we're okay buying more [ __ ] um and that was and i believe that this whole recycling thing was it was made popular by a lot of plastic like big plastic the plastic lobbies um and that's [ __ ] so i think recycling is over hyped i think making it actually work is under hyped i'm very very uh bullish on that and it's something that i think about all the time um i think that's a good one uh i actually did it i used to work in consulting in the previous life and uh i i worked on a big project with a waste services provider one of the big ones uh here in the u.s and i can tell you that you are absolutely correct about what you am i yes how much of it is just thrown away here's the thing the big way services providers um and there are two here in the us they try they try to recycle yeah the thing is you actually have to be like really good with your recycling of like you have to wash out your milk carton you know you have to like take out all of the styrofoam that is even if there's little pieces like but then you need like five different bins you need like a plastic one plastic two classic three glass a glass b now in some areas they will sort it for you right but anyway it's extremely costly um it's not energy efficient so it like costs a lot of energy to recycle this stuff so it's like is it worth it from a carbon standpoint anyway and then most of it it's just not worth it because people aren't that good about sorting out their stuff and throwing it away the right way so anyway you're right about that but i do think there is an interesting space for people who do recycle like if people are willing to confront the fact that it doesn't work then hey can we do some recycling stuff that does work like can we recycle in a different way i think it's interesting space i always say i always say it should be reduce reuse that's just end it there don't say reduce recycle just reduce reuse yeah i think it's like i think it's tragic that i order something from amazon and i get all that packaging it it hurts me i'm like i'm why why is it hurts me just because this is inefficient but it's like i just took this from the environment when i didn't need to yeah yeah absolutely um the one i'll say that i think is over hyped is i don't think it's overhyped but i do think that you know the hype cycle where it goes way up and then you have the trough of disillusionment and then it comes kind of back up i think we're right at like the top of the initial hype cycle for crypto we're gonna hit like a big uh like disillusionment period where a lot of people are gonna leave the space and then it will find its footing and find some legitimate uses a few years from now but i think um that the the current fervor cannot continue forever i think i agree i agree uh let's answer all right so your your 20 million by 30 goal what was the process to come to that number so this person basically when i was like 21 or 19 i forget i set a goal where i wanted to have 20 million dollars liquid by age 30. and the reason why i created that goal was i basically asked a bunch of rich people how much they spend each month and it ranged from like ten thousand to a hundred thousand a month but this one guy whose life i really liked i think he said he said sixty thousand dollars and then a lot of like i went through a lot of monte carlo simulations and what it shows is if you spend only three percent of your net worth per year you will never run out of money and your principal will continue to grow so 60 000 times 12 is 720 000 and then um three percent of 20 million is around that so 3 times 20 million is 600 000 so it's a little bit less and so i thought um 20 million was a nice number because it was close to that 60 000 a month number and a lot of people think you could spend 3.5 so that's the number changed a little bit because a lot of people say it's 3.5 some people say four i budgeted for three and i don't spend anywhere near that i think i spend like eighteen thousand dollars a month do you worry at all about sort of these black swan scenarios of like inflation's bad right now at fifteen percent what if it goes like really out of control do you prepare it all for catastrophic scenarios like that no uh like the vast majority of my net worth is in large publicly traded companies and real estate um no if i'm bullish on america therefore i don't plan on its demise uh all right do you have another one you want to do or you want me to go you can go all right um how about this one i was just about yeah that's what i was gonna ask too okay what what are you most proud of when it comes to my first million uh uh to this day when people say they listen to it i'm like really why so i'm i'm shocked that anyone even listens to it whenever i get i get recognized on the street weekly and that is the most proud so i was going to bring this up but we talked about ross albright and he said i wanna i want someone to bring up silk road to me and i want them to not know that it was me i've heard people talk about it or reference it and they didn't know i was there or i say who i am i'll say i'm sam and they don't know anything but then i'll say like um oh my last name is par and they go oh wait you're from the podcast i love it so that is what i'm most proud is when strangers or people i don't know say that they listen i'm most proud of that can i tell a story that i was gonna tell the top of the show and i forgot it relates to what you just said um so i i told you like a little bit about this but we did an ama together about podcasting i was talking about how to take over the world and a little bit about my first million you were mostly talking about my first million so we're talking with a group of a number of people on trends about podcasting and just at the beginning um the the host the the moderator asked everyone to type in where they were from and one person said alexandria virginia which is where i live so i just sent him a quick dm and i said hey you're also in alexandria you subscribe to trends you're probably my kind of person let's go get lunch sometime this person said uh this person's we'll call him john not going to share his identity publicly john says yeah sounds great i'll dm you on twitter let's go get lunch sometime the next day i'm flying to where i am now utah which is where my in-laws live and we get on the plane and i'm there with my wife and with my daughter who's one and so we had a aisle and a middle seat and so this guy gets on he has the window or no no we had a middle and a window yeah we had a middle and a window and this guy had the aisle so i say to the guy hey would you mind taking the window seat so that we're not always crawling over you to to go use the aisle to walk my daughter around and the guy says sure no problem a super nice about it so we all sit down and he turns to me and goes i'm sorry are you ben wilson and i immediately felt cool first time anyone's ever said that to me and i said yeah and he said i'm john like i'm the guy that you messaged yesterday on that ama and we were sitting next to each other in the same row on this airplane so anyways it was my first time being recognized and just like one of the most insane coincidences i've ever had what did he say he said he's a huge fan we talked to just about like what he's got going on he had a bunch of questions about the podcast about what i'm doing but he's he's an issue he's a really cool guy it's really interesting when you when that happens because you you're like wait you're smarter than me you listen to our podcast what the [ __ ] why it is wild yeah let's let's wrap up with number six and seven how's that yeah sounds good what's the most fun you've ever had in your professional career and why i don't know what's yours i've got two answers one is one time i worked for a startup that did like event uh management technology like they did sort of the software backbone for ces if you know what that is but so i would just go around i was single time it would go around to a bunch of different like major conferences and events and that was just like really fun from a fun standpoint of just like being in different cities all over the world and um just like being on vacation all the time while i was working i really like that that's good mine was when i first started the hustle and i was the only employee blogging and trying to game reddit and get all this traffic was the most fun i had because i it created these dopamine rushes where like it sucked it sucked it sucked and then like one of our articles got like a million views and i got so pumped and so that was the most fun where i was like just writing every single day in order to get views i think that was the most fun uh okay should we go with uh finish up with number seven yeah so your cursor's over so you gotta read it oh sorry name a couple of celebrities or high-profile business people you'd feel genuinely nervous about meeting i was uh when i met tim ferriss i was a little nervous but i'm not nervous anymore i would say um when we had andrew huberman and ariel helwani on the podcast those two folks i was more nervous to talk to than anyone else uh i will i would absolutely say with ariel you definitely were for like days and weeks in advance i didn't notice so much with andrew but i definitely believe you um yeah and i don't know i i haven't met as many rich and famous powerful people as you so i you know my list is long like a lot of people all of them that's my answer no we haven't we've had like some famous people reach out and say they like so like uh when sean sean's now buddies with hassan uh i like that wasn't that was no big deal for me like some or like we've had a handful of like famous people reach out and say they listen like really famous like tier one actor famous and i found that to be incredibly underwhelming um when i met lance armstrong so basically um i grew up cycling and i'm a massive lance armstrong fan and one day i get this uh email and it's a picture of our office in austin and we had like a sign on the window and it said hey that's so cool i didn't realize you guys were in austin and the gmail sender said lance armstrong and he signed it just like l and i hit reply and i go i don't believe your lance armstrong here's my phone number call me to prove it and i get a call and he goes hey man what's going on it's lance and it was lance armstrong and i was like what like in my mind of like the top 10 famous people i could meet he was like in the top three i was a huge lance fan i still am and he goes what's up dude i was like nothing you like i was so shocked and eventually we just talk on the phone and he goes you want to come over i go yeah i would like to come over he goes cool come over for breakfast next week so i fly down there and hang out with them and now we're friendly and we've hung out and gone to dinner a couple times and i still am nervous around them that's super wild it was it's a crazy crate that was the craziest like celebrity style moment um were you nervous to meet rob a deer deck at all no not at all that's interesting because dude i didn't even want to do that podcast i was like why are we gonna talk to rob like he's just a skateboarder like he doesn't do anything interesting and then on the podcast he totally blew my mind but at first i said why are we talking to rob dierdick like he doesn't do any interesting business stuff yeah all right something interesting happened recently so there's this guy named ross albright am i saying that right you think i think so it could be ulbricht but i think it's albert albrecht well ross we're going to call him ross mostly he not allegedly but this is the fact there's a lot of alleged going on here but this is the fact that i'm gonna say he started this thing called silk road and about eight years ago i believe three thousand days ago and i'll say three thousand days for a certain reason three thousand days ago he was arrested and sent to prison for life and basically silk road got famous because they had something like if you do like today's dollar it basically made bitcoin popular because it was like ebay for drugs and something like 10 billion dollars went through it in only two years and he since he started it and he was allegedly uh hired a bunch of murder for hires and for the creating the silk road and for the murder for hires he was sentenced to life in prison and he tweeted out the other day uh basically this really cool status and whether you think he's a murderer well he didn't actually murder anyone but whether you think he tried to kill people or not and he's a bad guy or not it's incredibly interesting content of him tweeting about being in prison and he somehow has access to twitter and he is able to talk about it and then he has a medium like a blog where he blogs about death and prison and it's incredibly fascinating so because he just tweeted this on december 17th he tweeted today is my 3000th day in prison at this point i feel numb to it i've forgotten what freedom feels like but when i let myself feel like i am today i just feel pain and a deep longing to be part of the world again so like this like super deep stuff today what i wanted to do was with ben tell the story of ross explain why this story is incredibly interesting and almost like what we can learn from business and leadership about it and we're going to try and like make an argument like we'll try to dissect the arguments of is he guilty or is he not guilty and i want to preface this podcast that's with a few things the first finding unbiased information on this topic has been incredibly hard it's been incredibly hard because the people who don't who are on ross's side are like these bitcoin bros who love bitcoin and they're incredibly passionate about it and then of course there's his family uh who isn't who says he didn't do what he's accused of and finding information has been hard and also the third maybe biggest reason is there was a ton of corruption in this case where a lot of police officers or a lot of detectives were arrested because there was so much corruption in this case so i want to say that like we're using research that is likely biased and i think i'm biased about the situation i had a strong opinion about it so i'll try i think what we should try to do is say what's fact and what's not although that would be hard i think it's a little i don't know where you kind of came out on it for me it was like really easy to put myself in ross's shoes so i found myself naturally drifting towards opinions that exonerated him and i had to kind of check myself because i want him to be innocent if that makes sense 100 and that's what i have at the bottom of this of our show is for us to talk about like what our opinion is and one of my points is it's easy for guys like you and i you know uh uh white dudes who uh have are good intentioned and who have access to the internet and like imagine ourselves because that's what this guy ross which we could talk about he looked like he was like a tall good-looking guy and it's easy for us to imagine that we're just like him but like when i when i lived in san francisco there was these uh guatemalans on the corner and they would sell heroin to people on the street and i was so angry at them i'm like man these guys should be arrested what the hell and i caught myself thinking like well ross said do it i'm like no no that's [ __ ] racism like you gotta like it's gotta be the same either way you could just because he's like this like intern just because he's doing it on the internet you know what i mean so anyway uh we'll talk about that so let's start start with the background do you want to go first ben sure so uh he starts in your old stomping grounds uh he starts in austin uh he was kind of a science guy uh in college he studied um i wanna say it was something like neuroscience or something like that but was more of a sciency guy before he decides that he wants to go uh down more of the business road um and so has this kind of flash of an idea uh and he he kept a diary which turned out to be not a great idea for him uh if you keep a diary keep the bad stuff out uh keep yourself covered but he wrote down basically everything in his diary uh he wrote quote uh the idea was to create a website where people could buy anything anonymously with no trail whatsoever that could lead back to them uh he'd been studying the technology for a while but needed a business model and strategy so he kind of goes into his bunker uh i read like a thing from his girlfriend at the time that said he became increasingly withdrawn and was just like in his room 24 7 programming coming up with the business model come up with this whole thing for what would become silk road and silk road is this essentially a marketplace where you could buy or sell anything initially they do end up putting some restrictions on it like no child porn uh you had other stuff written there what else could you not do on silk road no fake degrees and no counterfeit goods but there's times where that those rules kind of got blurred because someone was like should we have cyanide pretty much the only reason people use cyanide for is for killing themselves or killing other people should we allow that and they ended up allowing it so there was a little bit of gray area of what they allowed and what they didn't allow and before he started the silk road he had an online business called good wagon where he sold books and it didn't go so hot like at the peak it made in revenue was like 10 grand in one month and so his profit was very little and at the at the beginning of 2011 in that same diary he wrote uh well basically he he he basically ex admits everything so about starting it so he goes in 2011 i am creating a year of prosperity and power beyond what i have ever experienced before silk road is going to become a phenomenon phenomenon i can never say that word and at least one person will tell me about it unknowingly or unknowing that i am its creator and so he talks about that and even in his linkedin his linkedin says that uh what did it say where'd it go oh sorry on his linkedin he wrote i want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of corey i can't ever say that word either what's wrong with me use echo how many read this for me ben uh use economic theory as a mean to abolish the use of corrosion i can't even coercion on his linkedin page ross wrote that he wanted to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind so he's basically like acknowledging all this and so uh what he does is he learns how to program i believe he just used uh like the most basic coding languages ever and builds this website on this thing called tor tor is basically uh it's it's basically a different version of chrome so it's a web browser it was developed in the early 2000s by the us navy because they wanted a way for officials who are in north korea or in china to be able to use the internet and not be tracked and so they created this browser and so i remember when i was a little younger when silk road was around i downloaded tor and i went to the silk roads website and you had to like type in this like we all these weird numbers in order to find it and it popped up and it was amazing like it was like i couldn't believe that this was a thing and 99 of well i don't know if it's 99 but most people who used it were using it to buy weed essentially so like there was all this stuff around the edges but the research that they have done shows that people were generally going to it to buy small amounts of weed not like big drug dealers but just kind of people like sam who were like oh cool you can buy anything on here i will buy weed i never bought anything on there just for the record we did an article um uh we did an article about this and and i had friends that bought ritalin from it and they were like kind of squares they were like not people they i didn't know that they were like they don't put in your head they're not like a drug user or you know but they bought ritalin and adderall on the silk road and i used to go to it i never bought anything from it but i would go to it just like i can't believe this is a thing and right when it launched he basically grew some in the book the american kingpin he they said that he grew mushrooms and put it on the website in order to get the initial sales and then he uh somehow gawker found it like just a few months after starting it create created an article about it on gawker.com which at the time was one of the most popular sites on the web and that's kind of when it blew up and he uh you know you mentioned his kind of early comment uh about like manifesting the growth of this thing uh he also comes up around this time with his moniker so uh the system admin who we now know to be ross wrote who is silk road i am silk road the market the person the enterprise everything i need a name and uh then he said my new name is dread pirate roberts which do you know where dread pirate roberts comes from a little bit but tell me it's from the princess bride so it's uh the the kind of the main character wesley uh goes and gets kidnapped by the dread pirate roberts and then later it turns out he is the dread pirate roberts and that dread pirate roberts is actually like more of a position and so once one pirate dies someone else becomes dread pirate roberts and that name's important because that's like the whole crux of the case which is are there many people doing this or just one right so in the name is seated this idea that there could be many people who are dread pirate roberts it like kind of um hints at that having said that there is i don't know if you want to go through it but there's like pretty compelling evidence that he was at least the main person who was dread pirate roberts let's let's do that but just not yet let's first get i want to set the background for finish up we'll wrap up with what silk road was and like ross's background so around this time this was in february of 2012 so we're about uh i think a year after launch he starts blogging on the silk road and you can go and read some of his writing his writing is very good he's a very his character this character of ross and this character of dread uh pirate roberts it's very romantic and it creates like a cult of personality and he writes things about how we need to stop funding the state with our tax dollars and direct our productive energies into the black market and he says money is powerful and it's going to take power to affect the changes i want to see and it's all about how like people need to have their own rights to decide what they want to do with their bodies things like this like very traditional libertarian things traditional uh what's it called the austrian school of economics it's like a way of thinking it's very libertarian um and he even writes we what we are doing will have rippling effects for generations to come like he uses these words that are like he sounds like a a dictator or and you want to get behind him uh and he sounds like he's furthering this like romantic and admirable cause and in some ways i'm i'm on board with that because i am on board bitcoin um but the idea of like you know we don't want to be controlled by a central bank things like that i'm on board with it and he does a really good job of using that language it's amazing too to go back and look at it with the amount of value that was flowing through uh silk road at the time because bitcoin hadn't had its moment yet the way it has now and so you can go back and look at the amount that flowed into dread pirate roberts's wallet and if you just held it it's now worth like five billion dollars or more or more yeah yeah uh so uh yeah so it's all it's it's booming as you said gawker picks it up uh there's a lot of money flowing through it um and after only two years of doing this he gets arrested and the way that he gets arrested is is pretty amazing so uh basically in like 2010 he writes into a forum uh stackover stack overflow a popular development form forum uh developer form and he goes how do i connect to a tor hidden service uh using the curl and php and then he lists his website as ross albright at gmail and so he's like he posts that which that in itself isn't interesting but what they noticed is that immediately after posting that he changes his username from his name ross albright to frosty and the reason that's also interesting is the very time the very first time anyone used the word or reference the silk road it was for a username in a forum called the shumery.org and frosty that username he writes something like hey has anyone seen this cool new thing uh called silk road where you can buy and sell anything anonymously so he posts that and then in another thread uh using frosty that same username he posts something saying like i'm working on this uh site that helps people sell and buy anything i need help dm me if interested you know he says something like that and so that's actually how they like catch them and they notice that this guy ross previously he had gotten in a little bit of trouble because homeland security opened a package a few months prior and they found like 20 different fake ids all with his picture and different addresses on there and they went to his home and they busted him and he said he bought him like as a gag and so he actually got away with it he didn't get in trouble but they go huh this is kind of interesting this guy has a little bit of a background and they uh end up like stalking all of his social profiles and they notice that he's talking a lot of libertarian stuff on his linkedin he says uh what he does and what i said earlier about uh a very libertarian vibe he watches a ton of libertarian and bitcoin related videos on youtube and comments on them and that's basically how they catch him and so what they do is they find out that he lives in glen park and i have a story about that because glen park is where i lived he lived right down the street from me when he was arrested they found out that he goes lives in glen park and the police stake out his house and what they're able to do um is they're able to track him because throughout this process which i'm going to talk about an undercover agent an agent went undercover and befriended him and basically became an employee of silk road additionally they had arrested other employees of the silk road and i'm going to tell you how in a minute and they were having conversations with ross because of that the whole time and what they noticed when they were tracking him in glen park they noticed that when dpr is saying he's going to get off the computer so when and he tells his employees like hey guys i'm done for the day and closes the computer they notice that ross goes out for a walk and so they're just able to catch like okay whenever dpr logs off ross is out walking around and so what they do is they go to the library uh because ross goes to library works out of life the library this library was basically like eight houses up from my house and he goes to the library and he logs onto his computer and what the investigators do is they have two of their guys go behind him ross is sitting at a table with his computer open working on the silk road they have two uh investigators go behind him and kind of act like two homeless people getting in a fight and ross turns his back to his computer to see what's going on and someone swoops in and grabs the laptop from out of him and then another person tackles him and they rush the laptop down to the uh van waiting outside and they take screenshots of it and then they down the the data and he was logged into the silk road admin account and everything that they ever want is there and they could easily see uh how much bitcoin he had they could see everything and at the time he had 144 000 uh bitcoin which at its peak 60k it's like 8.5 billion dollars that he had um and so they caught all of this and they logged on to the computer they find his diary where he's like logging all this interesting stuff going on he's got like a an escape plan about what he's going to do if he gets caught i mean it's just all there yeah and it wasn't just so they have this physical tail on him and they're able to like using this kind of shoe leather approach connect him to drip height roberts but they also had did you read how many federal agents they had infiltrating silk road no you want to guess i don't know 50. that's really close so 60. there's 60 federal agents who were on there doing like fake sales or fake buys and bus and a lot of them weren't even talking to each other right right and and a couple of them and this will come into it later uh were like pocketing money were were essentially like when they were busting people they were just like well no one really understands bitcoin so if it just ends up in my wallet it's fine and one of them ends up going to prison for that so we'll let's let's talk about that in two seconds so but first ross is arrested for doing that and everyone's shocked and i'm gonna i'll tell a story about that in two seconds but everyone's shocked and eventually after a very short amount of time he goes on trial and he gets locked up and he they find him guilty and the judge sentences him to like two life terms plus 40 years and so the verdict and then they they appeal it and they go to the supreme court and they just say nope we're all we're holding this up so at this point very very very very likely he is in there forever and nothing will ever happen and now like this is where a lot of the drama begins and the reason why a lot of the drama begins is because there's a lot of debate over whether there was multiple people as uh dread pirate roberts and the debate is if there is multiple people did he commit the hits so throughout this process there was four or five different times where someone emailed him like an employee and tried to blackmail him saying things like or they would steal money from him or they would say i'm gonna reveal your identity if you don't give me blank and so ross hired someone or dread pirate roberts hired someone to go and kill these four or five people but the person he hired was an fbi agent and they went to the people's house and they knocked on the door and they go [ __ ] we know you're up to no good we're supposed to kill you you better cooperate with us and they take fake pictures of them killing these people and in exchange the people spill the beans on everything they know and that's how they get access to be able to track him so well um yeah so to be clear he was never convicted of this in fact he was never even charged with uh putting out these hits um and that's because they probably didn't they didn't have very solid case uh it was gonna be very difficult to prove that he was actually the one that did it but it really seems like the reason they wanted to put him away for so long was because they were pretty sure that he did it they just couldn't prove it the judge says basically i need to make an example out of you she goes we need to put an example to anyone who creates the silk road too this is what's gonna happen and the prosecution actually told the judge we want 20 years and she goes no no no we're doing life and they gave him life which is wild and they never actually pursued the murder charges because or the uh murder for hire charges but she does say in her reasoning for the sentencing that she takes that into account and she assumes that he does it which i don't know like anything i don't know much about the law i don't know if that's considered kosher or not but that's what happened it's it seems legally suspect to me that something that you were not convicted of could count towards your sentencing yeah i don't know i i i do think so okay do we want to jump into some of the implications of this and some of our conclusions so one thing i will say that scares me a little bit is essentially he's being put away for life for something that they couldn't prove he did like well that what i believe the charge was a bunch of drug charges but then there's this if i'm not mistaken there's this thing called the kingpin the kingpin act something like that where basically um in the uh 40s and 50s they were trying to arrest these guys like al capone and they're like [ __ ] all we can get them for is like tax evasion but we know they murdered people and so they created this act that basically says that they can put these guys behind prison for a long time even if they they don't know that they did it but they know that they were involved in so many things correct and so i guess how you feel about that is going to determine a lot about how you feel about this that crimes that they can't get them for they just like you said they kind of add up these tax evasion charges until they say all right well we we couldn't get you for murder but you're gonna be life behind bars anyways for tax evasion it's it's pretty wild um and let me tell you a quick story and then we're gonna go into like let's let's have an argument about why we think he's not the one and why we do think he is the one and i will try hard to do both but so i've told this story to you ben a couple times i've sold on the podcast but since we're talking about it already i'll bring it up so around 2012 i went to a party in san francisco and i was single at the time and i saw this girl and i was flirting with this girl and this very charismatic tall guy comes in and kind of steals the girl from me and i wasn't like mad you know we were just flirting but i was in awe of him like i was charmed by his energy he was like nice enough and he was good-looking and confident and he stole her and i like looked up who this guy was after the party and i was like oh his name's ross oldbrick and i looked him up on linkedin and i wouldn't we weren't friends but we had that one running and he lived on someone told me he lived on the street from me in glen park and if you're in san francisco glen park is a neighborhood that's a little bit more family oriented and so if you're young pretty much no other young people live out there and i was one of the young guys and so i heard he lived there i was like oh that's cool i gotta hold this guy one day well i i see that there was a big commotion at the library in glen park i lived down the street from the library and i would hang out there and i look online and it's this guy i knew ross had been arrested and it was four starting silk road and i was in awe i'm like oh my god and so we went online i and went and found all the pictures we had together at that party and we i took screenshots of all of them and then we had to delete all of them because you know everyone was nervous we're like so after this party when you look him up like what did what did people think what was the public face of what he was doing like what did you think he did who did you think he had so i think his linkedin like the description said what it said up there i think it also said that he was a currency trader or some type of like currency uh i don't know anything about that world of finance but it made it it was interesting bitcoin wasn't that popular at the time and in fact the day after i told my friend billy i go billy my uh this dude i know was arrested for silk road your dad likes bitcoin right billy his dad was tim draper who eventually goes on to buy the bitcoin he i think he was a billionaire already but he bought the bitcoin that ross was uh arrested with because they the government auctioned it off and that bitcoin is like worth like five billion dollars and he bought it from the government for like 20 million or something like that and i go billy this is crazy and he goes yeah my dad's and at the time he didn't know that his dad was gonna buy it but he was like yeah my dad like loves bitcoin he thinks it's like the future and i was like all right that sounds cool i don't know anything about it but if this is just too good to be true like i gotta like you're telling me you think it's gonna be popular and the guy got arrested i'm just gonna buy some and that's how i bought it and i and i bought bitcoin for my family that year for christmas so if you were attaching a percentage chance to it what do you think the chances are that he was the one who put out the hits for higher 70 so you think he probably did but you're not totally sure so yeah let's get into it so there's the problem with this case is that there's a large amount of information out there that's really good for both sides and it's really hard to know who to trust and so i don't know like what's not debated is that he started it the point is like when did he give it up and so let me explain to you why i think it's suspect so he had this friend named richard richard bates and rich he tried to recruit richard to come work at the silk road when he first started it and richard's like no i'm not into that man that's illegal eventually ross wrote to him and said all right i sold the site but in the diary he wrote i've been lying to my friends and telling them i sold it so that has happened a bunch of different times and it's hard and what we forgot to mention was throughout this case there's like three or four different fbi agents or like dea agents who are convicted and go to prison because they started talking with ross and getting into bitcoin and they eventually like started feeding him information about what the feds were doing and they started stealing bitcoin and they were locked up and sent to prison for this and so there's a massive amount of corruption going on here but you could say and his parents say because there was so much corruption we can't trust the entire case i actually think there can be corruption and it can also be true for example o.j simpson mark furman i think planted that glove um so you know the the if it don't fit you must have quit they were they found this glove and o.j simpson's thing and but they're like why is this glove here and like i think mark furman planted it because he was racist but also oj killed that lady right you know what i mean i think a conspiracy can exist and also the guy's guilty yeah i i think so one of the big points of debate is did anyone else have access to judge pirate roberts it seems clear that other people at least at times a few other admins did have access but there probably weren't multiple dprs if that makes sense like he was dread pirate roberts but maybe some other people have limited access for a short amount of time the other like question is did once the fbi and the dea had access to his laptop and had access to dread pirate roberts could they go back and edit messages in order to make them support their case essentially and he argued that they did and there are some people who were involved with silk road who basically say yeah i went back and looked at my messages after the fbi had access to ross's laptop and like my old messages are totally whack i didn't say any of that stuff now they might have reason to say that stuff anyway but that that is an argument yes but there's things like that which make me question it and then there's things like this so listen to this this is a post that ross wrote there's been more than one occasion where i've wanted to quit without getting into details the stress of being dpr is sometimes overwhelming what keeps me going is the understanding that what we are doing here is more is more than uh more than my more important than just my insignificant little life i believe what we are doing will have rippling effects throughout many generations there's gonna be a shift in how human beings organize and relate to another one one another i have gone through the meant to listen to this i've gone through the mental exercise of spending a lifetime in prison and dying for this cause i've let the fear pass to me with and with clarity commit myself fully to the mission and values outlined in the silk road charter so he writes things like that and i think so are you just you're lying to all of us well in a little bit it's like if you believed in something that strongly and what he's saying is like this glorious revolution then would you would you be willing to kill for something that's that important definitely yeah i mean it sounds like the kind of rhetoric that maybe maybe so let's talk about uh some more evidence that shows that he uh that he didn't do this so there's no doubt he admitted that there's this great website called free ross and i'm not saying i actually agree with it but it's called free ross and then they have a post called like the true story and they someone on the on his team wrote all the this really long blog post and it has all evidence citing everything that they said um and basically in that ross has admitted he goes yeah i started it but i handed it over uh someone a hacker came to me and he said um like i figured out how your site works i'm gonna get into it because of this error you made uh otherwise you should just sell it to me and so he does or that's what they say the story is and he sells it to the guy who started mount gox do you know what his name is uh i'm looking i'm trying to look it up right now so he sells this to the guy basically mount gox in 2012 was in 2011 2010 was coinbase but back then um eventually this guy though gets locked up and goes to prison uh because mount gotts gets gets hacked and he kind of knew about it and so he's kind of a [ __ ] crook i mean this guy's a crook hardcore but what the police say and the feds say they say that silk road was registered on a domain service owned by this guy and that most of transactions that were working with silk road went through mount gox and it made sense for the mount gox ceo to want to own silk road because it increased the price of bitcoin and made them more valuable and so that's a huge accusation here mark curples is yes is the name so that's what a lot of people so a lot of people think well he actually wasn't it and then they go well why did why was ross on on silk road when he got arrested they say because this guy hired ross as a freelancer after he sold it for help and multiple people had access to it and so they say yeah he was helping him run silk road when he got arrested but he's not the guy who ordered the murder for hire or did a lot of the other stuff yeah i read i met a guy the other day who lost 20 million dollars in the mount gox hack sheesh and that guy the mount cox guy he's a french guy he spent time in prison for doing a bunch of bad stuff in japan so i think that guy's sleazy um it is sort of a just so story though that like oh yeah i was totally out of it but i was doing this one last freelancing gig you guys happened to catch me at the exact moment when i just happened to log in for one last time just to help this guy out it is uh it does stretch credulity a little bit it does uh but there's so many things in the story and we're only touching about a little bit of it there's a book called american pink kingpin there's so much stuff in this story though that is like it's hard to believe is true but it is in fact true like basically when ross started this in 2010-11 he was like a happy-go-lucky-ish like uh oh you know i'm down on my luck i'm gonna try this and then within 18 months you see his tone changed to like being this like domineering we're gonna take over the world and further this cause type of guy and this is just like i mean this is it's a movie just how this guy could do it and he had the good looks and the charisma so it's hard to know what to believe because there's a lot of unbelievable stuff that's true yeah exactly and also add to the fact that by virtue of what he's trying to do most of it is secretive by design so it is like hard to unravel and unpack what is true what is not because it's intentionally obscure and um and so i don't and then add that it is just so weird though to me that like multiple federal agents multiple multiple federal agents on this case get arrested and do in due time do hard time for corruption and one extortion one guy who did it i think his name is carl force i think he got sentenced to 76 months so like what's that like six years uh he basically you can go and read his chats and i think that he like fell in love with ross and this idea like uh like fell in love with the idea of like this this mission and he would he would say like dude you're gonna get arrested i'm gonna get fired from this i'm gonna go to jail for this i think that like he at first he wanted to make money but because this is such a romantic like idea of overthrowing the government and like the little guys are winning and we're doing this all and we're the downtrodden they all bonded together and it was when i was reading this i was like i wish i was part of this and so i understand it so this guy knob he that was his username carl force's username on silk road he just did it for fun and just to learn and then he realized like he got into it so i think it was a combination of greed so he eventually stole from people of greed but also i think that they just got caught up in the intoxication of all this because when you're doing something like this it feels like there's no consequences when you're building something online it's like well this is just fake like there's no consequences yeah so let's talk about how big this was so uh the silk road even though it had a massive impact on bitcoin and society and things like that it was only around i think for two years and so and let me see if i have some stats so between there was a period between uh may and july where 1.2 million messages were sent on the platform um when he was arrested he had 144 000 bitcoin which at its peak is like 8.5 billion dollars and keep in mind he was only it's like ebay you only take like a 10 feet so that's like not including the that's not the transactional volume so in 2013 uh they say that it was doing more than seven million in income so dpr the that was his his his annual revenue or his and so there's with these businesses there's gross merchandise revenue like or total transaction volume which is like if your ebates how much uh goods are going through but then there's like how much the actual company makes because they only take a 10 fee and his 10 fee added up at the time he was making seven million dollars in bitcoin and if you uh if you bring that out to today's prices that means he was making around five billion dollars a year already in year two and there's a bunch of interesting things about this the first is that he was doing all remotely without knowing the identity of his co-workers so he eventually hires like freelancers but they and he like makes him do certain things like um send them his their id and stuff like that and but he had like a team and he didn't know at all who they were and it was all done remotely that's incredibly interesting they built something that big that fast that that way and second um uh he didn't know how to code he was learning to code as he was going yeah that is that is kind of mind-blowing it is interesting that he was able to do it with this remote team that he'd never met but like half of them ended up trying to extort him right yes yeah so maybe a cautionary tale there in terms of who you work with but like oh well sure but it was a productive working relationship other than that huge thing so if it's like a thing where there's like where it's like well no like we're we're selling um like bottles of soda like i can call the police on you like it's not like i'm afraid to call the police on you about this thing totally um the numbers by the way uh so in terms of this is like dea estimates so they say 1.2 billion dollars worth of illegal drug trans transactions took place is that at the time of bitcoin's price in 2013 yes not current day price that is at the time price so then i i think bitcoin when he was arrested was worth around 80 or 90 and at its peak it was 60 000 so so what's that you multiply it by 6 000. yeah it's a lot of money a lot a lot of money uh in in today's value um so 1.2 billion dollars uh 46 million of that is marijuana 17.4 is cocaine 8.9 is heroin uh then how much 1.2 billion in in then time uh money total moved oh my gosh i can't even my calculator i'm like struggling to even it's hard to even read those numbers it's basically like 780 billion dollars so it's crazy right it's crazy like the the how big this is i would love to see some numbers i don't know if you have i don't have them of like of um what percentage of bitcoin transactions back then and even up till now took place on silk road it's crazy so the reason why they suspected it was mount gox was when they started it accounted for like 75 of mount gox's uh business um so let's talk about why this story is so fascinating so the first reason is like there's just like a lot of like drug sex and rock and roll like this is like we're we're into that no problem admitting it the second reason is that for a lot of like white nerdy tech internet guys of which both of us are that this guy ross is incredibly relatable we look at them and we're like oh i could see myself doing that maybe not going that far but like i i in in some regard i would say we're envious of him we're like oh man he had the courage to like do this epic thing because it doesn't seem like there's any bad consequences to what he was doing even though it's not realistic but that's how it feels and it's also like it tugs on your heart strings a little bit of to look at a guy who you're like yeah he's kind of like me and he's never gonna breathe a free breath again for the rest of his life like it's just hard to digest that that like because let's take for granted that he did call in these hits right like it feels like someone who just really got caught up and got really carried away and i know like we both had to check ourselves like that's not really an excuse that's not fair that's incredibly unfair it's incredibly unfair to people other people who do get put away for these kinds of things but it is like easy to to relate to and to excuse if you're someone like us who has an easy time putting yourself in issues another reason why this story is incredibly interesting and it's this is the part that hurts which is that it feels like ross's life is like a wasted life so this guy was like kind of i wouldn't say he was a genius but he created something amazing and it only lasted two years and now he's in prison forever and it's just like a total waste that's why i feel angry about this i'm like man this guy was so smart he had it going for him what the [ __ ] man now he can't do anything yeah and also i feel like his life is a little bit of a waste and silk road is a little bit of a waste like you know obviously some really terrible stuff happened on it i think and i don't know how much i agree with like hardcore heroine and stuff movie but like at the same time i don't know if you're if you are someone who has a little bit of a libertarian streak you're kind of like well shouldn't there be room for something where people can like do stuff outside of the all-seeing eye of of the government you know so i went through this same battle as well i consider myself to be aligned with a lot of libertarian stuff and i realized i'm not a true libertarian because i don't want drugs to be legal and if i don't want them to be legal in real life like i lived in san francisco and i would see these guys shooting heroin all the time i found a dead body at my office once did i ever tell you that no so uh i was at my office uh i got in early at like 8 30 and there's often times people sleeping at our door and i would nudge them with my foot i'd be like hey can you you got to move please i got my employees are coming you can't lay in our doorway and i did that and the person was i did this time the person was dead uh from drugs and we would see [ __ ] like that all the time i lived in soma and i would see the drug dealers they were allowed to be there i knew who they were i could tell you who they were i know i knew that a little bit of the background i would like hear him talking and i was so angry at them i was like these guys are the worst for our society they're only hurting people this is not good and i think so that's when i changed i was like i don't want heroin to be legal i don't want this to be legal this is not good and i was so mad at these guys and then i found myself romanticizing ross so much and i had to check myself and say this is wrong it's wrong on both sides if i don't like these these uh these uh gangbangers selling this [ __ ] i can't also think that ross is innocent or should shouldn't suffer yeah absolutely i get what you're saying i mean i'm not a true libertarian either but i don't know i it's just like i can't even think of a specific use case for it but just the idea of there should be a place that isn't owned does that make sense appeals yeah yeah yeah i agree that's why that's another reason why we like him so much is because we like his intentions were interesting yes so you did your research for a little while what is your opinion on if he's guilty or not well on a bunch of different stuff there's actually a lot that i want your opinion on okay um so we we you you believe that he started it obviously he admitted that do you think that he was uh running it the entire time yes so then that means do you think that he ordered those hits i do i maintain that there is a possibility that um that no that at least the chat logs were massaged in order to make it look more open and shut man i like i think that a person would do that the problem that i have with a lot of conspiracies is when many people are involved in something keeping a secret is impossible keeping a secret is very very very hard if there's three or four people involved particularly government official government officials it seems like keeping that type of secret is so freaking hard so if that did happen there had to be more people involved and did did there though i mean i guess would one person risk their career just multiple people did that's the thing you know they did it they did to make money yes most of them yes what do you have to gain by changing this just a guy goes to jail i don't care about him a person that much well you got to realize though that for some of these prosecutors and for some of these ea agents like this is a career-making thing like i'm the guy who busted ross albright and sent him to jail drug kingpin billions of dollars worth of transactions like you're you're kind of made right after that right so yes i do think they had something to gain from it it is a little conspiratorial i don't know i don't know that i would assign a more than 50 chance that that actually happened but i think i like to maintain like a 30 to 40 chance that maybe something like that could have happened do you think that he deserves life in jail no well ye if it um i don't know i guess yeah if he did try to call hits on people multiple times then yes someone who does that does deserve to does deserve life in jail yeah i guess so the reason why i'm a little suspect if at first i thought that's fair but then i realized no one died no one actually died and for murder a lot of murder for hires um particularly if if no one dies they don't get life because you know they get 20 years and so it is crazy that he got life and there's also a lot of cases i listen to a ton of crime stuff where people actually kill someone and they don't get life and they are can get out after 25 years and so you have to ask and i've spent time in prisons working with a lot of people i've met uh inmates who killed their mom or killed their killed someone in their family killed their wife and they get out after 20 years because they've proven that they're rehabilitated and when they did it they were like young-ish and they're like we think you could deserve a second chance did you read the chat logs at all well there so that's another thing about this case is there's like so many chat logs like there's like thousands and thousands of pages so which ones i've been talking about specifically the ones where um he supposedly orders the the murder for hire yeah he was pretty callous about it yes but uh the other side who i believe did turn out to be a federal agent is that correct yeah he's like kind of drawing him into it a little bit like a little bit yeah of like man this is such a problem i wish there was a way for it to not be a problem you know and is like definitely trying to move him in that direction i think ross says like let's just beat him up and the guy replies with i don't know if that was gonna do i don't know if that's gonna solve this yes which is like pretty shady especially if you think that's a federal agent like man why are you trying to bait this kid into ordering a hit so my opinion is i think that there's so the thing about like trials though like you have to you have to paint a picture of a shadow of a doubt i have a shadow of a doubt but i think that it's likely that it was him i do think that he deserves time in prison 10 to 20 years just for the drug charges and for creating silk road um but i think it's kind of [ __ ] that the judge sentenced him for the murder for hire or took that into account without actually trying him for it so i think that's a little nonsense so i my opinion is yeah he's totally guilty it's just like how much stuff is he guilty of and in my opinion it's enough to get 10 to 20. um but if they wanted to do life they really should have they had to charge him with murder for hire and prove that it was it happened yeah do you think so it's uh like early 2012 it's like right in the middle of silk road going gangbusters do you think that there is any and there are 60 dea agents infiltrating it they're on his case they're uh like monitoring his house do you think there's anything that he could have done to have either like gone legit somehow and like turned it into a marketplace for things that were maybe questionable but not totally illegal or is there a way he could have just remained undetected and and outsmarted the feds i think there's a world where he could have gotten away with it if he bailed i think he could have bailed and gotten away man like there's a lot of examples like whitey bulger you know whitey bulger yeah he was um basically the character that uh robert de niro is it rapper de niro in the departed jack nicholas jack nicholson which one yeah yeah that's right he was a gangster in boston he got enough loot he got like the equivalent of like 15 million dollars and he goes i'm out and he left boston and he moved to santa monica and he lived there relatively peacefully for like 30 years and then he was arrested when he was like 90. and i think there's a world where like ross could have done something like that where he could live um for a little while maybe the rest of his life undetected if he just stayed uh with a low profile but i think a guy like him and myself included i'd rather probably die than like shut up forever yeah is there a way he do you think he could have like kept it running from some small island in the caribbean or off the coast of africa or something like that well aren't there still sites like this are there i don't think i'm pretty sure there's nothing at that scale i don't know i haven't actually researched it but uh for for the hustle we had a guy talk about using medicinal lsd to help him with his depression and we did an article where he just showed how he buys it online and i actually saw him buy it uh and it was on a a competitor well i think a lot of this is changing just in that the the drug war the idea of a drug war has taken a hit and so a lot of people are less gung-ho about enforcing this kind of stuff and so there are a lot of places now where you can you i don't lsd that probably does have to be pretty black market but there's some like gray market stuff where you can buy shrooms and other kind of lighter psychedelics yeah for sure and it might be illegal i mean you could take ketamine and you can go to a doctor and get ketamine in um new york and a few other states i believe so um yeah it's an interesting story another interesting thing is that his girlfriend she still lives in in austin so she's a major part of the book that i took a lot of information call from called american kingpin she i think her name is vivian and you could follow her on instagram she's like this beautiful black lady uh she kind of looks like my wife to be honest and you could like follow her on instagram and uh it's really cool because if you read the book or learn about him um you you can go and use web archive and see pictures on instagram and on facebook and things like that that like it's what the author's describing and so you can like kind of track this journey you're like oh man here he is see they're under the golden gate bridge they took that picture like there she is and you could still follow her i think she just got engaged i follow her on instagram before anyone thinks that sam's just being conceited because you literally did just say she's super hot she looks like my wife uh the first time i saw that picture of of her with ross i i did go is that sarah like she does look a lot like your wife yes yeah she does uh i actually don't know what race this lady is but she's definitely uh i bet she's mixed half white half black that's what my my wife is and it does look like you're from afar and it's cool you could see all these pictures of them together it what a crazy story so i don't know where do we go from here uh don't do drugs don't sell drugs uh that's our official advice don't start a marketplace where people can buy and sell drugs yeah it's a it's a fascinating story um the book american kingpin have you read that no i haven't read it um it's the greatest book i've ever read it's it's the number one best book i've ever read it like i was so impacted by it like it's it's a story that sucks you in i couldn't set it down it's amazing um it's so good so read that and uh that's that i wonder if people are gonna like these the style of episode i i think they will i think it's kind of cool uh turns out yeah that was great all right is that the pod i think that's the pod [Music] you

i wanted to bring this up there's we had talked about this in the past but this is a uh story about miss excel so her name she calls herself miss excel and i don't know if you've ever seen her i don't think you're a big tick tock guy but i am i had seen this person going viral on tick tock and basically it's a woman who puts out like microsoft excel tips and tricks like little hacks like oh you know how your um things are always like poorly formatted just put pushed like you know command g when you're hovering over the column and look it auto formats everything perfectly or like do you know what a vlookup is you do this this and this and boom you can find anything so she basically puts out these little clips on tick tock but it's not just the content like the way she does it it's like what works on tick tock it's like cute cute girls dancing humor like these are the things that like work on tick tock and so she does that she's like she'll put a song like that's like a trending song on tick tock um she'll dress up she'll be she'll have the screen screen share behind her and she's kind of overlaid on top of it and then she's showing something funny that's like something that's happening she's explaining it quickly and in an entertaining way so she's uh she's here's her story she's a consultant um kind of a boring job she was a consultant and she decided you know there's a lot of consultants and bankers that if you watch the music sell they won't touch a mouse like they just used a keyboard like a wizard and like they could just do everything just by hitting like shortcuts and macros on their on the keyboard in excel there's actually a lot of people that could do this who who used to work at bcg basically they had a mouse with like a wired mouse that was clearly cut the cord was cut and they like it was like in a frame on the wall and they're like that's what you're gonna do here the mouse that's what this needs to look like you don't use the mouse exactly uh and i don't know how any of this works but uh i've definitely seen a bunch of friends who can do this they it's kind of amazing when they're doing it so she basically took that idea and started turning into interesting clips so she starts off and she tells the story where she's like you know um i wanted to like try making some content and uh you know tick-tock i felt embarrassed because like isn't tick-tock like for kids and like it's just like the silly thing to do i shouldn't i shouldn't make a take out account i'm a consultant and then her gut was like you should do a tick-tock and so she listens to her gut she makes a tick-tock and pretty quickly i think within the first week or so she goes viral with one or two clips and she gets over like a hundred thousand views and she's like holy [ __ ] this is awesome and so she does it again and she does it again and then she starts to she's like buys a little ring light and gets a green screen so that it looks a little bit better and she does it again she gets a video that gets a million views and it's like wow this is amazing and so she starts branding herself amazing branding by the way miss excel like she is the one she is the excel woman and um and so i thought that was great and so she starts doing this and she's getting popular but she's not making any money and uh she reaches or who what happened morning brew reaches out they're gonna do a feature story on her and they're like oh we want to feature you and at the same time a business coach reached out to her and was like hey i saw you have this like really great following i think your your content is super unique um you know and she was like yeah it's great i'm gonna be featured on morning brew they're like awesome like what do you have to sell she's like i don't sell anything it's all free content and they're like if you're gonna get featured you should have something to sell and she's like okay challenge accepted you're right i'm gonna make a course and so she decides to make a course she's never done it before and i think she had like something like two weeks or something to like pull this whole thing off and she rushes to do it now let's fast forward to today she is making courses and she is making um six figures a month off this thing so she's making single-digit millions a year she has a few days of the year where she's made six feet over a hundred thousand dollars on a day in course sales that's kind of like her black friday um or black friday special or whatever where she where she sold her course and so she's doing millions of dollars a year and she's working towards million a million dollar month that's like her goal i want to hit a million dollars a month as miss excel and she is like microsoft loves her they're like pumping her up um you know she's featured in business insider she's featured in like buzzfeed she's featured in a whole bunch of places because this great story she's featured on this podcast right now and so she is doing amazing what i love about this is she quits her job as a consultant she now works 15 hours a week unless she's making a course like but just like a normal thing she's she's doing 50 hours a week she has one employee which is an overseas virtual assistant her cost structure is that overseas virtual assistant which i'm guessing is making something like six to ten dollars an hour so you know probably paying them like five hundred dollars a month ballpark plus uh she pays 97 dollars for thinkific which is the course platform and she pays a video editor to um to edit the videos for the course so like all in all her expenses are probably like sub fifteen hundred dollars maybe some two thousand dollars at the time and um she's making six figures a month so she's profiting um you know at least a hundred thousand dollars a month uh doing this thing and um there was a whole bunch of like different little nuggets in there that i liked but that's the the overall story quick quick reaction to that amazing i don't think it's gonna maybe it will last maybe that was that was my initial instinct i was like awesome run but like you know who knows if this is here two years from now and then i changed my mind when i kind of read her read a little bit more about her here's what i liked okay so we had talked about excel way back maybe a year ago when i when we were talking about i was going to create a course and we had done a deep dive of what are the best courses it's always excel microsoft excel is always on the top if you go to teachables top courses udemy's top courses learning to master excel is always in the top like 10 earning courses and you think it's hard to be the one but it's a topic people will pay for anker from teachable he's got a he's a good twitter follow he uh tweets out some of the biggest earners he won't explicitly say who they are but he'll say one earner we just paid their you know they just crossed 20 million in in revenue or in like earnings and then he'll also say like the top course is this excel thing so you can kind of like triangulate exactly and and on udemy i think i was able to do this as well i was able to search and sort for the top best-selling courses and excel was in the top as well that's amazing and um so i think excel has real demand then the question is who's gonna be the best brand in the excel space and she's the horse i would pick so um why do i think that first is her content is fundamentally better she took the most um she has the best top of funnel so what's her top of funnel strategy it's highly exciting quick hitting snack sized tick tock videos tick tock itself is like the crack cocaine of content right like 10 seconds video with music overlaid that is crack cocaine for content and she's using that for excel when all the other excel creators are like bloggers and [ __ ] like that there's like a stale old thing then her brand and her personality miss excel good looking woman who understands how to do content and um and she i know she understands the content she says she's a little bit when i was researching her she is really into some of the [ __ ] i'm into that's really like kind of like off the beaten path so she was like yeah she's like most people when they think of content strategy like especially for for this space b2b type of content she's like it's always like strategic intellectual trying to figure it out she goes i spend most of my time just getting into a certain state of mind i just she's like i just get into a she she goes this is her exact quote she goes the way i run my structure for my business is through energetics most people don't even know what the [ __ ] that means she goes i get my energy to a place where my presence is truly magnetic i get a vision of what's going to go viral then i run to my computer and i create that and sure enough it goes viral she goes because most content people people don't understand content is just energy transmission yeah i'm having a great time i'm excited about this topic and so i'm gonna push that through the phone into you and sure enough you're gonna learn something but you're also gonna smile while you're watching my [ __ ] you're also gonna laugh while you're watching my thing and nobody else is doing that and i've read that and i go she gets it she gets like one of the most important things about business and life which is it's like being able to manage your own energy but the second part is she gets the content strategy in a way that i don't think anybody else is gonna really get in this in this space the second thing is go ahead go ahead she now has scales so at first i was like okay but she's just like an individual creator on tiktok and like who knows maybe take talk algorithm changes no so here's what she's doing she basically is like i'm gonna scale in two ways first she's expanding into the whole microsoft suite so it's not just excel she's doing powerpoint and word and outlook and like everything that like you know a billion people on earth have to use professionally and so and microsoft is helping her and every time they're releasing a new thing she's getting first look at it and she gets to come out right away with the content that's going to highlight this new function or this new feature that you get to be able to use so that expansion gives it more legs than just excel the second thing is she now hired a performance marketing agency and she's like yeah get my brand to grow and she's like the beautiful thing is i don't sell my course i just put my most viral thing and i put ad spend behind it and people love it like they love that content and so they like it they comment on it so facebook's algorithm promotes it and so i was like oh that's kind of an unstoppable like flywheel she's going to keep creating this like juicy like quick life hack type content then she's promoting it uh that's already inherently viral then she's putting a paid ad spent behind it she's growing her following on instagram now plus tic toc plus youtube plus all these different places um and she's like oh yeah reels came out so then i just like jumped on reels and i became like one of the most viral reels creators on instagram and um so i'm like okay now she's diversifying the audience and she's got the courses behind it and she's going into more more parts of the suite i like that formula i was wrong she's gonna she's gonna crush it i think she's gonna get to my bold prediction she's gonna get to a hundred million dollars in sales and that sounds outrageous i would like to say 100 million i think she could i think you could do i think 100 million a year or lifetime a year uh yeah i actually agree with you i think that's bold i think likely she'll get to like 25 million dollars a year in revenue and could probably actually do that for many years right uh yeah i think it's crazy um so i loved i loved her thing there was also these other little nuggets so she basically she's working 15 hours a week so then she's like oh cool quit my job i'm going to be a digital nomad something you kind of did this last year she's like every month me and my boyfriend we just moved to a different state we just want to experience it so they'll just move to a different state in america and just like hang out there for the month and they hop around and uh the other thing that she's the other nuggets i liked was she does these like webinars because she understands there's like a top of funnel so top of funnel if you don't know is basically like how you get new customers to even like get in touch with you get in get into your cases it's just going viral on tick tock going viral on tick tock or instagram or youtube great then she has the middle of funnel which is where a lot of people fall out which is okay you've touched base with me once you're not ready to buy something just yet but how do i actually get you to participate in a deeper way to invest in a deeper way and for her she runs these webinars and she calls them high energy excel parties and so she she invites people to these and what happens is it's of course it's like someone from bcg and then they go and they're like oh this is amazing then they're like hey we'd like to buy like 1500 seats for our for your course for our company you know like or hey i work for target uh corporate training and uh yeah we have 25 000 employees that we think would be benefit from this how do could you create something custom for us and it's gonna be like yeah here's the same thing but now i say the word target at the beginning and i charge you you know five million dollars for

this other thing i think is really interesting so the adventure book let me tell you about this story have you heard do you know what this is this product the adventure book i have no idea what it is ben have you ever heard of this thing okay all right so you guys are also not on tick tock enough this is like the number one ad on tick tock that i see uh i don't know if i'm just in their market or they just run a [ __ ] ton of ads but i've been seeing it for like a year so basically it's a it's kind of it's a book you buy it's like a high quality big book and what it is is like there's a bunch of imagine like a scratch off like a lottery so there's a bunch of things you can a bunch of adventures that you could scratch off so you open the book to a random adventure you scratch it off and it reveals a thing you're gonna go do like it might be um like i don't know i've never bought the book so like you know bad example but like you know you're gonna go into a store today and you give out ten compliments to people in the store or uh you're gonna go streaking around your neighborhood or whatever like an adventure a thing you can go do and um so this idea and and and they pair with it like a camera so you you're supposed to take a polaroid of you doing it so it becomes a scrapbook so on one side it triggers you to go do something that you've never done or that's like you know get you out of your comfort zone uh and then it gives you the ability to capture it and paste you glue the photo in and it becomes this memory book of all your adventures like cool kind of novel idea so i had seen this and i was like ah that's a cute idea that's a novel idea what i didn't realize is this a hundred million dollar business that was created in the last like two years so how do i know this you know like for the podcast i don't know if you get these emails but i definitely do um there's a bunch of people that have like booking agents and we get all these emails which is like hey sean love my first million um have you thought about having you know joe joe on and you're like you know it's like oh first they're complimenting me so i like open it and i'm like it's like i don't want to be a member of any club that will have me you know so it's like that's how i feel about the guest thing so normally i write all these off but this one caught my eye which was they said would you like to have brian ellis on he is a high school dropout now owns a hundred million dollar business called the adventure challenge and i was like it's like that that adventure book thing and it and so i replied i go 100 million dollars no way that sounds high and she goes yeah like it's been incredible they've grown blah blah blah and i said 100 i'm just like clarify i'm like 100 million cumulative revenue annual revenue what are you saying here and uh and so she goes yeah like they'll do 85 million in revenue this year and they have a few big bigger partnerships that distribution partnerships that will get them over 100 um like in the next year and you know so the business is valued over 100 million dollars with 85 million in revenue and i was like what the [ __ ] and so i go and i start researching this and so here's the story so this guy bryant he's um so i couldn't confirm the high school dropout part i don't know if that was just like some post-fact [ __ ] like like to make this sound better but like let's assume it's true so uh high school dropout i think his job was he had some job which was like he was a skyscraper inspector so he's like you know some low man on the totem pole doing a job he didn't love and he's like all right i'm just doing this for the money he wanted to make a business like he just he's like my whole life i just always been i always have ideas and and uh you know i wanted to come create a product it's like so i'm doing this job and i had this idea to do um to do this like adventure box so his original idea was take a machine uh create a box like a machine and you push a button and it's like like prints out a receipt the receipt is like the adventure you're gonna go on so you get like a random adventure that comes out cool idea right and um and so that was the original idea and he's like ah just tells a couple people about it and they're like oh yeah that's cool and he's like great but he's doing his job and he hasn't really you know figured out exactly how to do it or whatever um and he's like he's like okay but he's he's he everything's like on hold until he gets fired from his job and he like uh he he makes a mistake they think he committed fraud his boss is like no no there's honest mistake but either way he gets fired he's like all right [ __ ] um what do i want to do so he decides i want to go to acting school so he's like i'm going to go to acting school but i need to pay for life so he's like i need to create a side hustle that's going to make me 2 000 a month that's my goal and he's like what about that adventure box challenge thing and he's like the idea over the course of a few months has had like evolved and he's like all right what if it was actually like a book that you could scratch off the adventure um and so he tells a couple people about it and they're like that's actually a really cool idea you should do it and so he goes to hobby lobby and he buys some paper some of the scratch-off material and he and he's like buys it goes to a different store he buys a camera and he's like starts coming up with this idea and he basically spends six to eight months prototyping this idea because nobody had really done a like kind of like um an adventure style scratch-off book before so he's like creating an actual physical product and so he's like um he has this idea and he um he just keeps telling people about it and so he um he gets to the point where he's prototyped the idea several times and there's videos i found online of like he's creating a vlog while he's doing he's like all right it's 11 p.m april 1st uh i just got this really cool material for the scratch off i really like this one but i'm having trouble with the bindings you know and he's like so maybe i'll try this other thing tomorrow and then like he has the next video you know a week later he's like okay i figured out the bindings part and now i need to figure out this other thing i love seeing the the start the early stages of these ideas so he creates a kickstarter he's like i'm gonna do a kickstarter it's gonna be great i wanna raise ten thousand dollars for this book and uh kickstarter goes live he makes thirteen hundred dollars the first day and he's like [ __ ] yeah i'm the man he you know goes to a coffee shop he's strutting in he's like i made 1300 today i don't know about you guys i'll take you know your best give me your finest coffee and uh he's like all right we're you know we're already 13 of the way the goal let's keep going but day two four hundred dollars day three zero dollars and like the kickstarter like runs out of steam he's like [ __ ] i was kind of just banking on this going viral and now it's not viral so what now and so he's like all right basically he's gonna throw in the towel because like for for only seventeen hundred dollars i can't even get the quality of book made that i want uh maybe i'll just quit so he's like i need to get a job to pay for life um you know like i'm out of money and so he's like he's like oh maybe i'll contact my buddy i don't forget his name but ben my buddy ben to uh to get a sales job he has like this company i can do sales so he calls him up he gets a sales he's like i want to do a sales job i want to do it for one year and i'm just saving up money so i go back out there and build a product and the guy's like alright cool that's fine like you're upfront about it like i'm down with that let's do it so he gets a sales job there and while he's there he's telling people at work this idea he can't shut up about the idea and um and the guy there was like you know have you tried ads he's like oh dude nobody clicks ads like ads like uh ads like ads are scams basically like that was his mentality at the time and the guy's like no like that's how we grow our business like you know you should try so he puts a little money into ads he's like i don't know if it worked or not but like you know i got this like 10x roast and the guy's like what like no way and he's like yeah like people really like the ad or whatever and so the guy he partners with his buddy the guy who hired him and he so i'm fast forwarding some parts of the story but basically he ends up leaving that guy partners with him that guy's like look we're gonna grow this thing through ads and um and they basically run a [ __ ] ton of tick tock ads facebook ads whatever and they've grown this thing to now 85 if this is true 85 million dollars in sales they've sold about 2 million copies of this book it's like a 40 book which is like you know something 70 something million dollars in sales if you do the math and um and yeah what an adventure now they have like a couple's book so you're like 50 fun adventures to go on with your date they have a family book here's some things to do with your family a friend's book and then a by yourself book and um yeah it's kind of amazing

have you heard of this thing called ged match no what was that oh have you heard of the golden state killer no okay so in the 1970s there was that's what they call you yeah that was my nickname in high school golden state killer uh in the in the 1960s 70s and i think 80s there was this guy who basically like raped like 50 women and then he murdered eventually like 20 of like he was a serial killer and uh he got away with it for years no one knew who it was and patton oswalt's wife pat oswald the comedian his wife who recently died right before she died published her like master work or life's work and it was about the golden state killer and how he's never got been caught and it renewed interest and then the fbi got all into it because all the press and they eventually use this website called ge it's public it's like anyone can use it it's like an open source website and it analyzes all of the uh information from 23andme ancestry and like all that stuff all the database stuff and they found they put his dna the golden state killer's dna which they had into this ged match thing and they realized that the daughter of the killer or like they're like well this is so aligned it must be like the daughter or the granddaughter of the killer recently signed up for 23 and me and so they stake out this guy's house they dig through his garbage they find they go boom got him and that's how they arrest him and they arrested him when he was like and if you google golden state killer you'll see like these pictures of this old man and they got him because he got away with it for so long but eventually they brought him to justice and now they've caught many dozens maybe even hundreds of killers or rapists this way which is good but it's kind of scary and so you could so i was gonna say so you're you're worried about this why why is this working because it's being used for grandpa and trouble it's being used for good now but like you could see like do i want to be in the state do i want to be in this database and so this is one thing i'm a bit worried about so you can go to ged match and you can upload your results and it can tell you all types of stuff about your results you can see a lot of interesting stuff and you could like if you can somehow get the dna from an fbi case which i believe in some cases you can you can like upload it and there's like thousands of like these internet detectives using this database to solve crimes it's kind of fascinating it's kind of interesting and it's definitely a little scary wow is there like a subreddit for these uh you know like sort of like public crime solvers yes there is and it's very very interesting and most of the time they're wrong so like if you remember when the boston like the boston uh marathon bombing they like named like these like three guys and they they kind of [ __ ] with these guys lives they they didn't end up doing it but everyone was certain on that subreddit and they're uploading pictures and they go this guy works at this place it wasn't them they were wrong no one guessed it that it was the two actual guys but this is a little bit different because it's dna but dna isn't perfect so it's like there's a it'll say like there's a um this person is five percent related to this person so it's like all right let's see what that is that could be like a distant cousin until you like track your way down to that and you build these family trees to figure out oh you know it's kind of weird that like this matches this person and they're they also lived in the same area and so it's not perfect but it's like pretty good so anyway i thought that's why i may not get 23 in me [Laughter] yeah i also know people who have gotten it and realized like their dad is not their real dad um and i think that that happened to a family member i think that's a you know uh you know side effect to be aware of sometimes ignorance is a family member of mine a family member of mine found out that their parent had a base their parent cheated on the spouse and had a a a kid and so they logged on and they go oh man i've got a second brother around you know like a stepbrother or a half brother and uh it changes [ __ ] i was gonna say without getting too personal that that uh that has like that they went public with it or they just kind of kept that information to themselves no no no they did not go public with it but it like was very it was i don't know they haven't talked about it with me too much but it was it seems like it was like somewhat earth shattering yeah there's a there's a thing that i've heard that goes on which is um people who uh people who use sperm banks so like a sperm donor will take the t sorry people who didn't realize that their parent had used a sperm donor or whatever they will get the sequencing done or whatever and they'll find out like oh my god i have 42 like half brothers or sisters out there it's like oh yeah this was a person who um you know this is a person who donated a bunch and then so yeah you actually do genetically share with all these different people um like wow that's really crazy so there's all kinds of like interesting stuff and i think 23andme their business model is to sell your data right like i think that is the core business model as they sell pharmaceutical companies for um you know like the research or whatever like i don't know if it's [ __ ] up or if it's like this is for the good of science but i don't think you really know or opt it's not clear that hey like it's not clear yeah it's probably it's definitely the terms you know but nobody's reading the terms and so that's the problem it's like it's like a benevolent dictator it's like it's cool when they're making the trains run on time it's not cool when they start killing people you know what i mean yeah it's like it's good when it's good and then but it could go bad really easy

tyler perry i don't know a lot about him but i know that he's a baller yeah and he's incredibly talented so what's cool about tyler perry is like one he's a billionaire but i mean not a ton of people are billionaires but like he is i think an unexpected billionaire in the sense that some people haven't even heard his name right and there's a lot more people who you would think are more well known who at least at first glance have done more things but he's done a ton of things but just to compare you're like okay a billion dollars like he works in you know in the uh movie tv slash um play industry so like okay that doesn't sound so crazy but like taylor swift guess what her net worth was i pulled this earlier this year so it's probably way higher but maybe what 50. so 365 million leo dicaprio how much do you think his net worth is 100 260 serena williams uh is serena the oldest or the youngest she's the uh she's the younger one venus is the oldest 200 yeah so 225. anyway i should share the weight but one of those what are those uh what's that source i don't know i mean some some site on google so yeah take it with a grain of salt dude those sites are [ __ ] if you google like i i tested this if you google a couple people's net worth some of my personal websites come up number one and i just made this [ __ ] up and i've seen people cite it well yeah i mean definitely take it with a grain of salt because i've definitely googled some of this stuff before and you'll see someone and one site will be like their net worth is like 50k in another site it'll be like their net worth is 50 million so it's it definitely you know can vary but the point is i've through the podcast i've met one or two like celebrities who if you google they'll be like yeah they're worth 10 or 15 and i've talked to them they're like i wish they're like i got they're like i make like 100 000 a year yeah okay so tyler perry is like at least i think he was like written about by several different publications i think they verified he's a billionaire i believe with him with him i believe it because he's on the forbes list yes exactly so for that for that reason his story is awesome because he basically i mean he didn't start out with much so he used to when he was younger he used to watch his dad's subcontract and his dad would make 800 bucks and the person who he's contracting for with like net 80 000 and he remembers thinking at the time like i always knew there was more power in the man that owned the house rather than the man working on building it so i wanted to be the guy who owned the house so he like very early on understood the principle and the importance of ownership and he had he had a messed up childhood i think he was molested a little bit i think his dad was abusive this guy went through a lot yeah and he was also a high school dropout so when he dropped out of high school he was you know he was doing a bunch of different odd jobs he struggled to pay rent he was a bill collector he sold cars like he did all types of stuff um but eventually he saved up enough which was 12k to rent an atlanta community theater so this was his first bet he basically wrote this play himself it was called i know i've been changed and he started running this play and you're probably thinking like oh okay overnight success no it was really bad at first and he struggled to pay rent and um he actually worked on this play for over a decade he produced the play he sold the tickets he designed the set he sold the snacks so he was like doing the whole thing because no one else would invest in him at the time but over that decade i think the play got better he like reigned in his chops and basically throughout that decade period he sold over 100 million in theater tickets 20 million in merch and 30 million in just the videos of the plays because again he owned the ip so he can actually make money he was just making plays like like interesting plays and which sounds simple but that's like and it's hard crazy so he made these wonderful plays and was it like he made a bunch and then they went to different and they like did he like literally tour and just make like 50 grand a night through um like hosting it in atlanta and then nashville and then like chicago or wherever i think that it was just this one play i know i've been changed but i do think that they did like several tours and actually one of the one of the different theaters that he eventually ended up at so remember he was just at this like atlanta community theater to start he ended up you know at the acclaimed fox theater so he like moved his way up and i think this one play i know i've been changed um kind of helped unlock some things for him so that was his start he started with plays but even then you know that hundred plus million a lot of that was in theater tickets i don't know how much profit he made from that so the next thing is he basically said okay i want to do that and that was 100 million in over 10 years yes exactly so it's over like a long period of time that's amazing and so basically he wanted to create i think a movie next um and he basically wanted to create it's called like the diary of a mad black woman which is pretty funny and he definitely knows his audience right so he's definitely like tailored his career towards um you know an audience that he understands really well but when he wanted to create this he basically yeah like no one would take him up on it he's looking for a distributor um and the only people that will take him up on it and act as his distributor was lionsgate but even then lionsgate was like uh we're not so sure so basically tyler had to put up half the money he said look like you know what if if this is what it takes like i'll put up half the money um and how much the nice thing about that i'm not sure how much it was actually but um the great thing about that deal which you'll see throughout every deal he does so the budget by the way the budget was 5.5 so he put up two point uh two point what's that three nice so with that deal though he owned and controlled the content so basically every deal he's done like he's he's owning that ip so the lionsgate ceo basically said like before it was released like if this makes 20 million dollars total because yeah like the budget was like five mil he's like we'll be really stoked and it did over 20 million in weekend one um and since then has made over 150 million dollars in licensing alone that's crazy so like first of all like i i understand so he launched the stuff in in the the 90s or not in the plays in the 90s and 2000s and basically like the black population is i don't know what 12 of america and so you think like so you're gonna do a thing dedicated to only 12 of one group like there's no way that can be big and he totally proved it correct because it's kind of like um in in uh is it ice where's bjork from iceland so i think iceland and iceland doesn't have a lot of people um but bjork is incredibly famous and i think the reason is is like iceland had so much pride that a huge chunk of the icelandic population was like oh we love bjork therefore once they start seeing her succeed they get behind her and they go bjork is awesome and that's almost what happens here a little bit and that's kind of why sometimes it's cool to appeal to a smaller but more passionate base than it is to appeal to the larger percentage yeah and by the way iceland has a population of 366 000 people so is it that small very small i remember i had a friend on exchange from iceland and she told me not jokingly they have a dating app that makes sure that you are not related to someone that you are dating because it is such a small population and hey they made and bjork sucks sorry if you're a bjork fan but objectively she she sucks it is not good music so like it was definitely you know they say it was like it was the product go to the marketing good the icelandic marketing or whatever she's from it was wonderful because they made her famous that's so funny um anyway so that was his first foray into movies but then he kept going okay so he's done play then he's done a movie and now he wants to do tv okay so he goes and basically he goes and creates ten episodes first himself because again he's like i can do this like i produce to play for ten years i don't need like to hire a bunch of people i can do this myself so he creates ten episodes first he sells it to one network called cw and they air it and the ratings are through the roof people absolutely love it and because of that it caught the attention of another network which basically was like hey can we steal this um and they did and they struck a deal for 200 million dollars for him to leave this other network and he would produce 90 more episodes and again he owned the episodes which is kind of crazy he owned the ip of those episodes even after that 200 million deal this deal alone is expected to have made him 138 million dollars so his show his earnings then um you know people still aren't really paying attention to tyler for some reason um he continues to make remember that lionsgate deal that he did he continues to make movies with them and over time he makes an 11 film franchise that's done over a billion in sales and netted him specifically him individually over 290 million dollars because again he always owned the copyright and then tyler made one i mean i'm sure he's made other bets but one really big bet in 2015 which basically this whole time he's like an atlanta native right and he he kind of saw the potential for the city and so he bought a plot of land worth 30 000 sorry 30 million dollars at the times 330 acres and about double the size of a warner bros warner brothers lot and he turned it into this like production base or where different like uh media companies could go and film shows so since then i think like the walking dead has filmed their black panther um and part of it is he actually like it wasn't just him betting on his city he saw that in 2008 georgia had changed the tax law so there were certain incentives for production companies so we saw these incentives and he said you know what i think people are different production companies and i bet maybe they they could have created those incentives just for him well i mean this happened so the law happened in 2008. he did this in 2015. so we saw that this was changing and basically in 2007 before that law 67 million was spent in or sorry in georgia and then in 2018 it was 2.9 billion much thanks to tyler and his um investment there but basically because of that then he was also to he's since signed like 150 million deal with viacom cbs to run another suite of episodes and he's just like kept going in every juncture he's made sure to own what he's producing and so now he like has listen to this he's basically amassed 22 films dozens of plays and 1200 tv episodes that's what like his like life work so far plus this like production base and he owns much of his work even the latest 150 million dollar deal i think he sold it for five years but after those five years the rights returned to him i love tyler perry is there a tyler perry biography out there i would read that in a heartbeat yeah i think there's a few go to google tyler perry house he's got a this huge spread in outside of atlanta with a private jet run a runway no one has that uh that is baller so i was doing this podcast earlier today with rob walling and i was talking about how at hustle con because i've met all these like successful people and these billionaires and stuff like that that i uh i'm like i was like often i'll meet someone like for example uh like the founders of casper or something like that and i'll say to myself you know you're like maybe fi you're financially more successful than i am maybe um and like your company's definitely bigger than my company but i don't think that you're necessarily like if i i don't think you're necessarily 20 times or 50 times more smart or smarter than i am or however much bigger i was like you know like we're in the same ballpark you might be a little bit or maybe even i might be a little bit smarter or even hard-working or something like that the difference is is that maybe you just kept at it or there's probably some luck involved or you um you kind of like landed on the right idea like you're not like significantly better than me and therefore that's why i believe that most people can accomplish something interesting of course like it definitely takes luck and like all this crazy other stuff to become a billionaire but like we can all become uh pretty successful if we just kind of stick with it because the intelligence isn't that big of a factor in order to achieve some success however i see guys like tyler perry and i see the work that they like their output and their genius and i think well we're just not the same you're just better than me like you are so good at what you do like i went and just i saw hamilton the other day and i was researching lin manuel um and i was like oh you're just a freak like you like like i was watching it and i was like i don't even like musicals but the fact that someone was so brilliant that they came up with us and put this together that like i understand you should be a billionaire like you should have it all you should or like when i read harry potter i'm like how on earth does one person invent this in their brain you you're better than me you and i we are not the same you are just a different human being and you're more of an alien than you are a human being and that's how i feel about tyler perry that's how i feel about like lin emanuel or what's the name lin manuel and that's how i feel about like a jk rowling type so kudos to tyler perry he deserves it yeah i mean it's crazy he's done like over 1200 tv episodes like you have to be just like so good at what you do to be able to do that for like i think his first play came out in 1992 so he's been creating for 30 years straight and it's like some people are one hit wonders like this guy is not a one-hit wonder he like knows what he's doing he's like honed in his craft and so yeah it's like super cool i remember i got a lot of flack for this but i like once tweeted something about like jeff bezos i think he had like resigned and i was like this guy's been working on this company for 27 years like how rare is it that someone works on anything for even like five years straight and these guys like tyler perry as well like he's just like worked on his craft for decades like that's insane yeah it's pretty cool i think that um like we were talking about on this podcast i was like you know i think i could become a billionaire if i wanted to i just you have to be willing to dedicate like 30 years to it like i'm definitely smart enough and i and i work pretty hard um i just don't know if i'm like if i like want to spend the time doing it and and and and i think a lot of people who achieve greatness they're not much different except there are people i was like elon musk and jeff bezos i was like you just have more horsepower than i do like you're just different and i'm gonna put tyler perry in that category you just you just we're just we're not the same you know what i mean yeah i know it's just like it's like a race car versus like you know not a race car like there's just no amount of modifications can i make my car as fast as that yeah you have to like have so much horsepower to want to do this for so long which is why you're you ask me all the time you're like you want to be a billionaire and like every time you ask me i'm like less sure of the fact that i want to do it because i'm like yeah everyone wants to be a billionaire everyone wants to like amass well maybe not everyone but a lot of people are like yeah i'd love to live like a great life but a lot of people don't want to put in that effort and now i'm questioning like i think i'll actually be pretty happy with less than a billion yes uh i think you'll be i you do you definitely don't need that to be happy that's for sure about to see my first a million got to the safe and it's filling up got to the bank it's not big enough

this is awesome ben texted me or like slacked me while we were doing this and he goes steph's been uh spitting fire for the last 50 minutes so this is badass about to see my first a million got to the safe and it's filling up got to the bank it's not big what's going on um what's up good how are you i'm good all right you're back shawn is on a family vacation and you are the sub and i think it's a good sub so you sent me this document that we're gonna we're gonna go through a ton of stuff there's so much stuff on here how uh are you is this like a list that you've been keeping for months or is this just you made this just for this this is part of a list i've been keeping for months i uh i keep this list in my evernote that just every time i see a new idea whether it's from like a newsletter or something you guys talk about on my first million that i want to respond to i just have a running list so this is probably like a quarter of that bigger list what this is 15 pages how many words like just what we have here is like 10 000 words we should share this i mean at least parts of it because we're not gonna get through all of this this is amazing i if i was you i wouldn't share this i would charge people for it this is good i mean there's definitely things that i'm excluding from here you know you don't share the ones that you actually want to build you uh so you told me one time that you want to become a billionaire i think i want to we'll see if that actually happened well i said who cares if it happens or not but you said that's what you wanted do you um what are you going to do to become that i mean i feel like if i ever become a billionaire we're going to talk hopefully about tyler perry later it has to come from building something on my own i need to have equity in something like you don't become a billionaire from working for a company and buying etfs well there's a few examples but the likelihood of becoming a billionaire is slim to none the likelihood become of becoming a billionaire by being an early employee somewhere is much slimmer of that subset but it's possible it's definitely possible um should we talk about these companies of one which i feel like are kind of anti-not anti-billionaire but a different approach to building yes and i actually don't think they're anti-billionaire i think you can become a billionaire this way but just so people know so this is steph smith steph you work at the hustle you basically helped me start trends and you ran it for a while and you still kind of run it but you also do like a bunch of other different projects and you have this gum road book called doing content right is that right yep and it made like 150 g's in the first year or something like that right yep exactly and you are the type so we we aren't like really partners anymore but i felt like when we when you ran trends i viewed it a little bit like a partnership so i've worked with you pretty closely for a while now now that now we're just friends but uh is that out is that all accurate what am i missing i think so yeah i uh i build stuff on the side for fun taught myself to code a couple years ago and now i also have a podcast so if people like what they hear hear um it's called the [ __ ] you don't learn in school that's my little plug and you are very you and i are similar in that there's like it's kind of like sean like there's like this this like overlap of things that are very very similar between us but there's things that are very different in that what you're different about is that you sweat the details uh like crazy and you're pretty technical in the sense of like i really think it's just you're just smarter than me like you could just figure things out like you can just you can just figure certain things out so your research is actually typically more like in-depth and technical than my research and i like that thanks i mean i don't know if i actually saw the details if anyone knows me closely like if you'd have asked cal he'd be like no she's like a mess so i appreciate that i come off that way so let's talk about companies of one so you have a list of like ten or seven companies that are run by one person that are shockingly big let's go through some of them and uh talk about them yeah so i think you called out two before so i'm gonna just call out those two quickly you called up built with before which is the site that basically can tell what a site is built with is it built with wordpress or squarespace or what plugins is it is the site using and that one at the time when you found it was i think doing around 14 million and then you've also covered nomad list and remote okay by peter levels and those two i think together are doing around a million a year and those two i think are both completely solo founders i know peter certainly is um but there are a couple others so have you heard of ugg monk well hold on so built with so people know built with is like maybe one of the most impressive ones here but not the but one of built with is like it's like a i think they have a plug-in as well but it's a website you go to builtwith.com you enter in the hustle.co let's say you want to you you see something on our website that you like and you want to copy and you're like how'd they build that what plugins do they use what whatever you use built with and they make money because uh they like what do they do i think they like sell people's data or something i'm not sure actually let me look this up because i know they get a crazy amount of traffic look they've got plans on their site so they've got a basic plan i don't know what you get with it but it's 295 dollars oh i know what you get you get basically i believe you sign up and it tells you uh people's so it crawls all these websites and it tells you what type of features they have on their website and what type of plug-ins and i think you pay money and it'll say we have the emails or contact information of all types of people who use blank plug-in and you sell a plug-in that is complementary to that therefore pay money and you can now target them and advertise against them or things like that yeah they charge so their basic plan is three thousand dollars a year their pro is five thousand their team is 10 000. there's a cool little trick they have on their pricing page if you go to it and you hover over they have like technologies keywords and they have these little gifs that they're actually like showing what you would get with the product i've never actually seen that before so that's a cute little hack and it's built by basically one guy in australia um all right so what are some of the other companies okay so i was gonna call it ugg monk so this one's not as big i actually don't know exactly how much they're making but it's a really simple e-commerce store they started just selling really nice t-shirts which sounds like okay like there's enough t-shirt stores out there um but this guy jeff sheldon he focused on just really high quality shirts and then now he's moved into almost like productivity stuff if you are you in the doc i'm looking at ugg monk so when i go to ugg monk i see like a pen holder and i see um like a a to-do list like a it's like cute well-designed like pen holders which doesn't sound neat but it honestly it looks pretty sick yeah it looks surprisingly sick if you go to let me if you click in the dock where it says look at this if you click that that is his setup and he he's like one of those builders who i think has built a little twitter following as well and he just has this beautiful desk set up which is like the perfect ad and i oh i've seen this it looks awesome i never thought i'd want to go and buy like a 100 to-do list but i i think i'm gonna buy one yeah i it's just like cute easy to use like mid-century modern stuff yeah i'm on board how much revenue does he do i'm not sure but i'm pretty sure he does several million a year he gets over 200 000 page views a month um and he's been going at this for several years so i know he makes enough to have left his full-time job several years ago and he's grown a lot since then so i'd probably say a couple wow that's crazy all right that's a that's a good find it's just one guy he's the only employee i think so i mean he's he he probably has some staff now that he's been growing but i i'm pretty sure he doesn't have a big team all right what's next all right card is actually one guy he might have contractors but card c-a-r-r-d i've built sites with card people probably recognize card or they've almost certainly been on a site built by card um and it's built by this guy aj and it's doing one million dollars a year ar i think he actually just raised money now so i think he's kind of going for did he really just raise money i would love to invest in this yeah he raised money earlier this year he was like big in the indie hacker community and then i think he posted on indie hackers this year like look i'm i'm going to raise money i'm going to you know really go for it but he it's kind of crazy 2.5 million sites have been built on card and yeah like a million ar so it's a free platform for building simply uh for building simple fully responsive one-page websites that can do anything um yes i actually think so there there was this company called um you remember about me no what is that about dot me so go to about dot me at that's the url um you don't remember that you're i'm just a little bit older than you which is like then that few years probably makes a difference because about.me when i was just getting started was considered like the preeminent builder in this space and they made it was a one page website where you can explain stuff about you and it was started by this guy named tony conrad i believe his name is and he's this cool looking dude who uh is also an investor now and he sold it after only two years to aol for like 40 million dollars and it was bootstrapped you see about.me you see how it's like basically the same thing yeah it reminds me of you've heard of unsplash right i love unsplash so or sorry i'm not thinking of unsplash i'm talking about unfold unfold is this app that basically for instagrammers it adds different like it allows you to kind of piece together pictures for your instagram story but they also started these like one pagers um where basically because all these instagramers they're like oh i need my link in bio link in bio is also a site like that but unfold um was sold to squarespace i think like last year or something i don't know for how much though man i think that these one page website builders are actually really cool so there's this other business i almost invested in i think it's called mediakits.com or dot co i believe it's just called media kit and all they did was built a really slick website builder where you could create your media kick kit and send it to people so and uh whether you're the hustle or you're just an instagram person you just had this like uh the hustle.com media kit or like you know um stephsmith.commediakit and it was that your media kit was on there and that sounds like not that important but it's kind of like docsen so docsen if you don't know what docsen is docsen is basically all it is is powerpoint in the cloud but email gated so you have to enter your email and then you get all types of information so if you use it when you are creating a pitch deck and you want to send it to investors so you know who has it and uh and who views it and how long they've used it and it's basically that um so anyway card is pretty badass that actually might be one of the highest potential businesses you have here i think yeah and i mean he actually runs card as a subscription business so that's 1 million ar and i think it's probably way past that today i think you're going to like the next one though go to uh this nextepisode.net i think it's actually next episode.net it's the it's such an old site i think the guy's been running it for 15 years um and if you just open it up you'll you'll get a sense of how the ui hasn't caught up to where we are today but it's amazing because this guy's been running it for 15 years guess how much traffic this thing gets i'm looking at it on similar web this is crazy so what is this called so next dash episode.net what is this yeah it's a site where basically like there's no way i would think that a site like this would still exist but people use it um that basically helps you track your tv shows and it's a little bit of a community so i think i've never used it but you know people watch the bachelor they hang out on this site and they find other people who watch the bachelor and they talk about it um but it's kind of crazy how much traffic this site gets this is awesome and so here's why i know this is a big business so if you go to similar web and you look at the traffic the estimated monthly traffic is 3.6 million uniques a month that's decent that's not like the best but it's like really good particularly for one person but if you go to traffic source it says that 80 is coming from direct traffic which basically means that there's a lot of people that are just typing in this url and going there on a consistent basis and if you do that you probably can have a huge business and it looks like they've got um a premium which is only two dollars a month but uh how big is this so i don't know exactly how big it is but he's been running it for 15 years and i know he's definitely i found him on hacker news one of those posts that was like hey like who's a solopreneur who's doing this thing on their own and he's like i've worked on this entirely on my own for the last 15 years so what this is crazy good find i can't wait so who what's this person's name do you know uh let me send you here he is i found him nico nicole yeah wow this is a good find how much revenue do you think he does on this i don't know about today but i'm assuming like if he's getting that many million pages and he's been working on it for 15 years i'd say like maybe a million a year what do you think yeah i would agree with that and it's probably mostly all profit yeah well i mean he's literally the only one who works on it in one of the posts on hacker news he's like yeah i started for myself because i couldn't find such a tool back in the day and um basically he's like avoided hiring other people um because he doesn't want to like scale through hiring um all right what else we got there's a ton on here there's some there's one called hostify by a guy named riley who basically um you know has scaled that to like a million a month in a year or two um there's some good stories from back in the day where apparently surveymonkey was doing 19 million dollars in revenue um with 12 employees so not a one-person thing but plenty of fish is another example where they were doing apparently 10 million dollars and the guy was by himself he might have even been part-time so that's kind of a crazy story from back in the day too how did how do you know this about surveymonkey so it was posted it was actually you posted about built with a while ago i think and then i went through all of the comments of you basically you were like can anyone tell me something more efficient than that and um this guy named tripp posted yeah surveymonkey was doing 19 million with 12 employees um and you asked him if this was documented and basically someone else commented and was like yeah tripps do you want us to say this but he actually invested in surveymonkey in 2009 so he probably knows the numbers wow this is amazing i've heard this i've heard rumors about surveymonkey doing this this is crazy this is so cool so did i tell you about how i told you about craigslist right so the hustle our very first office it was this apartment it basically it looked like a town home like like a typical san francisco town home but it was zoned as business and on the bottom was this uh was a piano teacher in the middle it was like a three-story town home but they like divvied it up into apartments so the bottom one was a piano teacher the middle one was this company called nugs.net and nuggs.net sells it's like a marketplace where you can trade uh like fish and grateful dead like cds that you recorded at their concerts and above that was craigslist and craigslist moved out and we moved in and this was in 2016 i think and which means craigslist at the time the landlord told me he goes they were making around 300 million dollars in revenue and they worked out of this little office and this office was so small it was basically a three or two bedroom apartment and he was like there's basically like 14 people here and that was the whole company and they were so cheap craig was so cheap that the rent the rent i was paying was like 500 and i split it with my friend sieva so the rent for the whole place was probably only two thousand dollars so they're paying two or three grand in rent for this place when they were that big and they were so cheap that in the lease apparently it said like toilet paper is provided by landlord and every once in a while uh i think his name was ishmael he would forget to uh or emanuel a man i forget it was like this old jewish guy he would forget to put the toilet paper and replenish it and they wouldn't pay the rent they go until we get the toilet paper you're not getting the rent and uh they additionally craig worked out his i used uh craig's room because it had a kitchen table in one of the bedrooms that he used as his desk it was like this ugly kitchen table that was like his desk but it was really heavy and they couldn't move it and they just left it there and that was my desk for a long time was this like weird kitchen table and that was out of the craigslist office and that's how scrappy they were dude i love that so i mentioned peter lovells before he's a friend of mine from bali he once tweeted about this so i don't feel bad sharing it but he used to walk around with this like you know those bags that you get at a grocery store they're like plastic bags that are like a dollar yeah so you'd think that some guy making like a million bucks a year all profit is gonna like upgrade his lifestyle he would carry his laptop around in one of those bags and like that's it and you'd see him walking around in flip-flops and a t-shirt and you'd be like dude like respect because like you you make a lot of money and everyone knows that because you have that open page but he's like walking around with like a grocery store bag as his laptop holder that's stupid that's very stupid it ruined your laptop um what are some what are some other smaller ones all right so i want to call it a couple these are actually uh also some people i know from bali so it's it's kind of cool when you live in a place like chengu because you're just running into people just like this so one of them is this thing called banner bear so if you click on the link where it says banner bear that's their open page so a lot of these people also create these cool open pages like uh the ones from nomad list but i wanted to show you this one because if you scroll down if you're on the page do you see the modem the motor i can't even say it the moto meter yeah what is this so i'm looking at basically a pic pictures of motorcycles of like nice triumph motorcycles so basically like he's got his revenue and you can see his mrr and it's pretty impressive he's at around an er of 300 thousand i think he only started this you can see in some time in 2020 um but he kind of rethought the open page and he was like you know what i just i don't want to just show my revenue i want to show people like what i want to spend this on so he loves motorcycles and he has like these different goals so like if he hits a certain mrr he like unlocks a new motorcycle um and so i thought that was just like a kind of cool cool little thing and you can see just like peter he shows all of his data like you have the number of trials per month uh his churn um obviously the the moto meter his github commit activity so i think that's pretty cool because like i think years ago there was some people showing their like open revenue but now people are kind of like rethinking what they can share what the hell is banner bear this is so cool looking what does it do so basically i think it's it's basically like an api for generating images so do you know how like we use we could have used this at trends honestly remember we would run events and we'd have to like go on fiverr and like you know it would kind of it would it wasn't very expensive but it takes some time and you're like oh man like we should just have like an image template for all of our events and it has like a certain background a certain theme and so he's made it possible to basically generate images based on certain inputs so um you don't have to like go and hire a designer to do that you can like auto generate images and so some people use this for like social media right so you have like a certain theme that aligns with your brand and you're just like adjusting like all of your blog posts to like use banner bear instead of going and hiring a designer to create an image for each one this guy's site is beautiful he reminds me of how do you say that peter lovells guy is that is it peter yep he reminds me of that this guy looks like an artist yeah i mean i think what's cool about all of these folks is like they do the whole stack like i guess you have to as a company is one but they do like the marketing they do the design they do um the development and what's cool is that like because they're not necessarily experts quote unquote in these spaces like they're just kind of hacking it together i find they're actually a lot more creative right so they're like they're not like constrained by the marketing degree that they had you know before and so peter is like another example where he's he pretty consistently does pretty cool things on marketing or on twitter for example recently he like instead of paying 10 000 for ads he's like i'm just giving 10 000 away to like someone who retweets this and it got like 11 000 retweets which obviously is like much more than he would have spent on ads this in this website banner bear it was launched in uh 10 of 2019 so let's round up to be 2020. so let's say it started in 2000 january 2020 that means it's what two years old yep is growing pretty well does it say its growth rate i mean this could be pretty this could be a really good business yeah and and it's just him i think he like might have hired like a part-time customer service person but yeah it's going really well wow this is amazing how big do you think this could get i think pretty big because it's actually like you know it's one of those niche problems that you're like what like a you're going to create a product that auto generates images like who needs that but then you actually think like wow every company that has a blog has to generate all these images on mass every company that runs something on social media like i think the reason it's working is it's actually even though it seems like a niche problem it's it's a problem that most companies have wow all right you want to do you want to pick a couple more we can just call out uh one more which is have you heard of headline no what's that how do you find how do you find all this stuff by the way well like i said i combed through some of the threads that you posted before but headline banner bear nomad list like these are all people who were nomadic and i think it's like the indie hacker community and the nomad community overlap because they're both kind of like rebellious in a way they're like i don't need to live in one place or like i don't need to raise venture capital and so i think there's an overlap there and so yeah most of these guys are people that i used to like co-work with in bali wow okay so what's headline so headline is super super simple app but um danny the guy who built it built it in like a couple months and within a year he sold it for seven figures so all it was is it was using ai to generate um kind of like landing page headlines or copy um and so if you look at the landing page it kind of looks like a much more complex product um but it's actually pretty simple and um if you've heard of copy.ai i think there's like similar elements to it oh hey basically on the website of headline they use my name they're writing wait really say i just noticed that you must have seen this before i've never seen this this guy's using my name i've never that's so funny is he trying to tell me to use this i don't know because i also don't know like i said he sold this so i don't know if he put that there if the new founders put it there um you're wait you're seeing you're seeing my face and name on this website yeah totally god that's so funny why is my face on here whatever that's cool uh yeah well this is just like a super simple one where it's like i love it's like perfect example of like just being scrappy building something he exited seven figures within i think eight months which is pretty crazy um and yeah i just i think one theme is just like these people find like a niche problem that isn't or at least seems niche they solve it has to be an existing problem that people want solved i think the thing that a lot of people do wrong when they're trying to like do their like own little startup is they look for things that like don't really exist but these are like perfect examples where it's like oh of course people need sites to like house their their work of course people need like nice t-shirts and productivity stuff of course people need like landing page copy so i think that's the like one learning for me how did this guy build this he built it in the open on twitter so he just coded it and he would like keep giving updates and then i think he launched it on product hunt like pretty classic launch strategy but i think it kind of blew up after product hunt and then sold it but it's just built on top of that gpd3 thing yep wow all right that's amazing wow i cannot believe it good fine um you want to try something else yeah let's talk about just a couple of these so another thing that i did which kind of overlaps with what we talked about is just like sites that have a surprising amount of traffic so sites that you're like wait really like there's no way and then you look it up and you're like wow i guess like you know 20 million people a month actually look this up so one of them i want to show you is called glitchin deals have you heard of glitching no what's that mean okay so you know how like of course e-commerce is popping off a lot of companies have e-commerce sites not all of them have fully functioning e-commerce sites so sometimes they glitch right so sometimes an airline will you know show a a flight for like 20 bucks that's really meant to be 200 sometimes you know there will be something that's a dollar and it's like really supposed to be 100 it's just like a decimal place error and this happens all the time right and apparently according to the law like if you advertise it for a certain amount like you have to sell it for that amount so there are all these sites that basically look for glitches and i found this out because i was at um my partner's like family home for christmas last year and i remember his aunt being like hey do you want like a podcast mike and i was like i don't like sure i don't know like why why do you have she's like i've got 30. like i just don't have to give them away and i'm like what do you mean you have 30 and i guess she found a glitch in one of these groups and yeah like she just got 30 podcast mics that like she she got for free so free it was free in that case it was free most of the time it's just like a crazy wild deal that the company didn't mean to do so like i need to buy i'm trying to up my game and get that garage fridge you know i'm talking about that garage space like it's so i can store all my meat and so i uh on here they've got a 25 garage fridge i need that freezer yeah and uh that's how you know you make it when you get a garage fridge and um they have one for 50 and it looks kind of complicated to use though yeah so i have to say i've never actually glitched myself i think it's one of those like rabbit holes that like the same way people go and like try to like enter sweepstakes i think it's like a similar phenomenon but there's a ton of people doing it so this glitch and deal site gets four million uh page views a month but it's only been around for a year 2020 i think they must scrape them or they have at least i think it's actually a separate glitch site but has they have a facebook group and this facebook group has 342 000 members wow guess how many people post a day in this facebook group how many 250 plus posts a day that's today when i checked it had 262 posts and it was like it was like 11 am so i'm not that surprised because when we do giveaways for the hustle we'll do like a t-shirt giveaway and like these websites it's like a circular like they all like copy each other and it's basically like midwesterny stay-at-home moms mostly and they love giveaways and like one time we've like we're giving away stickers and i saw one of them post this on like a forum uh like hey there's this newsletter called the hustle you just gotta share your referral link they'll send you stickers i just got mine and there's hundreds of people commenting on it like talking about different strategies that allows them to get more referrals through the hustle so they'll get their t-shirt or their stickers or whatever people look like this demographic it's mostly women i've noticed and it's mostly like uh stay-at-home mom types they love this [ __ ] they love these deals they love free stuff they love it's like it's like a challenge for them because i remember asking his aunt like why did you do this like you don't need 30 podcast mics and she's like i just wanted to like i just wanted to like win almost and i think it's so interesting that so many people are doing this because like you're saying it's it's like a crazy amount of people who are like who probably don't need this stuff but are like i'm so stoked that i got like a gas grill on clearance yeah we were giving away we were giving away like stickers that said the hustle and it's like these ladies like they don't care about business or tech like they just didn't they didn't care about our brand but they just wanted it just because it was available to get and they felt good yeah it was crazy to me what else we got okay so let's go to nugget comfort so if you want to click on that it is it was actually something shared in the transcript a while ago i don't even know how to explain what these are they're basically like cool children's pillows but they're children's pillows that you can basically make into like different shapes and forts and it was just crazy to think so nugget was i think started relatively recently it's in the last year or so i think they had some mailing lists for a prior product before that but they made over four million in sales uh in a month with zero ad spend so nugget comfort was doing is doing over four million a month yes what if you go to so here's how i know that they're at least pretty big you go to their website so it looks like they're based in north carolina you go to their website and you look at you click careers and you see who they're hiring for they're hiring a senior accountant so you know that they're they're counting the money counting that bread they haven't then they need a bunch of different warehouse operators they need a production associate which means that that production associate is going to report to someone uh so you know there's like a huge like a pretty meaningfully sized meaningful sized team here this company's only a year old who started it i'm not sure who started it let me pull up this facebook post basically it's called nugget comfort it's like it looks like pillow cushions that it's like pillows but you can like build with them it's almost like a combination of legos meets pillows yeah exactly and i don't actually know exactly who the founder is this was shared in the facebook group looks like it might be someone called hannah fussell a former elementary school teacher um yeah so actually nugget was launched so it had a previous product that i think was not geared towards young kids um and i guess they had some kickstarter at the beginning and then ultimately i think covet hit um and they had to reposition and somehow they came up with this like children's product which i think is just so interesting because i feel like there are certain um certain industries like pets or children that like people have just like an endless budget to spend on and so these pillows i think i think they're like 200 bucks or something it's only 300 it's not a lot of money yeah it's like they call it a pillow couch this is amazing this company this is one of the wilder things this is brilliant i totally understand it what a cute cool thing uh this is amazing all right let's move on to public domain review we'll do one more um this one is just relates to something you guys have talked about before about how certain ip you know is not in the public domain and then it moves into the public domain after a period of time and so this is a site that basically tracks all of that stuff i think i originally found this because apparently winnie the pooh is going into the public domain in january and so i think i found some article about that and it was on the public domain review so i think it's public domain so what's going to happen what's going to happen when that when that happens what's what type of opportunities are going to be there and what businesses do you think are going to pop up so i think so just for like background for people listening um there's tons of obviously different books or like the bible for example that's in the public domain people can like buy and sell you guys talked about like cool millennial bibles winnie the pooh is a book that you know was written ages ago and then in 2022 would go into the public domain so i believe i think there's like several different um things that um are different um not patents what's it called when something is not in the publication right yeah several different like copyrights and so you need to look into exactly what this covers versus what else exists um but you could like for example potentially like go and like take a winnie the pooh book make it modern and like resell that to um to new customers i think so for example on this website publicdomainreview.org they've got a store where you can buy prints like to put on the wall and it's like really sick art so you're saying like now they can use like winnie the pooh in that art or they can like resell old winnie the pooh art or something like that yeah and what i'd be interested to find out is specifically about merch i don't know exactly if it's just the book right like the book ip or if it actually has to do with just like the ip overall but the crazy thing about a lot of these big franchises pokemon hello kitty winnie the pooh they've all done over 80 billion dollars of sales in merch alone so a lot of people think like okay if you're talking about pokemon they made a lot of money off the show it's like no they actually didn't make that much off the show they made a ton of money off the merch and the same thing is true for like mickey mouse or star wars that's where all the money is made and so what i'd be interested to know and i don't know the answer to this is whether these things moving into the public domain does that mean like i can then go sell like a winnie the pooh shirt i'm not sure do uh first of all how long does a copyright last is it 76 years i think you are going to know this better than i believe it's 76 years but it's pretty messed up actually when you think about it so like let's just say that like a family invented a a person invented winnie the pooh they they die they leave it to their family so you're telling me after i think it's 76 years uh or it's it's death of the creator plus 76 years ago yeah it's it's from what i see now it's death of the creator plus at least 50 years but it can be extended to 70. is it 70 i remember because it's like the there it was like i remember the law there was a law created that did that it's kind of messed up actually when you think about it that that is going to expire why would that expire like why i guess it depends i mean you see the same thing with drugs right where you don't want someone to be able to like capitalize on something forever and i think probably has to do with like the public benefits from something being in a free market over time yeah because of that [ __ ] because if i bought a piece of property and a piece of land and like wouldn't that be weird if like on the third generation you could take back that land i guess so i wonder like yeah i wonder how they determine what things have these expiring copyrights versus what things like that that doesn't exist i think that's interesting i would like to learn more about that but sorry go ahead about publicdomainreview.org well it's just another one of those sites where you're like wow that's one an interesting site where you can kind of browse and see like what is moving into the public domain but it's a beautiful site it's very fun to read yeah it also gets i mean not a crazy amount of traffic but 500 000 page views a month and so i wonder actually i didn't notice they are selling art or like different collections i was wondering how they were monetizing but it must be through that this is awesome i love this website you want to do one more um sure do you see one that you want to do in here i mean one of the ones that we can talk about which is just like a super fun little thing it's like an internet find is this foodtimeline.org there's not much of a business opportunity here but i just think it's like a fun thing to browse basically someone has gone down the internet rabbit hole and found like the first citations of when a food existed so it starts with like water and ice and then you know you get like wheat and and things like basically there's like a bunch there's like hundreds of different data points here and then of course it moves to like 2013 which you see like test tube burgers um but i just think this is like an awesome thing where like again i don't know what the business opportunity is here but like if you have extra time you can create really nifty things like this online and this site this page alone there's only like one page here gets over like 150 000 page views a month i think so i don't know i just thought it was like a cool internet find this is awesome broccolini was only invented in 1993 it's kind of crazy to look and see like wait a minute like i guess it makes sense because it's fermented but like kimchi was invented in the seventh century but then like you scroll down and you're like yeah what like what we didn't have i don't know like yeah like you said broccolini until 1993 or um that's another crazy thing on here high fructose corn syrup 1967. i would have thought that was far sooner buffalo wings only 1964. how intriguing this is a really really cool website i think that the reason why i think this is cool so this woman it's lynne oliver she launched it in 1999. the reason why this is cool is because i respect so listen lynn oliver or oliver she was born 1958 she died in 2015. she was a library and food historian and the sole author of the food timeline website so there's this here's a wikipedia page i just love that there's someone who's this weird and quirky enough to dedicate time to do this because i love people like that and people who are crazy enough to put all their energy into something like this exactly i just think like this is the coolest thing ever and whoever actually created this like thank you for for doing that i've actually one related business opportunity oh listen to this according to the wikipedia the site's domain supposedly support uh expires in 2025 but as of september 2020 uh the the hue is database shows that it's set to lapse on april 2022 because she died so she died and now it's set to go out go out on april 2022. so there you go speaking of copyrights there you go one i guess food related opportunity have you ever looked up like healthiest fast food or like healthiest cheese or like totally do you remember that book you're you're not american so i don't know if they have this in canada but it was called eat this not that yes such a good book series and i would like use it to figure out like what's not what's a good like if i want to eat a burger what's the healthiest burger at a fast food place so you're not the only one and i discovered this because i think one day i was looking up something ridiculous like healthiest cheese um and so a ton of people are searching this every single month so i think some of these numbers are old but something like healthiest cereal which we all know like cereal is not good for you um fifty thousand uh searches per month healthiest bread thirty thousand searches a month healthiest cheese twenty thousand and then there's also a ton of search volume for things like yeah like healthiest meal at taco bell or something like that which i just love because it's like it just shows again this problem where it's like people want to eat healthy but they're realistically in some cases like unable to but it also reminds me of something that uh peter lovells did with his like nomad list site which is basically i call it your listicle is my opportunity so whenever you go you made up that phrase yes i've been thinking about it for ages but i like basically whenever i search something and the all of the results on that page are listicles right so you look up like healthiest cheese and you get to a site and just like five it's like a long article with like five types of cheese and you're like oh my god like this should be easier right and there's so many sites that have basically found things with a lot of search volume and made it easier like that's what nomad list does he's like you know what there's all these like variables and you can play with them yourself i'm going to collect this data so that instead of getting a bunch of listicles when you look up like hot place in june to go traveling he's like giving you that information so you can access it yourself right he's basically like refining the information um and you've seen tons of other people do this i think like that was basically like rich barton's strategy right when he built things like media yeah kind of but listen i i will help someone do this or if they want to partner with me i'll do this so here's what i'm going to do i bet you i can make a fair bit of money like ten thousands of dollars total but like have a business that makes single-digit thousands of dollars you could do this in 30 days here's what i would do here's what i would do so steph have you so we're doing this contest called emma uh i forget what it's called actually but people are taking our clips and they're turning them into tick-tock videos and they're posting them on tiktok and they're getting tons of views so the mfm clips in a matter of like i think we only launched it seven days ago but i forget it's less than 10 days uh in that short amount of time that hashtag has around 10 million views meaning kids have made videos that have 10 million views um on tick tock it's crazy there's a couple videos i think there's one video um that has like 1.3 million views and there's a whole bunch of other videos that have about or over a million and for sure hundreds of thousands and these guys are killing it and so the way that they did it they created like a handle called like mfm clips or like the hustle's pod or hustlers die like they just they made these things from scratch and in literally seven days a couple of them have a million views what i would do is create a tick tock page that says craving a chicken sandwich don't eat the popeye ones eat because it has this grams of fat they use these types of chemicals instead eat the chick-fil-a one because it has this or like craving a cereal don't eat this eat this why and then you'd be like you want more go to this website and you create like a wire cutter style website that does this and you for sure for sure can make a really good revenue like thousands of dollars we're talking off of affiliate websites uh an affiliate website and then eventually do brand advertising deals without a doubt i would bet that would and and that would get popular if you had the right face you need like a hip tick-tock or young-looking person to do this it would absolutely crush totally i mean i feel like just the tick-tock side of things like that's going to trend no matter what and then there's so much search volume for this stuff that like you build up that sustainable business over time and there's so many queries for this so if people are actually gonna go build this i want someone to do that go to ahrefs go to the keywords explorer enter healthiest food and then if you go to matching terms it'll basically give you this like list of terms uh that are similar so you can see like healthiest food which we already talked about but also like healthiest taco healthiest breads healthiest breakfast healthiest restaurant has the healthiest starbucks healthiest mexican food and you just like go down the line and there's like how many there's like hundreds of terms already just like seated there for you and what's crazy is i was actually pretty surprised to see that the keyword difficulty for a lot of these was not very high like i would have thought if someone told me their search volume for this stuff i would have thought like oh someone's already tackled this no no no no i'm not i just googled healthiest cereal and like pure pure wow ranks number one i can outright yeah wow exactly it's like thrillist or like health line and you're like someone should go and create like a site just for this and it'll rank surprisingly quickly if you can target the right keywords this is just fantastic the um eat this is uh so eatthis.com kind of does that it's owned by galvanized media so whatever i do is i go to these websites i scroll all the way down to see who owns the copyright galvanized media is a website that owns like a ton of different stuff they don't eat this not that they own travelicious they own celeb well and a bunch of other stuff i would i bet you i could figure out how much money these guys make but i would imagine like in the 20 or 30 million range if i had to guess based off the website um probably a really good business wow and i mean you can start with healthiest stuff and then obviously like expand past that but that's actually like a surprisingly well i mean i guess not surprisingly i think that's a big niche not so niche niche wow okay let's wrap up with two more things so okay you had something in here about chess and this guy magnus who you you're like this chess nerd you're a chess pop you're a chess prodigy you go to uh chess.com and you play there you're no you're known for being a chess person you had some amazing stats about this guy can you tell me about this well so if people don't follow chess magnus is the number one chess player in the world but the cool thing about magnus i read this the other day is that unlike many athletes if you want to call chess a sport he's actually managed to already um kind of build a little business empire so what a lot of you know celebrities or athletes do is they focus on like getting paid at the time but then they really really struggle to build up any sort of equity in like a product or a brand that they're building which as most people know the way that you you know actually accrue wealth is through equity we'll talk about that with tyler perry he's managed to create this guy magnus how old is he he's not very old he's only 31. it looks like he was like a gm by the time he was like 14 or something um wow and he's like kind of good looking or like he's cool looking he like it looks like he's kind of charismatic he's just like like there's a story here it's not like he's just good at chess he's like he seems like a like a like a like an interesting person in itself yeah he's 31 so he's uh he's not old at all and yeah there's like videos of him when he's like 12 and they're like filming him at i think like world championships and stuff so he was really talented really early um and now he's only 31 he's built up a little empire so not only does he like compete in chess still and um i think he streams on twitch and all that stuff sometimes but he also built his own little company it's called magnus chess so if you go to see what the url is magnus chess carlson.com okay oh sorry it's play magnus.com they get redirected um he has this plus membership i don't know exactly what you get from it but it's 14 a month and here's some of the stats um basically his company play magnus already is a publicly traded company has 250 employees uh 4 million registered users and a market cap because it's public of 115 million dollars already how much revenue does this make so i don't know how much it makes currently but i mean let's look it up it's a publicly traded company and it's publicly traded in france i think or is it nor i actually don't know where it's publicly traded so it's definitely new yeah it's in france fra i think it's it's in euros uh wow this is amazing who would have thought does he own this he owns a stake in it so he owns um not you know not a ton but he still owns i think uh oh actually never mind he owns 85 of the business holy crap that's amazing yeah so this guy's this is amazing and so do you know what's the sales so it looks like revenue um last quarter was 5 million so it's doing around 20 million actually it's grown a lot recently so it's only started looks like in 2019 2020 had total revenue of 20 or sorry 8 million dollars but it's you know last quarter was five so it's trending towards 20 million dollars wow and that's recurring revenue so that's a subscription yep this is amazing and he owns 85 of this so he basically has a has a 120 or something like that million dollar net worth just off of this yeah so it looks like i'm getting a little confused there's something called magnus chess and then there's something called play magnus so actually i think he owns only nine percent of play magnus but then he owns something else uh which i think is like a streaming platform called magnus chess but either way he owns a substantial amount of of one of them magnus chess and he's worth several million wow so we and we also actually covered chess.com chess.com uh i think it might be mostly bootstrapped and it gets something like have you seen what's the monthly uniques of chess.com have you looked it's super high yes i have like like 150 million i think chess.com currently has a yeah 150 million monthly uniques and i've heard rumors that it's a multi-billion dollar company i mean people pay a lot for it because they've actually built in some pretty cool features so light chess is a competitor like chess some people like because it's more like indie but chess.com has like if you go on there you can play and then after your game it'll basically say like actually here all your blunders your mistakes and this is actually like exactly where you went wrong and it's interesting because those are the things people used to pay coaches for like when i was little playing chess a coach would come over once a week and he'd like sit down and i'd go to tournaments and at tournaments you'd write down your moves and then we'd like study them after and he'd be like see that move like do you see how like eight moves later that really hurt you but chess.com has that basically like built into the software where they're like see like that's where you went wrong this is crazy this is awesome ben texted me or like slacked me while we were doing this and he goes steph's been uh spitting fire for the last 50 minutes so this is badass you definitely have to come on again um and there's like way more notes here if i was you selfishly i want to say don't share this and we'll do another one in the next next week or the week after ben what do you think what do you think about this i just got i was getting flack the other day for giving you guys too many a's uh so uh but this one really was like an a plus i uh steph i i know you've got your course and it's doing well but you should do another course on like how you do research people i i do kind of want to screenshot this doc like ben that's what people say to us they tell me and sean that you're saying she's even better she's better she's better than you she's better than you at this uh it depends i think so you and sean are like a plus entertainers i gotta work on that and i know it's something i gotta work on you guys are so good at like making a conversation flow all your like funny bits um and so i think like yeah i mean i can share how i do some research on give me some credit ben we do this two or three times a week steph's doing this yeah once everything's true it's true you do it twice a week but it's just and so it does like it's a little unequal because this dock that steph has is just like chock full of really it's amazing yeah this is me i'm down to come on anytime i was a little nervous to come back on every time i come on like you know the first time it was sometime in 2020 you guys had maybe like 5 000 listens an episode and then like it's gone up so much since then that every time i'm like dude you guys just had like hassan minaj you've had garyvee and i'm like i'm just this like trans analyst or i still feel that way so yeah if people like it i'm happy to come on anytime but um if not we can also just like open source this research i don't i don't think i included anything here that i am going to build myself i was actually previously going to build the like healthiest x thing and then i just realized like that's been on my to-do list for two years so probably never gonna happen i'm gonna ask sarah i'm gonna go to the other room right now tell my wife sarah i'm like hey do this she should i mean seriously this is like the reason i had it on my list is because a lot of the ideas that i've shared in the past i'm like yeah those are cool ideas but like can you really do it and can you do with not that much money and is it pretty likely to succeed right those are like the variables and this one like checks those boxes dude that's awesome thank you this is badass um we're going to wrap up if steph what's your handle on twitter steph smith io or jeff smith io and i'm just going to plug my podcast again because i'm trying to grow it just like ben is um it's called the [ __ ] you don't learn in school all right sick thank you and that was uh you do it with calvin your uh your boyfriend your fiance uh yeah good dude uh all right thank you talk soon thanks guys about to see my first million got to the safe and it's filling up got to the bank it's not big enough

like they used a thumbnail that i looked stupid or a title that made me sound like an idiot and i was like ben i don't like that he goes oh you thought that selling out to the algorithm was gonna feel good [Music] all right we're live let's do this um you want to get right into twitter no yeah let's get into twitter wait let me tell you something really quick i just remembered i was gonna tell you about this i did a body fat scan the other day yesterday okay bad news for all of us man why what happened i was 15 percent why is that for all of us because if you're 50 if i'm 15 like yeah if i'm 15 like that sucks for everyone else i felt like i was like 11. that's just because people [ __ ] like people who are like i'm six percent body fat and then like doctors are like no you you are not six percent body fat you would be like you know sick if you were 66 body fat that's just not the case so i think like what people say is six to eight percent body fat is actually 12 to 15 or like 12 to 14 or something like that and uh so i think 15 is great i was 26 last time i did a dexa scan 2627 something like that and my goal was actually i don't even remember what it was i think maybe my goal was to get under 25 i was 28 or something like that i was amazed at how high i do it every three months that's good i i was made amazed at how how high mine was it uh because like i don't feel like completely ripped but i feel like fit like i don't have a stomach anymore and i and it was still 15. i was shocked we've all seen the picture if you go to my twitter we've all seen the picture you're ripped you're actually the perfect amount of ripped uh because you know there's an obnoxious ripped where if you look like oh man this guy's just he's just it's like a girl who's like uh got like hair extensions eyelash extensions uh nail extensions and like tons of makeup caked on it's like oh they're sort of trying too hard and it's like a high maintenance person that i don't really want like i don't really want to go out to dinner with you because you're just gonna order like broccoli and you know like raw chicken or whatever so you know you're like the right amount where it's like oh man he might live an active lifestyle like maybe he surfs and like maybe that's why uh it doesn't look like someone who is like you know jim bro who just lives in the gym four hours a day and everything centers around that in their life well the point is is that it just shocked me at 15 but i just wanted to to let you know that that happened uh let's talk about all right so we're gonna talk about you're officially canceled as a fitness influencer you can't be a fitness influencer i know 12 is okay anything above 12 i i got to get my [ __ ] together you could do you could just do it as the start of your fitness journey is this this am i i'm still a before i feel like now you're before i feel like i've been a before picture for the past five years i'm still at before [ __ ] damn we already said there's before before i'm a before before and then there's a before you're a before now no i'm just kidding you're more like an after uh i'm now a before but i wasn't before before your system you just gotta know the ranking system it's not about body fat percentage um all right let's get into it all right so we're gonna what's the what's the topic of what's the the title of this segment the title of the segment is sam and sean cross 1 million downloads a month for the podcast they get intoxicated by the growth we're on pace for 1.3 right now smashing old record highs of 900 000 and with this intoxicating growth they say we're gonna [ __ ] out double down and we're gonna make a list and so we're gonna do list episodes that's what's actually happening here now what list did we decide to start with well we didn't go ultra tantalizing ultra drama filled list to begin with we're going with our favorite twitter follow so i think we're going to have 12 is it 12 total so our 12 twitter follows that we recommend now these are going to be i think in most cases not the obvious people so you're not gonna my goal is even there's a lot of people that aren't even on twitter so if you're not on twitter maybe start or not uh you know just subscribe to my five tweet tuesday newsletter if you're not doing that if you're on twitter i bet at least half of these are going to be people you don't already follow that's my guess that's my goal if we do this right so they should be kind of under the radar rising stars and we're going to talk about why we like these people's feeds and some stuff that we've seen from them that's pretty cool so we'll go back and forth uh let's start with uh candidate number one are we going in order of like no best no okay so mine are a little bit more popular than yours so okay are you gonna go how many do you have you have five no i only have three okay i was like researching i was researching i was trying to find ones that people the the ones i love are people that everyone knows but until i was like well you might have to bring up a few or i think i bet when i say some you're gonna think of some others just based off that okay so we're just going to name 12ish of them and we're going to go back and forth let's trade off until sam runs out so i'll go first because you're going to run out faster otherwise so okay the first person on my list of twitter twitter people i think you should follow is post market do you follow post market it's post underscore market no by the way you follow thousands of people i follow up until recently i was following zero people literally zero now it's like this would be cool i just i was getting addicted okay so i have a list and this person's on my list so i said post market is an anonymous account and um or like a pseudonymous account i should say so it's not like a this is not their real name or whatever post underscore market we're going to put the full list in the description of this podcast so if you want to find them uh you could do that or maybe what we'll do is we create a twitter list that you can just subscribe to uh that might be easier so uh who's this person i don't know what they do by day but there's something in the financial world stock you know a trader hedge fund person uh i don't know what it says exactly in their bio but basically what they do is they have like hot takes on the market uh and it's not like hot takes like cnbc where it's like oh you know um the dow is up five points it's like basically they'll take a stock and they'll just rip it to shreds if it doesn't make any sense so like for example the like one of their um one of their ones that they were killing right now is something called the called grove collaborative i don't know if you saw this it's like a it was like a d2c brand it was like one of the winning ddc brands there's a unicorn it goes public and then here's the tweet it says please make it stop here is a mostly d2c organic cleaning products business it's doing six percent revenue growth at two billion valuation has no plan to make profits anytime soon and a greater than five percent uh 5x sales multiple grove collaborative not gonna make it um and then it basically pulls out things from their like investor presentation that show like a fairly so slow growth low margin business that is overvalued what does growth collaborative make i've never even heard of that they're kind of like a subscription almost like a whole foods costco type of model where you can go buy products uh from them i believe and what what valuation are they trying to get i was not trying to get there they're publicly traded at you know two two billion or whatever yikes okay that's a good find and so and so this person because they're pseudonymous they can just kind of um talk about whatever they want they're not really they don't pull any punches and so like they'll go after um they'll go after like chamath for you know most people are kind of afraid to like poke the bear in a way but chamoth in reality had a bunch of really shitty spacks where he made a bunch of money and people who invested in his backs on the whole like just got ripped to shreds this year and um and so this post-market account will like call out basically bad stocks bad behavior um across the board in the stock market so i like that like for example um our buddy moyes tweeted something he goes honest company went public in 2021 uh it raised 400 million that day the shares closed at a valuation of 2.7 billion since that day it's lost 2 billion in value and is now worth less than 800 million and then he says public markets are brutal be careful if you ipo and postmarket replied and said public markets are not brutal private markets are a facade and it's like i like the i like the uh the hot takes i like the intelligence and i like uh that they don't pull punches all right i like this one yeah i'm gonna subscribe i'm gonna follow um all right i'm gonna give you one see some of mine are popular but i'm gonna give you three examples of why i like them ramit safety do you follow me on twitter i don't follow actually i do it follow him on twitter yeah so there's a game on the pod i was following there's two reasons why he's amazing the first is when people criticize him he'll sometimes say that's a good that's a good criticism other times they'll be like no you're an idiot for these following reasons right and he also that's reason number one so he's an entertaining follow and reason number two is he tweets out loads of personal finance stuff and he'll find an article that's going viral and if he disagrees with it which oftentimes he does he'll explain why it's [ __ ] for example uh a lot of people particularly people who aren't necessarily wealthy have financial advisors who charge one percent and he'll tweet out a whole thread about why that's total [ __ ] and you shouldn't pay one percent advisor the second thing everyone talks about buying a home and how it's a wonderful investment and he'll tweet out this awesome math saying no buying a home is not an investment buying a home is like buying a car or something like that where you should just use it and not do it for financial reasons because more often than not it's not a good investment at all and finally he's got this really cool tweet on how to automate money so i actually linked to it in that sheet and i actually set up my my accounts based off that tweet so what do you mean by how to automate money what does that mean so click um so click i believe it was this one where it says uh how he like like where the money goes like for example where do do you have your bank account set up so like a percentage goes here a percentage goes there or like your um your paycheck no you really so where's your money go to well i don't get a paycheck but you're you get paid for the hubspot podcast you get paid for your business so where's your income go to straight to a checking account go straight to a jacket account and then your boy moves it into whatever investments i want to make really yeah i think you need to read some ruby set these stuff because like it should the way it should work is like all your money should go or not you could do however you want well the way often times i think it's easier is your money should go to a checking account and then it takes money out and like let's say that you have a really simple setup put this much in wealthfront put this much in a mutual fund put this what do you even use to do that i don't even know that's a possibility that you automate the like clawing out of your checking into various other services yeah you could do it with coinbase if you wanted to you could do an automatic thing for coinbase oh you go okay so what you do is you go in those services you go into wealthfront you say i'd like to do a auto saver plan and you just ach connect yeah exactly and you just set it up so it's all automated so it's just like basically like you know based off of your monthly income roughly that you want this much cash in your checking account at all times and it automatically and you kind of know roughly the intervals of when you're going to get cash and just funnel it into okay so one of the reasons i didn't do that was when i was getting the last thing i had last job i had when i was at twitch one of the major sources of income was just stock rsu's that were going into amazon stock like automatically so that was already that was already there and i wasn't selling because my basis for when i when we got acquired was lower than the amount at the rsu grant i didn't want to sell and rebalance because it was going to trigger taxes uh on those gains um as as the price cap have you sold any of those shares uh yeah i sold a small amount maybe 15 are you ever going to sell any of them i hope not uh yeah i'm on that big borough die [ __ ] now so uh you know that's that that's the that's that new game plan it's awesome right yeah it's it's awesome until it's not awesome it's probably probably the right answer like most things okay i'm just going to read these remutes money rules all right have one year of emergency fund cash okay fair enough uh i don't but yeah you can um save 10 10 and invest 20 of your gross income you do that or you go higher uh much higher yeah um pay cash for large expenses 20 down minimum on a house okay fair enough yes i do that uh never question spending money on books appetizers health or donate to a friend's charity razor agree completely business class for flights over four hours agree completely um no limit for spending on health or education agree completely buy the best and keep it for as long as possible i disagree with that really i i either buy the best or i buy extremely cheap disposable where i don't have any stress about it because i didn't invest hoping it was going to be the best like a razor it's like a barbell like i'll give an example uh for black friday there's this brand called 32 degrees do you know them nobody's the costco they're like the costco brand of under armour or like nike so i'm gonna buy stuff from the no is it awesome they make like they make like athletic wear and uh it's actually like pretty good but i don't think it lasts as long as lululemon it doesn't last like gym shark yeah like it's it's just not going to have that same durability but i like their stuff like i like it when i wear it and it fits well uh on my whatever fits well for me so i you know for black friday they have this insane deal where like everything goes down like 85 percent they just want to move all their inventory so you'll go buy like whatever like athletics you know like a hoodie or like a fitted you know long sleeve shirt or whatever and it'll be like 4.99 and so i just load up so i buy like almost a thousand dollars worth of 32 degrees stuff that day you get to see on my floor here there's just piled the boxes came and there's piles come out like it's as if i'm a wholesaler for them and so i'll buy like 15 of the pants i like i'll buy like 25 of the shirt i like and because of that i don't worry about like a losing anything getting a stain on anything something wearing out it's like nah i i bought you this so much laundry you have to do though gotta clean it for the laundry bro all right all right you're good all right your turn i know it's bad for the the real argument is it's terrible for the environment and like you know fair enough but uh you know bird's gotta fly so here we go uh here's his last two his last three rules earn enough to work only with the people i respect and like i think that's a great rule uh marry the right person okay fair enough doesn't seem like a money rule but i get it uh prioritize time outside the spreadsheet what does that mean um so like when you're i do i have a problem with this all the time i'm constant i have a spreadsheet with all my net worth and my finances and i'm constantly optimizing it and i'll like do different scenarios like oh and five here if in five years if this happens then we're gonna be here if it goes worst case scenario we're gonna be here therefore we should do this this and this so i'm like constantly tinkering with it and doing i'm like oh three percent uh if you only spend three percent of your net worth over this many years but it grows by this that means by the time we're 50 we're going to have this right and that takes like that takes up so much time it's so fun though i see uh and also this wealth advisory thing so we both have the same advisor but he doesn't charge us any fee right correct no we he only gets paid if we buy uh some of the funds that he's gonna sell us right okay fair enough it's pretty sick right so i think that's kind of a hack i think that's that's a pretty good hack i think it's a great deal um okay so let's do uh let's do another person okay so you got we have post market we have vermeet uh i'm gonna do another one let me do okay i'm going to give you a double a double dose because they're kind of the same same type of account so my buddy george mac and then there's this account called marketing examples do you follow these no what is this one marketing samples so marketing examples this guy i would say is one of the best content creators um on the internet what's the handle i think it's just marketing examples is it good is it harry's marketing example so there's this guy harry drive harry dry he works with us sometimes i think we we i discovered him a long time ago and we tried hiring him and uh it didn't work out but we're we love him yeah i uh i really really respect i don't know this person i don't i don't know well i've damned him just kind of showing respect uh i don't think most people know him he's not like widely he's young you know you know there's like the circle jerk of like we all kind of like the same things and yeah the same circles i think he's like 18 or 19. yeah i think he's probably a little older than that but if he whatever he is he's amazing his content is so good i um i think most people when i see their content i'm sort of cocky where i'm like i could do better if i like if i wanted to i could do better i see his [ __ ] and i say oh i should be copying things he's doing so that's like a very very high compliment in my book uh where i want to copy your [ __ ] because i think you're doing such a good job so um so i think he's his account's really great and um and then george george mack is similar in that george mac basically tweets out kind of like cool marketing hacks mental models um just interesting stories and uh it's a george is really really good as well and he's also kind of like outside the scene meaning like he wasn't he's not a silicon valley person he's not a founder or vc that like isn't super well connected in this area but i think has earned a lot of people's twitter respect you know he's probably got i don't know what like 70 000 followers maybe 100 000 i don't know what it is um so george is really good also so they're they're the ones i would say to follow if you want examples of what good content marketing is as well as kind of like uh marketing psychology hacks is what i would call them yeah this guy harry dry has some of the best stuff he's like she just basically takes landing pages and he goes this is why this is good and he's just very simple have you seen his his kanye west thing what did he do i remember something like that so ben pull this up go to go to the kanyeweststory.com i think that's what it's called so basically this is like a blog post that he just like tricked out it's like exhibit knocked on the door and was there to pimp his blog and uh maybe i got the domain wrong maybe it's not that it's the kanyestory.com yeah the kanyestory.com and uh it's basically this epic website blog post that's just like a scrolling story about the day he got in touch with kanye west and how it all went down and so it's like it starts with it starts with this like epic photo of kanye that you scroll and it's like a slide it's like from lying in bed with zero ideas to negotiating with the biggest superstar on planet earth and then it's got this little like outline on the left it's like the idea going viral coding it launching it reborn billboards yeezy and then this is those the chapters of this story and he just tells a great a very simple you know hustler story but i just love this like domain the way he designed this blog again this guy's an artist and i'm like i really respect him and when i come up with [ __ ] i think i like use him as one of my mood boards of inspiration of like something that i'll i'll copy or i'll steal uh inspiration from at the at the least this kid's amazing yeah he's he's 25 years old that was way off i think when we i want to do something i want to like launch something with this guy i don't know i i my new thing is like i find people who are just awesome and i find an excuse to collab with them and i would put both george and harry in that bucket all right your turn um all right we're gonna go with uh the pessimistic what's this called the pessimist what's the full one the pessimist archive that's what it's called uh the handle is like just pessimistic pessimistic arc uh so basically what it is is it's incredibly fascinating because it's a twitter handle that looks back at history and brings up topics that people complain about today so for example there's a um a tweet from november 16 1918 or a news article and it says i would rather spend the rest of my life in jail than wear one and it's talking about a guy who doesn't want to wear a flue mask and then there's another example of someone saying like uh oh here's a quote from martin luther king saying like you know there's too many books out there people are trying to write too much and become famous and it's basically he's talking about like influencers uh and it's kind of funny and then this is great there will be another one where it's like technology is just gonna kill our brains and they're like referring to like a telephone and so it's real and so if you read just the tweet part you would think that they're talking about now but then they show you a different year and then they show you a picture of the article and it's from a newspaper from the 1800s and so it's kind of cool because people complain about the same [ __ ] all the time and so you'll think like oh our country is more divided but divided than ever or like the wealth gap is like crazy or right it's like narratives that it's like yeah all those things could be true but like oftentimes people think it's worse than ever before and maybe that's not the case because people have been complaining about the same [ __ ] forever like okay there's one with school shooters and it's like um the you know these guys were addicted to books and they were reading these these gory books and that's why they shot up their like their local town instead of video games they're blaming like this uh the novel the dime novels whatever those are and it really and my takeaway here is to two things the first thing is that we react this oftentimes human beings react the same through for for centuries and if you study why people react the way they do you can begin to predict to predict this and so if i can if i figure out in history what have been some of the common reactions to action x y and z i can kind of look into the future and or at the present time being like okay i think people are going to react by doing like any blank because that's just how we're wired um the second thing that it does is it like brings you to like senses a little bit where you're like okay i need to be calm people have complained about this literally for 150 years and we're doing okay and uh so that's interesting and i was reading this book human nature by robert greene ben i don't know if you've read the snap maybe you could tell me but i'm almost positive somewhere in this book i that they said that one of the very first bits of written lang language that they found was of people complaining about the younger generation and how they aren't going to keep the cultures that the old or keep the traditions that the older generation has created you know what i mean it's this idea of like old people complaining about young people being lazy like one of the very first evident pieces of evidence of of of written language it was a story of complaining about that so anyway yeah i like seeing those patterns so that's mine yeah that's uh you know what's the phrase history doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes yes and uh that's that's like what this account is you know in a nutshell there's some really great ones on this i have a similar stash uh in my swipe file that i've been keeping for for years i kind of forgot to update it recently but it was called smart people saying dumb things and i would say anytime somebody who is clearly smart and successful said something that was very wrong so for example you know warren buffett uh was very very dismissive of like you know certain technologies what you know bitcoin today but before that you know internet and technology stocks um that he just didn't understand that he didn't understand them and so therefore made some disparaging comments or um like ray dalio predicting like a crisis in the 80s yeah or um you know steve ballmer laughing and saying you know when he's cackling and saying nobody will ever buy a thousand dollar phone like they just don't get apple you know apple will fail or whatever so i did that partly because there's like a in the moment there's like a junk food fun of it which is like ha yes wrong you know there's a joy when somebody's successful is pointed out to be very wrong about something but there's more than that the real reason i did it was to remind myself that like it's very easy to kind of go into hero worship mode and to idolize certain people or put them on a pedestal and just because you're smart in one thing doesn't mean you're smart in another or just because you're right a lot doesn't mean you're right all the time it's a very important lesson because i've made big mistakes like for example i think i've missed out i bought tesla stock very early on i think i bought it under a hundred dollars a share and i think if you uh if you adjust for the splits i think it's now over like five thousand dollars a share so i think i've i would have made about five million dollars on stock buy that i had really if i just held and um and the reason i didn't hold wasn't because i wanted to take profits it was because i got spooked by first there was like a lot of people at a given time that were called tesla q do you know about that uh was that the thing where they said that like the it's fake like their factories are fake but it's not that the factories are fake but that there's sort of like fraud deception that the fundamentals don't make sense and that tesla's going to go to zero josh wolfe the guy like spreading those yes exactly so josh so there was mostly anonymous accounts on twitter and reddit and so i had read it and i was like okay i always want to learn what is the other side i was so bullish on tesla this at this point tesla wasn't even anywhere near where it is today right um and so it was like okay you know tesla's gone from 90 a share where i bought it to 380 a share great but like you know i still think it's got a lot of room to run and and i was reading i always want to know what is the what do people who disagree with me say and what's their argument do i do i believe it and so i read it i was like ah there is some weird stuff like wow they've gone through 25 cfos like that sounds strange like why does the cfo keep leaving and like the people would have this like drone footage of like parking lots just full of teslas that they're taking like why are they stashing teslas in these parking garages look at this every car in this six door car garage is a tesla why is it here what are they are they faking deliveries and sales like what what is this so there was a lot of like wait there's fire was there any truth in any of this honestly or here's my honest take i actually think that there was a lot of truth to what was going on i think that and the reason why i say this is i don't think it's as bad as they said but i also don't think it's as good as tesla portrayed it meaning i think there actually was a period of time where tesla almost died where it actually almost did go bankrupt because um of like the combination of the production ramp up was going too slow they had the production line was not moving fast enough uh the subsidies were there but they could have gone away and like all this stuff and i think there was like a lot of um kind of like you know fake until you make it going on there and elon has even come out and said in the past he goes he was talking about when um when clean tech was big and the government was giving money to this thing was called solyndra or something like that and he came out and he said same thing happened with enron where it was like five weeks before it went under they were like not just saying everything's gonna be okay they were saying everything's better than ever and he eddie alon came out i was sort of like what do you want people to say he's like you know it is in the incentive of somebody of the captain of that ship to go down with the ship and the whole time be saying oh we're so close to our destination basically he was like they're never going to come out and say yeah we don't know we might not make it because then that will guarantee you don't make it because people will sell the stock it'll put so much negative pressure on the company it'll hurt the morale inside the company and so you can't ever come out and say i don't know we might not make it so you always have to say make it of course we're gonna make it we're thriving and like you just hope it actually comes true he said something to that effect in an interview once i read and i was like i feel like he's describing what actually was going on inside tesla that's amazing so anyways the long story short was i didn't believe it didn't believe it didn't believe it i was sort of like reading it but i didn't pull the trigger and then josh wolfe this guy's a very very smart guy successful vc not an anonymous twitter egg account who's like just shorting the stock and trying to like spread fear um he was really [ __ ] on it consistently for the course of a year and at some point i was like you know what will i regret more selling the stock now and taking my profit if i'm wrong or seeing all these signals and not like going with what seems to be a mounting amount of evidence how much did you buy guess what i was wrong tesla becomes elon becomes the richest man in the world tesla becomes a 600 billion dollar company i bought it at a 6 billion valuation or something crazy like that and so you know i missed out on a 50-100 x uh you know somewhere along the way and uh and so yeah i do regret i actually turned out to be wrong i would have regretted more of this scenario happening but it seemed improbable wait so you bought a hundred grand worth of tesla stock i didn't buy a hundred grand i think i bought like i don't know i don't even know what it was it wasn't 100 i don't think that was that's not what i was buying back then because this was like i was like 23 years old or something at the time it was a long time ago and basically i think i bought like 30 or 40 grand of the stock at a certain price and i because i remember doing the math and thinking okay they're valued at like five or six billion now what is ford and gm value okay they're valued at 25 billion okay on one hand that seems crazy that they're only five times less when they deliver like 200 times less cars but i was like i really think like the cars are gonna go electric that these old [ __ ] are never going to switch and he's got this like vertically integrated it's like actually a battery and energy company it's not even a car company and this was before self-driving because it wasn't so it was a good place yeah but you know if you get it wrong you get it wrong so egg on my face and by the way on this note of the the pessimist archive i saw this youtube video that was um i don't know if you heard about this a few years ago elon musk negotiated a very unique compensation package do you know about this uh yeah basically he gets some crazy bonuses if some crazy goals happened yeah so he had he had set up this thing where he gets absolutely his entire compensation was tied to the um the market cap of tesla and like it was at 50 billion i think at the time when he had done it and um it was like every 50 billion dollars increments he was gonna get more and so i was like if i get us to 100 billion then i get x i get i think he would get uh like one percent or two percent more of the company each time i i i i should have i don't know we're gonna talk with this i could have mapped it out but basically he was going to get a percentage more of the company for every 50 billion they go up in market cap as they also have to hit certain um like revenue and earnings uh at that time and he had no guaranteed income so basically if tesla just went from 50 to 99 billion he would get zero during that time and he had five years to do it and the top of the compensation plan was if they became a 600 billion dollar company then he was going to become like he was going to get this like he would own like 10 percent of whatever he would own some ridiculous amount that would get unlocked for him and he would be essentially the richest man in the world and there's all these there's this clip of uh what's his name andrew sorkin or whatever his name is the guy on cnbc fast money or whatever um of them they're outlining the plan and they're laughing they're just laughing at them they're like i don't even know why they included these tears like for tesla to get that would be uh there's no way and they're all laughing like there's no chance and they're like this is such a weird thing why did he do this and they're like basically laughing at him and saying how outrageous the top end of it was where it just made no sense it's like well to do that temple tesla would need to become like the fifth most valuable company in the world or third most valuable company in the world and they're like that's ridiculous but i guess you know aim high i guess no guaranteed compensation of any time of any kind at all he gets no salary cash bonus equity uh he only gets equity that that vests over time but only if he reaches uh these hurdle rates which are dare i say crazy so right now the company's worth 59 billion dollars they run at 50 billion dollar increments so if he gets the company to 100 billion you're just talking market capitalization not based on revenue now based on the number of production there's going to be two metrics at each step so the first step is he has to get the company to 100 billion dollars and reach these operational and adjusted ebitda and revenue number if he doesn't get either of them he gets nothing that's kind of a weird way to break it down based on he gets to 150 and has to hit the operational numbers i mean the market can be irrational so can't control that at each 50 billion dollar number he collects one percent of the company if somehow magically he would get the company to 650 billion dollars which is literally what the plan calls for if you can believe this uh he would collect the equivalent of about 55. what a million dollars in compensation otherwise he gets absolutely what if you get it to 650 billion dollars and then immediately and then sure enough he he's like i think he just hit it or he's about to hit that that last final thing and sure enough he's the richest man in the world now that's badass better on yourself i need to go back well if you're him all right i'm going to tell you a handle that would have helped you so you know who ryan holiday is definitely right yes uh ryan holiday is an author just kind of like a personality but mostly an author and he does stoicism stuff and i included him but i'm gonna actually tell you the one you should follow so i like ryan holiday because he's got these things that are not business related but help me in business and help me in life and so he's got five lessons from seneca seneca was a greek i actually don't know what he was uh he's a philosopher uh and so they are we suffer what was he i think he was greek i i didn't look it up it was roman ben thank you uh we suffer more imagination or five stoic lessons from seneca we suffer more in imagination than in reality associate only with people who improve you the greatest remedy for anger this is the best one the greatest remedy for anger is delay nice value your time more than your possessions and death is not in the distant future we are dying every day and he's got these amazing things that i love but he's got this other twitter handle called the daily stoic i love the daily stoic and they just like tweet out all these like interesting stoicism that's his right it's his brand it's his and it's incredibly useful this stuff is like it's one of the stoicisms one of the few philosophies that's like actively um it's practical and you could use on a daily basis and so i like following this account it reminds me to do certain things okay so correct me if i'm wrong so uh i had heard about stoicism from ryan holiday tim ferriss bunch of others so i go i buy meditations by marcus aurelius i sit down i start to read it and i'm sort of just trying to understand what the heck is this philosophy and there were some things i thought really cool like the tweet like that tweet you just read out those five principles like that resonates with me but there was like a part of it which was sort of like feel neither the highs nor the low it seemed almost like a philosophy and i think i'm wrong so i want you to correct me uh it seemed like a philosophy which was sort of like feel nothing yeah and i think that you're i feel nothing doesn't seem very fun why do i want to feel nothing so that's my big that's my actually a really good criticism in my opinion of stoicism and it's my criticism of stoicism which is a lack of joy and a lot of stoics this is me a steel arm steel manning by the way a lot of stoics will say um no like there's joy like if you read it differently there's room for joy or they never say you can't have joy and they're not wrong but oftentimes it's how to deal with pain and misery and the idea is basically you accept the fact that you're going to come into contact with a bunch of idiots all day who are going to want to hurt you and steal from you but that's okay you do like a negative visualization right you like imagine things going wrong which again just feels very not so fun for me and not the way i have not not that's not a formula that's worked for me in fact the exact opposite has worked for me that formula has worked for me actually so what i do is like all right today i've got cancer i can't get out of bed because i'm like harsh you do this every day i do it a lot or i'll be like look like like if i'm feeling sad i'll be like my i just got my leg cut off like i can't walk i wish i could run sports and then i'll be like wait a minute i have both legs i'm don't feel sick let's go celebrate and exercise or you know what i mean or like you know i'm happy my dog is not dead and i'll go and it makes me appreciate him yeah it's called negative visualization i think it's incredibly useful there's a there's this is this is to me so i will disagree with this there's a this to me is the argument of well there's kids starving in africa like in any given moment you could just sort of remember oh there's kids starving in africa this kid's starving in africa my boyfriend broke up with me well at least i'm gonna keep staring in africa and um and i i get the utility of it i've used it myself but in my experience i've learned that it's a bit of a roundabout way to a destination of gratitude and like you don't have to go to feeling the stress and the pain and the suffering of bad in order to feel the gratefulness around the good and so i found it i guess my personal experience has been i think it's a roundabout way to gratitude and like i might as well just go straight to gratitude don't need to uh don't need to think about all the bad things think about worry about all the bad things that could happen and go there this it's not been useful for me i remember like when i get a sore throat i always feel this way and when i get like a toothache i'm like i wish i could go back to the days where my tooth didn't hurt like if you had like a toothache is like the most pain you could be in or sometimes and i'm like i like you're like i i don't remember like sometimes it might if all the women who have given birth are like what the [ __ ] is good talking about well yeah but like i do think is the worst pain you could feel or like like in my like whenever i get earaches and toothaches i'm like you know it's like it's like this internal pain it's like i can't make the pain stop and i just have to deal with it until i have an appointment in three days and then you get like two days in and you're like i don't remember what it felt like to not feel this pain and so i got into the habit i'd be like i would be so thankful if i could if my throat didn't hurt today and i could just swallow food that would make me so happy and days when i don't i'm not sick i try to think back i'm like this is exactly what i wanted i wanted to feel happy that i'm not sick today and so i think about that stuff all the time so anyway ryan holiday and the daily stoic is a good follow you're up all right um by the way i know we didn't do stoicism justice for people who are like die-hards sorry uh people should look i don't think it is no emotions i think it's like more subtle than that but but that's a really good i think your criticism's great which is like i think it's what a lot of people run into getting excited and then they're like wait but wait is this what i want yeah it's like where's the room for fart jokes you know what i mean i'm gonna give you two niche experts they're in different niches but i like them okay so uh i should link their accounts here for you too uh this first guy i don't know exactly how you say his name his name is aviral bhatnagar uh and i'm gonna link you his twitter it's aviralbat and uh i'm gonna put it uh where do i put it i put on the sheet that we have okay you got it so this guy avi aviral bottnecker he is a venture capitalist in india and his blog is at juniorvc.com this guy puts out really really high signal stuff around what's going on in india um like for example he has a tweet that he put out yesterday or that was india now exports more software 133 billion then saudi arabia exports oil 113 billion we are the india is the largest engineering population in the in the world uh what an amazing story that's come come out over the last 40 years how did you find this guy this is the best this one's the best one though this is the most helpful one on the list yeah and so like i i do a lot of investing in indian startups and i was like okay if i'm gonna invest in a new startup i'm not on the ground i'm not the like local domain expert so what did i do i invested in a fund i became an investor in somebody else's fund that's india focused i was like okay cool i'm gonna get insights from him and i can bounce any deal off him to see if he wants to participate and maybe he has a local view that i don't understand and then this was another guy that i thought was really smart so i wanted to find who i wanted to basically see who's the thought leader in that space and then how do i subscribe to them and so his um you know his like blog i think has 50 000 subscribers now so he's not like you know no name uh but he's very niche and he talks about kind of like the indian tech scene and what's going on you know at a macro level whatever so i found this guy to be i think he's doing a really good job of content creation so i'm going to pick this guy in one niche is there such a thing as this for china uh i'm sure there is actually this is a good idea i should just um like find this person for like vladim for europe you know for different parts of europe and for for india for china and for australia maybe um so if there is none be this guy this guy is a valuable position to become super valuable there's this guy named bill bishop i think his name is bill bishop had a newsletter uh called steinism i think it's called you know what i'm talking about no um cyno cynocism i don't know what that means uh cynicism um s-i-n-o-c-i-s-m for a long time he was the most popular guy on sub-stack and his entire newsletter is it's called get smarter about china and he just tells you about the business of china and you can see all the latest trends coming out of china it would be a really great arbitrage to do by the way if you yeah instead of trying to compete in the same pond as everybody else like go provide a really useful bridge into one specific market or one specific geography um like i i i've told the story before i think but like one of the most influential people in my life was this teacher named lisa keister at duke university and she taught this class called getting rich and her story was she graduated what was the name of the class the name of the class yeah did everyone take that it was it was one of the hardest classes to get into because it was a great name great title right so you already know this person's not just like every other professor like she understands like her customer her market the second thing was she was the highest rated professor on like ratemyprofessor.com and greatest thing she had a chili pepper next to her name so she was like hot too it was like oh it was everything so i i wake up at five in the morning we go to the library to get on the highest speed internet connection and as soon as the course listings open up we like jumped on it and we got into this class and i go in and she was she tells her story she goes actually i was a student at duke 10 years ago or 11 years ago whatever it was she goes i graduated with a degree in mandarin because that's just what was interesting to me and at the time everybody was making fun of me actually she was older than this now but she had started teaching back when she was like 32 or something now she might be 42 or 50 or something like that but she goes i graduated with this degree all my like friends were like good luck with that you know how's that mandarin degree gonna kind of help you out get a job here because i'm a i'm gonna go to med school i'm gonna be a lawyer i'm gonna be a consultant like what are you gonna do with that chinese degree and she's like well i bet i can get a job in china like what and so she bought a one-way ticket just goes to china and she just starts waving her hand she's like hey people in china like i know english i know companies in the west um and i would love to learn about you and then be a bridge and she became a bridge basically between companies in china and companies in america if an american company wanted to do business china they would do it through her because she like could translate the not just literally the language but like she knew who to talk to she became like the local expert there she be and this like to me this guy on twitter he's my bridge and knowing what's going on in the scene in india and so what her story was she made a killing doing that because it was really valuable companies in china really wanted to do business with the companies in the west then she invested all of it in the tech and the tech stock market because she was like oh i can tell tech companies are the ones that are doing well she and then right before the bubble burst she pulled it all out to be like i want to do real estate now and she just timed it perfectly accidentally invested all in real estate from 2000 2008 right before the real estate crash happened she took it out again because she just wanted to do something else with her life and basically by 32 was retired and like you know uh was like what i want to do i want to go teach and teach kids what i wish i knew back then how wealthy she got i think she made like you know a few million dollars at least and like you know probably like five seven million dollars and like um you know she wants she lives in in durham and she teaches at school i mean i have no idea so what was the class totally i'm totally guessing so the class was basically was you know like ramit sethi was like personal finance which is like she's like you probably need she wanted to teach what she wished she learned when she was in school so she's like i wish they taught you about how to manage money so she would show us like the power of compound interest over time like why you should save early and versus saving more money when you're 30 versus saving even a little bit of money when you're 20. and then like what is a mortgage and like how does that work and like then so and then every other class you would just invite in someone who made it like someone who's successful financially but doing a completely different thing just to expose you to like look there's like 50 pats dude this is like this podcast pretty much yeah one would be this girl who started a t-shirt company licensing university logos and she would tell her story then she got jamie diamond on the phone and like jimmy diamond is like you know the head of whatever stanley or whatever uh and like then she had this hedge fund guy from san francisco come out and he's like yeah here's what he's like he surveyed the room he goes do you guys use uh microsoft or apple products and there and people are answering he goes uh he asked like three questions and we were like why did you ask that he goes because then i'm only gonna make one decision this year and it's whether to invest like hundreds of millions of dollars into apple or not and um and he's like so all i'm doing is i'm just trying to figure out what is the right decision on that and i was like whoa that's a job that's a that's epic and he he had said in his when he was in the class he goes by the way uh all you guys are gonna just have the same resume he goes you're all trying to do the same thing you're all trying to get grades and then like these internships he's like so the first three fourths of your resume think about it it's gonna look the same as everybody else in this room like i'm not really going to be able to tell the difference he goes the only thing that's going to differentiate any of you is that bottom section where it's called other like other interests he's like so at this school everybody's going to teach you to like work on that top three fourths of the resume in reality you should be working on the bottom the bottom one fourth of that resume because that's what guys like me look at everybody's got a degree everybody's got good grades everybody went to a good school i've never have i told you about the bottom fourth of the resume no what is that that's so funny that you you even use that fraction i always tell my when when i own the company i would say i just care about the bottom fourth i'd always say just temp this wow and i would always say that and i'd be like one of the greatest people ask me how do you find good writers i was like well here's one really easy way ask them about the bottom fourth and they go what do you mean i was like well just it didn't matter what they studied in school ask them um okay so you majored in philosophy what's your favorite uh philosophy class or favorite philosophy teacher and if they can't tell me a story about something that they spent four years and hundreds of thousands of dollars on then they're just not going to be a good writer because they're not interesting enough right and so i would always ask about the bottom fourth of the resume for all types of roles because i'm like if you're just if you can't entertain me for this conversation and then you just don't have any passion and i don't want to be around you right that's amazing okay so maybe this becomes one of the the core frameworks that's a you know one one person saying it that's just a dot two people saying hey that's a line i interviewed uh i got that from uh gold brian goldberg who founded uh bustle and he has this amazing article and he says it's headlined losers exist stay away from them and it's basically like how to only hire winners it's from pando from years and years ago and he's a brilliant writer but he doesn't write anymore because he's kind of a loose cannon but it was titled losers exist how to avoid them and it talks about uh one of the best ways to ask about the bottom fourth and if you're you're a loser if you can't like be passionate about something that you spent four years studying ah no dude this article is gone it's is it panda you know like pando died let me see if there's a cache version there is a cache version uh okay we're back in luck the headline is losers exist don't hire them yeah awesome um okay let's do uh let's do a couple more i'm gonna give a couple quick ones uh okay this other person who i think is a niche expert is this guy willy woo do you follow him no i'm looking him up now i'm following all these people the the indian guy is the best one so far but let's look at willy woo yeah i don't think you'll like this one because it's very crypto specific but this guy willy woo is i think the leading crypto analyst and um you know in most things like these people who analyze charts and stuff like that they're like it's a little bit like horoscopy they're like oh look the trend is going this way and like if you draw this t shape it's going to be the iron cross pattern and like you know so bye bye bye and um in crypto there's one unique thing which is that all the data is there's a lot more transparency all the you know everything that's happening is happening on a chain on a public blockchain so you can actually go analyze it so like he looks at all these metrics that are like um you know he won't just look at the price for example there's things like what is the actual average buy-in price because it's one thing for the price to go up or for people to like not be selling because they bought it in 2013 and they you know their cost basis was like five dollars and your cost basis now is 50 000 so it looks at like what the actual price people buying in what is the average price people bought in for and that tells you like if it's low versus the actual price you're like okay um you know it's mostly you know it's mostly just same coins and old hands versus if it's higher you realize that people are buying in at the current price levels and that's pulling the average up um and so there's there's a whole bunch of things like that like um coin age like um are old coins moving meaning like if og believers start selling that's kind of a signal like it's like when a ceo starts selling their stock it's like wait why are you selling your stock that doesn't seem quite right um what's the reason and so like when a bunch of old hands start selling that's actually a signal that comes before the price changes it may not even affect the price yet but it's an indicator of something to come damn all right i just follow them so this guy's got all kinds of analysis and he's a lot more reasonable so crypto is full of especially crypto twitter is full of like just propaganda artists and they're good at it they're like they will make you believe that some random [ __ ] nft is the hottest [ __ ] because it's like one guy controlling 55 bot accounts and they're all replying to every tweet that uses the word you know art with like a link to their freaking project there's so much propaganda there's so much noise and there's so many like just believers who if you say if i if i just go out there to say and i say my price prediction for 2022 is six six million dollars a coin um i'll get a bunch of attention because people want to believe that number's going to keep going up and so this guy is a lot more reasonable like he's still obviously a big believer he's super bullish on bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general but he grounds it at least in like real analysis and i find that to be quite valuable all right i follow them i think that's cool is he what what does he like actually make predictions yeah he'll make predictions but it's not he's not like he doesn't get just like intoxicated which is prediction after prediction it's more like let me explain the way things are moving and then when a move happens he'll explain what actually happened who actually was it a big one whale dumping was it a lot of old hand selling what's causing this bear market he'll say look there was actually a lot of leverage in china and those got liquidated and that's what drove the price down and like you could get an explanation for like what otherwise feels like pretty arbitrary price movements damn that's badass all right let me give you one um rohin dwar i actually don't know how to spell rohin's last name or say robertine's last name it's d-h-a-r so this guy uh founded this company called priceonomics you remember pricinomics yes i've followed this guy this guy's good okay so he's interesting price in amex was interesting we actually recruited a bunch of people from there and i love that company i don't know if it's really around anymore but it's just a blog but his new like started as a side hustle now it's kind of like a full-time thing and i actually showed you two examples even silly's commenting on it and this guy he owns i think 12 or 10 or eight somewhere in that eight to 12 range he owns eight single family homes uh in new mexico in california hawaii wherever and you can go and look and he'll kind of show you where they are and i'll show pictures of them and he'd rent him out on airbnb and sometimes when his kids are on vacation or not school he'll go and stay in his homes and he reveals all of the numbers and all of the updates so on december 6 he tweeted these are my monthly mortgage payments on each of the homes in my small portfolio vacation rentals uh another one is he'll say like you know currently we're seeing this type of occupancy rate and we actually just added a surfboard to our house in hawaii and we noticed that we could get more money for it or something like that and he takes screenshots and he shows all of the revenue that he's making as well as how much money things have cost uh cost him to buy and he'll even do things like recently he posted a couple listings he's like i think i could turn this into an airbnb and he'll just like link to the redfin house listing and he's like i think i can get these numbers so it's actually really cool to see him in real time make it all happen yeah i like this this is awesome uh i didn't realize that he was doing this this is it's kind of new yeah he's been at it for a while he's been at it for now his new stick he's doing it for six years but he doesn't think he was i don't think he was as public about it he wasn't as public about it he was not as public about it but now he's like all in on it and it's so fun uh it's a really fun handle to follow because sometimes his properties are like a quarter of a million and he puts down 20 so he puts down or sometimes even less i think so he'll put down like 40 or 50 000 on these properties and that's pretty attainable for a lot of people and so it's kind of interesting right um okay i have a okay let's do a couple funny ones um okay have you heard of this account james friedman it's fjme0013 uh what is it on this list no so what is it james friedman james fridman or i don't know maybe it's friedman but it's f-r-i-d f-r-i-d-m-n uh no who uh so he is uh he's got two million followers he's definitely popular he's the photoshop guy so basically people will photoshop like uh hey james my boyfriend's wearing this calvin klein photo the same camouflage t-shirt and every um and every photo that we i take with them can you just remove the the logo of calvin klein and then like he he does the request but he doesn't it's not actually just photoshopping it he makes it hilarious so like it's very visual so you know you need like youtube to be able to see what i'm saying here but like he photoshopped the the his guys wearing calvin klein shirt of like it you know just says across the chest calvin klein jeans and uh so he like photoshopped it with that ripped off so that little section ripped off now you can just see his chest and uh so it's like it actually like [ __ ] up the photo it doesn't make it good like the girl wants uh and it says calvin klein tattooed on his chest now instead of on the shirt um and so it's like uh like people will just be like you know um you know we here's my wedding photo uh but we forgot to wear a mask during our wedding photos can you photoshop a mask on instead of photoshopping a covered mask he'll put like you know the green mask from jim carrey's like the mask on their face so it's just like people request it and then he does the like he does the request but he does it wrong in a way that they're not happy with um they'll be like you know my my arms look too big here and then he'll make them like absurdly tiny or whatever and so it's just hilarious like followers he's like i look funny with one arm and then so he just or you can't see my other arm so it looks funny with just one arm and so he just deletes the the second arm so the person's armless yeah exactly uh and i think he has like a book or something like called the joy of photoshop it's it says uh asking the wrong guy for help this is awesome this is cool i've never seen this i'm gonna follow him uh you wanna go do a few more quick funny ones uh yeah let's do another one uh we have a friend nikita beer he's pretty funny in like the tech world um what do you think his account hilarious he's a [ __ ] yeah i'm actually amazed that he does some of the stuff that he does and that's why i like them well it's kind of like the donald trump rule right which is like you say one offensive or weird thing um you know you're canceled but you say all offensive and weird things uh you're you get like you know you get the pass how did you get away with it that's that's the key is like if every post makes fun of something that's cool if only one does then you're an [ __ ] all this stuff is making fun of something so i think it's a great follow and his profile picture is hilarious yeah his profile picture is uh is good um all right we want to do one more um yeah okay i like this one i don't know if you know this guy i don't think you do i don't know if you'd be interested in him his name is harala bob what's he do so haraldabob's story is kind of crazy he's a crypto guy so he's he's actually he's transitioned from being the the one thing guy to the next thing guy to the next guy okay so he started off he got famous because he was this big sports bettor and he famously one year and i think the year 2000 like just absolutely raked it in in vegas because he found an arbitrage that he could bet on and he just like milked it and he realized that like i think it was something he's had a few of these where he bis phase he finds he would find inefficiencies in the sports betting market and that's how he made like millions of dollars so he found like one year that what they would do is um let's say that they would have an over under a total points for a game and let's say it's 200 points for the game um now vegas is like weirdly accurate with over unders like they will get it like so spot-on it'll come down to like the last possession and like it'll flip over or under so they're very good at doing that it doesn't seem like there's much inefficiency there but like in basketball what happens is that the first half of basketball you just play and then you go to halftime but at the end of the game there's often this situation where the losing team will start fouling the winning team to like stop the clock make them shoot free throws and then try to like they're trying to make threes while the other team can only shoot two freezers at a time so what it led to was that the second half had more points than the first half but vegas had this small bet called the they would take the over under and it would say you can bet the first half over under it it was just dividing it by two so it's like dividing the total by two so the total was always really accurate but the the first half over under was underpriced it was oh it was like too frequently too uh too high so he was just betting the under so he'd find these like little inefficiencies certain refs are really foul prone um and so he would know that okay when that ref is reffing this game that team is gonna score more than their normal average and so he he would analyze the refs when nobody was analyzing the refs and he would just bet for a whole season on just the refs um and he actually unco i think he figured out before the nba uncovered that that ref tim donahue was like cheating basically because like it was always weird [ __ ] happening on that guy's games uh and and so i i'm paraphrasing because he doesn't like totally out his whole strategy but like he's talked about it before like you know the lakers in one year were undervalued in a way and so he was able to bet them so he made millions of dollars doing that and i think he then he became um then he gets hired by an nba mark cuban hires him to be his like secret weapon for the maps yeah but he only worked there for a few days right no he worked there for like a year or two and then he famously you know left or slapped left slash got fired this year he left but like an article came out saying everybody in the company hates parallel bob because he has mark cuban's ear and like you know he has too much power for like his like random position as special advisor and stuff like that that made him seem like this like master puppeteer and whatever he left uh and now he's like big time and he's been he's been big time into crypto recently and so he's just like at the intersection of all my interests like sports betting poker gambling nba games and like nba personnel stuff franchise management and now crypto and so i just think this guy's like kind of a baller degenerate gambler type of dude and he kind of looks like a [ __ ] so i like him automatically and he's not afraid to talk [ __ ] because he's not like employed by you know somebody or whatever uh so you know he uh he basically like um he's kind of like a one-man band which i think is great i think those people tend to be the most interesting because they could speak their mind and he's kind of like a [ __ ] degenerate gambler type so he's got you know the sense of humor that you find when you run in those circles which is like you know part like smart alec because you're just like actually really [ __ ] smart and clever and you're finding like the edges uh but also part [ __ ] where you're just like you don't mind just making fun of people and calling them dumb this episode turned into like the slumdog millionaire of um twitter where like we name we named ten things and then a super in-depth story on each one and why it's interesting yeah yeah that's true actually it's more about their backstories than their twitter i think it's going to be cool um ben what do you think are people going to dig stuff like this people are gonna love it people love lists like sean said we sold out but you know what this is a good thing to sell out for because it's a good episode we um we had one title the other day either was the title or is the thumbnail like they used a thumbnail that i looked stupid or a title that made me sound like an idiot and i was like ben i don't like that he goes oh you thought that selling out to the algorithm was going to feel good [Laughter] yeah i had them change the title also for the hassam hassabinaj episode it came out it was like reveals all his comedy secrets and i was like i don't even we didn't even talk about that like we didn't he didn't even talk about his comedy secrets and uh you know i feel like that's a guest i'm trying to look cool with man you kind of like making me look dumb in front of my friend i'm trying to look cool with so can we like change that like you can make me look dumb but don't make me look dumb in front of somebody who i care about are you guys friends now uh yeah we're buddies that's great that's that's pretty i feel like that's a big a big thing right like you're you're friends with like a guy who's almost a hero almost a hero a strange description well like i don't know i didn't know how much you looked up to him but i knew you looked up to him a lot okay there's there's definitely like a part of it which i think uh you know is kind of like the embarrassing part of anybody where it's like you know like i find it really embarrassing when people see a celebrity and they [ __ ] lose their mind and they go and they like take a photo with them and they like ask them for an autograph like can you please write your name on this piece of paper like i mean it's a real like [ __ ] move if you think about it it's very strange you know if i had my memory wiped and i came back into society i'd be like well you just did what like you know why did you use yourself that's how i used to think when i would see people with like trump flags or any other politician flag or they're like his face i'm like it's kind of weird to have a grown man's face all over your body yeah exactly and then like you know i fanboy about ufc and [ __ ] like that i get super excited so there's you know there's still people that like i still can fanboy about so there's definitely that part of it which is like oh it's kind of cool that someone someone that's kind of famous is like your friend but that wears off after like i don't know 10 seconds um or at least for me i'm like this is like a lame feeling um the thing i like is that he actually is super helpful like uh he asked released a question like first of all we was like okay let's take let's take uh his career and my career completely out of it if you have a conversation with this person do you like them do you get along like do you do they say interesting things or is it just boring same old same old commentary that everybody has like no dude's super interesting has really good questions that has cool opinions then the second part of it is um are you gonna like like i told you this framework which is good friends consume together great friends create together and so i told them i said dude a dream of mine is to like do like a 10-minute comedy set someday like i just think that would be such a thrill such a challenge you know like that's one of the few things that i can make you know make me you know nervous or scared it's gonna help is the idea of doing that and so he like i didn't even ask him for help i would never like i wouldn't really ask for help like dude your time's a lot more valuable than helping me with my like hobby dream you know um like yeah i'm that like kind of out of shape guy who wants to wear the jersey and dribble up and down the court in madison square garden like yeah i want that but like you don't need to help me but he has he texts me like really interesting kind of like the stuff i'm you know you know i'm a nerd about which is like frameworks kind of like techniques tactics of like okay what's behind the laugh the laugh doesn't just happen you know like there's a there's like there's there's a there's a way to consistently recreate the laugh how do you do that and so he's been sharing some ideas with me and so you have to ask him be like can i share this tweet or can i share this text i did ask him i was like dude you should charge for this like this is unbelievable he's like he's like hey don't share my [ __ ] i was like okay i'll go to the grave with it and then b so i haven't told nobody no not even not even my right-hand man i don't don't don't even let him take a peek then the second part was uh he's like you know there's like this feeling in like a comedy and like acting which is like you could teach it but like if you teach it that's sort of like this like signal of like i couldn't do it so i became that acting teacher in you know new york or whatever and i think there's that same thing in tech which is like are you like teaching it because you like you couldn't make it as the operator i think there is that stigma in tech as well but much less so because in tech people figured out if i start blogging about my [ __ ] and tweeting about my [ __ ] i get my reputation goes up i get better deal flow i get to invest in better more badass companies it's like actually strategic right and it's not like that versus like a fallback plan well i'm very eager sean to hear about your friendship with with this famous comedian [ __ ] you [ __ ] you for doing that congratulations i'm making a new friend to tell you a text on why that was funny yeah for some of us it's natural yeah dissect that buddy all right that's the episode [Music] you

and how did you get good like when did you go from suck to non-suck like because everybody starts i believe that suck that's like the pixar way i don't know if you've heard this before pixar is a philosophy which is all movies start at suck our job is to like remove the suck yeah so there's non-suck left at the end yeah yeah so i took that approach man the daily show changed my life man seeing the way jon stewart worked and especially that institution both daily show and snl love them hate them they're part of their comedy institutions snl for 50 years now a daily show 25 you know that um are these pedigree boot camps for understanding the process about how to think about comedy right and one of the things that i realized is what john taught me and trevor showed me you know john really unlocked the code but it's like it's all about your take what is your take and being able to back it up so it's not even being funny first it's what is the take what am i trying to say what is the take what am i philosophically artistically trying to say and um let's give an example you had in the show last night you're like you met this guy who's a private equity guy you're like what the [ __ ] is that yeah he's like oh yeah we do like lbos you're like yeah yeah what is the leverage we'll as you get to the bottom of your like so you use other people's money to buy other people's companies and you ruin the people's lives in them by firing them and gutting them making them profitable and then you flip it to somebody else yeah you're like yeah i'm not cool with that like yeah i think that's a little bit of a [ __ ] up way to win is to like yeah this is kind of like vulture just legal stealing yeah yeah yeah yeah that was never your money yeah also it's it's it's stealing well it's legal oh just just because legal doesn't mean it's ethical right you know bill cosby got off legally right we all know what it is and so like that is what the joke i would start with that's my take around leverage buyouts and vulture funds right then you start tagging it you can do that bill cosby tag he got off legally it's not right you know we all know it's on ethical what he did or whatever the glove didn't fit o.j yeah right right so you must go ahead okay um and then you start tagging and then the funny just starts flowing from there and then you go that's like this and then you can just what are you doing you're sitting in a room with like a few people you're just spitballing riffing bantering just like that yeah and then eventually you got to put pen to paper right and you got to start writing the act one and you start to see when i watch weekend update or when i see an act one on the daily show or any of those desk segments i now see the matrix i now see oh i know how to construct a seven and a half minute piece right last week tonight patriot act i know how to do a 27 minute piece on it right i know the beats and the flow of that and what was really cool was it just gave me that um that central kind of like philosophy how do i do this and so the first 10 11 12 years of my career i was just trying to be funny and what john in 2014 really helped me unlock was like no no you need to have like um there needs to be an actual process and purpose to what you do now i'm not saying this as a virtue thing no just you just need to be like even if you're doing dick jokes or even if you're being silly there needs to be you need to understand the game and how to heighten it comedically right even stupid silly jokes you know are are like that and so um that was the unlock for me and then just reps trying to get as good as possible now my my next thing that i'm just working on the most is the jazz part of it like yo just have fun that's always been one of my weaknesses because like i told you like i'm a kumon kid you're structured and so and so we're so built around fear and so there's these moments that i try to have on stage i don't know if you saw us it's like i'm just kind of unhinged like the first like three or four minutes of the set when i'm just i'm literally just riffing yeah when i was making fun of the kids shorts there was a kid in the front row of the show just short shorts yeah the eyes were just like all up on the chair and then like the seats in the back and you know seeing people come in late and then riffing off of that it's pure jazz now jazz has structure but there's also play right and then you can go back to it and like it's that organized chaos that i'm trying to like start to tap into

what's the system you've developed to get on stage and have that switch flipped because when you came on within two seconds it's like this guy's in a state of mind he's in a state as we say yeah of like he's here to perform he he knows what he's here to do yeah there's no like tiptoeing into it yeah so i was wondering what do you do the five ten minutes before or an hour before i don't know what's your kind of like warm-up routine yeah yeah i think you're ready three hours before what i do is i like to do some form of exercise and i try to get out of my workout workout or you're just trying to break a sweat what are you what's that yeah trying to do on tour it's just about body maintenance so i'll do running i'll do some pull-ups some core stuff just stuff to get my body going right and start breaking a sweat and what i love about like right around minute 30 to 45 is i'll get out of my head and into my body and so much of life right now getting out of your head and it's funny i i called you randomly i was appreciate i appreciate you picking up the phone the other day we had a long conversation we can get into that later but so much of i think what you do and what you put out in the world and i call it like tech twitter talk it's all in your head intellectual it's all just heady anxiety-inducing stuff ethereum's up just solana's this it's like it's all headshit right it's not a body feeling thing right like grounding yourself two feet on the ground i'm here in this moment what do i do and so much of performance and to be great at it the best chappelle the best performers they're not in their head they're in their body they're really there right somebody screams somebody says something somebody heckles they're in their body when you watch steph curry play when i watch devin booker play these guys are so in their body right luca is the best at this he's in his body he's in the he's in flow right and so luke is like a kid and kids do this well yeah kids do this pretty naturally i love that the older you get the more heavy you get which is you gotta yeah you gotta fight that right and so that's a great way to get out of my head get into my body then i'll probably i eat something um i take a shower and then i put i put on the outfit and for me it's like being on stage uniform and putting on that it feels like a uniform and like for me it feels i wanted to feel like a show like from the watch to the jacket to the pants i'm like there's a level of confidence that you have when you move into a room and you're like hey from from my heels all the way up to my head i'm wearing my armor right like i'm coming correct right and you just you carry yourself with a little bop you're like no i feel better about myself my [ __ ] isn't slouching there's no stains on my stuff you know what i mean like the moment i saw you today you walked in you're wearing your tech pants i could tell you washed them a few times but there's some stains on the back side you know what i'm saying but that feeling of like no man when i'm coming in here i'm gonna be fresher than sean yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm just gonna be fresh yeah that already gives me a feeling of like confidence i know what i'm doing you know and and by the way the opener marcela like marcella was just like dressed to the nines you know this is it's a feeling then i get to the show um i finish eating i'll meditate so meditation for 10 to 15 minutes allow me to just again get out of my head and drop into my body and something simple just head space like i'm not getting too crazy about it um and what i love about head space specifically is so much of it is just basic breathing establishing a level of intention i'll meditate then i'll pray and for me like prayer is really important because it's got to be about something bigger than just myself and my corporal being i'm like what am i doing this for and just establishing an intention and for me the intention is like love let me give joy to people right and i want the seed of everything that i'm doing to come from that not be like not be petty energy angry energy um i'm gonna prove you wrong energy like i'm in the laughter business like i'm here to make you feel joy right um and that warm feeling so establishing an attention there i get to the i'll get to the venue about an hour before i have a double shot of espresso um i'll let my bowels do what they do you always get those jitters like you gotta pee you gotta do what you gotta do and then about like 30 to 45 minutes before i like to be loose just with the with the staff right let them know like hey what's up how are you door guy security guy openers right you know what i mean another way to get out of your head by the way yeah yeah be with others be there yeah they're serving others in a way yeah and then um about a half an hour before um i'll go to my green room i usually write it down i'll write down it'll just be on hotel notepad paper hey what are a couple new tags that i'm working on tonight right just move the ball forward a little bit remind myself yo i'm gonna do this um for example last night one of the things i talk about act one of the show was fertility and a new joke that i did was like you know what it's like being infertile as a man i felt like woody and toy story when his arm got ripped off that was a that was just one line and i was like hey make sure you do the woody toy story line right you know and uh every show i try to add a few of these extra moments and you add that up over the course of like a year two years three years you start to see what works and what doesn't work and i'll i'll have a thousand three thousand different variations of that right and then i get on stage and by the time i get on stage there's just this feeling of like now it's just pure play whatever happens happens right and um when i'm on stage what i try to do is i try to remember when when i'm opening in front of my crowd they're like really hot and one of the things i try to remember is don't yell don't scream try to actually bring them to you like set the tempo of the game right don't get like too excited or too hot like you can whip them up but then like sit down at the stool bring them to you and like make the room feel like it's coming to you you know what i'm saying do you ever watch uh film of yourself basically yeah i watch tape all the time yeah and so i see bad habits it's kind of brutal huh yeah yeah but it's cool though actually like those moments where you like is very painful for your ego but there's a lot of growth in that the only way to break through and get to like the next part is is that part

already past i think a hundred thousand views it's crazy so their tick tocks are their tick tock account is blowing up just by taking our content and just chopping it up and then the guy who did the like south park looking cartoon thing that was amazing amazing this it's a young guy named corey who's i i followed his account and he's got like hundreds of thousands of views on a handful of videos and he launched the videos and like within a day or two he had all these views it's wild and then the guy who does the cartoon thing i think he's launching a business and we are his first right right because i followed his twitter account he had zero it was like zero zero yeah so that's yeah anyways five grand go go take our content turn it into clips uh let it go viral and uh yeah everybody wins um all right i've got a few interesting things you've got many interesting things you should go first i have it's just straight fire uh we we might need to split it up into multiple segments or multiple episodes because i just got too much fire for one day i know what the first one is and i think we should start with that okay so i wanted to bring this up there's we had talked about this in the past but this is a story about miss excel so her name she calls herself miss excel and i don't know if you've ever seen her i don't think you're a big tick tock guy but i am i had seen this person going viral on tick tock and basically it's a woman who puts out like microsoft excel tips and tricks like little hacks like oh you know how your um things are always like poorly formatted just put pushed like you know command g uh when you're hovering over the column and look it auto formats everything perfectly or like do you know what a vlookup is you do this this and this and boom you can find anything so she basically puts out these little clips on tiktok but it's not just the content like the way she does it it's like what works on tick tock it's like cute cute girls dancing humor like these are the things that like work on tick tock and so she does that she's like she'll put a song like that's like a trending song on tick tock um she'll dress up she'll be she'll have the screen screen share behind her and she's kind of overlaid on top of it and then she's showing something funny that's like something that's happening she's explaining it quickly and in an entertaining way so she's uh she's here's her story she's a consultant um kind of a boring job she was a consultant and she decided you know there's a lot of consultants and bankers that if you watch the music cell they won't touch a mouse like they just use a keyboard like a wizard and like they could just do everything just by hitting like shortcuts and macros on their on the keyboard in excel there's actually a lot of people that could do this who used to work at bcg basically they had a mouse with like a wired mouse that was clearly cut the cord was cut and they like it was like in a frame on the wall and they're like that's what you're gonna do here the mouse that's what this needs to look like you don't use the mouse exactly uh and i don't know how any of this works but uh i've definitely seen a bunch of friends who can do this they it's kind of amazing when they're doing it so she basically took that idea and started turning into interesting clips so she starts off and she tells a story where she's like you know um i wanted to like try making some content and uh you know tick-tock i felt embarrassed because like isn't tick-tock like for kids and like it's just like the silly thing to do i shouldn't i shouldn't make a ticket on account i'm a consultant and then her gut was like you should do a tick tock and so she listens to her gut she makes a tick tock and pretty quickly i think within the first week or so she goes viral with one or two clips and she gets over like a hundred thousand views and she's like holy [ __ ] this is awesome and so she does it again and she does it again and then she starts to she's like buys a little ring light and gets a green screen so that it looks a little bit better and she does it again she gets a video that gets a million views and it's like wow this is amazing and so she starts branding herself amazing branding by the way miss excel like she is the one she is the excel woman and um and so i thought that was great and so she she starts doing this and she's getting popular but she's not making any money and uh she reaches or who what happened morning brew reaches out they're gonna do a future story on her and they're like oh we want to feature you and at the same time a business coach reached out to her and was like hey i saw you have this like really great following i think your your content is super unique um you know and she was like yeah it's great i'm going to be featured on morning brew they're like awesome like what do you have to sell she's like i don't sell anything it's all free content and they're like if you're going to get featured you should have something to sell and she's like okay challenge accepted you're right i'm going to make a course and so she decides to make a course she's never done it before and i think she had like something like two weeks or something to like pull this whole thing off and she rushes to do it now let's fast forward to today she is making courses and she is making six figures a month off this thing so she's making single digit millions a year she has a few days of the year where she's made six feet over a hundred thousand dollars on a day in course sales that's kind of like her black friday um or black friday special or whatever where she where she sold her course and so she's doing millions of dollars a year and she's working towards million a million dollar month that's like her goal i want to hit a million dollars a month as miss excel and she is like microsoft loves her they're like pumping her up um you know she's featured in business insider she's featured in like buzzfeed she's featured in a whole bunch of places because this great story she's featured on this podcast right now and so she is doing amazing what i love about this is she quits her job as a consultant she now works 15 hours a week unless she's making a course like but just like a normal thing she's doing 50 hours a week she has one employee which is an overseas virtual assistant her cost structure is that overseas virtual assistant which i'm guessing is making something like six to ten dollars an hour so you know probably paying them like 500 a month ballpark plus uh she pays 97 for thinkific which is the course platform and she pays a video editor to um to edit the videos for the course so like all in all her expenses are probably like sub fifteen hundred dollars maybe some two thousand dollars at the time and um she's making six figures a month so she's profiting um you know at least a hundred thousand dollars a month uh doing this thing and um there was a whole bunch of like different little nuggets in there that i liked but that's the the overall story quick quick reaction to that amazing i don't think it's gonna maybe it will last maybe that was that was my initial instinct i was like awesome run but like you know who knows if this is here two years from now and then i changed my mind when i kind of read her read a little bit more about her here's what i liked okay so we had talked about excel way back maybe a year ago when i when we were talking about i was going to create a course and we had done a deep dive of what are the best courses it's always excel microsoft excel is always on the top if you go to teachables top courses udemy's top courses learning to master excel is always in the top like 10 earning courses and you think it's hard to be the one but it's a topic people will pay for anker from teachable he's got a he's a good twitter follow he uh tweets out some of the biggest earners he won't explicitly say who they are but he'll say one earner we just paid their you know they just crossed 20 million in in revenue or in like earnings and then he'll also say like the top course is this excel thing so you can kind of like triangulate it exactly and on udemy i think i was able to do this as well i was able to search and sort for the top best-selling courses and excel was in the top as well that's amazing and so i think excel has real demand then the question is who's gonna be the best brand in the excel space and she's the horse i would pick so um why do i think that first is her content is fundamentally better she took the most um she has the best type of funnel so what's her top of funnel strategy it's highly exciting quick hitting snack sized tick-tock videos tick-tock itself is like the crack cocaine of content right like 10 seconds video um with music overlaid that is crack cocaine for content and she's using that for excel when all the other excel creators are like bloggers and [ __ ] like that it's like a stale old thing then her brand and her personality miss excel good-looking woman who understands how to do content and um and she i know she understands the content she says she's a little bit when i was researching her she is really into some of the [ __ ] i'm into that's really like kind of like off the beaten path so she was like yeah she's like most people when they think of content strategy like especially for for this space b2b type of content she's like it's always like strategic intellectual trying to figure it out she goes i spend most of my time just getting into a certain state of mind i just she's like i just get into a she she goes this is her exact quote she goes the way i run my structure for my business is through energetics most people don't even know what the [ __ ] that means she goes i get my energy to a place where my presence is truly magnetic i get a vision of what's going to go viral then i run to my computer and i create that and sure enough it goes viral she goes because most content people people don't understand content is just energy transmission yeah i'm having a great time i'm excited about this topic and so i'm going to push that through the phone into you and sure enough you're going to learn something but you're also going to smile while you're watching my [ __ ] you're also going to laugh while you're watching my thing and nobody else is doing that and i've read that and i go she gets it she gets like one of the most important things about business and life which is it's like maybe able to manage your own energy but the second part is she gets the content strategy in a way that i don't think anybody else is going to really get in this in this space the second thing is go ahead go ahead she now has scales so at first i was like okay but she's just like an individual creator on tick-tock and like who knows maybe tick-tock algorithm changes no so here's what she's doing she basically is like i'm gonna scale in two ways first she's expanding into the whole microsoft suite so it's not just excel she's doing powerpoint and word and outlook and like everything that like you know a billion people on earth have to use professionally and so and microsoft is helping her and every time they're releasing a new thing she's getting first look at it and she gets to come out right away with the content that's going to highlight this new function or this new feature that you get to be able to use so that expansion gives it more legs than just excel the second thing is she now hired a performance marketing agency and she's like yeah get my brand to grow and she's like the beautiful thing is i don't sell my course i just put one my most viral thing and i put ad spend behind it and people love it like they love that content and so they like it they comment on it so facebook's algorithm promotes it and so i was like oh that's kind of an unstoppable like flywheel she's going to keep creating this like juicy like quick life hack type content um then she's promoting it uh that's already inherently viral then she's putting a paid ad spent behind it she's growing her following on instagram now plus tic toc plus youtube plus all these different places um and she's like oh yeah reels came out so then i just like jumped on reels and i became like one of the most viral reels creators on instagram and um so i'm like okay now she's diversifying the audience and she's got the courses behind it and she's going into more more parts of the suite i like that formula i was wrong she's gonna she's gonna crush it i think she's gonna get to my bold prediction she's gonna get to a hundred million dollars in sales and that sounds outrageous i was about to say 100 million i think she could i think you could do i think 100 million a year or lifetime a year uh yeah i actually agree with you i think that's bold i think likely she'll get to like 25 million dollars a year in revenue and could probably actually do that for many years right uh yeah i think it's crazy um so i loved i loved her thing there was also these other little nuggets so she basically she's working 15 hours a week so then she's like oh cool quit my job i'm going to be a digital nomad something you kind of did this last year she's like every month me and my boyfriend we just moved to a different state we just want to experience it so they'll just move to a different state in america and just like hang out there for the month and then they hop around and uh the other thing that she's the other nuggets i liked was she does these like webinars because she understands there's like a top of funnel so top of funnel if you don't know is basically like how you get new customers to even like get in touch with you get in get into your cases it's just going viral on tick tock going viral on tick doc or instagram or youtube great then she has the middle of funnel which is where a lot of people fall out which is okay you've touched base with me once you're not ready to buy something just yet but how do i actually get you to participate in a deeper way to invest in a deeper way and for her she runs these webinars and she calls them high energy excel parties and so she she invites people to these and what happens is it's of course it's like someone from bcg and then they go and they're like oh this is amazing then they're like hey we'd like to buy like 1500 seats for our for your course for our company you know like hey i work for target uh corporate training and uh yeah we have 25 000 employees that we think would be benefit from this how do could you create something custom for us and it's gonna be like yeah here's the same thing but now i say the word target at the beginning and i charge you you know five million dollars for i have a buddy who's doing this which basically is like his top uh he he does top of funnel newsletters then he does these like webinars and workshops and podcasts that go deeper and at the bottom is somebody from you know procter gamble will reach out and just be like hey cool like yeah we got 50 000 global employees uh we would love to have you come speak at our headquarters once a month and like you know we'll pay you um based like a hundred thousand dollar retainer per month how's that and he's like whoa okay that's like way easier than like what's he teach so he teaches basically i don't want to give away too much because i can't say the numbers then but he teaches like a version of um are you familiar with that so he's like kind of one of the thought leaders in growth mindset and so big company like sports teams uh like have them on retainer as well as you know big companies like uh whoever you know coca-cola or whatever will will pay him and they they're just like look we think your stuff is great and we have 50 000 employees uh how do we just like package this up for all those employees and then like guess what we want to do this every year and so that turned out to be a very big business for him and he's just trying to figure out like what do you charge a company like this and he'll just name a number and uh you know sure enough they'll pay and he's like oh man maybe i should have set a higher number i thought that was a crazy high number but i guess for them it's like they didn't even blink they just like said yes so [ __ ] did you see uh this weekend the world excel financial modeling championships happened no but that is amazing i love that it went viral uh ben look this up it's like look up like financial modeling world championship dude why did i think of that idea that's such a me idea to think of it went viral and there was like and you see these guys it's like all you know no disrespect it's all nerds doing it obviously and you see pictures of them and you see memes like this is what peak male performance looks like and uh okay what what do they actually do what is the competition so they're all like you can uh it was they did it like twitch so like you could like uh they were streaming their screens and they were asked to do certain things and then they had to like in real time like make this model and i don't actually know how they judged it i didn't pay attention i just paid attention to the memes i think seth smith tweeted something funny like this is a gift from god like she showed a picture of them on there it's amazing it was hilarious and uh all my indian friends were sharing it this weekend and like making indian jokes and it was awesome it was so funny but who who owns that didn't you see it's probably like you know deloitte but anyway so that was amazing this that's awesome i love miss excel when this article on the verge i think it was went live i had so many people dm me and say you guys got to cover this so i was going to do it and so i'm happy you did baller i think that um i've talked to a couple friends that have course businesses and my friend neville my best friend neville he had a course called copywriting course it honestly changed my life and he made this one course like 12 years ago maybe and it's been paying his bills every single year since then he and he does other stuff i took it as well he like updates it and now he has like a membership thing but this one thing that he filmed years ago it's like it's that's been his career by the way in terms of transferring energy uh neville is exactly like that if you watch in the course he does he's like like most courses are like here's an hour-long session about x his is like it's almost like a blog post and it's like one minute where he's teaching one concept and he'll like the camera will be on and then he'll pop out from under the table he'll be like yo and then he'll like say the thing and then the next one he's got a guitar in his hand he's like he's like if i'm writing an email and i want to get a reply and he's like singing a song and he's like he he makes it entertaining and you could just there's something that makes you smile and it keeps you engaged it keeps you involved with it and um you know people will forget the content but they won't forget how they felt taking your course and so they'll still recommend it and refer it and and be happy with their purchase can i i'm going to tell you about uh one or two really quick things and i think we should spend most the episode on your stuff because it's actually pretty good this adventure book thing looks amazing uh one very quick thing monthly.com uh do you know what that is yeah you see they explain it so it's just like cause i think it's pretty under the radar it's pretty much the exact same thing as masterclass but only for creators it's kind of cool i just signed up for my first one casey neistat which one is launching a youtubing and storytelling class do you see it amazing yeah so i signed up for it so that's like a cool find so it's dude how is he not at the [ __ ] top of the screen right now he's like just in the middle of this long list what are they doing it's monthly you know founders of monthly i think i've talked to them before they were they were cool uh they were like they were cool and they knew they were cool i was like hey this is awesome they're like yeah it's awesome i was like i'd love to invest yeah a lot of people want to invest that's right i i appreciate that so i do respect i just signed up for that i'm so excited to to do it like i bought it full price and everything i'm pumped uh the second thing another cool product that i've been fooling around with well we'll do actually three the second one is dscript have you seen dscript yeah we've talked about it so dscript is kind of like um editing software for like you you record something audio or video and then it like transcribes it automatically and then if you if you delete a piece of text from the transcription it deletes that part of the video which is like magic amazing i've been playing with this for my youtube stuff what do you do with it all right so you film a video let's say i film a 10 minute video it uploads the video and automatically transcribes it and so i edit the video by editing the transcription like a google doc and so i could copy and paste and move stuff around and that edits the video it's amazing it's it's almost transformative because it change when i think about what i'm going to film i think about like the the narrative like a story is just a long narrative and it's harder to think in video clips it's much easier to think in transcend in text it's super cool and so i actually think this company they raised money recently at a 200 million valuation i actually think this is a company that's going to be significantly larger than it is now and well like it's going to be pretty epic the guy who started it also started a groupon yeah it wasn't andrew mason mason uh he's dope also the best part about andrew mason that i respect is he he starts groupon groupon goes on this crazy run where it's like at that point in time it was like the hottest startup in the world copied by like every [ __ ] you know every joe schmo was copying groupon groupon like raises all this money it ends up going public then it kind of like you know then the world turns against groupon it's like this is not not a good business it's not going to work people are pulling out it's it's still i think like a billion dollar company but like you know it lost its its shine and he was in chicago i think and then he quits or whatever he gets fired i think he he got fired i think he wrote something really hilarious let me write something really funny all the way out he wrote like an email he's gonna pull that up he goes today i'm paraphrasing he's like today's my last day i've been fired you probably know why like yeah you know the video i've made making fun of that ceo who botched the the the layoffs this was the opposite this is the ceo who like who got it who gets it um and so he yeah he wrote this like letter i was fired today then he takes a year off and he creates an album a music album like a rap album of him just and he's not good but it's hilarious we should pull up one of the one of the the videos of his uh his like rap album or whatever yeah and um he releases that and then he like came back with dscript and it started off as this like walking tour thing which was amazing by the way the walking tours were amazing i bought a lot of them it was really cool but like not that good of a business because i mean i was a super fan but like most people you're never gonna do this and if you do you're gonna do one in your life uh but yeah exactly like that by the way what a great lesson the walking tour was like uh what people should do and like makes them like be be more active and like learn things in the world and then d script is like hey it's like products that make you make it easier to be lazier it's like hey you know editing video is hard let's make it easier for you so dscript i've been playing with it i think it's called dscript i've been calling it descript unless it's descript so sorry uh awesome under the radar cool and then the last thing i'm going to tell you about that's kind of interesting so story worth so sean or ben go to storyworth.com this is a crazy fascinating thing very simple product i actually knew the guy nick he started it i shared an office with him and he's still i believe the only employee and it's kind of cool it's very simple when i logged in or when i used it years ago all it was is you pay like 100 a year or 200 a year and it sends emails to family members that you sign up and it asks them about certain memories and ask them so much over the course of a year that at the end of the year if a lot of your family members have answered some of your prompts you now have a book describing their childhood so it'll be my i sent it to my aunt debbie and she was like a question i i don't remember all the questions but it was something like what's the best memory of your father before you were 10 and she was like you know on halloween we did this thing and and it's like oh my gosh i'm learning about my family and at the end i printed out this book super fascinating and it's super fascinating um because it's a one-person business it's just him and right and it's really simple it's very easy and i love that ancestry stuff so much like i'm a big fan of that um anyway that's why yeah that's cool that's really cool i um i've never used something like this so isn't it kind of a lot of work for the other person to like write an answer like i feel like people don't like to do stuff like that yeah but if you get what you get one a week and you spend like 10 minutes of journaling yeah it's work but i like told my aunt i was like hey this is important to me and she after a while she was like oh i kind of like doing this i'm remembering a bunch of stuff it's a lot of work we had done a version of this or there's a version of this that's like i think a little easier which was um i don't know if you remember i had when i i had my mom over uh she was doing a podcast with her and i recorded a podcast with her and the podcast was so much easier because really all they had to commit to was like one time hey let's sit down and talk and you get this hour-long thing with their voice and they don't have to like people get pretty intimidated having to write something there's this pressure internally to like uh do good writing i think school like traumatizes the [ __ ] out of people and um this podcast thing worked great i did it i had an amazing podcast with my mom i recommend anybody you don't need to be a podcaster by the way like this i don't publish this anywhere but it's just a memory i'll always have and it was a conversation that i wouldn't have otherwise had more importantly like i don't even know if i'll ever go back and listen to this maybe give it to your daughter on that really horrible day yeah like you know when she she passes away like i'll be happy i have this but more importantly it was like so much of life is um so surface level and like we're just talking hey like we're just talking about me and my life all the time b like if i'm talking to her it's about like what we're doing today or whatever i realized i knew very very little about like her and her family and her what made her her and like her upbringing um because you know i don't know that was just [ __ ] in the past and so um and even she forgot a lot of these things and in the conversation it all was coming flooding back to her so i recommend everybody do that with their parents uh like just sit them down and record one hour thing and i can share like the questions i asked or whatever but it really doesn't matter to be honest with you have you done ancestry or 23andme i've never done it no they're awesome so 23andme is awesome ancestry is i think cooler because i've spent hours on it like building up my family tree 23andme i've thought about getting it for i have it and i've thought about buying it this christmas for my family members the reason i'm not i may not do it have you heard of this thing called ged match no was that oh have you heard of the golden state killer no okay so in the 1970s there was that's what they call you yeah that was my nickname in high school golden state killer uh in the in the 1960s 70s and i think 80s there was this guy who basically like raped like 50 women and then he murdered eventually like 20 of like he was a serial killer and uh he got away with it for years no one knew who it was and patton oswalt's wife pat oswalt the comedian his wife who recently died right before she died published her like master work or life's work and it was about the golden state killer and how he's never got been caught and it renewed interest and then the fbi got all into it because all the press and they eventually used this website called ge it's public it's like a anyone can use it it's like an open source website and it analyzes all of the uh information from 23andme ancestry and like all that stuff all the database stuff and they found they put his dna the golden state killer's dna which they had into this ged match thing and they realized that the daughter of the killer or like they're like well this is so aligned it must be like the daughter or the granddaughter of the killer recently signed up for 23 and me and so they stake out this guy's house they dig through his garbage they find they go boom got him and that's how they arrest him and they arrested him when he was like 80 and died and if you google golden state killer you'll see like these pictures of this old man and they got him because he got away with it for so long but eventually they brought him to justice and now they've caught many dozens maybe even hundreds of killers or rapists this way which is good but it's kind of scary and so you could so i was gonna say so you're you're worried about this why why is this working because it's being used for good grandpa and trouble it's being used for good now but like you could see like do i want to be in the state do i want to be in this database and so this is one thing i'm a bit worried about so you can go to ged match and you can upload your results and it can tell you all types of stuff about your results you can see uh a lot of interesting stuff and you could like if you can somehow get the dna from an fbi case which i believe in some cases you can you can like upload it and there's like thousands of like these internet detectives using this database to solve crimes it's kind of fascinating it's kind of interesting and it's definitely a little scary wow is there like a subreddit for these uh you know like sort of like public crime solvers yes there is and it's very very interesting and most of the time they're wrong so like if you remember when the boston like the boston uh marathon bombing they like named like these like three guys and they they kind of [ __ ] with these guys lives they they didn't end up doing it but everyone was certain on that subreddit and they're uploading pictures and they go this guy works at this place it wasn't them they were wrong no one guessed it that it was the two actual guys but this is a little bit different because it's dna but dna isn't perfect so it's like there's a it'll say like there's a um this person is five percent related to this person so it's like all right let's see what that is that could be like a distant cousin until you like track your way down to that and you build these family trees to figure out oh you know it's kind of weird that like this matches this person and they're they also lived in the same area and so it's not perfect but it's like pretty good so anyway i thought that's why i may not get 23 in me [Laughter] yeah i also know people who have gotten it and realized like their dad is not their real dad um and i think that that happened to a family member i think that's a you know uh you know side effect to be aware of sometimes ignorance is blind family member of mine a family member of mine found out that their parent had a their parent cheated on the spouse and had a a a kid and so they logged on and they go oh man i've got a second brother or whatever you know like a step brother or a half brother and uh it changes [ __ ] yeah i was gonna say without getting too personal that that uh that has like that they went public with it or they just kind of kept that information to themselves no no no they did not go public with it but it like was very it was i don't know they haven't talked about it with me too much but it was it seems like it was like uh somewhat earth shattering yeah there's a there's a thing that i've heard that goes on which is um people who uh people who use sperm banks so like a sperm donor um will take the test sorry people who didn't realize that their parent had used a sperm donor or whatever they will get the sequencing done or whatever and they'll find out like oh my god i have 42 like half brothers or sisters out there it's like oh yeah this was a person who um you know this is a person who donated a bunch and then so yeah you actually do genetically share with all these different people um like wow that's really crazy so there's all kinds of like interesting stuff and i think 23andme their business model is to sell your data right like i think that is the core business models they sell pharmaceutical companies for um you know like the research or whatever like i don't know if it's [ __ ] up or if it's like this is for the good of science but i don't think you really know or opt-in it's not clear that hey like it's not clear yeah it's probably it's definitely the terms you know but nobody's reading the terms and so that's the problem it's like it's like a benevolent dictator it's like it's cool when they're making the trains run on time it's not cool when they start killing people you know what i mean yeah it's like it's good when it's good and then but it could go bad really easily yeah uh all right what else we got do adventure book all right so this is another so to me the miss excel thing was one this other thing i think is really interesting so the adventure book let me tell you about this story have you heard do you know what this is this product the adventure book i have no idea what it is ben have you ever heard of this thing okay all right so you guys are also not on tick tock enough this is like the number one ad on tick tock that i see uh i don't know if i'm just in their market or they just run a [ __ ] ton of ads but i've been seeing it for like a year so basically it's a it's kind of it's a book you buy and it's like a high quality big book and what it is is like there's a bunch of imagine like a scratch off like a lottery so there's a bunch of things you can a bunch of adventures that you could scratch off so you open the book to a random adventure you scratch it off and it reveals a thing you're gonna go do like it might be um uh like i don't know i've never bought the book so like you know bad example but like you know you're gonna go into a store today and you give out ten compliments to people in the store or uh you're gonna go streaking around your neighborhood or whatever like an adventure a thing you can go do and um so this idea and and and they pair with it like a camera so you you're supposed to take a polaroid of you doing it so it becomes a scrapbook so on one side it triggers you to go do something that you've never done or that's like you know get you out of your comfort zone uh and then it gives you the ability to capture it and paste you glue the photo in and it becomes this memory book of all your adventures like cool kind of novel idea so i had seen this and i was like ah that's a cute idea that's a novel idea what i didn't realize is this is a hundred million dollar business that was created in the last like two years so how do i know this you know like for the podcast i don't know if you get these emails but i definitely do um there's a bunch of people that have like booking agents and we get all these emails which is like hey sean love my first million um have you thought about having you know joe joe on and you're like you know it's like oh first they're complimenting me so i like open it and i'm like looks like i don't want to be a member of any club that will have me you know so it's like that's how i feel about the guest thing so normally i write all these off but this one caught my eye which was they said would you like to have brian ellis on he is a high school dropout now owns a 100 million dollar business called the adventure challenge and i was like it's like that that adventure book thing and it and so i replied i go 100 million dollars no way that sounds high and she goes yeah like it's been incredible they've grown blah blah blah and i said 100 i'm just like clarifying like 100 million cumulative revenue annual revenue what are you saying here and uh and so she goes yeah like they'll do 85 million in revenue this year and they have a few big bigger partnerships than distribution partnerships that will get them over 100 um like in the next year and you know so the business is valued over 100 million dollars um with 85 million in revenue and i was like what the [ __ ] and so i go and i start researching this and so here's the story so this guy bryant he's um i so i couldn't confirm the high school dropout part i don't know if that was just like some post-fact [ __ ] like like to make this sound better but like let's assume it's true so uh high school dropout i think his job was he had some job which was like he was a skyscraper inspector so he's like you know some low man in the totem pole doing a job he didn't love and he's like all right i'm just doing this for the money he wanted to make a business like he just he's like my whole life i just always been i always have ideas and and you know i wanted to come create a product it's like so i'm doing this job and i had this idea to do um to do this like adventure box so his original idea was take a machine uh create a box like a machine and you push a button and it's like like prints out a receipt the receipt is like the adventure you're gonna go on so you get like a random adventure that comes out cool idea right and um and so that was the original idea and he's like ah just tells a couple people about it and they're like oh yeah that's cool and he's like great but he's doing his job and he hasn't really you know figured out exactly how to do it or whatever um and he's like he's like okay but he's he's he everything's like on hold until he gets fired from his job and he like uh he he makes a mistake they think he committed fraud his boss is like no no this honest mistake but either way he gets fired he's like all right [ __ ] um what do i want to do so he decides i want to go to acting school so he's like i'm going to go to acting school but i need to pay for life so he's like i need to create a side hustle that's going to make me 2 000 a month that's my goal and he's like he's like what about that adventure box challenge thing and he's like the idea over the course of a few months had like evolved and he's like all right what if it was actually like a book that you could scratch off the adventure um and so he tells a couple people about it and they're like that's actually a really cool idea you should do it and so he goes to hobby lobby and he buys some paper some of the scratch-off material and he and he's like buys it he goes to a different store he buys a camera and he's like starts coming up with this idea and he basically spent six to eight months prototyping this idea because nobody had really done a like kind of like um an adventure style scratch-off book before so he's like creating an actual physical product and so he's like um he has this idea and he um he just keeps telling people about it and so he um he gets to the point where he's prototyped the idea several times and there's videos i found online of like he's creating a vlog while he's doing he's like all right it's 11 p.m april 1st uh i just got this really cool material for the scratch off i really like this one but i'm having trouble with the bindings you know and he's like so maybe i'll try this other thing tomorrow and then like he has the next video you know a week later he's like okay i figured out the bindings part and now i need to figure out this other thing i love seeing the the start the early stages of these ideas so he creates a kickstarter he's like i'm going to do a kickstarter it's going to be great i want to raise ten thousand dollars for this book and uh kickstarter goes live he makes thirteen hundred dollars the first day and he's like [ __ ] yeah i'm the man he you know goes to a coffee shop he's strutting in he's like i made 1300 today i don't know about you guys i'll take you know your best give me your finest coffee and uh he's like all right we're you know we're already 13 of the way the goal let's keep going but day two 400 day three zero dollars and like the kickstarter like runs out of steam he's like [ __ ] i was kind of just banking on this going viral and now it's not viral so what now and so he's like all right basically he's gonna throw in the towel he's like for for only seventeen hundred dollars i can't even get the quality of book made that i want uh maybe i'll just quit so he's like i need to get a job to pay for life um you know like i'm out of money and so he's like he's like oh maybe i'll contact my buddy i don't forget his name but ben my buddy ben to uh to get a sales job he has like this company i can do sales so he calls him up he gets a sales he's like i want to do a sales job i want to do it for one year and i'm just saving up money so i go back out there and build a product and the guy's like all right cool that's fine like you're upfront about it like i'm down with that let's do it so he gets a sales job there and while he's there he's telling people at work this idea he can't shut up about the idea and um and the guy there was like you know have you tried ads he's like oh dude nobody clicks ads like ads like reds like ads are scams basically like that's his mentality at the time and the guy's like no like that's how we grow our business like you know you should try so he puts a little money into ads he's like i don't know if it worked or not but like you know i got this like 10x roast and the guy's like what like no way and he's like yeah like people really like the ad or whatever and so the guy he partners with his buddy the guy who hired him and he so i'm fast forwarding some parts of the story but basically he ends up leaving that guy partners with him that guy's like look we're gonna grow this thing through ads and um and they basically run a [ __ ] ton of tick tock ads facebook ads whatever and they've grown this thing to now 85 if this is true 85 million dollars in sales they've sold about 2 million copies of this book it's like a 40 book which is like you know something 70 something million dollars in sales if you do the math and um and yeah what an adventure and now they have like a couple's book so you're like 50 fun adventures to go on with your date they have a family book here's something to do with your family a friend's book and then a by yourself book and um yeah it's kind of amazing i am into these notebooks i told you i used one of these best self code right yeah but that's different that doesn't have like a product it doesn't have to go do things in the real world it does it does the the one i use i use like a relation we use like a marriage one and so i'm into this this guy's amazing how old is he uh he seems very young so i don't know how old he is um he looks like he might be 25. this is amazing max i don't know i think these box things are cool we talked about one that was doing like 100 million in revenue and it was um remember it was that like catch a catch a criminal box you remember that oh what was that what is that one that's a is it a truth it was amazing it was it was a true crime thing it was thirty dollars a month and they send you a box and you solve a crime with your friends it's so good it was so fun and this is in that same world i think it's cool to like it feels special to me to order something and to like see a physical get a physical thing and uh i'm into it i think this is badass i like so often true crime won better than this because that's a repeat that's like a recurring one or it'll have more repeat purchase than this um it's so fun and uh i do one i buy this thing called kiwi for my niece which is like it sends her like kind of like a science fair project basically it's like here's a kit you're going to build a like a little like mini tractor it's sort of like legos or whatever but it's not like one specific thing or sorry it is one specific thing um it's like here's you learn about electricity through this little like box every month and it's not great but it's good enough and like she loves it so now if i cancel i have the guilt of like her not getting the toy she wants and so i'm like i'm gonna just keep this 20 subscription forever i i guess i'm on board with this i think this is awesome i think who by the way whoever's making clips this should be the clip uh that you make this guy's story's like i was enthralled this is amazing wow um all right what else what else you want to do i have uh keep going okay i have a segment it's not even a full segment it's just uh the start of a segment i think this one might be bad but let's try it uh i basically pretend i'm drunk and then this will be like ah that's pretty good for a drunk guy um i have a bunch of half-baked tv show ideas do you even drink i'll drink you know if the occasion calls for it i'll drink but not regularly no um but i want to pretend i was drunk when i came up with this list because it's kind of just like a random ass list of weird ideas so these are half-baked tv show ideas okay uh this is for the you know the producer who listens to the show the netflix guy who listens to the show uh you're welcome in advance i want to get your reaction to my concepts okay i'm going to pitch you three ideas uh i don't know if you have any any tv show ideas i'm gonna pitch you three okay okay the first one is called frat you um i love i don't know if you've seen um the football one that's on oh my god what's it called there's like a football one called uh something on netflix it's like one of their original shows that basically follows a a junior college football team around and um uh it's like here's the coach here's the players and it like picks six players and it's like you kind of get emotionally invested in their story there's a formula one show that's just like this it's like here's these six drivers you get invested in there yeah it's amazing their story there's a cheerleading version of this that i watched i think it's called cheer i don't know what it's called exactly but it's like here's this the the best cheer card you know that that was like you know that that was like the most popular show and it's not like something you discovered i'm i'm a pretty you know a good curator here so you so i don't know a lot of people didn't watch the show because it's like why would i watch a chat i've heard of this thing called squid games so i signed up for the service called netflix that's pretty great uh all right so this same model i think it'll be applied to a whole bunch more topics the one i'm surprised at is why is there not a reality show just inside one of the craziest frats in america because you know that they would basically go all out sell out to make the show entertaining because they want the fame well i think it's a faux pas have you ever talked to like an 18 year old man they're woke no dude no that's are they just like the that's like the 18 year old who's like talking to old people like us most 18 year olds don't interact with people like us and they're like very normal and just trying to have a good time in college they're not like are frats are frats popular you think i would think they were going down dude like this are super popular because it's a bubble like when you go to a college it's like in such a little bubble it's not really affected by like the way the world is changing uh you don't have to you're not you're not you're not convincing me i understand the value but i i didn't even i just thought that like with everything going on that it was like a faux pas no dude if you go to arizona state or you go to like you know wherever you know georgia do you think they give a [ __ ] about like you know locism and they're disbanding the frats hell no they are have you seen the doubling date well there's these there's these girls on tick tock that do this challenge or not this challenge but i forget what it's called if you're a tic tac guy you probably know but uh sarah showed it to me it's these girls who are like pledging i think is that what it's called i i wasn't part of that uh where you i don't know what you do it's like you it's like a tryout and they always talk about what they're wearing i'm i'm a i'm an old man and i was a dork i wasn't part of a frat but they like talk about the clothes that they're wearing to their their like pledge ceremony things like that and it's gone very viral on video uh what's so noticeable about the watches i don't know but it's just funny it's just hilarious because like don't you know how like in the south and like at ole miss and stuff like that the the sororities do these uh like yeah they all like i went to a southern college yeah yeah for sure like like they all like it's all like the boss girls they all look exactly alike and they dress exactly alike and that's like the joke is they like show like what they're wearing duke you weren't even allowed to throw a party if you weren't afraid or sorority like they literally were like you better join this [ __ ] or uh you don't get to have a social life dude it's weird it's so weird to me that's so weird also whenever i go to one of these friends i'm like this is disgusting i don't want to live with like a bunch of dudes or alcoholics and there's like 80 of them in this crappy house and there's beer [ __ ] now how about you when you're like getting drunk all the time even back then but even back then i'm like this is bill i want to get drunk i just don't want to be around a bunch of like degenerates all the time oh okay well you're alone in that i would love to uh go back and experience college again i think it was a great time and living in one of these houses was yes messy but fun anyways point is you go to a party school you go to ole miss you go to georgia you go to you know santa barbara or whatever and it's frat you and you basically just follow around with a king alpha frat you go inside the house and you pick the five characters who are the [ __ ] you know they got they're gonna have all the elements of a great tv show they're gonna have relationship drama they're gonna have infighting they're gonna have camaraderie with the boys they're going to have a hazing and a a pledge process that's going to be controversial and get them to do all kinds of outrageous stunts it's all baked in the show basically writes that you got to have like like one guy questioning his sexuality exactly he comes out he's another guy he's afraid they're not going to accept him but they accept him there's the the person who gets canceled for doing something racist or sexist or something like that it's got all the elements and then you could just hop from school to school and the schools would be excited oh [ __ ] frat u is coming we gotta represent because you know georgia looked like they had a good time so now all of a sudden clemson is like oh you think georgia was hardcore look how we party look how we do our thing i think this is a no-brainer franchise that somebody needs to create and uh you could put me down as executive producer all right next okay basic to baller okay what is this um i recently met somebody i'm gonna do a separate episode of this but i recently met somebody who was uh completely um like middle class or a little lower middle class like didn't have any money all their all their tastes were that of a basic person right they they didn't shop at whole foods they shopped at kroger right they didn't uh they didn't eat like fancy stuff they you know like mcdonald's and stuff like that they um they didn't drive a fancy car they drove like a camry and like okay so that was their like taste buds so i thought what if you had a show where you just give a really basic person [ __ ] you money and they get to go ball out and you get to see their reaction because already shows where people ball out uh like like you know whether it's like kind of like a million dollar listing or it's like uh selling sunset or it's like kardashians it's like it's nice to see the lifestyles of the rich and famous people like that but those people also there's that genre of lifestyles of the rich and famous from people who are already rich and famous and sort of like you know snobby and materialistic okay that already exists what about some what if you transformed somebody you gave them the cinderella treatment they went from the you know the bottom to the top suddenly and they're now just discovering all these things for the first time hilarity ensues okay that's my second let me make it let me put a twist please i actually think that you could do this or someone listening could actually do this immediately via a youtube series so in 2005 there was a documentary called reversal of fortune it was on showtime it was amazing and the question was what would a homeless person do if they were given a hundred thousand dollars and so they found this homeless guy they gave him a hundred thousand dollars and they show him going to like a hotel for the first time and sleeping in a bed for the first time and he's like i don't like this and he sleeps on the floor of the hotel because he's like it's not comfortable sleeping on this bed and they give him a hundred thousand dollars and it ends not good so he spends all of his money on women he buys a 35 000 truck and this is like thirty five thousand of the hundred grand and basically blows through all the money and he does get a job but he like all the money is gone on basically partying and uh at the end of the movie he's only got five grand left and he's sleeping at his sister's house uh but i actually think it's not great for him but sounds like great tv to me it was great tv i was watching it the whole time so uh i think what could be it what you should do is just get a hundred thousand dollars and do a youtube series on this you i think you can make your money back and add revenue that's that's the thing i think i think if you did it with a homeless person you might get some blowback now uh so you know yeah not with the homeless person but like you know like what would happen if like you know a someone who's in need or doesn't have much is given a given yeah and i think it kind of needs to be temporary like uh you know so you know with like pimp my ride you know exhibit shows up at the door and then like your life just sort of changes overnight um or like you know wife swap or whatever where it's a very short period it's like a month or something like that i think you need to let them ball out and then let them return back to reality um and you see that that sort of the yo-yo of emotions between them okay so that's my my second one okay third one very easy show i just need a show that's background noise are you a background noise kind of guy do you just have something on because it just feels better to have something on uh in our when we had a physical office we had we had white noise machines throughout the office and i enjoy that baby's to sleep it was so you could have like hard like if you want to have a conversation in a conference room and for it not to bleed through the walls right uh and it was difficult newsletter conversations yes or like when you have like an open office plan you put it in like pods of deaths so then like the people eating lunch don't bother you uh now i keep the fan on well you're also like a music video guy right i remember we were at your house you were just throwing up like on apple tv like a bunch of music videos i have music videos playing uh throughout the day yeah okay so that's the behavior i'm talking about i think that netflix does not does anyone else do that you don't do that you don't have to i don't do that but my wife she'll always put like friends on i'm like dude you're watching friends and she's like no i'm not like i'm not watching i'm like why do you have it on can i turn it off no no i like i like having it on it's like yeah she doesn't like if there's like kind of like an empty home feeling and also it's this comfort safety blanket where it's like i already seen all the episodes and that is why the office and friends are such valuable catalogs because people just put them on and they can only pay 10 or 20 attention to it and 80 could be on the thing they're trying to do and they can just glance up and you know see certain parts but then they just don't it's a low maintenance show and when you go on netflix today so much of it is high maintenance attention uh it's like oh here's this intense story about this bank heist and that's great when you want like a friday night intense drama but i think they're underserving the background noise and i also learned this at twitch because when i was at twitch we looked at some of the data about the usage data and somebody was pointing out like oh yeah like x percent i can't say the exact percent but like a significant percent of the viewing time is uh when it's not the tab that's in the forefront on people's computer and i was like oh so we should just like throw that out right like they're not even watching they just like accidentally left it open and i was like why is this such a high percentage do we have some bug that like it stays open in the background in some weird way they're like no this is actually the use by like all the developers what are you talking about the developers who actually use twitch all the time they're like this is how i use twitch all the time like i'm coding i just have it on in the back i'm just listening to him like you're listening to somebody play video games like if there's one thing weirder than watching somebody play video games it's listening to somebody play video games like no i just like it as like a ongoing background stream it's kind of my favorite streamer and i don't really need to pay attention to it but i'll hop in if something if i hear something cool happening i was like holy [ __ ] so there's this big genre of background entertainment that i think you if you specifically tried to make in make background entertainment you could create some really successful franchises so can i can i can i tell you something that validates us so you know chive chive dot com um i think it's just like a news website or something i don't really know much about it a little bit it's like basically bar stool but a slightly different demographic but mostly the same and they created this thing called chive tv and so what they did was they uh would in their base in austin they basically gave a little amazon fire stick to a bunch of bars in austin and they said you could have this stick for free and on this stick is basically we're gonna put loads and loads of different clips of basically like america's funniest home videos basically guys getting hit in the balls and like funny bar stuff that you don't actually need any sound to understand or to get like pleasure from and so it was like silly stunts guys jumping off skyscrapers and like skydiving and stuff and they eventually spun this off and they created this business called atmosphere and this was making tens of millions of dollars in revenue pre-pandemic i believe they raised tens of millions of dollars at like a 200 million valuation and they would give these these these uh fire sticks to like loads of different people and then eventually you could just download this app and they would fulfill the uh put content in the pipe and then put ads on it and that's how they made all their money and they go look advertisers you're reaching all these bars right yeah yeah that's bars is a great one right that's like perfect background background entertainment okay so those are my three tv show pitch ideas half-baked ideas uh do you have any ideas is there a show that you think could exist or would exist or should exist i know i'm putting you on the spot here no but so one that has caught my eye youtube uh on youtube cnbc is doing something that i think is actually amazing it's called millennial money stupid name and the branding is really dumb but what they do is no they got the idea is cool though my friend steve was on it the other day they convinced these people and they say like and the titles are like here's how we live on a million dollars a year in silicon valley here's how we live on forty thousand dollars here's how we live and i've also seen kevin o'leary reacts to them have you seen this that's what they they that's also awesome i think it's a great series i think they're missing the mark though but even though they're missing the mark it's still quite good and so i've always thought that uh for different stuff i was like what you what you should do is get you could do it one of two ways i've always thought what you could do is you could maybe have a podcast or get actors and they like i bet you if i send out a survey and i've done this before we did this at the hustle we sent out a survey we posted on hacker news and we got like 3 000 people to tell us how much money they have in their checking account how much they have in investable assets how much they spend at each month and then just like a comment box and they like leave comments and if you search like the hustle founder bank account like we we did an article on it and people would give us all their information and it was all anonymous though and and it was pretty great and i always thought it would be interesting to where we can do a podcast where i just ask these people questions and then i'll hire a voice actor just to read them right right right i like that i also really like that survey kind of idea because the people people are very willing to share because they've no cost them it's anonymized it's you know it's not being publicly shared that it's their their information but people really benefit from seeing what the aggregate is doing uh so we talked about this with salaries with levels.fyi as well as uh somebody heard the thing for levels and then they made it for do you know about the story someone heard our podcast levels they made it for doctors doctors and then they got acquired by levels and so they now work out oh it got a question they got acquired they got aqua hired maybe it's better way to phrase it like those guys now are like you know like doing their thing at levels um he's like dude thanks for like that idea it led me to like a it got me off the path i was on i built something cool i got to learn from that and then i got a sweet opportunity at levels through that um so but there's another one that's going viral right now that's like i think a hundred and seventy five thousand tech workers have put their stuff into this spreadsheet yeah i've seen that what's that called it's literally just a google sheet it's like it's broken because it has too many rows now um like nobody can like use it they like they're like asking for excel experts to like help them you know like format this so that they they don't lose the data but like people can still put their stuff in i saw that they're basically doing it because they want to end uh like like maybe if you're a minority or something at facebook you're like i don't know if i'm getting [ __ ] here can everyone please enter their salary anonymously so i know like is this fair not fair yeah and that's how it got started and so people were like rallying behind it and and it went viral i saw that that was pretty cool yeah um all right that's all i got for today i got a couple other ideas but i'ma save them all right i think that was a good one benjamin what do you uh what do you think of this one give it a grade this was an a um this was an a minus [Laughter] okay walk me through that it was an a it was a it was an a because it was good top to bottom like all of it was good and then i decided to add the minus at the end because it was missing uh like a hose water sam moment like it didn't have anything that i was like rolling on the floor laughing or anything like that so i docked it to a minus dude it's because my freaking camera's screwing up it it knocks me off my flow so much i can't stand it um apparently i did so i some people say we're funny which shocks me and uh like the other day noah was like you have to take notes about reading a book and i'm like dude i just read a book about like the navy seals like am i supposed to take notes about how like bin laden was shot in the head and uh like apparently people wrote in the comments they like when we say dumb stuff like that and that shocks me [Laughter] when people say they listen i'm like i'm like really so i don't know if you're just doing that thing where it's like fake fake humble like oh gosh i didn't know that guy like because no i think it's funny like i think it's funnier you're funny i think you're funny as a group i would say we're like mildly funny but i wouldn't say funny is an attribute that i would like give this show and i think you're way funnier also i i even texted you this because you would you had sent me something that was so funny and i was like dude you're funny [Laughter] no you said a left-handed compliment you're like i don't think a lot of people understand this but you're pretty funny like i made a joke the other day someone posted a picture with them with their arm or it's just like a headshot of them with apollo anton ono the ice skater and i was like i don't know who that is it's someone says that's apollo antonino i'm like oh sorry i didn't recognize him without a skate song there's like little comments like that and no one laughed at it and i was like guys that's hilarious that was funny that was funny i should have given you a laugh because that wasn't that was a good one um and uh yeah so i think we're funny you have a you're blunt which is that's funny in itself right you just you just say something and uh you don't hedge which is like makes it even funnier because everybody [ __ ] hedges nowadays so you don't hedge or apologize which is hilarious and um and then you have some good like kind of phrases or one-liners that hit well i'll take it so ben a minus but we'll try to get some hose water stuff but people are still com people tweet at me and call me hose water i love it uh all right we're out of here [Music] you

100 i've been saying this for a long time which is anybody who could figure out how to employ the stay-at-home mom workforce is going to make billions of dollars [Music] dude this morning my friend had a 40th birthday party and he rented out an entire water park this morning from like 7 30 a.m to like 10 a.m and i went to it yeah it was like me and ramon and neville and then like you know david perrell he was there and a bunch of other guys are there and i it was so fun we had this whole park to ourselves and then i came home and like threw up and went to sleep like you caught something because you you threw about a nostalgia why are you puking i didn't like when i was a kid i used to love that stuff and then i did all these like slides and like went too hard and like going through them like like you go like these slides are it's kind of hard to explain but you're like in that you know those tubes that like go in twisties like it just made me sick to my stomach i i was like on the right home i was like no i think i might throw up can you uh unlock the window i couldn't believe how like old i got you savage you threw up out the window you didn't no i didn't do it out the window but i came home and i got sick and i just had to lay down i cannot believe how life has changed like you didn't even drink it just just the straight just the action just like the like well did you go to rides at disney uh like that my daughter's two so i did only like the dumbo ride like the most simple rides i don't like i think it was a little crazy i think i would have done like the big stuff i think i would throw up at this point i couldn't handle it it was horrible um but man this is why austin is awesome so like okay so david perrl i don't know him that well but uh just two blocks up there's this restaurant and me and sarah went out to breakfast and he was there and so i he we knew who each others were and we just said what's good but now we're gonna go hang out last night i had this guy over named chris williamson do you know who that is no he's like a popular youtuber and he just dm'd me he said i'm in austin do i hang out i go yeah just come over for dinner uh like we're just constantly just seeing people it's pretty wild it's a small weird it's like a a lot of like cool people here but it's a small town yeah that used to be the case in san francisco you know because you would just bump into people everywhere that were like doing the same thing like-minded people who are also in the same game but um i don't know i moved out of the city now so like you know i'm in the burb my neighbor is 80 years old uh you know if i bump into him you know he's telling me about like you know crochet or something like that so it's not the same well it's it's awesome here i've thoroughly enjoyed it um you want to get into some stuff yeah you have a bunch of really interesting things to talk about i've got less interesting things to talk about yeah let's do it let's pick one um actually let me let me let me lead with mine because i have less stuff this is pretty much the only thing but you talk to this person all right this woman named rebecca zamalo you talked to her right yeah i think you butchered her last name zamarollo zamarello sorry all right so i did a call with her as well i i dm'd her and and we and we started talking this woman is amazing so basically it's her and her husband her husband's name's matt they're partners on this she has a youtube channel it's anyone listening to this you only probably know about it if you have kids so it's meant for children it's like it's like acting like fictional stuff age uh like six to eight uh six to ten ish maybe where it's like it's not the like absolute beginner kitty coco melon type of stuff it's like somewhere between and yeah they basically like it's a little show it's a t it's almost like a tv show uh you know whether it's blues clues or whatever else there they create like you know these videos these little 10-minute videos that are entertaining and on her personal channel she's got like 10 or 12 million subscribers she has seven other seven channels total so six other channels one for her dog one for her husband one for like this for gaming just like all types of stuff she's releasing eight videos a week they have a team of like eight or six people maybe and she kind of told me a little bit about some of like the business numbers my mind was blown it was astounding unbelievable it was unbelievable did you talk to her about her business we can't like i didn't ask her if i could say anything and she wouldn't like that but i put that on blast but yeah i i like the you know the dog has ten times maybe 20 times more subscribers than we do on youtube like it's like oh this is my dog's gaming channel and it'll have like 400 000 subscribers or something crazy so she gets youtube has i mean 10 million subscribers is no joke and the amount of production the content output like just that thing you said it sounded like oh six like seven eight videos a week it's like okay so they do a video they release video pretty much every day but they're like 40 minute long sometimes yeah they're like long videos with like story lines about like and she'll be like you know um yeah we moved into this new house and there was like this weird door in my bedroom so we created this storyline about this like secret secret passage that takes you down and then there's a villain inside and the villain is my husband and like that's the like they create a whole play basically a little screenplay and they shoot it and while we were talking she's like yeah downstairs there's like eight people for our crew like our kind of film audio uh you know editors whatever that are all here and she's like yeah my life is crazy it's it's it was wild and she was telling me about different stuff and so there's this guy named dar darmon so his first name is dar d h i know him well yeah okay so you're friends with them i'm not friends with them uh my wife either knew him like in college or something like that or whatever but then we've uh done some deals with that him and his wife around like influencer content so he's got 13.8 million subscribers and it's it's kind of lame what he does like lame in that it's not going to fit what we we do but basically it's like hallmark channel videos like one was like bully someone bullies an autistic kid and the reaction is crazy or and it's like a fictional hallmark video i think they like children watch it i guess to understand like values and he's got something like a hundred employees and he's brand new to this like within a three-year thing yeah like two three years a hundred employees and they pump these videos out to the point of like right now he's got 6.3 billion views and it is crazy and across all their platforms their videos have been viewed 27 billion times uh it's the some of these youtubers it is i'm just blown away at how big their businesses are and when i'm thinking about it and i talked to rebecca i'm like this actually isn't that hard i could do this and if you dedicate like 40 or 50 hours a week if you start from scratch you can get big really fast and but you have to treat it like a job not a hobby just like anything else yeah like a business not even a job because yeah business managing a bunch of people and you gotta have a product for customers and things like that so so yeah i totally agree um like i'm on his uh twitter so it says like new videos monday through thursday family friendly kid approved right this is a that is a product you're offering we yeah we release on these days we are kid-friendly rated g uh you know like here's what you're gonna get out of this and that's that's you know my studio company or whatever um and i think but by the way before this this guy i think he was doing like a cannabis company an e-commerce thing yeah they have an e-commerce and cannabis business like unrelated he's doing all kinds of stuff it's it's amazing it's incredible um these youtubers like i'm blown away because there's so many that you have no idea who they are but they have these empires that could be potentially making tens of millions of dollars a year yeah i i also think um you know it's really hard to do what they're doing um like you know the it's not for everybody uh and i i guess that's kind of obvious but uh i guess what i'm trying to say is even if you could do it not everybody could do it but even if you could do it doesn't mean you should do it like this is such a hard thing to do to get on that treadmill and say i'm gonna produce awesome content five days a week non-stop and if i ever stop the algorithm punishes me and my subscribers leave my channel and my patreon people stop giving me money and my i don't have ad content for my sponsors and if i ever you know just don't feel like being in front of the camera like it doesn't work there's no substitute teacher to um to you know step in here and and step into this business so i think it is a really valuable i think it's a powerful business when you have it because anytime you have the trust of millions of people who like your entertainment that's great but man um i don't think it's worth it uh you know just i i'm not even just saying that theoretically like i've thought about doing it and i'm like there's no way this is worth it for me yeah i i and that's what i said to her and so this guy dar i think he's not like the face i believe in most of his videos i don't think i think he's enclosed in none of his videos or something like that with her she was like yeah but we've got all these seven other channels now so we diversified beyond just me and i agree with you i think that that's a hard treadmill but i would say to the the other side is like everything is that right if you start anything like you of course you just gotta work at it for a long time um i think i could share this but when i did the episode when i recorded with husband minaj who's like you know comedian uh he's on tv shows stuff like that he um he had asked me at one point during the thing i think the episode's coming out soon um the he had asked me like you know uh like what would you do next step if you were me he asked you that yeah like kind of like okay from a business point of view what would you do next and um on the pod itself i don't think i got him i gave him a great answer like i think in the pod we were talking more about like how would you invest your money and um i was like you know here's kind of the thought process i would go down it was kind of a boring lame answer i would to be honest but afterwards when we were hanging out i i told him what i think is actually the real answer for this i said you know everybody should do what fits them like something that looks exhausting to me might look might feel amazing to somebody else so you know don't take my word for it but let's just pretend i'm just going to give you my two cents and you could throw it away if you don't like it um i said if i was you this touring business model seems awesome because i was at your show it was so you know like 4 000 seats sold out everyone you know every average ticket's like 150 bucks and you just did that eight times in this city and then you're gonna go to 50 cities on this tour like you could just add it up and be like wow you can make a lot of money touring and um and then there's no limit to that like yeah this is a 4 000 person auditorium but you could do your same set in front of 30 000 people in a bigger stadium if like you know chris rock or dane cook or whoever these other people would do that that size tours so i said you got a business model that works and but the problem is you're i was like you're a new dad like me like i can't imagine being on the road going to 50 cities like we've been invited to many things i've been like yeah and then i'm like uh traveling is so hard a little kid i got to leave my wife i don't really want to leave the house for an extended period of time right now like i like being home so i was like you don't for me i would want to get rid of the travel component i said okay how do you do that you can't have a substitute teacher come in and say your jokes on stage that doesn't work and so what i had told him afterwards i go if i was you i would stash cash and i would create a two-year runway where i could just work on one thing and that is creating the next hamilton and he's like what and i was like i would use your storytelling your comedic abilities i would create hamilton for brown people because that's like his audience is his demographic is like heavily skewed asian and i said um i'll create hamilton for brown people i don't know what that means i would just take that and say i'm doing that and then he's like you know he reacted to it or whatever and i was like the reason i would do that is because then you get the business model of touring but it's not you on the stage you all you only have to create it once and like mamma mia has been running for [ __ ] 16 years and has done over 600 million dollars in ticket sales and um you know like hamilton's done over a billion dollars in ticket sales and it's the same story it's the same songs it's the same jokes every night done by a different cast of kind of like you know fungible or interchangeable pieces so you're not super dependent on any one talent like you can switch it off switch switch out people if you need so i was like that to me seems like an amazing business model i would do that so that that's kind of my example of this youtube thing is like you can also do the youtube thing but in a different way like i think it's cool that dar isn't the face of his videos so then it's more like a production company it's like a tv show he's created not so much a vlog dude there's this guy uh people are gonna laugh at me because i don't know or if you know who this is uh is it andrew lloyd webber i forget who i forget the guy's name is that the fan of the opera guy yeah and did he do joseph uh something jesus radical what's that that broadway show where it's like radical jesus or like jesus's uh it's like about jesus and then there's like this christ yes [ __ ] it yes school of rock phantom of the opera and evita which are all big hits that i've heard of and then i've never heard of jesus christ superstar but yeah that's apparently like done in the 70s yeah he uh he's a billionaire yeah so so i looked up so when i thought of that play model i was like is the play is the play business a good business it could be and i think it can be so the the top the top ip definitely accrues like a [ __ ] ton of value like i said if you you can go look at like lion king is grossed like two point something billion dollars uh that's the number one stage play two and three hamilton is like getting up there it's like it's like number two or three now but it's like very new so it'll it'll surpass lion king if it just keeps going um there's like fan of the opera there's mamma mia there's like so you take the top ten and they're all doing like hundreds of millions in gross sales okay now you don't get to keep the gross sales but i think you could do this in a way that works so like the guy who created hamilton lynn manuel whatever his name is yeah but did the uh did the author get paid too on that one uh so he gets so this guy lynn who's the creator of it he uh has like a seven percent royalty or something like that wow so he's made like tens of millions of dollars off of the the profits they actually crowdfunded the thing so what they did i don't have the full story in front of me because i'm just trying to say this off top my head from a memory but i think what they did was to raise the money to create the thing they had like a bunch of patrons basically chipping money and they all get to keep a profit share after a certain amount of money had been recouped and so that investment has been paid over like 10 times so if again if i was hustling i'd be like hmm there's web3 [ __ ] going on interesting a lot of people flush with cash buying into [ __ ] okay cool digital tickets nfts okay what can i do with this and i would basically raise 10 million dollars through an nft pre-sale of the show and uh in different tiers like you know some of the tickets have backstage passes attached to them some of them don't whatever that's interesting and and i would i would just let people buy buying this i'd raise 10 million dollars i'd use the 10 million dollars to go into a bunker to create whatever the health hamilton black people is and then i would hamilton brown people for indians oh yeah sorry not black people brown people so then i would take that show on the road and i would just try to i would be like yeah i know it's hard but like being a successful stand-up comedian was also like a 0.1 success rate or whatever um you know to get to where he's at so like yeah you want to get to the point one percent success rate but this time with a superior business model that um doesn't require your face on the stage saying the jokes yeah i think that's sick i think that's a that's a great idea i think that's actually that's wonderful i think and that could be incredibly creative creatively fulfilling i wish i had said it on the spot it's like one of those when you're in an argument and then like later you're interested i said that oh [ __ ] i should have said that that's what happened to me but luckily we were still hanging out at that moment so i was able to tell him you know then ah this is a cool idea i think in the next couple episodes what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to bring in uh i'm going to do some research on the broadway business or like i don't know theater i guess what do you call it theater yeah um it's actually an interesting idea i was always curious because american idiot basically they did this so billy joe armstrong wrote green day wrote american idiot the album the song they turned it into a uh a rock musical right you didn't have to be there they didn't have to be there you know exactly and they got paid a lot from it book of mormon let me see how much book of mormon has made of mormon yeah 500 million dollars has been the gross ticket sales of book of mormon and then if you did something like a hamilton or like a lion king or whatever you could take that same ip those characters you have merch you have like other that ips you okay is you got to own the ip and um you know so so i think you know when that when book of mormon launched it says it was bringing bringing in 19 million per month so like i don't know what south park generated lifetime but like i bet it's kind of like on par with that uh or you know i guess south park's probably a bigger success um yeah oh wow south park okay just in 20 i didn't know this happened actually it looks like a couple months ago the south park creator signed a 900 million deal for more episodes for for uh six years uh with viacom cbs that's insane i didn't know that that's actually amazing that's amazing right now is the best time ever to be a like a production company or an ip holder and we said this a long time ago remember i said someone needs to there's all these platforms now you got at the time it was netflix amazon prime and then i said disney plus was going to come out it hadn't come out yet and then there was like you know there's hulu there's all these different platforms apple tv plus came out they all want original content they're all hungry for content and they are betting billions of dollars budgeting every single year to buy content i think netflix or amazon or something like they're paying like six billion dollars per year for content uh for new content production and so it is the best time ever to be a seller of content and at the time we had said somebody should create yc for content basically the way that y combinator helped produce software startups and it just said hey two engineers okay you're 21 years old you grad it from stanford all right come here this is essentially like a business school but you're going to create a little business and you know maybe you can sell to facebook or google or you'll end up becoming the next airbnb you'll go public i think the same thing with the content where you come in as two kind of like creatives you have a pitch for an idea of a show you want to create um you have three months to basically create the sizzle reel or the pilot or whatever and then there's a demo day with a bunch of buyers from all the big streaming platforms and they just buy options on your [ __ ] and um i just think that's a beautiful i still think that's a great business idea and it's only been proven when south park signs a 900 million deal with with cbs uh shonda rhimes i think signed a couple hundred million dollar deal with netflix to produce six shows um reese witherspoon sold her production company which didn't even have that like for like a billion for like a billion dollars like this is you know this is tech startup money that's being sold for for tv content which is amazing so you know that's a that's way more fun than building software way more way cooler um way cooler than that and i think today house minaj also announced his production he created a production company today he announced it like 100 i think it's called 186k productions or something like that which is smart again like once you see reese witherspoon and other people's production companies selling and we had rob deer deck on i think he said he sold his production company for 200 something million he said that he i think he said he's walking away with 100 him personally yeah so like i think you know at least let's say at least 100 million probably closer to 200 million he sold his production company which basically just produced shows for mtv that's a great business to be in and i think it's only going to get better for like this kind of five year period and then these platforms are going to go away like paramount plus and you know like quibby died you know paramount plus what the [ __ ] is that that's good i love paramount plus why do you love fairmont what's the one show you love on there there's gotta be one they have uh like a lot of documentaries and [ __ ] paramount it's like old older it's like old school a little bit or like peacock are you subscribed to peacock hell yeah i literally was just when i was laying in bed when i wasn't feeling good i watched the office on peacock peacock is the only place that you can get the office the nbc's one right yeah you could the office in parks and rec it's the only place you can get it and then so i use it for parks and rec the office and ap bio or have you seen ap bio no i don't know what that is it's like with the class i took in high school it's like the main guy from it's always sunny you know uh dee's brother dennis yeah yeah it's sick uh but peacock's good man pika it's just it all costs so much money at all i was looking to [ __ ] on one of them i thought peacock was safe but uh i guess no peacock's cool you're sponsored by peacock i guess i don't know what's going on i pay i pay for this man a dude do you have so much stuff here let's just bang through it yeah let's do one uh okay so let's do um do this tweet thing okay let's do this tweet so this guy sue hale who created mixpanel and now is creating mighty which is a cool company have we talked about mighty by the way yeah it's pretty awesome i think we talked about it so yeah we'll skip that for now anyways good entrepreneur cool guy whatever he tweeted this thing out and uh my tweet's not loading right now but i think it was something along the lines of it it said what's a company you'd start if you had more energy time or a lot more money right so which is basically like if you took away your [ __ ] ass reasons what's the thing you really should be working on right now i find that to be a very interesting question i have another question that's similar to that so maybe we'll do both of these questions today so i went through the replies and i want to read you five of my favorite replies and i want you to just give me a gut reaction hell yeah hell no or i don't [ __ ] get it um okay so the first one came from gary tan who's a you know big shot investor guy um first investor in coinbase made like a billion dollars on that so he he said a reference check network do you know what that means just when i say just that yeah yeah so uh well the problem being solved is how to get uh like if he's gonna want to invest in someone hey does anyone know is this person uh honest right or you're hiring somebody and you wanna know okay yeah you worked at this place how do i get a reference check so normally today you ask the employee they give you three names of course those are the three people that are only gonna say good things which is kind of annoying in the first place so you can't get really get the right people then you kind of have to bug them there's no real incentive for them except for to maybe help out their their ex employee and then you have to think of whatever questions you're going to ask most people ask pretty poor questions but there are better ways of doing it and in the end you're just trying to get this fuzzy picture of like you know is this person any good or not so that can be done better and i think he had some solution in mind which is like something on the blockchain which was just like um you are able to like i'm able to have people who are linked to me somebody can go and request a reference from them maybe there's a little payment made i'm not sure and then they share information but it's not publicly shared it's just shared privately with me given the context of you know who's who's the employee and what what this job is so i thought that was all right um i thought it was really specific one that i thought was cool cause there was a lot of like i'd solve clean energy and like i don't really know what to do like it's not that that's a bad mission it's just like what the [ __ ] am i supposed to say about that okay somebody else said create the largest employer of high school students in the u.s what do you think of that sick sick yeah i mean that's a that sounds awesome yes i mean what is that now mcdonald's yeah like i mean i mean probably honestly i guess it might be like mcdonald's i don't know what that would be i talked to these guys who were building a company i forget what it was called you probably know what it was but it's basically like an id indeed.com but it's meant for teens and it looks like tick-tock and like panda express and uh mcdonald's and like pacsun were all advertising on it and you could like scroll through and look at job opportunities yeah i want to say it was called like peach something or like lemon something or something like that i don't remember i don't remember but uh panda express was like spending a ton of money on it um and so uh anyway yeah i think that's cool i think it's a great idea uh it's not a good idea it's a great prize to go for i actually would say that this is like an interesting framework which is who do you want to employ 100 i've been saying this for a long time which is anybody who could figure out how to employ the stay-at-home mom workforce is going to make billions of dollars so if you just work backwards from there's a bunch of moms at home they want to earn a little extra income doesn't have to be a ton they want to maintain flexibility of being able to stay at home and work not like necessarily a fixed number of full-time hours or the same hours every day who can solve that problem and um there's only one example that i know of that's solving that problem i don't know if you know any um for moms yeah uh maybe uservoice.com i think they do it uh testing usertesting.com that's the one i was thinking about oh is it really my mom my mom worked for them yeah so oh my god that's so funny i knew about it what a random thing that we both knew that um so i would say so use testing.coming by the way so you just pay someone to like go through your website public by the way um and how cool is this they just went public and my mom stuck and my mom was like well say what it is so user testing basically it's a service where i have an app or a website i want to know where it's confusing for users like design makes sense to me but like sure enough when somebody else is using it they're confused they can't find the thing they want and they just record your mom like scrolling through the site so they have an army of testers which is just all the requirement is be a normal person you have we do not even want you to be highly skilled like you're supposed to represent the average customer so they have a bunch of people they send them a little camera that um that records their finger on their phone basically it records them like and they just talk out loud so that you give a task you say like you know find a christmas gift for your dad and put it into your cart and they're like okay i'm looking for the gifts for dad section i don't see it uh scrolling scrolling scrolling they don't see the button that says menu oh there's the menu uh dad oh it's men's men's okay i'll click men's um yeah i don't get how this is sorted oh this is by new release and you just talk through what's confusing to you and that 15-minute video goes to the company and the company gets to watch it and they get to share it internally their their researcher basically shares it with the designer or the engineer they pay like 300 for it right no no each test is like 25 or 30 dollars and then um and then well now it's all switched to subscription but originally it was like 25 30 a test the tester gets 10 bucks for doing the test and the company kept you know 15 20 bucks and so the tester's like cool i could do like four of these in an hour and so a like a bid would come online oh chipotle wants you to test their new mobile menu and you would just have to go quickly say yes and then you qualify they're looking for women you know age 40 to 55 in the u.s and you're like yeah great i qualify i can take this test that's a billion dollar company now it's market cap is over a billion dollars did your mom get paid did they give her shares yeah it's awesome so basically my mom was she first started off as a tester then she got hired by the company to review the other testers because you have to do quality control so she became like she would watch the test and give feedback to the testers like hey your audio sucks or like you're mumbling or like you didn't follow the instructions of the test um one more strike and you're out of the testing pool and so that was her job and she was the oldest person in the company i think so she was like my mom's like 63 now so she just retired this year so she was there at 62 years old my mom like had slack and like knew how to use all like jira she knew what a jira ticket was like it was crazy my mom like who knew and she got some shares and she had always told me like should i i was like yeah you want the shares for sure um and then she would tell me like hey the ceo did an all hands he said this this this is that good i'm like yeah it sounds good like this company's doing well i should have bought secondary stock in the company during that time because i had like basically inside info of like this company's pretty good is a good quality company and i was a user of the service as well so it goes public the other day like like two weeks ago and i'm like mom how many shares do you have and she goes looks in carter she tells me to share i'm like mom you made 150 000 no way and she's like yeah because her strike price was super low uh she was there for like four or five years and uh so i was like that's amazing that's like uh like that's that my mom was so happy yeah like for her that's badass and so like this is why i think this model of who do you want to pull is actually interesting because it's actually there it's two for two reasons it's motivating so like the fact that like they are employing uh mostly like i have no idea i should make this up if it's like mostly women who stayed at home for a long time and now they want to get back to it that's like incredibly motivating it's like look we're serving our employees yeah it's very noble it's cool let's say you want to hire uh uh ex-cons or something it's like look this is interesting or we're gonna hire a bunch of 16 year olds and it's gonna be the first job we're gonna train them how to be uh men and women and prepare them for the rest of their lives it's actually incredibly cool it's fascinating there's one um i wanna look up the name give him a shout out here so it's higher you hire a military wives as eas that's awesome it's called and it also helps with expectations so you know what you're wearing you what's it called squared away squared away that's cool a woman i think i think her story is that she i'm assuming she was in this position i don't really know but basically it's military spouses um and i was like this is a great this is a great idea um because you know this is u.s these are u.s employees they want this work they um you know they it's great to provide for their family while you know the husband's away i just think it's awesome and um and it's it helps significantly with expectations because then user testing knows all right we're hiring a ton of 17 year old high school kids like we know like here's the deficiencies and here's where they kick ass or we're hiring guys out of jail we know like here's where they're going to struggle here's we're not going to show so that's cool um what are what are some other great ones on here that's a good one it's kind of vague but pretty cool i'll do two more um okay we'll do one vr therapy so um vr is not there for like mainstream use cases the average person's not coming home and spending a couple hours of vr there's a few there are some people who do it they like to play games uh but vr is really awesome for like for like training like i know doctor like medical schools buy it so that the doctor can be like in the operating room they can make a highly lifelike simulation um and i think therapy is a good one too so um being able to put a headset on and really like change your environment change the state of mind be able to go role play through scenarios or talk to somebody and feel like you're there with them i think that's kind of amazing and so i look forward to seeing like vr with these like really specific high-value use cases um until like the mainstream thing is ready dude i'm down with that i also think i could conquer a bunch of phobias like with that right so i'm down i think that's cool like i know that like athletes are doing this so like you know um there's this great we both love uh like you know ufc and mma and nfl is this way also but there there's this phrase that conor mcgregor's coach always says which is you want to upgrade the software without damaging the hardware so it's like how do you train and improve without the without putting strain on the body hurting your body because training is so physically grueling so one way that they're doing it in the nfl is vr headsets the quarterback instead of just watching film their first person reading the defense without having to go stretch get their ankles taped up go out on the field potentially you know sprain a knee or get hit it's like they get to ex they get to re practice reading the defense and all the different coverages just in vr and then when they get out there on the field like it's that same first person point of view being able to turn your head and you're you're only seeing parts of the field like it's like pretty much like a one-to-one recreation i think that's kind of awesome i want to know which company's doing that um i'm sure there's a company doing that my favorite videos on youtube to watch right now are they take folks who play uh simul racing sims so racing simulations with vr sets and they have these like amazing setups at home that are like ten twenty fifty thousand dollars and then they go and put them in a race car and uh they do really good no they do really well you know it takes them like in all the videos i've seen it takes him five ten twenty minutes to like get used to the noise and get used to um like the smell and just the the slightly different sensation but they pick it up super fast and so it's guys who have actually never raced before and they get them out there and they give them the fast cars and they pick that [ __ ] up it's pretty amazing yeah like i think even stuff as boring as sales i think you could practice sales in a much more lifelike way i know that teachers are doing this for like how to talk to your student about if they're feeling depressed or if they're being bullied it's like you sit there a student walks in you can see their face they're saying something and then you have to react and then you have to like you're kind of like choosing what to say live it's it makes it you get to practice before you go do the real thing that's cool any other good ones uh there was a couple other ambitious ones so there's a terraformation one we've talked about this before which is taking just deserts on the on earth and turning them into like rain forests basically turning them into forests like putting creating a green oasis of trees there and like that cleans up that sucks up a bunch of carbon dioxide from the environment so it cleans up uh you know the the air as well as like turns it into livable land and so like if we can learn how to terraform which is basically like turned you know unlivable land into livable land um that's gonna help earth but it'll also help when we finally do make it to mars and we need to turn that into a hospitable place we're gonna need to know how to do terra formation so i thought that was kind of interesting and there's another one like that like drone based wildfire fighting so like sending in drones to put out wildfires i think that's pretty cool too i think that's great those are really neat what um what's what's another one what's this legal question for five million dollars this i thought was cool all right so there's so as you know i'm a tick-tock binger nowadays and tick-tock is the only social media that like i when i leave it i feel better than when i came in everything else like facebook feel awful at the end instagram i feel like oh man my brain is rotting twitter i'm like i was a waste of time just dealing with a bunch of people's bad thoughts and uh tic tac is really i i cannot believe how much i enjoy it like is it just entertaining addictive it's entertainment but there's a lot of education like i learned a lot of [ __ ] off dick talk now it's all little life stuff it's like um like i don't know those stupid examples but like hey if you ever take a photo and you see that like you know where you're like when you take a photo your eye can have like a red like you know you look kind of evil like the camera has that flash or whatever like a red dot if that's ever white you should go to the doctor um because there's actually like a very uh like there's a chance that that's a very bad thing and then this guy was replying saying actually i had heard that i saw him a photo like the land of that i went to the doctor i trust i had eye cancer he's like i actually have my eye removed but like it saved my life that we found it early and um i don't know this is random [ __ ] that to like you know just quickly seeing like how an avocado gets to your door it's like oh cool this farmer farmer tick tock is dope like parenting tick tock is great it's like oh when your kid is just not listening how many times have you done this i'm like yeah [ __ ] that's me and they're like here's a better way to say it i'm like thanks you know parent i never had to teach me how to do this really important thing in my life um like you just learn little [ __ ] so um anyways i was on it and there's this account called legal baddie uh legal batty is just like some hot lawyer and she's like here's my question for you she goes if i told you that you were gonna make five million dollars a year as your salary regardless of what you do so you're just you're going to work 30 40 hours a week you're gonna make a fixed rate of five million dollars a year what would you choose to do as your work like you still have to work to get it uh what would you choose as your job and obviously this is like you know a hidden question of kind of like what do you actually really enjoy to do if money wasn't an issue um and so and but you still have to work right so there's one of like oh if i had 100 million dollars well then i probably maybe it wouldn't work at all like maybe i would just do blah blah blah this is like you have to work to earn this but no matter what job you do you're going to earn the same amount so which job by the way i'm looking at her profile i love legal batty i love this woman why it's just her look what do you like she's just like she's a daddy she's she's this one's a lawyer is that her her shtick yeah she's i think she's a lawyer otherwise i just think it's maybe trust and eagle mean something else i don't know what's going on if this woman she's 19 and that's where she's going first gen lawyer from ucla law i think it's amazing she's probably making more money off tick tock and like she's like i like i like i particularly like it with women but i like it with men too where they uh talk about like cool [ __ ] like passing the bar exam or whatever but then like uh like she's got a bunch of nail [ __ ] i i always think it's cool where like you can break that barrier of like smut and cool stuff and also like legitimate uh life helping content i always thought that was cool yeah exactly yeah i'm with you she has 500 000 followers on uh on here and like you know her top videos yeah she's like doing like like purposely hot girl stuff and then also like telling you how to get into law school i always i always think that's cool law school and then downer dog then back to quick bar exam tip and then back to my favorite name and like here's like a here's like a a pretty racy bikini video of her right so yeah she knows what she's doing right like let's credit where credit is due uh she is giving the market what it wants i love this differentiated thing all right she's not just one of the like kind of like tick-tock hot girl in a bikini or whatever like she layered it with another like that this the skill stack as you call it right how rare is that there's there's not a lot of lawyers on tick tock there's not a lot of hot girls both she might be the only one right so she's competing in a pool of one and there's this video of her talking in front of like c-span like some type of press con i love this anyway i love her uh so what's the question five million dollars what would your job be yeah what would you do for your job if you were for sure gonna get paid 5 million what would you just choose to do for that 30 40 hours a week what's your answer now i want to hear yours first i don't know it comes to mind five million dollars a year and you have to have like a 40 hour a week job right yeah um definitely something involving like charity so like uh something involving not making money so if i can get five million dollars and all i have to do is like spend time like running a dog shelter or uh uh that's awesome i would do that in a heartbeat if i could pay five minutes that's not what i thought you were gonna say if i could do five million dollars to like run like a dog rescue i would do that in a heartbeat or to help inmates ex-inmates find jobs i think that would be exciting so or even like people like everything we just discussed about helping uh stay-at-home moms get on get employment anything that involves helping people and not making money i would do that yeah that's good uh yeah mine's kind of similar mine's kind of boring i would probably teach like i just love teaching so um i would teach now the question is what would i teach i think i would teach kind of like business slash life stuff to people who uh want to actually like they're really motivated to have a great life and have a great great like kind of business career and so those are the people i like hanging out with the most and that's the thing i like doing the most is basically learning [ __ ] and then just you know packaging it up and then teaching each other and answering questions you know talking things through basically with people figuring stuff out um so i think that's probably what i would do but i feel like you know your dog shelter thing made me think oh maybe there's an even more lightweight um just pure enjoyment like maybe actually i know what it would probably be i would be like a um i'd be a basketball coach or i would be like a uh like whatever the f minus basketball league is like i'd be a basketball player because like that'd be something that's the travel absolute most fun doing is playing basketball and like second best would be coaching a basketball team this woman legal batty has another question would you rather have 10 million dollars today or 100 million in five years that's the easiest question ever which one would you take 105 yeah exactly 105 is is is great um it gets if it's 50 i think it's a lot closer it gets a lot closer at 50 because 50 could turn into a hundred in five years in a bulk market 10 10 will turn into 20 but also you got to have 10 now and you don't have to wait five years of your life which is you know pretty significant uh but yeah i think my answer is i'd be on some gordon bombay [ __ ] and i'd go do my mighty ducks thing with some like you know high school team i think that's a good answer um you wanna do a few more let's do something else let's do it let's do a couple ideas so business idea all right problem i just ran into um sending a gift to your production partner your factory partner uh overseas okay sending gifts in general is hard sending gifts overseas even harder um because like just like the act of mailing things like oh i want to send them like you know a bottle of wine for christmas or whether it's like i can't mail that how do i do this i gotta go look up ups like alcohol shipment you know rules and make sure it doesn't crack and all this so i i was searching like i'd like to send my factory a gift in china is there just like a version of doordash in china i could just like go look at what they have push a button and they'll just deliver it to them and like it's done and i actually found this like really janky website um i'm gonna find uh i'm gonna find the name of it um but basically i found this like old school looking craigslist looking website and it was we send gifts to your business partners in east asia and it's like that's all we do um brows here's like 50 gift baskets ranging from like balling out to like ah we just met and um you know you want to spend 40 do you want to spend 400 you could you could pick and they just say great what and then their address field is like formatted for chinese address it's like you know like it's like it's just it's optimized where you have confidence that they will actually deliver the goods and i'm not gonna have to worry about logistics i'm just gonna be able to put in some money and i'm gonna have a thoughtful gift to my factory partner so i like this idea because okay there's probably some amount of people like me that are searching for this like okay it's christmas i want to get a gift for my business partner but do they not have can you not order an amazon thing and send it to china no i don't think so oh i don't i don't know maybe yeah maybe i could have just done something as simple as that i don't think i don't think so but maybe there's like maybe i needed to go on taobao and like figure that out yeah but that's the pain yes because i don't even know what it is exactly this was like pay with paypal you're done and i was like great um this is what i wanted and it was also like organized as a gift so it wasn't just like an item where they're just gonna get in a shitty amazon box it's like it looks like a gift it's a gift cat care package um which is nice that's like the goal of what i was trying to do it's like edible arrangements to china is what i was trying to do essentially so i sent it and um and i was just thinking you could just do this and then do like cold outreach to like the one million shopify stores and be like hey you know it's a good idea you should send your your factory you know your your manufacturer basket a gift basket and like you know a costume box it goes a long way you know these people you know they're they're key to your business and study shell blah blah and gifting is a big thing in china it shows respect don't be rude um and like you could do that three times a year like oh it's you know chinese new year it's whatever else and i think just through outbound you could create like a probably like a one million dollar a year uh revenue business maybe three million dollars a year in like two weeks i think you could create that so our uh listen to this crap so so the other day we got a mattress delivered to our front door a zionist mattress it's huge and it had sarah's name on it i go sarah why'd you order a mattress because i didn't order a mattress and i'm like we gotta find out who sent this mattress because we can't open this up because if you open it up it's a pain in the butt we're just gonna keep in the box maybe send it back or we'll sell it for like 200 or give it to a friend yeah so here's like a heavy ass huge box huge that you can open and you don't know where it came from yes and it says zionist so i know it's a cloud mattress i don't even know what size of mattress it is okay i gotta open it up and she posts on twitter and nick huber sweaty startup says that was from me uh and and i go oh very funny and he goes no that was seriously for me i uh we wanted you to know i invested into his storage business and he said we wanted you to be able to sleep well at night knowing that your money is uh uh like being taken care of and i was like well i appreciate the sincerity that's lovely yeah who the hell has a like i don't have like a spare an unmattressed bed yeah like i don't have an unmattressed bed like what were you thinking like maybe a blender would have been cool or like just chocolate like like like a pillow a pillow yeah like a fancy pillow i could use another one of those he gave me an extra mattress and so we've been texting our friends like does anyone need a mattress he created a pain in the ass for you yes i'm like dude just send me chocolate covered nuts like give me like like some flavored like some weird fruit or something i don't want a [ __ ] mattress he sent me a mattress i've got this huge mattress in the front door problem and i've got guests coming on friday and i'm like looking like a redneck with this mattress we have a bed they're staying in the bed that's already in the guest room and i'm like i look like an idiot i look like a country bumpkin with just a mattress on my front door and i'm like oh just ignore that we'll get rid of it so uh i'm on board with better gifting nick huber i this will make it to you i i really appreciate the the gesture though it was very nice um but like maybe like peanut butter cups and like chocolate covered nuts and like some chocolate turtles would be more sufficient i love it all right so that's one quick idea the factory gift idea with the outbound outreach to every fba and amazon seller and shopify seller and i think you could i think you could side hustle your way into a million dollars a year doing that okay here's another uh random thing have you uh have you ever seen uh emf protected pants is that for your computer on your balls is that your phone yeah uh no emf this might be em something else electromagnetic whatever radiation i'm on board with this though i hate like i i don't know it's emf the studies i don't know exactly what it is but like basically having your laptop on your lap and that heat is not i don't know if it's radiation or what it is it like has proven to kill your sperm another thing like wearing whitey tighties you know like tight underwear where your balls are against your body that actually uh kills your sperm because it it heats your body up too much let the baby swing you know yeah you can't be you can't be the birds gotta fly yes you can keep them in the nest so um so i've i've noticed that there's a few people in my life who i they're like the canary and the coal mine like they they kind of get really into stuff and i'm when they first say i'm like why are you even thinking about this why do you even care about this um you're you're one of these people by the way where it's like dude sam just got really into [ __ ] mobility and like you know stretching he's like got really serious about like ripped dudes who want to sw stretch and be like super mobile or it'll be like you know um he's on this kick about like really wanting like uh toughness challenges like life is too good he's too soft so he's craving this like ch core primal challenge in his life uh is that just sam being sam actually what it ends up being is like sam being ahead of the curve by like three years and it's gonna become it's gonna be proven to be like quite popular um there's a few people in my life that are like that my brother-in-law's like this you're like this my trainer i've learned is one of these people where he'll say something and he's like you know super into this thing i'm like i've never like he'll be like oh yeah dude i take kratom it's like oh kratom like what the [ __ ] is kratom like do you know what kratom is no it's like basically so so he's big into like these like kind of supplements nootropics which like you know if the promise of them is amazing but you like can't tell if they work or not like people who believe in them are like oh this feels great but it's it's that thing we talked about before it's like the best product in the world is cbd for dogs because yeah you think you're giving them you know pain relief but you'll never know if it does anything and like cbd for humans is like that too but the dogs can't talk and um and so there's a whole bunch of these like kind of nootropics or supplements that's like oh yeah i take lion's mane and i take like you know [ __ ] milk of magnesia i don't know whatever just a bunch of random ass names and then later like he said he was telling me about like tangaly and then dr hubermann came on he's like yeah i don't do testosterone anymore i do like i get it from these other uh like more natural herbs like tangali and whatever i was like dude there's only two people in my life that i've ever said this name tanga ali and like it's these two people and so i've just noticed he's ahead of the curve on a lot of these whether it's like fashion fitness supplements nootropics you know like books that he's into and so on the supplement side he's like really this thing called kratom uh which is kind of like a advil um like you don't take instead of you taking a set of advil so it's like kind of like it helps with your aches and pains without the side effects of like like thin your blood or hurt your kidneys yeah like you're bad for your liver and [ __ ] like that yeah and um so anyways where i'm going with this okay so he's like oh yeah dude he's got his fashion line coming out where he's like making clothes basically just like i'm his only customer right now because it's like not released but i just get to have a bunch of his [ __ ] and i'm like oh this is amazing um he's like yeah the shorts on these the pockets have like emf protection and i was like what he's like oh yeah like i'm big into like you know just why not why not have emf protection and i was like from what like he's like yeah your phone's in your pocket all day right next to your balls like you just don't want that you know i want to have kids i i don't want to be having all this stuff there and i'm like i guess you're right i guess i'm pretty sick i was like it's so normal that everybody puts in their pocket so like is there something to be worried about and i call this footwear fudd which stands for fear uncertainty and doubt so i i just made that up yeah there's a general trend i've created here called footwear and i think that footwear is going to be anything that's like oh yeah you know like blue blocker like uh light glasses um emf radiation proof pants um you know it's like uh you know like and that's that's not to say that they're all like it's not to say that any of this is false like it might be totally true but it's basically preying on people that are when you tell them oh did you know that paraben you should never have aluminum in your deodorant and they're like what aluminum am i going to die all right i'm never using old spice i'll use native deodorant instead it's like paraben free it's like what the [ __ ] a paraben but i i guess i've heard parabens are bad for you you know um like the guy who came on the show he was like oh yeah i don't drink out of plastic because you know phthalates i don't drink out of plastic either and it's like but yeah it's still super common but the smart people i know are like starting to say this word phthalate i never heard this word before but i'm starting to hear this and it tells me there's a bunch of people that as they become aware they're going to start to steer away or teflon pans right exactly like the non-stick or whatever yeah so i think there's just a whole class of products that are just footwear and you can just find the next flood of like what are people afraid of it's like oh like they want to do like um uv cleaning of their phone and their toys because uv kills uh you know covet and you know uv red lights that's a great one footwear that's fantastic so a few more like the water filters so there's those charcoal silver water filters that are everywhere i think just justin mayer said he tried to get a built like a huge one so all of his home water goes through with this thing yeah said he has like intense i asked him i go what do you have what do you do for water he goes i go way over but i have like a 12 foot tall system that's filtering is it like is it called like it's called berkeley or berkeley what it's called but when rob dear dick was on he said that too he's like i'm making a shower head filter company because like oh yeah what if i found out that i'm showering in [ __ ] toxic chemicals well then i'm gonna buy this attachment that purifies it like if you just put a little seed of doubt into my brain i'm going to be like yeah why not i'm just going to add on the side of safety and on in the same realm with that and i actually i would want to look into this but i think laptops on men lapse is like a massive issue right i i like it could potentially be quite you could just make a whole company just protecting men's balls from like the modern day you know harm it's like yeah here's a laptop tray that's like [ __ ] made out of kryptonite i was like you can't pass through this here's your shorts put your pi put it in this pocket it won't won't fry your balls uh you know wear this underwear uh because you know your underwear has you know cotton phosphors it's like what's a cotton phosphor i don't know sean just made it up but it's bad for your balls and so it's like did you just make that up it's good it sounded good right dude i'm telling you the heat it does freak me out like having that he like i feel it and i'm like oh this is horrible for me so i i have like a pad like i you put a pad on my lap you know pomade you need to apply to your balls every night uh before you sleep because you know that when you sleep gravity pulls your balls and it's bad for you like how do you like make up an endless number of bulbs okay here's this one that i saw these guys launch and they advertised with us early on and i was like this is the stupidest thing i've ever heard of why are you guys even doing this and now it's a billion dollar company manscaped have you heard about manscaped i have i asked a buddy i said what's one of the best investments in your portfolio what are your best investments i thought he's named some tech company some cyber security company he goes oh manscape is great because they raised like only a tiny amount of money and they're worth like yeah like close to a billion dollars is it a billion dollar company you think i i don't know something like that but they sponsor the ufc and that's a really expensive sponsorship and they sponsor a ton of stuff if you told me that they do like 150 million in revenue i wouldn't be surprised i think it's definitely over 100 million in revenue for you think it's over 200 i mean i don't know and i've i've never used one i told her i told sarah to buy one for me because i won one for my nose hair and i think they have like why did sarah have to buy for you why didn't you just buy it she wanted a christmas present for i told my christmas i was like give me like the nose hair one um i think they have a nose hair one uh but uh like one is it all in one i don't mind using i will give you that cover they give you that air cover to be like yeah i just want to trim my beard in my nose and uh oh what do you know it comes in all your attachments maybe your boy will start manscaping yeah i'm cool with chair like using that on my face and i'm no the the nose one's different uh but but the the manscape like buzzer it it's just a normal i think it's just a normal buzzer i i don't know how it's actually different than like a normal hair much different and they crushed it this cat i never in a million years would have thought that this was gonna work it sounded like a joke when it came out i remember just being like oh that's a funny that's a funny joke of a company cool cool joke of the day for a startup yes and they kill it they sponsor all the major like boxing and ufc stuff these guys are killing it uh and it doesn't look so i'm on board with with with the protector balls that's a good business and fud is a phenomenal uh name what's it stand for footwear uh fud is fear uncertainty and doubt so they say this in the market a lot like if people are like oh i heard china's gonna ban bitcoin or like isn't it true that like uh you know satoshi was a you know part of the nsa it's like this is just fud you're spreading to get people to be uncertain and doubt and sell their positions dude that's great like compression socks i buy compression saw so that's fud wear i have no idea if it works but it's what is it supposed to do compression socks when you run i have calf pain and achilles pain all the time compression socks or socks that you pull really high up to your knees and they have a lot of compression on it and it keeps your calf calves tight so if you wear like compression shorts like that tight underwear for your thighs it's like that for your calves and ankles gotcha okay i like it i dig it um can we wrap up with one thing uh so recently this bitcoin thing um craig wright i don't know much about it other than like one article i read i guess he's an australian guy and he was being sued by this person who wanted a share of the money for what's the story uh i don't know about his lawsuit but i know about craig wright and that he basically for a long time has been claiming to be uh satoshi nakamoto so well so he claims to be the creator of bitcoin and then people who are smart in the community are like there's no [ __ ] way so people but this lawsuit basically he's being sued by the spouse of someone that's me this craig wright had a partner the partner died and the spouse of the partner sued craig wright and craig wright won the lawsuit and winning for what uh she said that you owe me money because of this reason and that reason we created this you and my husband created this thing together you owe us some money and in winning i forget exactly how it worked but in winning the case the jurors said well no you're satoshi and you worked on this alone and so uh like in order for him to win in a weird i don't know the exact details but in order for him to win they were basically saying yes we believe you're satoshi and satoshi worked alone so okay here's the here's the story so uh kleinman versus wright uh the jury ruled that david kleiner's relationship to correct did not constitute a business partnership meaning the estate was not entitled to a share of the satoshi nakamoto fortune which wright claims to have control over as the self-reported creator of bitcoin the jury ruled against wright on the conversion count awarding awarding 100 million dollars to kleinman what a rule against right yeah so he said they got 100 million out of it i don't know because i thought he was celebrating it was a little confusing but the point was is that this like this legal team okay they wanted billions they didn't get that but they got a hundred million against him for the unauthorized use of funds from climate rights shared venture wnk info defense research llc i don't know this is from something else so did is this guy the guy who started it that's what i wanted so basically um so he claims to have invented bitcoin then um there's a great clip by the way of vitalik buterin the creator of ethereum uh co-creator of ethereum uh on stage and he goes uh there's they were talking about it and usually people like you know like in a w in a conference panel people are usually pretty like you know they don't take shots at people like live there and he just he just pipes because you want to know what i think and they're like yes we'd love to know what you think he goes he goes um he gives this like quick like two-minute rant that just destroys craig right where he's like i think if you're the creator of bitcoin you ever and everybody was saying you're not and you keep trying to tell people you are all you have to do is one simple thing you just have to sign something with with satoshi's wallet and that will just show that you're him and the fact that you're not doing that like the you know he he calls them like some like you know awesome razer ox razor or whatever like just some term like that he's like the simplest explanation here is that you're not satoshi because if you have a simple way to prove your claim and you do not prove your claim using the simple way you cannot prove your claim and um so you kind of just like [ __ ] on them right there so who crowd went wild so who is this you think is he he's he just died or he's still quiet um the best theory is that it's uh that it's this guy hal i forgot his name is hal uh alfini um this was so hal finney was like a cryptographer he received the first bitcoin transaction he was the like the second wallet and normally like what does the developer do when they test something that's like oh i sent it from like sean a to sean b like my test account basically like that's how i do the first transaction and um he was like very active in the forums and then he died right around the time he got als and died around the time that the last known time that satoshi ever posted anything um so you know what he was like why wouldn't he tell do you think he why wouldn't he like tell his wife or his family or you know like because it looks like he has a wife on these pictures yeah well a maybe he did and b um like you know some people are so mission driven in their thing and their thinking and like you know there was a there's a real genius of the idea of being like i'm gonna have this as a pseudonymous name satoshi nakamoto i'm not gonna use my real name which means i'll never get the credit for being a genius if this works but also it like it's kind of like the parent dies so the child can survive it's like the only way a currency like this could have really worked is if you couldn't point to the creator because then they would just attack the creator they would say the creator has too much they'd say this guy has a ulterior motives he has control he's he's too powerful to you know he's just the new the new bad guy you know okay you're bad at the federal reserve and the governments uh yeah now you're mad at this guy for for private citizen being in control of this so do you think this is him i personally think it's him um like i've looked into a couple times about like who are the most likely candidates um you know is it a group of people uh was it the government themselves was it one person and it does seem like it was uh like you know i guess like i shouldn't say it does seem like it there's really no evidence of the existing evidence that's there this kind of like speculative data point you have how phineas fits the story in my world view the best so i think it's him god that's i love these mysteries which would mean that it's it's sort of gone like his coins are locked up um unless he gave him to his wife unless he gave her the keys uh and like you know and she and told her don't touch it because it hasn't moved not a single coin has moved uh ever and um you know i think if he did it let's say he did give her instructions how would i give instructions i would say um i would probably not actually let her have it i would say this file is going to be available to you on this date um 20 years from now and i would say you know follow the instructions inside so i wouldn't even give her the opportunity to make a bad decision because i would say if these move before bitcoin wins um then it'll be this will be just very destructive for it like if the creator of bitcoin starts to sell bitcoin that will trigger like a huge sell-off in the market because it'll be like oh the creator's alive they don't believe they're selling their coins who is it it'll create this like whole drama it'll hurt the project but has any money ever left his account no not a single satoshi has ever left his account so then he would have had to have create a different account for her to live on or something yeah which could have easily happened right um you know at some point but you know people can also see the ledger so they know who all satoshi sent the they know which wallet satoshi sent coins to and um some of them are like known identities like the other people that were in this like crypto like the cypherpunk community that wanted to test out the project early on uh but like you know he very easily could have just had her set up mining a mining rig so it didn't even have to come from his account he could just say because he didn't give himself the coins he mined the coins sure it's just that mining was so easy at that time so you know she could be minor number eight um you know that mind some coins and that's it that's she can live off that yeah god well we should see like you know house finney how's she living is she like in a in a 40 million dollar home in venice i i don't even know if he i i mean there's a woman with all these pictures with him like it looks like a wife i don't even know anything about her i just googled it it doesn't say anything about the wikipedia about his wife um but oh yeah his wife raised yeah so he does have a wife yeah i'd be curious i'm looking at pictures of his house when he's dying like pictures of him dying and he's in his home it does not look fancy yeah yeah also als just looks so brutal man yeah it feels like the worst completely debilitated uh that's really tough yeah so anyway that's fascinating we should do like an entire episode on that that's this [ __ ] is so interesting to me yeah i agree we should we should just do the research of like okay what is all the research that's out there and like what's the conclusion i think people are i'm fascinated by like this story i think it's one of the coolest [ __ ] out of straight out of a movie but it's actually real life things that has ever happened you know i like that and silk road but i think the silk road case is far more cut and dry than anyone thinks i think ross did it i think ross did everything right you know what i mean what's the con what's the controversy people think what many people were running it dred scott pirate whatever the the what's the name dread pirates roberts or whatever uh they're saying that that was multiple people and whenever i post about raw soul bright people are like free ross and i'm like well like he did kind of hire people to kill one of like other people like i don't know like what you have you seen the comments so you have a youtube video about your story yeah they hate and they're they're like they're like like there's like an army of people that love ross and hate they hate anybody that says anything bad you didn't even say anything bad i didn't say anything bad i said i think he did it but like but like my thing is like uh like i mean he sold like he sold drugs so there's some consequence to that not life but some consequence but if you did like murder for hire yeah life is is definitely fair if you do it three times totally fair right and when like i read that book american kingpin i looked at some of the evidence that i'm like yeah there were some bad cops working on the case and those guys got in trouble but it definitely seems like this guy did it i don't understand how there's any shadow of a doubt right by the way fran finney's twitter bio i'll just leave it on this note she she says i graduated from caltech i spent 35 amazing years married to hal finney um who lived with als in 2009 2014. currently living in dubai i vow to spend the rest of my life making him proud i thought that was nice yeah man she seems like a sweetheart and she turns out turns out nothing happens to me drives like a ferrari and a bugatti and like only wears gucci badass for the rest of my life with these fresh ass gucci's yeah gucci lights hilarious you see this uh did you ever see that meme you know that guy husballah the little like the little i love him so he tweeted out this thing he goes man people say i had this like people always talk about my disability do you see this meme yes and what did he say he goes yeah i got disability to make that bread make sure him holding a huge block of cash he's like disability to make this money i love that kid he's not a kid i think he's like 20. yeah i don't know what to say i'm gonna get canceled just trying to like just try to describe anything about him without being offensive so i'm just not gonna say anything all right let's roll i'm out of here [Music] you

netflix was like where do you want to do the special la chicago new york i was like nah son davis california [Applause] [Music] what's a day for you like uh because you're you're completely free now right i'm completely free well you're never really freaked out you know you build a prison of your own making now yeah so you know two little kids a day starts with morning shift dad duty yes i take the mornings i got a two-year-old and an eight-month-old yeah and so we're like we're the same like yeah you were talking about it yesterday i was like i feel ya yeah and we so i do the morning shift that's just straight dad time then i basically pick between i got three kind of major projects yeah so i got um investing so sometimes we'll be looking at deals then it's um could be content but content is really kind of on a specific niche schedule it's like monday wednesday for an hour we sit down we do the show and that's kind of it i don't do too much more than that i write sometimes and like twitter emails or whatever and then i have a business so me and my wife started an e-commerce business oh cool and so that that scaled up so basically in the last year that went from zero like just an idea yeah to now we do like over a million dollars a month of revenue on that business i was looking for something new yeah that i could do as a side hustle something that wasn't like yeah gonna take up all my time yeah but could still be a valuable business that was uh you know like some part-time basically yeah and so that's what have you always been like that multiple hustles have you always been that guy i was always that guy they weren't working before so really i was trying to do that and i was failing at it and like since high school like you were that dude so no so so a lot of people have this story a lot of entrepreneurs have this like oh back in i was my lemonade stand i was selling i was doing newspaper routes and i hired all these kids yeah baseball cars i was due the lights were off in my head until like 21 so like i was like i'm gonna be pre-med i was gonna be i wanted to be a team doctor for an nba team so yeah okay what do i do i wanted to be on the nba team all right genetics not working yeah team doctor that seems like yeah my genetics and like my interest yeah and only when i met a team doctor i was like wow this is boring as [ __ ] like you're just like you know these are just joints that are in pain and there's only so much you could do it's like not as exciting i need a plan b i was 21 when i figured that out wow and i was like you were still an undergrad yeah i had just taken mcats i was ready to go to med school i was like uh what else i had this random business idea with a couple buddies that sounded kind of silly it was so silly that it was almost like not dangerous you know how that is like yeah sometimes a very serious sounding idea is almost too intimidating to do but this almost seems so goofy it was harmless i'm just gonna go try i'm just gonna do this but yeah obviously i'll eventually go to med school yeah obviously i was like i'm not gonna you know i just and you're doing this for a couple months also um you're at a point in your life college is so unique in the sense that you you're leaning on this thing where if people ask you hey what are you doing i'm a student yeah exactly i got my cover yeah i got my cover story yeah yours is similar right because yeah totally right yeah freshman in college exactly so how long did you have the like okay so let's take that when did you decide all right i'm gonna do this for real this will be the job was it right away or did you kind of play with it first and then decide a year later or two so it's really interesting so for me i was a it's so funny you were at the show last night and so you could tell especially in the bay there's just this level of connection i have in this city new york certain cities where i'm like i know you guys yeah we're all kumon kids and they're like yeah that's okay we're like we're like type a like uh we're good we got to do that you know i i know you like i know you i know what your house smells like i know the way your mom talks to you i know you i've seen you at family parties right i know you like i really know you and there's a level of um intimacy there with that material the point of the story is is that i was part of that camp where there was a clear track um relatively speaking in the community i wasn't the brightest kid every community has like the stanford kid i'm always like i go up to like people in dallas i'm like yeah you grew up in dallas right who's the stanford which one yeah which one you know who's nikhil yeah i'm like yeah yeah so assuming you're not in a kill what was your path right everybody has one somebody's like run off man bruno went to mit i was like he's the star who's the star of your community there's a kid right yeah yeah you're not gonna name him it's fine so every kid he won the spelling bee yeah and you're like you're like okay this person is the shining star of the community what what's my path um and so i was a speech at a debate kid i go to college and the first open mic that i did a friend of mine funny enough um who i knew in college was illegally downloading a ton of stand-up comedy uh i went to college during like the kazaa yeah limewire limewire i think we're the same age i'm 36 yeah i'm 33 i think yeah so we're like we're that same era and um you said 33 i think yeah i haven't been thinking about my age in a while yeah yeah i think i'm 30. i think i am 33 yeah i mean 33-34 i think i'm 33. yeah of 36. and um so i i went to college during that era he downloads a chris rock special never scared i remember that special he's in the purple suit and i remember being like oh this is funny speech and debate this is connected to the dots yeah this is forensics but funny right oh i i see the matrix and then i come to find out oh like a lot of the comics that i really loved there were certain comics that really thought critically like that greg giraldo rest in peace one of the all-time greats he was a former attorney right and he became a comic dimitri martin who was really big at the time in the early 2000's early odds he also was an attorney worked at the white house for a while and then like got into comedy and he had a big run in comedy anyways all these people that i like carlin they were these critical thinkers that kind of were doing speech and debate presenting an argument or a take and it just was a light bulb moment and i had this thing inside of me i'm like oh this is one of the first things in my life where i have an alacrity and speed at which i do this that i never had at kumon or at the sat or at the mcats or at the lsats like i can pick this up really fast and i don't know if you felt this i think a lot of you know desi kids have this or whatever kids in general your parents will put you in soccer or basketball or swimming and you're like ah there's always that kid yeah from just the first drill picks it up fast and so much of adult life is figuring out what's my thing that i pick up fast like that and that was that was my mom 21 years old uh when we started that we had this business idea yeah and it was like we didn't even know what the [ __ ] we were doing right it wasn't nobody does in the beginning yeah and i remember thinking oh man my parents probably not gonna be cool with this if i because especially this our idea was to create the chipotle for sushi so it wasn't like even like a business idea like oh bioengineering blah blah blah like you know some new microbial whatever yeah why does it sound like you were high when you said that the way you said chipotle is like such a like i wish i was that would be a better excuse we just uh i just tried sushi for the first time and all before that i was eating subway in chipotle a lot i was like why don't i just why isn't sushi served like that the way i'm used to yeah there's as simple as that yeah so i was like all right i'm gonna did you always have so this this moment this problem-solving thing yo why don't they do this like this have you always that was the start of it that's what i'm saying i didn't always have it yeah i started to realize that when i write i've seen interviews with naval and the vols like i was always like why doesn't that pizza place do this yeah i wasn't like that and i i say this because i remember i used to watch those guys like naval he's like a hero to me right he's like a mentor in many ways yeah and when i hear him and you know you hear these people talk about how they they just had it from day one or you know early age yeah it makes you think if you don't have that your thing which most people don't by then it's like i guess i'm just not that type i guess i'm just not cut out that way i guess they're different than me yeah and so i'm always very like a friend about it which is like nah there was no signs of anything i didn't know what the heck i wanted to do i didn't know what i was good at until i did and that just light bulb comes on when it came on yeah and i remember going to my de i remember we started working on it and like you said i had this alacrity of i was good at pitching it was a pitch contest that we were working on first yeah business plan pitch and were you a great student were you like mediocre and that's why i called my dad i said you know hey um you know i'm thinking about doing this thing i was kind of expecting the indian parent thing which is like no stay focused med school remember the whole thing you just worked on for four years why i paid for this expensive ass college yeah like do that thing yeah and he was like he was like i think you should run with this like oh you think it's a good idea because no i think it's a terrible idea i think food business is awful i think uh restaurants are terrible idea uh i don't understand what you mean you know but you don't know anything about sushi so i think it's a terrible idea in like 10 different ways yeah he's like but what time did you wake up this morning i was like i don't know like 8 30. he's like and what'd you do right away i'll say i started working on he goes that's why i know you should do this because the light obviously yeah he was like that's dope we've been trying to get you to like study and like just care about it yeah care and like wake up with your own light bulb on and be able to go do that thing what is your what does your dad do let me ask you he's uh he kind of had a career where he was in like he was an engineer research like worked at a company worked at a big oil company and then he he realized like it was like 30 something he looked around he saw in his office he's like my office is the same office i've been for 10 years yeah i got all these patents on the wall he said like these are just like certificates they give me to like pat me on the head and keep me you know just to keep me doing my thing sitting here like a scientist like doing my thing he's like the guy i hand the pat the idea to he gets promoted he gets to go to london and he gets to like yeah he takes my idea makes it sound like it's his idea yeah he's like maybe i should do the business guy thing because it's like those guys just take my ideas and like run with it yeah so then he switched into the business side and so that's why he kind of you know most parents have this where like the thing they regret they kind of push their kids like no do it you know like so for my dad those two things was like social yeah he's like i didn't i didn't didn't i didn't know anything about socializing till it was almost too late so like go to that party he would drop me off at a party you know he would be like you need to go and i'd be like uh i'm scared i was just socially scared i said high schooler right i didn't know what the heck was going on and did they let you have girlfriends and stuff yeah they were cool about it they were like whatever awesome yeah so they were pushing me to again fill the gaps that they didn't have yeah and one of your mom was cool my mom was my mom because are you the oldest sibling yeah so the oldest paves the way so my sister had already done it yeah and so my mom was like she had to talk she went through vietnam with them yeah she was she was like all right look your sister didn't tell us anything and did everything anyways yeah everything we told her not to do she did and then she didn't tell us which made it worse and we found out later as we do and it's like bad by the way i know the listeners sometimes get mad at this they're just like get to talking about bitcoin the reason why this is no the reason why this is important to me is like understanding someone's drive shaft is so imperative to um why they are where they are yeah you're looking under the surface yeah like sometimes people are like ah that's stupid but i'm like no cause all of your i'll just speak on my like my field which is not big it's relatively narrow if you take 100 comics and you're all in the green room you'll quickly see the ones that are talking [ __ ] you'll see the ones that don't like to write you'll see the ones that right use sometimes comedy in the comedy club as a crutch to give them a place to go to just socialize the ones that love it the ones that are sociopathic sycophants all of those things but if you start to find out more about them which is why you know sometimes you come up in a comedy scene i came up here in san francisco in the bay you quickly find out oh this person's running from something right this person do you know what i mean and that informs the next 15 dominoes right of their career in their life when you did that because comedy i think is kind of known for that like yeah comedy's like this um torturous field where it's like you know nobody makes it then even if you do make it it's like continue you have to come up with new material reinvent it every year or every two years yes it's just this brutal field yeah and then even the the better you are at it's you're a truth teller yes right and often these truths are kind of ugly or they're kind of painful about yourself or about society about whatever yeah so there's this like darkness that's with like a lot of great comedians sure uh it lives with them yeah you seem like a well-adjusted you know good looking guy you saw the show last night did did i come off as unhinged or no you came out you came off like you came off like i'll tell you exactly it came off to me and i don't mean this ah this might sound no no no no no no be straight compliment yeah you seem to me like somebody who isn't the naturalist naturally isn't the funniest guy like some comedians you just see it you're like dude they could just be doing this at their dinner dinner table yeah and they're just probably slaying whatever room they're in they just happen to be in a big auditorium yeah yeah yours i could tell and my sister even said that she goes he works on his craft like you i could see that the stories you were telling the beats the like the punchlines it just felt like everything was put together it was thought through the lighting the sound the like position where your body language on the on the stage it seemed like you had worked this set not like this guy's just funny he had two drinks he gets up here and he starts spitballing yeah which is like you know the vibe that some comedians give yeah totally and so to me that was what i got was like you're it's like it's ironic it's like this is kind of like the indian kid who like does like hard work and practice and he's like really good at the thing that he set his mind to yeah that's the vibe i got is that accurate or is that like mine yeah no projection of [ __ ] i think i think that is definitely accurate like i i really do care like i love it i love this thing okay do the thing do you agree with my first thing which is amongst a hundred comedians that are like at the same time yeah are you the naturally are you the average above average below average what would you say yeah so what you're talking about is just like natural um there's people that look funny talk funny say things in a funny way so their voice sounds funny they look funny you're already in the top heap think about those guys chris farley yes uh another comic i love felipe esparza felipe esparza just looks funny hannibal burris has a has an amazing voice chappelle has an amazing voice right do you know what i mean yes exactly he just like sounds funny he's brilliant he also sounds really funny chris rock has a great voice right right he sounds funny um yeah i look like a news anchor you know what i mean like i look like i should be doing like the five-day forecast or whatever um but i also have like uh i have a genuine love and i have something that i want to say like there's a message yeah i just want to say something there's something inside of me that i want to say and um yeah one of the things that i i definitely feel is like when i put together a show like on tour i want to give you a show right like i want it to be a show and um for me putting together mixing stand-up comedy storytelling and theater that to me was my elixir yeah it was my elixir like we were at the show i wanted i was thinking about what do i ask him i was like yeah i got a bunch of questions but the one that i truly wanted to know which i don't even know if there's a good answer for this yeah but the question i was like at the end so you went up there for an hour and like by the end it was like you know in tetherball when one person gets the momentum and it's just swinging and the other the person the other person is like flailing they're helpless like the ball is just out of reach yeah but the one person knows they're like i'm about to you haven't won yet but the momentum is so strong yeah from about halfway through the show to the end of the show that's i felt like it was tetherball you were dominating and the crowd was just in the palm of your hands it was so good and at the end you know mic drop crowd goes wild what is that feeling like because most human beings are never going to experience that but it seems sitting there i'm like that must feel [ __ ] amazing even though you've done this many times oh it must feel [ __ ] amazing does that what does that feel like you know what it feels like the end of the set every artist and i think every human being um whether it's intimate relationships personal relationships collaborating in business family dynamics and hopefully your career everybody wants to feel seen and there's this moment in act two of the show where i basically go man i want to give you guys all of me yeah i want to close the gap between who i am on instagram and who i am on imessage right and when i look in people's eyes i could tell everybody that's in like the bay area work from home crowd they're like [ __ ] i can't be me yeah and there's part of me how are you laid down yeah when i lay down i'm sharing all these secrets with you guys yeah and i'm like there's this moment of do you see me i want to be seen right like when i'm with bina when i'm with my spouse she's like hey when we're disagreeing on something it's like you don't see me like you actually don't see me for who i am right and the most um enriching thing about that last moment when i say good night and i see people and their reaction i feel seen i'm like oh i think y'all you guys get me right and to me laughter in that exchange in that live experience is an expression of love you know what i mean because i can't make you laugh i can't like force you to laugh much like love making it's an intimate act right and that release of laughter is like oh you get me right you feel me it was the journey from the beginning of the show so that's the end that's the climax yeah that's that i feel loved and seen yeah before the show yeah and again we're sitting there and the openers went on and we said okay he's about to come on and my sister goes oh man like what would you feel if you were about to go on and i said well you know he's uh i was just thinking in my head i was like yeah i know he's done this many times so now he's figured out a system yeah how to deal with that combination of excitement and nerves gotcha uh what's the what's the feeling like for you now and what's the system you've developed to get on stage and have that switch flipped because when you came on within two seconds it's like this guy's in a state of mind he's in a state as we say yeah of like he's here to perform he he knows what he's here to do yeah there's no like tiptoeing into it yeah so i was wondering what do you do the five ten minutes before or an hour before i don't know what's your kind of like warm-up routine yeah yeah i think you're ready the listeners want to know this i'm sure i don't really i this is your personal curiosity i want to know it and i've my trainer has this great phrase he goes who are my customers the people that love what i do because he's he's like people always ask oh who your customers is some demographic right some like some like marketing intellectual answer he's like yeah easiest way in the world is the people who who who your customers are the people who love what you do yeah so just do what you do yeah you will naturally attract the people who love that yeah you'll repel the people who aren't interested yeah you will never have to guess what the heck people want because you just do what you want so that's the approach i take to the pod yeah um no i love it man i love i love talking shop like this for me it's actually it's a it's the three hours before so what i try to do before any show i try to make sure that like i exercise in some capacity because and i don't know if you feel this way and maybe it's within our community it's so funny to go back to what you're talking about where you're like oh he seems like a guy who works really hard this is funny i was doing mark martin's podcast and marin said the same thing about me he's like yeah you seem like really put together and he's like why aren't you unraveling like the way other comics are right and i'm like yeah i'm just philosophically not from that camp i'm not from the tortured artist camp i'm more from the place of like i'm creating from a place of passion and love and actually real talk it's about emptying the tank i just want to put it all out on the court right you know and this court happens to be the stage right um and i want to do my best i want to be like i put everything into picking out this outfit i put everything into picking out these jokes these tags the stage design the lighting design like this is it and i want to know when i go to sleep here at night when i put my head down on the pillow i did everything i could right like living a life without regret and only you can answer that is the best everybody's talking about chasing happiness to me it's about chasing satisfaction like that self-satisfaction and you know what it is right you know what it is right and you know when you sold out you know you got a good result but you kind of didn't do it the right way yeah that sticks with you and some people just like let that stick with them yeah other people say all right even if i won i'm not going to win on those terms again yeah if i lost i can lose on these terms and be good at night yep and and i'm sure there's listeners to the pod that spend their time retweeting the right things and quote tweeting and dunking on vc people and you know they they say the right things they'll regurgitate the right opinions but they know when they put their head down at night hey you're supposed to train you jerked off instead you were supposed to do this you did but only you can answer that right so you can signal all you want for me what that stage represents is like no i'm putting myself in a high level of accountability in front of 3 400 people right i'm putting it all out here right even and if you don't think i'm good if you think i'm corny if you think i'm whatever hey it is what it is but i stood here right and i did it i did me and on my terms and i did my best so you're saying so you're saying three hours before three hours before what i do is i like to do the the uh some form of exercise and i try to get out of my workout workout or you're just trying to break a sweat what are you what's the yeah trying to do on tour it's just about body maintenance so i'll do running i'll do some pull-ups some core stuff just stuff to get my body going right and start breaking a sweat and what i love about like right around minute 30 to 45 is i'll get out of my head and into my body and so much of life right now getting out of your head and it's funny i i called you randomly i was appreciate i appreciate you picking up the phone the other day we had a long conversation we can get into that later but so much of i think what you do and what you put out in the world and i call it like tech twitter talk it's all in your head intellectual it's all just heady anxiety inducing stuff ethereum's up just solana's this it's like it's all headshit right it's not a body feeling thing right like grounding yourself two feet on the ground i'm here in this moment what do i do and so much of performance and to be great at it the best chappelle the best performers they're not in their head they're in their body they're really there right somebody screams somebody says something somebody heckles they're in their body when you watch steph curry play when i watch devin booker play these guys are so in their body right luca is the best at this he's in his body he's in the he's in flow right and so luke is like a kid and kids do this well yeah kids do this pretty naturally i love that the older you get the more you get which is you gotta yeah you gotta fight that right and so that's a great way to get out of my head get into my body then i'll probably i eat something um i take a shower and then i put i put on the outfit and for me it's like being on stage uniform and putting on that it feels like a uniform and like for me it feels i wanted to feel like a show like from the watch to the jacket to the pants i'm like there's a level of confidence that you have when you move into a room and you're like hey from from my heels all the way up to my head i'm wearing my armor right like i'm coming correct right and you just you carry yourself with a little bop you're like no i feel better about myself my [ __ ] isn't slouching there's no stains on my stuff you know what i mean like the moment i saw you today you walked in you're wearing your tech pants i could tell you washed them a few times but there's some stains on the back side you know what i'm saying but that feeling of like no man when i'm coming in here i'm gonna be fresher than sean yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm just gonna be fresh yeah that already gives me a feeling of like confidence i know what i'm doing you know and and by the way the opener marcela like marcella was just like dressed to the nines you know it's it's a feeling then i get to the show um i finish eating i'll meditate so meditation for 10 to 15 minutes allow me to just again get out of my head and drop into my body and something simple just head space right like i'm not getting too crazy about it um and what i love about headspace specifically is so much of it is just basic breathing establishing a level of intention i'll meditate then i'll pray and for me like prayer is really important because it's got to be about something bigger than just myself and my corporal being i'm like what am i doing this for and just establishing an intention and for me the intention is like love let me give joy to people right and i want the seed of everything that i'm doing to come from that not be like not be petty energy angry energy um i'm gonna prove you wrong energy like i'm in the laughter business like i'm here to make you feel joy right um and that warm feeling so establishing an attention there i get to the i'll get to the venue about an hour before i have a double shot of espresso um i'll let my bowels do what they do you always get those jitters like you gotta pee you gotta do what you gotta do and then about like 30 to 45 minutes before i like to be loose just with the with the staff right let them know like hey what's up how are you door guy security guy openers right you know what i mean another way to get out of your head by the way yeah yeah be with others be there yeah they're serving others in a way yeah and then um about a half an hour before um i'll go to my green room i usually write it down i'll write down it'll just be on hotel notepad paper hey what are a couple new tags that i'm working on tonight right just move the ball forward a little bit remind myself yo i'm gonna do this um [Music] for example last night one of the things i talk about in act one of the show is fertility and a new joke that i did was like you know what it's like being infertile as a man i felt like woody and toy story when his arm got ripped off that was a that was just one line and i was like hey make sure you do the woody toy story line right you know and uh every show i try to add a few of these extra moments and you add that up over the course of like a year two years three years you start to see what works and what doesn't work and i'll i'll have a thousand three thousand different variations of that right and then i get on stage and by the time i get on stage there's just this feeling of like now it's just pure play whatever happens happens right and um when i'm on stage what i try to do is i try to remember when when i'm opening in front of my crowd they're like really hot and one of the things i try to remember is don't yell don't scream try to actually bring them to you like set the tempo of the game right don't get like too excited or too hot like you can whip them up but then like sit down at the stool bring them to you and like make the room feel like it's coming to you you know what i'm saying do you ever watch a film of yourself basically yeah i watch tape all the time yeah and so i see bad habits it's kind of brutal huh yeah yeah but it's cool though actually like those moments where you like is very painful for your ego and but there's a lot of growth in that the only way to break through and get to like the next part is is that part i've done that even in the business world and i'm going to keep bringing it back because that's where a lot of the audience lives yeah the things you're talking about of how to get ready for the for your performance your day what you do that's i mean i athletes do this before they get on the field you do the performers do this before they get on the stage yeah i do this before i get on my laptop it sounds lame because i was like dorky but it's like well i'm trying to be my be the best version of myself yeah i'm trying to set an intention before i go out here i'm trying to get out of my head so i can do my best yeah i do all the same things and i just apply it into this world and it doesn't matter if it's a call with a supplier or it's a podcast episode or whatever before you came here yeah got it i got through my routine yeah to make sure that is your routine similar-ish very similar obviously compressed not because you know a longer day so i'll i'll try i practiced it where i can do it in 10 minutes now i can get that state in 10 minutes that's my goal really has three three components breath work so this first three minutes of breath yeah and so i can use breath to change my physiological state right away it'll be push-ups and breath work so i'll just do 15-20 push-ups i'll do breath next three minutes again how do you get out of your head it's not about you gratitude and think about others i have this little exercise i do again sounds a little bit cheesy but i'll say it out loud people won't try this just try it i just let uh i rotate through almost like in my head so i'll visualize like let's say my mom my sister whoever people i love people in my life i just visualize them laughing so i just visualize them laughing which is them in their joyful state yeah there's no like i don't to think about why i laugh nothing i just i've seen them laugh a thousand times i just see them all laugh in succession in my head yeah now i'm not thinking about me and my problems and my needs and my desires my i'm just thinking about them yeah and i'm just it's a good energy that i like yeah the last time you do it you do establish an intention i do establish it and then the last bit is i remember why i'm here and so the thing you were saying you were saying i want to bring joy love to the audience want to make them laugh make them have a great time yeah same thing i used to think what am i going to say whether it's a meeting a presentation a podcast what am i going to say what person going to show up what am i going to say yeah that used to paralyze me just like what am i gonna say i want to get the right words i wanna [ __ ] up so then as soon as i start talking there's a little editor in my head being like that sounded dumb oh yeah yeah you walked up and you said that thing is stupid and then i'm in my head while i'm doing the thing and i wanted to just be clear and okay how did i do that so then i started stopping but i just i imagine the end so i already imagine after the i already imagine us saying bye to each other at the end of this yeah and if that happened that means this all went well yeah and i remember okay the people listen to this what are they gonna be thinking they're gonna be thinking blah blah blah they're gonna be saying these things yeah dude that that episode was amazing dude i love hustling man you have him on again he was so good right so now i don't have to think about what questions do i ask i'm already remembering what i'm trying to deliver and then it's i'm not gonna learn a new skill in the next five minutes like the performance is gonna be based on all the hard work i've done over a decade about whatever i'm doing yeah so i don't try to like cram for the exam i just try to put myself in the right state of mind so i just performed the way that the things i already know how to do yes that's my routine for for you know my how to start my day how do you get over you're part of this thing again i call it like the business internet world yeah which can be filled with people that are sincere in their intentions it's filled with grifters it's filled with sometimes people that are trying to do get rich quick schemes you're part of this really it's actually quite similar to hollywood and politics in that way yeah because if you work in show business you'll quickly see that too yeah you know like [ __ ] can run from people that are like really about it artist artists nas kendrick lamar all the way to logan paul and jake paul like that are just about like the wwf circus show of it all right this world that you run in and people are now talking about money in business in a really interesting way when people come out and they comment about you and your businesses and they quote tweet you and they're dunking on you and that's a part of now the social currency this is a social currency that you're a part of oh the more subscribers i get then i can do me on these commercials and we can sell the pod you're a business guy right how do you deal with those uh negative critiques does it bother you does it what's um so the honest answer is yeah every negative comment yes is like 10 times 10 yeah every positive comment you know and so that is the initial reaction but there's also a difference between response and reaction so the initial if i'm not in the right state of mind that initial reaction i'm going to clap back or they're so dumb because of this and this i'll go look at their profile you only got 11 followers and you're saying this [ __ ] maybe yeah maybe that's why you have 11 followers because you think this way you know i'm right you're wrong blah blah blah yeah and i realized pretty quickly that doesn't get me anywhere in fact it would waste like almost like half a day or a whole day of mine just checking the mentions for good and bad like this happened if i go viral good you know i go check all them i'm just addicted to refreshing nothing you did an amazing bit about this that was the most for me those most relatable yeah you played it up it was amazing yeah people aren't gonna know this go see the show you'll see this part about the the the comments likes yeah social media cocaine cloud back cocaine cloud exactly um but with that comes the the kind of the the negativity and that also is fun it's this thing in its own way yeah and so what are kind of like where did i land with all that yeah uh okay so you know the good they think i'm like a genius guru i'm not uh you know my wife will remind me of that real quick and you know the other people who think i'm an idiot uh scammer or whatever or people who think i'm an idiot who doesn't know anything about anything yeah or i'm wrong or whatever yeah or they'll point out that i've stumbled and said this said this the wrong way or whatever yeah um okay where is my focus gonna go like focus on why i'm so great or why i'm so terrible really does nothing for me right so i said okay i do need a sounding board so i'll say so so i get a reaction from people good or bad i'll be like hmm let me just get curious why are people reacting this in this way i'll take a minute to observe that yeah then i'll go internal and i'll say what's my what's my judgment because i guess my rule that i created for myself was that i want my own opinion of myself to be higher than anybody else's opinion of me you mean positive opinion any anything if i think something sucks that i did yeah i don't care what anybody else says i think it is so i basically want my opinion of myself to be the trump card and so that works uh for self-respect like yeah i stopped seeking the respect of others because i'm like well if i don't have the main respect for my respect then what is all this other stuff worth but then how did you get that wisdom because that's because we are social creatures my trainer so my my trainer's kind of my bro my train of running for my first trip he's also like a kind of like a he's like me he's like dude it's all in the mind this is a solar player solo player game yeah and we gotta train this just as much as we train the rest yeah so he he said something at the very beginning he's like why do you want to work out and i was like oh i just want to get fib i've got real fat doing my last company i just want to lose weight okay he wanted like you wanted to know the drive shaft what's driving you to do this yeah what's making you think that what's making you think you're fat what's making you why'd you call me today why today why didn't you call me six months ago what changed yeah and eventually got down to i had this experience i went with my two best friends who are business kind of like mentors bit older than me all the things i do they've done a little bit more yeah and we all went on a spartan race together and i thought i'm a little out of shape oh we're all out of shape it's no big deal yeah we went on the spartan race and i was way behind and i was just huffing and puffing and i was dying on this thing and they were like trying to help me and every time they helped me i just felt like a [ __ ] i was like oh man wow like this is embarrassing i'd rather they just ran and finish the race right and left me to like you know die on my own on this map the worst thing you could do is like push for me from behind because i'm like it's like don't give me the pep talk no anything but yeah yeah so i told him i said i was pretty embarrassed i had this the situation i said i just want to like have the respect of the people i respect i thought that sounded like a good thing to say yeah and he goes he goes like i respect he goes respect's one of those things um because you want to give it not seek it he goes so he does two things he goes uh we're not gonna do this we're not gonna start this program from a place where you're trying to get the respect to others he goes whenever you feel you lack it's time to give so like let's not worry about who you're who what respect you're trying to get from others and who you're trying to prove to yourself to and all that let's become a giver of respect to yourself and to others so and so we started flipping the script and this became one of my philosophies which is whatever you feel like you lack in the moment that's a signal it's time to give that exact thing and when you give it you realize i got it i have it in abundance it's kind of like a circular way of thinking about it yeah but that was the the thought process for me at least uh on this on this topic i guess that's cool yeah that's really interesting man i don't know you know i i know i called you about uh one of your tweets that went viral again and it was about how it was specifically about the metaverse and how the digital world will matter more than the physical world and i think the reason why it so deeply philosophically rubbed me the wrong way was because the pseudonymous digital world has commodified cowardice in such a way that the real world and the game checks you and what do i mean by that you know i grew up i was a you know desi kid who'd play at 24 hour fitness right you play ball at 24 fitness first to 12 straight up or win by two but if you lose get the [ __ ] off the court right i remember there'd be these guys these guys that were nice it'd be 11 11 straight up this dude would step back hit it and as he's about to hit it he'd go get the [ __ ] off the court right and you would respect it because he stood there and he's like i beat you 12 to 11. it's over this is there's no argument yeah this is our objective this is objective reality next yeah and you got to sit there and you got to run it back you got to wait another one game or two games or three games and then run it back but for the first time in history there are people that stand on stage that stand on the stage of business or life or comedy or art and they use their actual government name and then pseudonymous trolls who don't use their government name can launch digital drone strikes right attacking you your character your family that can then potentially impose economic sanctions upon your future yep and they do it pseudonymously yeah philosophically i don't rock with that say that [ __ ] with your chest right get on the court with me at 24 hour fitness let's cook like let's play each other that's what it's that feeling that fundamentally bothers me this is a dishonorable craft right it's not honorable it's not a fair fight the way i look how do you think i should unpack that that's the problem i was like why does this bother me yeah well that's the first good that that's the right question yeah which is not why are they doing this why is this election why does this bother me right the curiosity is what will set you free because you got to say do i enjoy yeah focusing on this do i enjoy this like trap this like uncontrollable yeah you're not gonna stop it yeah we all agree on that you're not gonna turn them all off right so that's not gonna happen the world now this is the world and i'm also thinking about my children too because i'm trying to prepare i got a three-year-old and one year old how do i prepare them for this new world order right and in a weird way let's i'll keep i'll keep riffing this out with you let's figure this out in a weird way there's times where i'm like yo i wish you punched me in the face actually i would prefer that how many fights have you gotten in your life i've gotten into three okay i've gotten three i've lost all of them yes one time some kid was trying to steal my shoes i didn't let him and then he just beat the [ __ ] out of me but i'm proud like yeah i kept my shoes he wanted my jordan 13's but i kept him um but i but i remember i remember being like i like the the irl nature of this there is some level of virtue even in this fight right that it that it ends and it ends today we've resolved this here right which is why you see when people fight it's gone the beef is usually gone out it's gone as long as the fight was on fair terms yeah both people are like sort of mutual respect by the end yeah it's over yeah it's over and settled um that doesn't happen yeah this is the first time where we don't really have that and um the reason why i'm saying say say it with your government name if someone says sean is corny or hussein is corny anytime any comedian or contemporary says that i go cool put up your hour against my hour oh i'm corny i'll do 10 you do 10. right let's see what it is let's play the 12. right let's play the 12. like i love the dance of it straight up or win by two well it's a merit-based thing yeah but but when baldwin is a merit-based thing again you said you can get up on stage yeah even no matter what your name is you can't make them laugh yeah you can't just force them to laugh yeah it is marriage you must earn that laugh it's why my favorite thing right now in pop culture is the verses right i don't know if you saw dipset versus the locks but you could see jadakiss go up against right dip set and i thought dipset was going to win but jadakiss was so nice he just buried them and it was it was let's play to 12. right you play your records i'll play my records and i and there's something so honorable in that in this new digital world order is so not honorable right because there's no reconciliation at the end either so i quote tweet you and by the way [ __ ] posting is now incentivized so actually being a negative nancy and being an absolutist in your position is now commodified and incentivized so that you can't even recognize yo you won i lost good game and there's no shake on it well it even gets worse because what you say online what you display online the photo you take online is so easily faked so it's not even like 20 it's it's like if instead of going and playing that 24 hour fitness we each submitted a mixtape yeah and so here's my mixtape versus mixtape like well how much editing really is going into your lifestyle your opinion your persona yeah your face all of it is filtered yeah it's edited is curated leaving out the bad [ __ ] and the more real you are so the way i look at this and by the way i'm not by the way i'm not [ __ ] on digital skills so if two people are competing against each other in video games i still like that like there's npa 2k tournaments but it's are you better at 2k than me right so i think about like the way in which i want to live my life and i want my kids to live honorable lives too hey compete and there's no there's no there's nothing wrong with losing but like be a good competitor be an honorable competitor say good game right but when i'm using my government name and ball drape 79 is risking nothing i'm like this is whack this game is whack and in baldrave even you can't deny that but i don't know if the people on the other side recognize that well go ahead i mean i just love your analysis on this so i guess the way i look at it is with the the pendulum has swung so uh before and you know sort of like in the past when everybody was online uh everybody was in real life real name merit based you had still had people's opinions in their heads they just couldn't broadcast it um people if somebody if somebody thought you were corny before they were thinking that they weren't saying it they couldn't get amplified from each other or they would say it and you're like okay cool so you think i'm corny it took a buy-in they had to annie up yeah they were gonna let's square off in the lunchroom so you think i'm corny now i can make fun of your shoes i can make fun of your hat i can make fun of you know what i mean who you're dating i can make fun of your mother's the barrier to enter is so low now right fake name fake handle whatever you can just go on there say whatever you want you know what we're analyzing right now this is kevin durant syndrome kevin durant is one of the greatest basketball players on planet earth and there are people on the internet that get kevin durant and his feelings riled up yeah and then he says he doesn't care but yeah so this actually but because to me i was like yo if and i talk about it in the show i'm like yo these memes hurt my feelings i'm a person right but i'm like yo if kd is getting in his feelings seven foot two wingspan can cross people over built like build like a velociraptor but can move like a point guard and like yeah then just like shoot and sledgehammer on you like and he's getting in his feelings about these like layman's at home we're in a big fundamental shift in society and culture in a way that it never was like that before yeah so i i think basically the reason you get the rewards you get are because of all these things as well so by you going out there under your real name the real face with authenticity telling your real life stories which is what you do right you're talking about fertility issues you're talking about stuff like that yeah you're getting like the score the meter is just running up why because it's in such scarcity today we don't get that from most people in most situations so when somebody does it you're running up the score real quick right you get the benefits of being the counter to all high level of accounting you're running counter to it you're putting it on the line so you're getting all of the benefits and you're getting the scale of those benefits before without technology right you'd be doing local shows and i saw this guy in north carolina he was amazing the guy you know in texas like who i don't i'm not a fan of that person i've never seen them yeah you do the netflix show you do twitter you do stuff like that you're reaching everybody everywhere all at once yeah and so you're getting the benefits of that leverage yeah and so you're running up the score because that is what society lacks today this this real like honor code yeah of like look i'm gonna go try to earn it under my real name and put myself out there i'll let you judge me and if i'm good i'm good if i lose i lose yeah and i'm willing to play at those stakes because you're willing to play you're getting all this benefit and people who are not willing to play they're not going to get any of the benefit they're going to get so they get this proportional like you know small bit of success if they just like kind of [ __ ] on you yeah they get a little immediate dopamine hit but ultimately they sort of don't ever really their score never really goes up so you're talking about the capital markets it's the efficiency they will reward they will get durant or whatever yeah or you're getting rewarded for being authentic and being accountable and you're getting and with that power comes the trade-off which is would you like this giant prize yeah and here's the here's what the hair on the deal yeah here's the cost of that big reward yeah where you blew up in like i don't know five years or something like that yeah the last five years you had this like media meteor rise yeah awesome it's because you had the right answer when society was going one way you were a awesome counterpoint yeah you're willing to say what you was on your mind willing to say what was right and you used technology to go viral as hell because you had something good it went viral and spread like crazy so you're going to have to pay this this tax this vig along the way and you got to recognize there are two sides of the same coin and so that's where it's like the the the 24-hour fitness scale where it was everybody was being accountable yeah cool but it was only operating at this like small scale it's not it's not scaled up yeah you're getting the benefits of this thing right and with that comes certain trade-offs and that's i think that's just like the way i look at it and i think that that's a good framing society's going that direction and so you're already on the right side of history here where you're willing to play a different game and because of that you're going to win a very different process and you're seeing that your career basically is an example of that so just so the listeners know i called you on the phone when that thread went viral and i said hey sean like and i'm so glad you picked up very few people pick up these days like real talk pick up the phone and i go hey man like this actually irks me here and you know i'm such like a i'm an artist man so i operate from a feeling thing and then i start questioning why do i feel this way and i was like i'm an irl guy but when you're telling me everything is going to be on the metaverse i don't want to be a pseudonymous drone right i don't want to i don't want to throw drone strikes at people that i can't see i want to talk about what's real and if you watch the show like i'm talking about what's real about me and bina my kids right what i went through going at dictators and and governments and it's real this is real life i talk about lawsuits and this just crazy [ __ ] but i'm like hey it's real it's my experience right i'm being sincere and authentic in that experience and i got the receipts and i don't want to live in a world where i'm a reddit commentator and you're a reddit commentator and let's just like argue at infinim that's a zero value add to society to me right but well i guess i guess what you're saying is right you're like well the more you double down on that so see the capital markets will perhaps right now for that accountability right so the comedian who gets up there and just tells dick jokes is not going to have the same emotional resonance as you going up there and talking about fertility issues and then you're dealing with it and what that was like and the attention that's loaded in that because anybody i just had two kids anybody who's been through anything with kids and that whole process yeah the uncertainty like we didn't even have any issues but my wife was worried that we might have issues they loaded the relationship with totally i'm sure you have friends that went through it let's get started earlier because it might happen you know like it's a connection so you put yourself the real you out there yeah you get the reward right comedian who just makes the dick joke i laugh i move on with my life i don't feel like i'm going to back this guy the way that i felt like by the end of your show i was like i'm about what this dude's about oh wow right because that's you that's what you did you drew a line in the stand you said this is what i'm about yeah you've told you built your case yeah and at the end of that how could you not be like right right i'm on the island if you don't so it was a very different thing it wasn't just laughing it was like laughing but also this is this person just put their balls on the table and said this is what i'm about yeah and you got to respect that and then you got to react to that you got to pick a side you're either about that or you're not and that's okay you can go either way yeah but he made it very clear and then i'm like that guy's going to build an army because he's going to be there's a lot of people who are going to hear that be like mm-hmm i rock with them i rock with that yeah whereas if you just did a bunch if you just did a bunch of impressions of like what indian auntie sound like i would have laughed yeah and then i would have been like next time you have something i'm not lining up for it i'm not camping out for it right because i don't i didn't connect in that way right but you did it so i think you get paid for for doing that so you're saying just be aware of that be aware of that and and like recognize what you're just remember what's already working for you and why why that bothers you is because you're the opposite of that yeah but there's also a piece of it that could be you but you've intentionally driven the other way so when you see it you're like i built my brand being the opposite of that so yeah it's like when apple sees a poorly designed product steve jobs was disgusted when he saw other products that were not thought well thought through he was annoyed with it in a way no other ceo was right because he built himself as we care about the inside of the [ __ ] design of this inside the case what that looks like these [ __ ] don't even care what the outside of it looks like right you know so like it disgusted him in a way that it disgusts you somebody who has no accountability sort of stands for nothing just trying to dunk on people on the outside right so i think that's that's that part of it to go to the metaverse side of it i think it's not as different as you think so let's say the world does move to where with these online identities and that that digital identity matters a lot yeah you know uh you have a screen name and you know my first screen was mr goobapple you know so like whatever that's that's what's yeah let's say that let's say that stuck with me right yeah it's so funny you know you know my first screening was hassan i've always been this way yeah it's always yes it was taken and then i remember on aim hussain minaj went online you remember the door you see here the sound of the door open of course right and then i blinked in my face yeah and i messaged him and then it's just immediately the door closed [Laughter] so i think that yeah whatever your screen name is it'll be the same like this name you have huston minaj that's what was given to you it's your it's for better words it's your stage name for the world sure and you're building up you're building up a reputation yeah it doesn't matter if that name was mr gubapple or it was husson it doesn't really matter what the real name it's wherever you're whatever you're going to make accountable you're going to say hey if you like me if you trust me put my reputation on this name yeah and then if i [ __ ] up that name has like lost its value yes well the better verse you might be able to pick a second name but like it it's still gonna work the same way yeah where people are still gonna have to put up or shut up under some handle it just doesn't matter if it matches your social security number it's kind of like my my take on that but i don't know it's it's a wild world of how that's going to turn out i think we're still like it's just we're still a ways away from that where do you how do you get the points of like the things that you do that you're doing right now like the fact that you take time to train and think you're you are preparing your mind as a physical corporal being with two feet on planet earth rather than being just like this guy with like the headset and you're just like in the matrix you know what i mean and your body body's literally just being used as heat to [ __ ] be a part of this yeah ready player one world yeah you know what i mean and i'm just like yeah i'm not gonna say i'm above that like maybe when that's here maybe i will like yo i remember afraid my kids are gonna like tackle me and they're just gonna put it on my head and just be like just join us yeah join us dad i'm like i don't want to do this well it's like i don't know if you remember before the phone i remember thinking it was like bat [ __ ] crazy that people watch movies on this tiny screen why would you do that that's like i don't want to do that that's no fun i want to love going to the theater i love the feel of the newspaper yeah if you had told me hey you're going to check your phone like 170 times a day yeah i would have been like why would i do i'm not a hamster like i don't want to live that rat lifestyle just constantly checking for my email yeah why would i need to do that i can just check my email once a day or whatever you know like yeah the things i do normally today would have seemed really abnormal and i could have i would have been kind of disgusted by some of the things yeah and then other things i would have been like there's no way that you know like how would i be able to do that it's not plugged in where would the internet come from like how do you now so now you've embraced that but then how do you eliminate noise from your life like one of the things i'm genuinely curious about is like trung your friend trunk who's hilarious online [ __ ] hilarious right uh my question is i was like how much just internet garbage is going in that guy's head every day i want to meet him where is he in like vancouver or something like that he's in vancouver i should have invited him to the show we are just in vancouver but i'm like how much just fecal matter of garbage is going in your head for him to be like this is the meme right he has to sift through right that's his job it's filtering through yeah yeah she is one here's a good one yeah just hold [ __ ] yeah um and how does it affect your just your like your body and mind so what i'm asking you and i would love to ask trung is like for you guys how do you eliminate just like this is just sheer garbage and if 80 of your day is just sifting through that which is so much of what internet discourses and again the algorithm is incentivized that just people yelling at each other not solutions oriented thinking and conversation and dialogue how do you then have like a high efficacy rate because i feel like we live in an era now where you're busy but you're just you're doing absolute horseshit yeah this is where i've heard this great quote uh from this guy he's an entrepreneur i don't remember his name but he told me something he goes he's talking about like i was like so what are you doing outside of building your startup like i was talking if i'm gonna invest i first get to know like what do you do when you're not coding this thing yeah and he was like i said oh i got some friends here's what we do and i go he's like yeah we're making music i was like so you're trying to like make a band he's like no we just like we make music together because it's more fun than listening to music i go what and he goes he goes yeah we make videos i'm like you trying to be a youtuber he's like no it's just better than sitting there and watching youtube he goes i have this rule which is good friends consume together great fans create together uh he goes so you know you can look at all your relationships and say what percentage of the time are we just consuming we go to a restaurant which is consume [ __ ] versus cooking something together yeah when we go to the movies we just consume something or binge watch a show versus like try to make something together make some art do a project together build build of gingerbread yeah it doesn't matter yeah what the thing is yeah he goes like the great relationships in my life i i recognize they're great because we create and the ones i want to be great i create more than we consume right so similarly whether it's even with work i try to create i think most people are consuming like 99 of the time i think they're literally just mouth open ingesting like whatever the hell everybody else is you know the few content creators are creating they're taking it all in and then they're hoping that their brain doesn't get like you know turned into like peanut butter yeah and what i do is like i know it's very addictive to just sit there and scroll to feeds yeah i do it from time to time but yeah i try to say all right i need to be creating 80 of the content i'll consume 20 percent yeah but of my time that i'm thinking about content that that's like that's like doing this i'm not with my family i'm not in the gym not whatever yeah i'm gonna be creating yeah and so i can only consume to the extent it helps me create how do you build community in the startup world is not hard because entrepreneurs like comics probably where we're all trying to do something really hard build a business from scratch like you know works you know and uh so like you know there's a misery loves company type of thing where it's like there's this there's a rapport that's built amongst people like we'll help each other out we'll get along with each other because we're all going through the same [ __ ] so my community became other people who were startup founders when i was doing that and now that i'm kind of more creating content and you know building an audience and a brand it's people who are trying to do that and trying to figure out like like we have one friend pomp who yeah he's amazing at content like he's great he's building his brand he's like the bitcoin guy he's the bitcoin guy yeah but when i look at it i say wow there's a lot of things i admire about what he did but i also got to learn that like i would never want to do what he's doing he does this thing he does a daily business show on youtube now every day he wakes up five in the morning or whatever and he's creating like a three-hour live show yeah he's doing his squawk box every day every day and i'm like i get it that would work i would never want to do that i never want to go that path so i'm like yeah trying to triangulate and learn from yeah he did these other three things i thought were [ __ ] dope that i'm like oh that's a great idea i should add that to my game yeah it's just like any athlete it's like anybody trying to get good at anything you surround yourself with people who are in the game trying to do the same thing as you that's your peer group and you commiserate and you share strategies with each other and then you have some people who already like have done it they're kind of your mentors and you go to them you know from time to time and ask them for stuff i'm sure you have the same thing totally i bet yeah i asked the jedi yeah yeah there's a bunch of jedi and then there's other padawan that are part of my like contemporary class that yeah all the time yeah and how did you get good like when did you go from suck to non-suck like because everybody starts i believe that suck that's like the pixar way i don't know if you've heard this before pixar is a philosophy which is all movies start at suck our job is to like remove the suck yeah so there's non-suck left so i took that approach man the daily show changed my life man seeing the way jon stewart worked and especially that institution both daily show and snl love them hate them they're part of their comedy institutions snl for 50 years now daily show 25 you know that um [Music] are these pedigree boot camps for understanding the process about how to think about comedy right and one of the things that i realized is what john taught me and trevor showed me you know john really unlocked the code but it's like it's all about your take what is your take and being able to back it up so it's not even being funny first it's what is the take what am i trying to say what is the take what am i philosophically artistically trying to say and um let's give an example you had in the show last night you're like you met this guy who's a private equity guy you're like what the [ __ ] is that yeah he's like oh yeah we do like lbos you're like yeah as you get to the bottom of your like so you use other people's money to buy other people's companies and you ruin the people's lives and then by firing them and gutting them making them profitable and then you flip it to somebody else yeah you're like yeah i'm not cool with that like yeah i think that's a little bit of a [ __ ] up way to win is to like yeah this is kind of like vulture just legal stealing yeah yeah yeah yeah that was never your money yeah also it's it's it's stealing well it's legal oh just just because legal doesn't mean it's ethical right you know bill cosby got off legally right we all know what it is and so like that is what the joke i would start with that's my take around leverage buyouts and vulture funds right then you start tagging it you can do that bill cosby tag he got off legally it's not right you know we all know it's on ethical whatever what he did or whatever the glove didn't fit o.j yeah right all right so you must go ahead okay um and then you start tagging and then the funny just starts flowing from there and then you go that's like this and then you can just what are you doing you're sitting in a room with like a few people you're just spitballing riffing bantering just like that yeah and then eventually you got to put pen to paper right and you got to start writing the act one and you start to see when i watch weekend update or when i see an act one on the daily show or any of those death segments i now see the matrix i now see oh i know how to construct a seven and a half minute piece right last week tonight patriot act i know how to do a 27 minute piece on it right i know the beats and the flow of that and what was really cool was it just gave me that um that central kind of like philosophy how do i do this and so the first 10 11 12 years of my career i was just trying to be funny and what john in 2014 really helped me unlock was like no no you need to have like um there needs to be an actual process and purpose to what you do now i'm not saying this as a virtue thing no just you just need to be like even if you're doing dick jokes or even if you're being silly there needs to be you need to understand the game and how to heighten it comedically right even stupid silly jokes you know are like that and so um that was the unlock for me and then just reps trying to get as good as possible now my my next thing that i'm just working on the most is the jazz part of it like yo just have fun that's always been one of my weaknesses because i like i told you like i'm a kumon kid you're structured and so and so we're so built around fear and so there's these moments that i try to have on stage i don't know if you saw is like i'm just kind of unhinged like the first like three or four minutes of the set when i'm just i'm literally just riffing yeah when i was making fun of the kids shorts there was a kid in the front row of the show just short shorts yeah yeah the eyes were just like all up on the chair and then like the seats in the back and you know seeing people come in late and then riffing off of that it's pure jazz now jazz has structure but there's also play right and then you can go back to it and like it's that organized chaos that i'm trying to like start to tap into yeah and you're doing well now you i don't know how you were doing before but i'll say let's say when was like the when did things start getting real good is about last four or five years yeah i would say probably around like white house correspondents dinner that was my kind of big breakthrough right national recognition moment of like you don't have to be a fan of the daily show or just a fan of comedy like i penetrated you know front page of the news feed type fame and clout and credibility type thing yeah and you uh so you start doing well start making money doing this thing which is amazing yeah so hard to do so you did it uh yeah and what do you do so let's talk about the breakout how you broke through but now that you're here you've arrived you're doing really well now business side of things yeah how are you running the show so what are you just in like dude i'm just [ __ ] touring 24 7. i don't even think about the money just goes on an account i don't think about it yet are you like investing what are you what are you thinking about yeah and so you know that's the real interesting thing is now i'm starting to think more about the business side of things not in so much of the i'm a venture capitalist i want a 100x i want a thousand x the way show business works i think like any business really but show business per specifically is extremely predatory and it's built on this idea that um we provide the labor and they're kind of banking on you being desperate dumb and not owning your ip and right content creation they kind of are banking on that and they meaning like the big studios the big streamers the powers that be the agencies all those sort of things they're banking on you not knowing what it is and i think for the first time in history we're starting to see close groups of collaborators starting to come together and build things themselves right they can still run them through the big pipes in the studio system but they're also like no no we independently operate we cook everything we write everything completely so like me and prashanth we started a company and we write we produce we executive produce people's projects but we do the whole thing kit and caboodle right and hypothetically sean would come to me and go hey listen man i'm hosting this 15-minute event at this thing and um i want it to [ __ ] rip i want it to kill i go cool let's what's your take what do you want to say blah blah blah come sit down with me in pv let's break down your act one right and we'll tag it up and do all that stuff and that's a cool opportunity for us to collaborate and for us to brown paper bag amongst each other and i love the ethos of that like hey let's build together right you're an artist and a creative i'm an artist and a creative i think lawyers are important i think agents are important they're fine but they're necessary evils this brown paper bag this honest relationship that we have as artisans together is of you know the paramount importance and the more artists we can learn about just the business side of things i think it's going to be for the for the better the other the other part of it man is i'm just i'm so much of my life was just trying to make it yeah now i don't even know what to do with money i'm trying to understand what is money what to do with it right and what's your mindset now so what if where have you arrived on that to me money represents you know um in capital represents two things money will not solve all your problems but money can take care of certain certain problems so if there's ten problems four of them say child care my daughter's braces uh you know being able to uber back and forth to the airport i can take those problems off the table right it will not solve my marriage it will not make me a loving father or an attentive father those are problems i have to solve that won't make me in shape it won't help my mind but at least taking those pain points off the table means a lot to me but there's another data point as an artist that money can help solve two things it gives me the opportunity to say no to things you have [ __ ] you money like uh you should host this game show nah i'm not gonna do that right it also gives me the opportunity to imprint my world view upon the world on my terms right so this so the show you saw i own it outright right i i'm not just in the comedy business i'm in the trucking business like i i own and operate that 18-wheel truck you're like mayweather those lights those like the there's the holodeck that i'm standing on that glows like i own it like you know i don't know what i'm gonna do with it after the special but there's a sense of empowerment of yo i want to say this in the world and i have the capital to imprint my world view upon the world right and that there's a deeply empowering feeling in that the next thing that i'm trying to learn and the reason why i want to be on podcasts and meet people like you is artists we need to learn more about how money works so once you make it and you want to buy a house and provide for your family and you know hopefully have child care in some capacity and how do you not blow it on dumb [ __ ] to the point where it gets really sad man there's a lot of artists and entertainers you'll get hit up and they'll be like hey so-and-so has cancer we need to do a comedy benefit to pay for their medical bills i'm like this is sad man this guy was on snl this guy was on blah blah blah this guy was on a sitcom and i'm like yeah this has to stop right and um my question to you would be and this is the thing i'm trying to figure out is if you were an artist and you all of a sudden we make our money in lump sums you all of a sudden were given two million dollars a million dollars five hundred thousand you just make these lump sums what would you do with that money yeah that's the fundamental question that i'm trying to figure out and answer well the first thing is there's gonna be a bunch of people telling you what to do with your money and you gotta correct them at all costs correct the people that are swooping in with the next great opportunity and trying to get you to buy [ __ ] you know kentucky fried chicken franchises and [ __ ] like that like yeah you have to sort of say all right how do i get a trusted person who is an expert at this yeah that is actually good at their job and how do we align our incentives so that they're not able to just pillage me uh like happens to a bunch of athletes yeah um they're not just my homeboy you know from from high school or whatever yeah i trust them but they're not video experts like yes find that intersection of trust and expert can i tell you where where it gets really hard you know i'm fortunately like again i grew up i'm kind of just you know i'm a nerdy kid i was never i don't roll with an entourage right you know i pulled up in an uber he heard like solo with my backpack so i don't have all those pitfalls that other uh artists and entertainers have where they're a couple of jewels yeah jewelry purchases a couple car purchases and a divorce away from just like losing it all yeah you know i'm a pretty like level-headed you know guy that being said you know it's interesting you you try to do your research and it's it's crazy i'm 36 years old i'm starting to read about um [Music] you know financial literacy and stuff like that and i'll read books i'll read jail collins book you know and you know he's an advocate of vtsax right just vanguard funds yeah but when i go on the internet and i start looking through your mentions and i go through your page or sam's page and nobody's trying to [ __ ] with bts like you old man you're not on the solano team how do i how do you figure discern truth ontological truth reality and light from just this banter just this just never ending yeah up down nature of noise so here's what i would do all right so here's how i would break it down i'd say what do i want so there's some people who are saying i'm trying to become ditty i'm trying to become kevin hart i'm trying to do whatever i'm trying to have this mega mega empire billion dollar status some people who say look i came from nothing and i got this thing now i'm not i need a certain level of security and safety that's what makes me happy is knowing i can never go down to zero knowing that i can never [ __ ] up and lose at all it is it is safety for life for me and for my kids what is that number yeah so you start to play with these numbers you start saying what does life cost and what do i want what are my goals with this what's my burn right now you first got to take that lay of the landings i don't need any strategy without an objective so any strategy is meant to get you to some objective and what most people do wrong is they're just picking strategies without really curating the objectives yeah and why why why is that thing can i stand and defend why i believe that this is what i'm going for that this is my strategy um like how do i get to the point where i know what i want and i i can defend what i want to myself not to you know like i can articulate it yeah actually why i've decided that and i said no to these other plausible paths that might be right for others but they're not for me yeah so you set your goal that way so that's the first my most important my goal is two things and i've identified them because i think about these things for a long time you know being on tour is really good because you just start to planes are great you just have a lot of time shower in the air and one of the things that i thought about it was like it's two things it's like to me being a father and a husband means providing financial safety and security for my kids you know i grew up in a family i want to give away i want to talk about this too much but money was always a thing that people in my family argued about and i never wanted that to be a thing here and it's a tough thing to do if you're an artist are you kidding me that's why did you pick that path but it was it's what's honest to me but to me what what money and business represents is okay if i can earn enough so that god forbid this goes to [ __ ] but i have enough run right one runway room and this is gonna sound crazy but for 10 years because i do deep work like it took me two and a half three years to write this show right it took me a long time to put it together and i hope the depth of that resonated with you into the audience that's my dream like yo do you do you feel how what this meant to me and what this i hope i hope you see me i hope you see it i hope you feel it too but in order to do that i have to have runway room yes i have to have two years to be able to hole up and write this movie right this thing i have a couple projects that are now lined up after we shoot this netflix special but they've required a ton of time right time you need financial capital to cover your burn yep to cover like i said you know my daughter a baby girl she has glasses now escalating burn yeah yeah and now there's all these additional things my mom her knees are going she needs knee replacement surgery you know i'm the eldest these are real things and i i put it as like no i need that burn for you know 10 years right but now we live in a world where we're not even be able to retire yeah so i have to start thinking no i got to be rocky i want to be mel brooks i want to be doing this you know hopefully dick gregory i'm doing this until i die right i love that dick gregory died with dates on the books he was gonna do rooster t feathers in sunnyvale california living legend man and i'm and i'm like what an inspired life right so many people are like well he wasn't the biggest comedian i'm like bro you lost the plot yeah exactly he's still playing the game like what a beautiful thing in his 80s right god god give please give me life so i can continue to do that so that's it's that burn what's that number ten maybe ten years five years and i've told my accountant this right then the other thing is is what is the financial capital that i need to then continue to imprint my vision upon the world so the show that you saw the burn to run it man is almost 40 grand a week just in labor cost trucking costs getting it to venue to venue it's a lot right now do that at scale i'm touring for six months eight months nine months a year got to take it over to europe to asia to australia all of those things it's like i want to be able to count on creative capital yeah only on myself i'm not asking for a network you know so funny like one of the things that artists now complain about is like the studio said this and i'm like hey man we got to shift to now being like no no we have that now in order to do that i got to be able to make money not at a 1x yes 2x 5x i have to start making moves that can potentially 10x it because it can then cover that burn so those are my two missions yep how do i continue to do king's gestures and take care of my family i'm not trying to be a billionaire it's just those two things yeah so that that will give you a number or set up a range yeah then you say all right what are the strategies that give me that get me to that you're not going to know them yourself because you're like well i spent 10 years getting [ __ ] amazing at comedy not the money game right the money game is its own game i'm going to respect that the same way when i'm like dude i want to do comedy i know comedy means it's a game that i i know what it was like to be an absolute beginner in business i got my ass kicked for eight years straight yeah it's probably gonna feel very similar if i ever wanted to like even just like have the experience of going and doing a five-minute comedy set i'm probably gonna have to get my ass kicked for like a year or two yeah to just be able to go do that yeah so you gotta say all right how do i find somebody that's gonna do that and i need somebody who uh i need them more than they need me yeah that'd be a great thing to have right because a lot of people who need you they need you for the clout they need you for the money they need you for many things so you need to find somebody who doesn't really need you they're happy to help they're happy to offer they get something of it it has to be a mutual exchange yeah but they're good already and so that's why i like hanging out with people who are good already so when i go to them they're not trying to dig into oh yeah here's the business here's what you should do by the way can i get some advisor shares can i get some equity it's like well you don't they don't need that because they they're already playing the game at a higher level in the money game so they don't need me for money when it comes to that so i can trust their advice from that sense because yeah or you know they're not looking for that so then you get a bunch of strategies all right here's my my safety my safety playbook i want this amount of money that's in something like vanguard low-cost etfs that's expected to grow seven percent i could chart that out and say all right that's what that looks like over 10 years then i need my high risk high reward part of the portfolio that's that's the that's the thing and i've read those books like jason calcanis has a book where he's just like hey take a hundred thousand dollars and turn it into 100 right let me ask you this is that real that part i do not believe is real this is what i don't very misguided and i don't know you know my whole thing is you know and you can like it not like my comedy whatever but i'm trying to meet people where they're at right i love people bro like i never want to lose i call it the cost of milk energy if you ask my dad how much is milk my dad will be like in manhattan at the bodega or at costco over in new jersey if we go over the bridge he'll tell you the cost of milk i love that like knowing how much gas is right knowing how much it is to like lease or buy a corolla that's why i drive an odyssey right it's like man i want to [ __ ] with people i love people so for me one of the biggest things that i'm trying to do also is like if i can learn perhaps even through my comedy through my gift i can help meet the people where they're at i'm never going to run with the a16z's right maybe who knows they may they want me to they may want me to like perform at their birthday party or something you know the kids 12th birthday they're just like oh they really like haasen come do 10 minutes but i'm talking about like man that i'm speaking to that it's funny i had this joke that i did on patriot act where i made fun of bitcoin the dudes who like tell me to invest in bitcoin i said i believe in bitcoin i just don't believe in the people that tell me to get bitcoin because it's all my homies that told me to take out a subprime mortgage in 2008. i'm like travis it's a property yeah you want a media you wanted me to take a second mortgage and why are you just like all like diamond hands now you're diamond hands and me to death or whatever and they're like you dumb [ __ ] look it's at 60k now yeah and the comic in me is like bro keep it a hundred keep it 100 with me use your government look me in the eye tell me honestly right the reality is you have 10k in the bank the cost of living in milpitas is too high and you need that [ __ ] to [ __ ] 200x and so you are betting everything on this and that's why my jokes are getting to you now look me in the eye and use your government name and tell me am i lying so i think that am i being real check me if i'm wrong check me sean uh you're not wrong you're not wrong what i would say is but maybe i'm misguided maybe there's a certain level of skepticism you have that is absolutely needed yeah and you're tr you have to get to the root of yeah why are you saying this do you know what you're talking about what is in it for you if i do this you know what you know you don't want to be blind following the blind yeah what i do one thing that works for me that's like a hack a cheat code when i was doing that sushi restaurant thing i told you about we were trying to find the perfect location they said in restaurants location is everything so we're like oh [ __ ] gotta be location experts we're scouting we're doing all this real estate [ __ ] we're looking up and we just realized hey chipotle puts like you know billions of dollars in picking the right location why don't we just go right next to wherever chipotle is and that's actually the strategy that's uh that quiznos and a whole bunch of other brands had used noodles and company if you go look next to a chipotle there'll be a noodles and company there or there will be a subway there they all just they're like well they do all the research and they're an attraction so like yeah we just go next to them we can piggyback because they're putting their skin in the game they're not just telling us this is a good location yeah they are putting down their roots they're investing money which means this is probably a good idea yeah so i have a couple buddies who i'm like look uh you've been successful in this game what are you putting your money into now and and what ratios are you putting them out how much of your money are you putting into these things and how do you think about them i triangulate between four people like that yeah i say okay now i have a base understanding of like where they are putting their skin in the game they're not telling me to do it because they get something out of it they are themselves investing in this and they're doing certain amount of diligence that like they are in a space that they understand and so you're able to get there's an intelligent way to copy and then follow yeah there's an intelligent way to follow and then there's an unintelligent way to follow as well yeah the unintelligent way to follow is i heard some [ __ ] from some guy who's got an incentive to sell me this thing yeah and i don't really understand why he's telling me to do this and yeah i can't really ask him i don't know what percentage of his portfolio is in this you know so i can shield some random cryptocurrency i'm excited about yeah people oh you said that was great yeah i put a half a percent of my net worth into it because i understood it in this way and i thought had this risk reward you put 30 of your net worth into it i never told you to do that yeah i never told you to do anything but you interpreted x as y yeah so there's an intelligent and an intelligent way to do it but that's kind of my approach of like how i would do this i would say all right there's a money game you got to learn i'm going to learn along the way yeah i'm going to speed up my learning curve by partnering with people who already are playing this game at a higher level than me that don't need any they don't need the money from me they're not getting a cut of me yeah but they're happy to do it because it's cool to know a comedian yeah you know it's like a social worker yeah yeah it's just it's fun right and so like there's that's how i would approach if i was the other thing you said which is important which is the artists have to get leverage so like people were last night when we were leaving the show i was talking to my sister and i said it's amazing this my dad was like i can't my dad the whole time i told you i bought the beer he's like i can't believe you bought that beer at the show so expensive that beer is a dollar at costco i was like i know i understand that i'm having an experience at the show here i wanted to have a beer and enjoy the show yeah uh that was worth 13 dollars to me i know the beer on the couch which is crazy and so he's like he's like i can't believe so many people pay to come this show how can they afford a show like this and i said well people care about like they're having fun like this their budget i understand you don't allocate your budget to that they do and he was like he's like he was like you know this guy must be doing amazing because he's he did eight shows or whatever in bay area he's got a netflix show i'll say yeah he's doing i'm sure he's doing great i said but also think about like i don't know what your netflix deal is but i know that if i was offered a netflix deal i'd have to do it for zero essentially right like netflix kind of knows that i have to say yes to have a netflix show yeah yeah so my bargaining power is probably very low yeah so even though it's a big deal and it might do well yeah my negotiating power in that situation my leverage is low right versus this show that you own your leverage is higher right yeah so it's like i say you know just because somebody has certain things you do for distribution and fame totally dude monetization that was the comedy central deal like you're on the daily show you're on snl right to be on a cultural institution exactly to get your name built yeah they know like you can they can pay you whatever yeah and so how do you get the leverage back and so that's where there's this idea by the way that like for us who said that somebody said this i'm stealing it but why wouldn't comedians create like oh so everybody's getting big bit big checks from netflix and others to go do a special now yeah and okay here's you know i think chappelle whatever something like 30 million bucks 20 million bucks i don't know what the numbers are it's on that rank very big upfront payday yeah yeah they know they're making the money on the back end otherwise they wouldn't offer that kind of money yeah um but also a key data point you need to know is it's just like you cannot use ronaldo's deal lebron's deal steph curry's ultra max deal or chapelle's ultramax deal because the delta between who the capital marcus is playing number one man you gotta see what buddy healed on the sacramento kings is making right no because buddy's solid but what is he but is he top 10 in the league is he top 15 in the league that's the real again i talk about the costco milk thing that's the real working class artist if you can't be kevin hart if you can't be jeff bezos if you can't beat chamath or whatever and you can't ball out at a bill then what do you what are the moves you make exactly that's the way i'm trying to operate my life hey assume you won't be will smith right you won't be the biggest movie star in the world and the capital markets are going to pay you at a thousand x say they they pay you at 10x what moves do you then do to have a healthy happy artistic career for the rest of your life that's my mission i want to continue to make art that's honest for the rest of my life yeah so i think well i'll answer so but let's but the idea real quick is the idea is if the artist got together and created the streaming technology now is actually like pretty standardized off the shelf you can you can have a white label version of netflix yes in six months yes um the thing is you need draws and so like if somehow and this is always the coordination problem yeah if you could somehow coordinate the key artist to say hey we can own this [ __ ] we can actually create our own platform that's a comedy streaming service yeah that people pay for yeah and we're gonna share the the dividends sort of like meritocratically meaning if i come to watch your show if i subscribe to the service yeah because of hudson's show yeah you're gonna get the bounty of my my joining yeah and then if i also watch you know three other artists yeah they're gonna get some some cut of the subscription it can be what what crypto and other things are enabling is a basically creator-owned platform yeah somebody's gonna do this i don't know if it's in comedy or if it's in some other music or some music what's triller triller's kind of like that right no it's the same thing as a company and then they they cut checks they get the artist to come on board and then yeah they pimp out the artist to go get customers yeah and the artist feels like they're getting a good deal because they're cash rich but they're equity poor yeah they're getting and you know they might kind a deal with jake paul or something because the triller has nothing to lose so they're like yeah you get two percent yeah you know they'll cut that to one person yeah what i'm talking about is if chappelle evan hart if you could somehow coordinate the forces that be yeah to say let's create a platform let's only put our art on this platform comedy is one of those things where the fans will pay to jump the fence to get the thing yeah and they're willing to pay to also support their their it's funny yeah i have the answer to that um so that would be a platform that would be value it could eventually be valued you know easily single digit billions of dollars that would be creator-owned and then as you cycle out and the next community comes up they would just basically join the syndicate yeah they'd be pumping their fan base into it and they would be getting their proportionate share based on how much how much audience they're bringing to the player so i'm presenting so i love your analysis on this again i don't know i'm trying to learn but i'll just share the things that i've learned from just being in the circle um you know shout out to my man az az was you know chappelle was doing all these summer camps uh in in ohio and and one of my comedian friends az i think he's you've met with him he was saying he asked dave he goes and and i love z's like he's always been a future writer of remy right yeah and he's but he's always been a futurist he's always been 20 years ahead and i tell asia i go hey z you got the al gore problem in 2000. it's like the internet everyone's shut up yeah you look like an idiot in 20 years you want to be 20 years ahead you want to be maybe like three three to five years yeah yeah yeah yeah you wanna be that guy with oculus and you're like bro this sucks that's always my thing i was like i don't want to be the oculus dude yeah you know what i mean you don't watch jungle book on oculus i'm like he's giving me a headache like cut this [ __ ] out anyways he goes he goes up to dave he goes dave man you come on bro you're the goat you're number one you could just put it up on dave chappelle.com and everybody would pay you five or ten bucks for 15 bucks 20 bucks maybe a radiohead style a hundred dollars nipsy hustle right proud to pay and louie did that yeah dave's like this he goes like this he goes new fans what about new fans what that netflix billboard gives you is it pumps that tile out in front of you whether you like it or not i don't know sampar yeah i slid in sam's damn sam's i slid in your dms you didn't hit me back but when he's with his wife and they open up the doom and they see my tile and they see my like my raccoon on adderall face sam now has to reckon with that right then sam he's sitting on the couch he pulls out his phone and then he sees you retweet my thing and he's like man this indian dude what's up this guy let me see this guy boom i've now picked up sampar i know i'm a convert with you your cousins are gonna talk about me your your sister's gonna talk about me whatever but i'm talking about new fans you know what i mean in the distribution they do to get new fans on board that's what this proud to pay movement doesn't have right so everybody's told me hey start an online shop i'm like cool i'll do homecoming king low cal kangas shirts cool what about your three other co-workers the dude in that room i want them to know who i am right so that's what you know louis put out his last special sincerely louis ck did you see it no why didn't you see it because it was just a closed network between him and his direct fans people couldn't get outraged about it they couldn't write about it which would then get you to it would titillate you and you'd be i'm gonna watch it right which would that get you to watch it and he'd pick you up as a new fan yeah it had yeah exactly that's 100 it's closed it'd have to be paired with a pretty aggressive clip strategy right so like one of the ways you grew was not because i watched 160 minutes of the correspondence like speech 45 minute it was long speech right yeah 27 minutes 27 minutes it's because a couple of those clips get on instagram they get shared they're tick-tock they go viral yeah and twitter instagram tick tock that's where you'd have to basically pair it with that that'd be the only way that you could get the exposure is to say there's great [ __ ] we're going to use youtube we're going to use tick tock we can use whatever and we're actually going to they're going to take the best stuff yeah we're going to dangle it over there we're going to let that be shareable yeah it still may not work to actually like simulate the new fan like that's why that's the interest and the coordination problem which is the biggest people you want they're getting overpaid by the networks yeah because they're that's the strategy of the network lock them in lock them in and then every other artist has to follow uh yeah at a almost below market rate because this is where all the headliners are you want to be where they are that's what feels like a first class thing as an artist yeah if i'm in the airport people like what do you do you're a comedian i go yeah yeah and then i go yeah um how do i see you i go go download the zone yeah and yeah and i'm just like netflix i go netflix because netflix has that the dumb factor just like damn i man my kids watch coco melon i watch netflix i watch blah blah blah so the thing is amazon disney and netflix right now they're running it and i'm trying to think to me i'm trying to have a barbell approach to it so if you follow me on instagram i put out content i put out videos tyler my videographer we put out stuff but i'm trying to barbell it and i'm trying to figure out yeah how do we start to monetize those things now the most the most the clearest sign of that that i've seen which has a low cost of entry has been podcasting comedians podcasting and people like tom segura people like joe rogan people like andrew schultz those guys have been able to call me um call call your daddy you know people in that podcast shepherd people in that space have been able to build up their own independent platforms and have more leverage here's my issue with it i find it very risky to put up every single thought and idea that i have in real time on the internet i'm be candid with everybody listening i have no hidden thing here i'm just be transparent the reason why i'm honest i love what you do i think what you do is honest and sincere and i think artists need to start to talk to people in your space to be like you understand business we understand art how can we work together how does this all how do these these two worlds now merge right without being part of a a multinational conglomerate and then have business affairs and lawyers and all that stuff muck it up that's the interesting new world that i'm really excited about and um that's what i'm trying to figure out yeah i love it yeah uh i don't know how much time you guys have i got time i want to be respectful the camera's still rolling are they [Laughter] perfect yeah uh let's finish up with a couple of things you uh do you listen to the bot i don't know if you actually listen to this listen to the body yeah amazing yeah um when you listen to it you there's always the beautiful part when a guest listens to the show because most most guests don't but they if they do the best part is there's a moment on podcasting when you're at home and you're hearing people talk about stuff and you're screaming either like you don't get it yeah talk about this instead or no i disagree and like they normally never get the mic they just have to sit there and sort of punch air as we just drone on about whatever the hell we're talking about yeah yeah what are those things that when you're listening you're like i would say this or i want to know about this or i want to talk about this what are those things for you as you know you broke through the wall and you're here yeah for me i'll tell you the moment that i loved um and by the way this has been my ethos with comedy writing and i learned this at the daily show you can only tear something down and this also works with movie writing and script writing if you tear something down you got to pitch an alt don't just [ __ ] on the idea pitch an alt right and what's the alt joke what's the alt take otherwise sit down like sit on the sideline you're not in the game so if i'll tell you what i love um actually there's i don't have a ton of criticism i've actually asked those questions the one that i loved is you guys had this run that you and sam did there was two things that i sincerely loved you guys had this thing up if you had a million dollars what would you do with it today i loved that then there's another thing that you did that was really cool it was vulnerable and again the reason why it resonated with me is at a level of honesty and transparency in it you guys were candid about your asset portfolio distributions right and sam was like i'm a little bit more conservative conservative and you're like i'm more risky right and there's two moments i love it was the thing what i do with a million dollars and there's a moment that you did where you're like i want to move through the world in a way what if i was worth 100 million dollars and i want to build my days around that yeah but where did you get that from so there's two things i love those are just two things i love but i want to actually just tag that with a question where did you get that attitude that like that bde that's so that's a that's a big dick energy i had a thing uh i was talking to the uh when i got when we got acquired we went to twitch yeah and they brought in this guy who became uh like i initially reported straight to the ceo and they brought in this guy who became the the chief product officer yeah and he was like twitch is like this gamer young gen z millennial type of product yes guy comes in gray hair uh doesn't play video games um you know was like at google in 2003 or some [ __ ] like that yeah and he's obviously smart and accomplished in the tech world but seemed like so out of touch with the product yeah so people were like oh why don't we have this guy like internally like rumblings in the engineering ranks which sort of like this guy doesn't get it uh like the people already hate upper management in general they always think out of touch making bad bad decisions yeah so there was this like skepticism is this guy gonna get it and he would ask questions in meetings that were like oh like you don't like you do you know what fortnite is like wait wait how are you how do you have this job if you don't know like you didn't know what minecraft would you use discord for exactly yeah but he was just he didn't he was like i'm asking questions to learn why would i ask obviously if i'm asking the question i don't know i think it's important to know yeah you think i should know this so i'm just going to learn it right here like instantly he didn't care yeah that's a bunch of questions when i um he asked me he sat down with me he was like let's do like a one-on-one he's like all right it's career career planning or whatever and he's like so what do you want to do and i basically when you when you sell your company of this deal this vesting structure so it's like you basically get some cash up front and then it's like after one year you're going to get your next big check and after two years you're gonna get an xbj if you make it to year three you get the last bit i didn't make it to your three i only got two but wow at somewhere self-imposed or you guys kind of yeah i was just like this is enough i want to go do other [ __ ] yeah i'm surprised i even got to two like one i knew i would do because one locked in my family security so i was like right i'm gonna suck this up and i don't care how bad this sucks i'm gonna get that year i'm gonna lock in like family is good yeah i'm gonna get the bag and so i was there and he was like what is the number if you don't mind me asking what is that number in the bay area i had always said six million i said six million is where your money works for you every up till then you're working for money your money works for you six million why did why did i say why six because i said all right you work backwards so i said all right my burn rate i think at the time i calculated it i was like we're spending like 20 000 a month okay was my like monthly expenses and i said okay well i don't know if it's going to go up or down but i'm sorry i know it's not going to go down it's probably only going to go up right because it's very hard to give things up once you have certain services or certain lifestyle or certain size house whatever you don't want to plan to downsize i wanted to plan to buffer in some growth i said okay so that gets you to 240 000 a year okay so let's say 200 how do i make it so that just the interest on the money i own so just the the gains on that money being invested in in the market and i don't need like a home run just like if i'm making and yeah if i'm making seven percent or let's call it four or five percent is like four or five percent as a target yeah so you just do the math like i as the rule is i don't do public math but you take 240 000 you divide it by the five percent or whatever and that gives you some numbers so i forgot what the calculations were but i know the number came out to about six million okay let's say all right at 6 million six million dollars invested would yield an amount of money that will pay for our lifestyle rather than me going and working a job or doing something that requires income to pay for our lifestyle yeah so i came up with this number and some people were like that's too low some people like your why is your monthly expenses so high so look i i like to live a certain way i'm going to try to live that way like i'm not telling you you need to spend this much money yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna get chipotle with avocado i like avocado exactly the guac's extra i said give me two servings that's why i wanted to be able to not have any weight on that right and so i was like all right well that's the i'm trying to live that guac life and so so that became a num a target number right and i said all right i want to hit that number and i said okay so you know i was trying to secure that back so winding back to this this question of how did i get this this mindset so i talked to the guy uh he takes me in he says what are your careers so you got the six though i got to the six god i said all right well how do i uh post tax right you have to have it you have to have it exactly yeah so i said all right well he goes when you when you think about your career what are you going to do and i knew that the right answers say oh you know i love to yeah i love it here at twitch and i would love to stay here forever and i could see myself being you someday the reality was i couldn't i didn't i was having fun because i made it my way but i was like this is not where i want to be forever yeah and i was like i'm gonna be honest with this guy i'm not gonna tell him and it's a weird conversation you're basically telling your boss i don't plan to be here for very long which is in a way saying right don't invest in me you know like don't promote me don't give me opportunities give it to the next guy because he cares it's kind of like a weird thing but i decided i'm gonna be honest so i told him he goes alright what do you want to do he's like then we don't need to talk about this twitch [ __ ] like tell me what you want to do i said well first i'm doing this so that then i can go do this thing i want to do because i don't believe all that i go well you don't believe i want to do this he goes no i don't believe that strategy of life i don't believe in this life plan of i'm going to do all the stuff i don't want to do so that then i could do all these things i do want your mortgaging for a future that may not happen exactly this this is never going to come he's like i've been around the block people who have that plan he's like very rarely do you ever do the thing you want to do is it's much better just do the thing you want to do start that now don't spend five years doing the thing you don't want to do because it's a means to an end but then but then what you're talking about is that if you had approached that you would have never perhaps gotten that six exactly so so he had a different mindset so i said all right well what does that look like and so so he goes why don't you just like figure out what you want to do yeah figure out what it required what what amount of money what skills what you would required and start accumulating those so that's actually where the six came in i said oh i want to be able to wake up every day and do a certain amount do a certain thing which is basically wake up and just work on whatever i was most interested in right like i told you dude i want to like i want to do comedy sometimes i want to do it i want to do i have these other things i'm like dude why don't i make a song that like just slaps like why was it a catchy ass song yeah i want to produce i want to produce a record yeah like i don't know anything about it but like wouldn't that be fun if i just made a catchy ass song that kind of hit yeah and like it's not i'm not trying to be the best musician but like why not like why why not write a book why not do all these things like that'd be a fun way to spend a career that's kind of how i thought about it yeah so i said all right well if i want to be able to do that um i gotta have this you need time yeah i gotta have time that's deep let me start comedy stand up dj so that was kind of my mindset and so along the way um again i talked to my trainer and he goes if you want to have a certain thing carry yourself like the guy who has that thing very simple really they fake it till you make it thing not even fake it till you make it you believe you will feel a certain way when you have it right that's why you want let's say you want a hundred million dollars you want a billion dollars whatever your number is five million one million dollars you believe you want that because you think you're gonna feel a certain way when you have it yeah so let's skip all the middle [ __ ] and let's just believe that we have let's let's believe that we're going to have that let's carry ourselves like that let's have that feeling now don't punt the feeling until the end when you're 60. okay and maybe you've achieved your goal so what he's basically saying is a level of confidence right and confidence and security and not playing scared exactly yeah then the byproduct of that you know the comedy take i had on this by the way this is the way my brain works the extremely wealthy and the homeless actually operate the same way which is what delusion which is what anything i do isn't going to affect my life anyways what are you going to do the incredibly rich that's funny and people who are like the same mindset yeah are are just like hey what are you going to do to me what can you take from me right they both actually operate that same way sometimes it's people that are in that vast middle that fear either direction that are like oh i cannot [ __ ] this up yes yeah so so that's the the mindset is basically don't wait waiting is the enemy so when you're waiting to feel good until you've achieved certain things anytime you hear the word wait run that's not the right strategy and so it's like anytime you're waiting to do the thing you want to do don't wait that's kind of became my mindset i just realized got it you mean don't put it off don't put it off right don't wait till x in order to have y that you really want gotcha so if i want this feeling of security of of relaxation of confidence whatever why am i waiting let me tap into that now so that became both uh had two benefits there's the benefit which is you feel better today already already a win yeah instead of feeling anxious and stressed and worried you're already feeling good but there's also a strategy to it which is when you carry yourself like that dude you carry yourself that way you'd be surprised what kind of doors are sort of open for you how people treat you differently they yeah they treat you with the assumption of where you treat yourself why do you dress the way you dress why do you carry yourself the way you carry yourself because people will treat you differently life will give to you what you're putting but i also feel it too like i like being fitted i like wearing like jordans yeah and it makes the immediate feeling which is already good yeah and then you get the actual like i think this harvard guy called it the the happiness happiness effect he basically said most people wait till they achieve a thing then they're going to feel happy and then what happens is you achieve that thing and you just move the goal post well this is not enough when i when i really have it then i can do it you know and so this keep moving the goal post and everything he's like not only is that obviously deferring the thing you want which is bad two he said there's studies that will show that the person who goes into the situation already feeling happy will perform better on the test yeah we'll be better in the professional setting we'll have a higher likelihood of success yeah we'll have more lucky breaks that was one of the things they tested they basically they gave you a test and like you know the third line of the instructions said like just go to the end just type write the letter five in and you're done yeah and the people who went in with a stress mindset they were just trying to solve all the problems and they had to do the whole test the people who went in relaxed and confident they were more likely to observe that little line so oh another another break that goes my way oh great you know like so i'm going to skip to the end hand the test in i'm done yeah and so that's called when i when i started to learn about this sort of like happiness effect this this idea that if you bring the future feeling you're chasing into the now not only do you feel good now but you actually have better results i was like that's just the thing i want but it's also a mindset shift where you're operating different than sam sam's like i'm not going to take those crazy opposite but why why is he the opposite yeah so what i'm what i'm saying is sam may look objectively or it's his subjective experience at your financial situation and be like you can't afford that you can't afford to start this like one million dollar fund and just with randos off the internet and just start betting things yeah why are you doing that you could lose it yeah it served him well like i think the other many ways to win what i'm trying to get you guys to beef i'm trying to get you i'm joking i'm choosing i'm actually curious play style like there's this great conor mcgregor quote where he goes look you're gonna feel some kind of way anyways right like any moment you're feeling some kind of way so he's just like he's like why not feel unstoppable why not feel i not feel super confident yeah yeah it's the same sort of thing which is that there's many ways to win but you do get to choose and sam's way to win and many successful entrepreneurs the same way which is chip on my shoulder my dad never loved me you know uh i people doubted me and that drives me and that's why i'm successful and they'll tell you this proudly and i hear it i'm just like man you sound like you've been suffering for a long ass time you know you didn't have to do all that right yeah yeah i'm i'm glad it worked for you but also like the toll was high on that highway right you paid an expensive vig which was every day you were focusing on like yeah the grind grind set mindset and you're you're focusing on proving people wrong and how all right how it you know the doubters and how you had to like kill yourself to make this work well i know people who did it the other way so let's agree that let's agree that both can happen yeah let's let's also do a quick delineation though when you said you're moving like you're worth 100 mil so you're not i don't make size bets like obviously there's examples of gravity no but there's a way to move to be like hey because i'm serious because there's people that may be listening that that are just like let me get that let me get that rolex daytona right let me feel that way right if it's 100 mil then that it's probably a rolls-royce phantom it's probably a you know what i mean a maserati a ducati whatever that thing may be you're not making those things are you uh yes and no so in the things that matter like i hired a personal chef okay that's something that really the only like the true wealthy typically do okay i was like no i this matters to me i want this is the number one want i have i think it helps me and my family be healthy we don't have to stress out about making food all the time for our daughter who's real picky and she keeps throwing away we gotta remake dinner right i said this will improve the quality of my life i don't care if we can afford it i'm gonna get it and i'm gonna then i'm gonna afford it right because i'm not like i know i believe in my ability to go get that money yeah so i will not limit myself in the things that i really care about yeah yeah it's a true belief it's something that you really want for you and your family truly wanted it yeah you're not gonna wait again i was waiting i said oh i identified all the spots in my life i was waiting i said i got rid of waiting that's the thing i really want and i'm waiting for it no more i'm going to do it now got it but do i go and just spend outside of like what means what i care about what i have like no i i don't and i don't because i also don't want to be owned by those things yeah every time you buy something you know it now owns you as much as you own it yeah because that bill owns you in a way it owns a piece of your time because you got to pay for it i'm very selective about do i want this enough or i'm willing to let it own me a little bit and so then i don't need a lot of those things and i also have this like this is you're good at these questions man the last thing i do is i want to be able to have as much fun whether i'm in a mansion having a feast with celebrities is if i'm stuck in an elevator by myself which means i don't want to have to i don't want to have to have some nice [ __ ] in order to feel good i don't want to have to have the circumstances be going my way for me to feel good yeah and so that's self satisfaction that's you training i want to train my brain yeah but that's you doing what you're training your brain you're meditating you're boxing whatever that thing is so you feel a self sense of self that's zero dollars it's not 100 that's not a hundred million dollars or a hundred thousand dollars exactly because the ultimate goal the ultimate way to carry myself isn't that i had 100 million it's i just remind myself of that if i ever start to feel like because when i heard that what i what resonated with me as an artist is play big play are you playing scared cook you're on the court cook let it fly launch like be loose do the impressions do characters that's what my thing is like that's my goal like i want to be loose i want to have fun i want to be really get on the floor use a basketball analogy i know you love basketball yeah and researching for this i saw your celebrity game got a nice left hand yeah yeah yeah you go with that yeah you're not lefty right no i'm not done right but you were very nice with it yeah um the analogy is this steph curry's not afraid to shoot his shot yeah anywhere on the court once he passes half court he's willing to let it fly that doesn't mean every time he steps across half court he just lets it fly because he knows like old the ultimate goal is to win yes but he's not afraid to shoot his shot he's not thinking about missing he's thinking about making his confidence in that mate yeah so i would say a very similar thing on the business side which is i don't just spend like a drunken sailor yeah or invest in the most wild [ __ ] possible all the time i'm not trying to take every risk possible yeah i'm not trying to shoot every quarter every shot at half court but i am confident if i pull but you're not afraid to let it if i pull it or if i'm feeling it yeah or if i believe i can make the shot i'm going to pull yeah even if i miss the last three even if this is not what other people like this feels right this feels right yeah i put in the time and i have the confidence itself and i'm not gonna second-guess it yeah so that's where i'll make cool some take some risks cool that feel right to me in the moment but the overall objective is to win it's not to take max maximum risk possible yeah it's also not to minimize risk it's to win and you got to define what that win is for yourself right my definition of the win for myself is i want to have the lifestyle where i'm at the manager with my best friends we're at the table we're feasting we're toasting that's what i want yeah but i want to be able to have as much fun if i'm alone stuck in an elevator that is my ultimate win where my mind has created that situation where you can have all those things yeah but i'm i am impervious to the environment great i will have just so that's my ultimate win yeah i'll take enough risks along the way to get to that you know as i go that's great last question this is from this is from me to you people can be pissed by the way they're like dude you had us you just talked about your own [ __ ] philosophy no you know what people are going to be playing no i'm going to say this right now for the listeners and the watchers people going to be like he interrupted sean too much and why is he talking like this about bitcoin like sean you know you're not the star no no no i'm i'm coming from curio i humble myself before all you my first million people so listen i love this again this is what i love most about irl experiences about being on stage doing material in front of people hearing the applause break knowing that that joke is right because i've corroborated it with the people sometimes comics when a joke doesn't work they'll be like [ __ ] you i know better and sometimes that works but there's a lot of times where it's like no no hear them listen to them see them you want to be seen but you got to see them for you as an outsider you know we don't know each other well this is our first time actually meeting when you watch the show and you see me what would be your advice for somebody like me that's at this point in my career i'm at an inflection point in my career i represent a certain period of time me my contemporaries me john mulaney ali wong we're entering that new era that the bill burrs and the chappelles are those are the elder statesmen of the art form what is your what was your advice to someone like me looking at it from the outside because you have such a great business mind yeah i think what's what's worked for you is going to keep working that's why i said before i think you have zagged when everybody zigged i said everybody was going in one direction which was which is low accountability low risk yeah um doing things under you know worried about cancel cancel culture and things like that i think you have built a niche where you're not afraid to call out the saudi prince you're not afraid to call out the president but you're calling out not from a place of getting a reaction you're calling out when you see a truth you're putting your finger on it and saying i don't care if this hurts i don't care if this is a nerve i'm gonna have my take on this i'm gonna stand by my take regardless of what's happening and that's when all those are the things that have hit for you you talked about that in the show yeah so i think it's not that you have to keep doing that the same exact thing you have to keep in the mindset that got you to do that in the first place you got to self-assess what got me to to observe those things what made me curious where i observed those things where i asked the question that got me to that truth right what gave me the guts to do this i felt like i had nothing to lose trying to make a name for myself now i got a name for myself now every tweet i'm kind of worried how are people going to react well now now you're not playing the game the way you did at that time yeah so i would say first and foremost don't lose what got you to the dance second is the stuff you talked about which is you're betting on yourself which is your own production you're owning your ip you're owning your own as much of that pipeline as you can from a business perspective because it's what gets you leverage it gets you capture the value you're creating you create a bunch of value you got to capture it you got to look at the supply chain and say who's capturing all this value who why is ticketmaster taking this much of my feed why is you know who when i go put this special online what do i really make out of this versus what do they make how do i get their numbers and how do i understand how to capture value on the distribution side and not just this side yeah i'll try to think about those types of things and it seems like you're building like for example my mom saw you on the morning show i watched the morning show too yeah oh [ __ ] he's getting into these mainstream areas building the name building the face there and then you're gonna almost like that's how you go get the new fans and you take them back you build this funnel yeah at the bottom of the funnel the people who are going to know your life story they're going to know what you stand for all these things they know me just like any product in silicon valley you create a funnel top of funnel is new fans new eyeballs how are you going to go get them in this strategy middle of the funnel how are you going to get them to get their first taste of you their first real experience get them to their first show um get them to watch you know the first 20 minutes of something that's your best work yeah how do i get that and how do i get them bottom of the funnel which is how do we get create maximum value like oh a bunch of artists doing nfts what does that look like for comedy right you know let me play with these ideas i'm not going to do all of them yeah but i'm going to have brainstorming sessions with guys like shawn and say yeah what would i do with nft what could can with nfts and i would start to think about because that's bottom of the funnel more like totalization yeah i would think about that funnel i would say all right i am a product and i'm going to build my brand around that product you know and it's a long you know it's a long series of optimizations totally but that's how i would think about it yeah that's how i would view my my craft which is like uh you know it's easy to just get into the art world which is like you know i'm trying to i'm trying to build myself and you know tell jokes make people laugh yes but like ultimately your product and your experience from the mo like when i showed up at the show yesterday there was an hour long line yeah we got to skip it likely because you hooked it up yeah with with the nice like vip stuff but everybody their experience end to end isn't just when you step on the stage it's like from before the show totally aligned yeah the rest and i would say playlist when you sit down yeah we talked about the the interface where you go buy the tickets how much friction is there i will go look at that whole funnel and i would say all right i'm trying to grease this funnel i'm trying to get them to these magic moments with me the first magic moment when i first made you laugh on like clip on instagram second magic moment your friend takes you to a show you have a great time yeah third magic moment is the follow-up of that you know fourth is when you buy the merch and actually the merch stands for something totally you know whatever yeah that's cool i've always um i appreciate that because the i cannot see itself sometimes we're so in our especially as artists it's what it requires to do deep meaningful work but we remove ourselves from like what you said the line four blocks down the street from the masonic theater how much you had to pay for parking then what the show experience is like all that stuff yeah right yeah but i think you're doing great man thanks man i don't think you need advice for me to be honest with you i think you're doing great no man hey this is my this is my two cents for the space y'all are working in i think um uh just continuing to try to be a source of light amongst just all this heat that's out there it's really important man there's just a lot of garbage and trying to actually represent ontological truth in reality for what it is right because you're playing with people's money people are listening to my first million for that thing i just want to like let you know don't forget it's that but it's that titillating feature yes it's like when you hear that title you're like but i want to it's but it's just like i want to make a mistake i came to laugh yeah i came to laugh you making fun of our indian parents and the goofy things that they do yeah but why did i that's what that's what i came for that's not what i what i loved what i loved was the stuff you're saying at the end the stories about your daughter the stories about the the the jerk parent at the at the yeah library or whatever those were where i was like oh man i attached same thing we have my first million and the hook is ideas i'll help you make money and get you get you to your first million and what do you do with that when you get there i know that the people who are really gonna love this because that's going to fade like you get that hit yeah you get the hit you get the hit what are you going to be here a year from now you should have already got that million but you know by a couple years in or whatever the people are going to stay because damn these are just great conversations i want to hang with these guys yeah that's the only thing we do is we create a fun conversation where people wish they were i hope that like there's a third seat in the studio my goal is that somebody listening to this was like damn i feel like i was in that third right that was listen to a real ass conversation between two people not you talking to your book and me talking my book but like right real conversation by two people you were curious and so i answered questions i asked you a bunch of questions of stuff i was curious about yeah they feel like they got to be a part of a conversation that was a little bit more entertaining than whatever's going on in their world that day like maybe their their real life conversations that they weren't as interesting sure my hope is that this one is that they feel like they're in that third seat that's like a win for me with this and so cool hope people enjoyed this i know this is appreciate you coming out thanks for having me man thanks for doing it in person because i remember you reached out you're like let's do a via zoom and i was like nah we're doing this yeah sorry to sam yeah we're pulling out for him yeah sam check your dms bro i'm in your dms doc okay cool thank you [Music] you

i started i i got kind of curious so there's two extensions that caught my caught my attention the first and they're basically the same thing with almost exactly the same name the first is this thing called ad block i think that's the one i use the second one is called adbot ad block plus so that's why it's a little confusing and so adblock was created by one guy in georgia named michael gundlach and he uh uh he just kind of built this thing in 2009 and he's been the only employee the whole time and i went to his personal website to learn about him and he only has 55 followers on uh twitter his website is called sorryrobot.com that's his personal website and he has like python projects a unity game that he built called asteroids and he even has an mp3 of him singing a christmas song at church during christmas time this is like by the way his linkedin his job description is just a guy uh he is in duluth georgia and it says i am not available for work please do not contact me about job opportunities i created adblock the most popular chrome extension for google chrome extension and for safari with around 20 million users it's neat before that i did some other neat things and he was the only employee and then i did some research on his competitor called ad block plus now this company they have a few few more employees i think they've got 20 or 30 people and because they're based in europe when you're a european company oftentimes at least in england and i know it's a lot of the k uh a lot of cases in different european countries if you make over 20 million dollars in revenue you basically have to file a report that reveals your revenue and profit and so i went and looked at this company called io it's called io they own ad blocker plus in 2017 they did 44 million dollars in revenue and 26 million dollars in profit which is astounding and they had at least a hundred million users however if you look in the group the the chrome plug-in store uh ad block plus has around 150 000 reviews and it says they've got over 10 million users if you look at ad block which is the one founded by this one guy they've got something like 300 000 reviews and uh also it says 10 million users and so there's potential that this one guy had a business making all of this money tens of millions of dollars a year very likely tens of millions of dollars a year in profit just off a chrome extension is that amazing this is amazing i'm i'm still on this guy michael gunlock's uh website sorry robot.com resume um dot pdf and i i think you said this but i was reading while you were talking so he was an engineer at google working on google ads and google adsense did you already say that part no and he worked on google and basically he goes nah [ __ ] that i hate these ads so his job was he goes at google i kept the global at google ads and adsense networks alive and kicking um in my spare time i built this other thing and i built this other thing uh you know like because google has that 20 times like i built this javascript framework blah blah so basically he goes from working at google and google adwords and ad sets to creating adblock and and makes 20 million dollars it makes more than that uh off 20 million users who who love this thing and what year did you work at google i believe like 0.5 2005 yeah so which is like right after the ipo basically yeah so he probably made 30 million dollars at google like collectively it's pro that's what it's worth now yeah if he held it so it made tens of millions of dollars off of that and then reportedly now the thing about this guy is everything's very quiet about this guy he's hard to find everything's impossible however i think in 2015 an anonymous buyer bought adblock interesting there's a world where it could have been sold for like two or three hundred million dollars i mean there's a world where that exists uh maybe it was lower but it was it's a it's a huge problem he stopped he he stopped working on ad block or you know it sold probably 2015 which is kind of scary because these chrome extensions are a giant security hole for people because chrome extensions can like read and write all the data on your as you browse the web so that's all every email you're writing the text is can be picked up by these chrome extensions and even if they start off safe because you know just a guy from duluth georgia built it and he's an engineer who has the right intentions somebody who buys it with the wrong intentions can really like uh do some dirty stuff you know with the data and even modifying it and things like that so you got to be careful with chrome extensions i try to install the minimum amount of chrome extensions as possible yeah they are pretty scary and um yeah they're nuts and but it's a wild business i think that what here's here so i love these extension style businesses

kevin i think is even more famous and he has 2.5 or 3 million subscribers he recently did a video and it was called here's my entire 50 million dollar portfolio at age 29. so i and i noticed that he had done one of these i'm clicking okay double click full screen headphones on and i noticed that he did another one of these like nine months ago or 13 months ago something like around a year ago and his net worth then was only 25 and i was like what is going on this guy is nuts and so he's basically this guy meet kevin i don't know his full name he um it makes like three to four videos a day and he is talking about like which stocks he's buying uh which um types of houses he's buying for investment properties and he shows his entire portfolio and at the end he goes now here's proof and he logs in to all of his accounts and you can see all of it screen share yes which is amazing for many reasons one he's only 29 and he's a youtuber with 50 million dollars how was he how did he how did he get that money so he's just off of his youtube or he had some other business that he started with at age 19 i believe he started as just a real estate agent so just a normal guy okay and he made a little bit of money like a hundred grand a year took that hundred grand a year and bought some properties and then started a youtube channel in 2010 or 2011 and he just started documenting about his real estate investing slowly that started making additional income using that income he bought even more properties eventually he had like a course and things like that where he was making like one or two million dollars a year so a significant amount of sum or a significant sum then he took that money and he started investing it and started talking about what he was investing and you could see this entire growth over the last five years of his portfolio and how it's grown of course it helps that a he's got now a significant stream of like four million dollars a year i would imagine and we're in the best bull market of all time and so it kind of works but that's how he's done it and interestingly this guy kevin uh when gavin newsom was being recalled kevin ran for office and there's this republican named larry elder who got second behind gavin newsom kevin was third with something like hundreds of thousands of votes and so it's this kid's amazing and so that's surprising i feel like a youtuber who's got a big following should crush any politician he doesn't have that big a following he only has 2.5 or 3 million it's not significant and it has to be a california above 18 voter so it's not like it's not significant but my point being with a lot of these youtubers is this video was nutty and graham stefan did the exact same thing he goes here's my prediction mr beast or a mr beast type person will run for president and will surprise people with the type of following they get because oh absolutely whether you want to be president or not you could you know i think the original trump playbook was i'm gonna just throw my hat in the ring i'm gonna get tons of attention and press i'm gonna build my brand off the the massive amount of attention that goes into elections and i'll be the the kind of curveball story that everybody wants to cover everybody's got an opinion on like kanye kanye did it or whatever he threw his name in you're gonna see the wild wild west of people trying to put their name in the hat for running for office or running for these kind of like positions that will sound you know how could a how could a 21 year old youtuber be doing this and they're going to get a little momentum and then that's going to create a press cycle that's going to create more momentum i don't think they'll actually win i don't think they even want to win but it would just be a smart move for the dog-eat-dog world of youtube trying to get views yeah and and but here's back to the original point of getting views what is exhausting life that you have to go and and i'm thankful that mr beast does what he does i'm thankful that this kevin guy and graham are crazy enough to log in and show me their that is so cool they are [ __ ] nuts that is nuts

peloton um a peloton class yeah they're always they always do this thing i don't even do peloton but i've seen two or three so i'm gonna say always it's always like all right everybody they like come in like they were just having the best inside joke with somebody they're like okay we're gonna start with the ghost star what's up everybody jamal here and we are gonna rock it's like they always start with this laughter to make you feel like we were having such a good time you're in a good place right now okay well everyone we've got all right so here's the deal we've got a uh two things happening the first is last month we did a contest where people reviewed us and we gave out a thousand dollars or did we get five thousand dollars pen six thousand thousand dollars to six different people oh wow so six people okay so six people won a thousand dollars we even gave it to like two or three people who gave us negative reviews um we're gonna if you're watching on youtube uh you can click the link and you're gonna go to the end of this episode and that's where you'll see who the names are and you have to contact ben if you're that person is that right by the way the people commenting on youtube get a bigger prize which is that me and you go and we reply to everybody who comments on the youtube channel personally they talk [ __ ] yeah especially if they talk [ __ ] but i like the people there's really two that i like there's a great when they say great episode i don't know what the hell they say back so i just say like yeah thanks but if they talk [ __ ] or if they reference some inside joke or call us out on uh one of our like mannerisms or something we always say that's stupid or whatever those are great it makes me uncomfortable when that happens um i get self-conscious uh i was just gonna say uh to summarize yes correct uh we announced them at the end of a different episode we announced the winners so we're going to link to that clip at in the show notes of this episode so click there listen see if you were one of the winners if so email me and i will get you your thousand dollars and what's your what's your email ben b wilson hubspot.com is my email all right now the second thing this is actually significantly cooler so we are giving away five thousand dollars to two fans and here's what you have to do you've got to take our content whether it's like audio or video which they're all on youtube and you have to remix it so basically chop it up into little viral clips and then use the hashtag mfmclips so mfm clips uh and use that hashtag on all the popular social media [ __ ] we'll find you and the and we're gonna do a combination of cool stuff uh like cool content as well as popular content and we're gonna give away five thousand dollars to two different people who use that hashtag and use cool clips or who create cool clips i think that's gonna be sick there's somebody who did this for the all-in podcast there's just a tick tock channel somebody created called all in talk uh like like tik tok and um they just chop up clips from from the pod and they just put it up there there's no contest but this account is just getting like hundreds of thousands of views because it's the content's already good all you got to do is just grab the best okay we're going to talk for an hour you grab the best kind of like 30 second back and forth and um and you turn that into a clip and they don't all hit but definitely like one per week is hitting and this account is getting so big and it's just some fan account and so that's actually what i would do is you're gonna if you just did that if you just made the tick tock account for this you just put the best best nuggets on there and just chopped it um your account's gonna get popular which is more valuable than whatever five we're gonna give you five grand great but like whoever does that like we'll just employ you and also you're gonna have an account that's yeah we we've talked about doing this for like every month so if someone's good at this we'll just give you five thousand dollars a month maybe i don't know maybe maybe that's in the cards but uh so mfm clips that's the hashtag just you know on instagram tic tac um twitter we'll see we're going to follow it all and so did i read what what then did you look at me did i do that correctly it's good running the only thing you didn't say is running through from now to the end of the year so you've got about a month to do it i have a question for you guys which is if you were betting what is the over under for how many views the top clip is gonna get i think on tick tock the top the top video will get over 50 000 views oh i was going to say like i think someone will get half a million on something the right thing will go by if you just take something from the rob dear deck podcast or you take something from the garyvee podcast the tai lopez podcast there's a whole bunch of those andrew wilkinson there's a whole bunch of those that are good or just one of our rants or something funny that we did you know back and forth we're yelling at each other those will hit yeah i i agree um all right that's that um sean i got a bunch of stuff you want to talk about you want to you listen to the noah caking pod i listened to it yeah so i listened to it in the car it's great because i normally never listen to this pod because i was there we talked about it you know it's awkward to listen back your own voice but this was different i got to basically hear an episode of mfm but just with somebody else on the other side and uh what'd you think of it first before i give you my i didn't think it was that good i thought it was good but here's what i thought i thought the flow was awkward yeah and i don't know if that's just how the podcast sounds when we're on it too but there was something very start-stoppy about it that was kind of like awkward to listen to but the topics were great like i liked the stuff you guys talked about the the content was great because i it hit the thing that i always want which is i feel like these were just two two cool people who i would be friends with hanging out and i just got to hang with them it didn't feel like a show so like you would just be like do you have a will and he's like yeah i got you know like i have one but i don't have kids so i put in my brother's kids and you're like that's so weird right like it's not even your kid he's like yeah it's weird but like you know and you were just talking about [ __ ] that like just [ __ ] that i don't know just dudes would talk about that that's like oh what are you doing with your money yeah is that good yeah it's good but you know blah blah blah it wasn't like some it didn't feel like every other podcast so i liked that but it was a little stoppy i think that there was either maybe a weird delay or something because it happened consistently where i would say something and then it was weird there was just like this weird delay i was like oh i'm sorry you go ahead yeah we have the opposite problem we'll talk over each other but that actually makes it flow a little faster because it's just like whatever i'm talking over you you're talking over me let's just keep it going back and forth rather than wait okay you go now i go right and that's the problem with these zoom pods in general why in person podcast just like that extra 30 better is because in person you can start talking over each other but it's no that's a normal thing in a conversation you can kind of interrupt each other but if you interrupt someone on zoom it's a very abrupt like um it like kind of like stops the flow of everything for some reason just the way that like kind of the conference call tech works and what did you think of as peter thiel thing that was cool i liked you know some of the nuggets i don't know if they're real like does he really have immersed black mercedes waiting outside the building running the car must be running and the jet must be fueled and on the runway at all times that's what i was quoting the book so that that was cool but i didn't know if it was real uh i liked the poker story where he was like he bought it at the pokemon then he had to go meet with zuck they came back and asked for his money back i thought that was hilarious that should be a clip by the way those are the nuggets that yeah that should be a clip those are the nuggets that make you like feel like you kind of get to know the psyche of somebody like we already know they have we already know the resume so you don't need to talk about what peter thiel's done you got to talk about what's it like like i've told this story i think i've told the story of the pod maybe not i met a guy who in college was friends with a guy who worked under peter two at paypal so peter thiel was the ceo paper friend of a friend of a friend yeah a friend of a friend was was an intern there at the time he's in college and the intern gets invited to um go to peter's like tahoe he's going like on to a vacation or you know he's invited like 20 people or whatever to come to his cabin so the friend tags along and he gets there and he said by the way he listens to the pod so i think he'll appreciate the story being told without giving away too much info he gets there and he goes the first question peter asked me he goes how much money do you have and peter asked that peter asked the kid the college kid the kid is like uh like you know none basically i have like a checking account at wells fargo like what um what what is this question he goes no i don't care how much money you have but um you should whatever you have you should invest in a company called facebook and this is back in like 2005 or something like that 2006 maybe and he's like you should invest every bit of it into a company called facebook and um at the time peter was the main investor facebook and the guy is like okay like the college thing like we do like that like the app we waste time on like the website we waste some time on like he was like okay like maybe but i'm not comfortable just investing all my money in it and i just met you so this is just like super direct and he's like every question he asked me was a very like thought-provoking or reaction-provoking question and that's something that i've heard from many people who have met him which is like he has pretty much zero interest in small talk um he will he's looking for original thinkers so ask you a question and then he'll hear you and it's sort of like if you're just saying the same [ __ ] that everybody says very hurd like thinking i think it's the impression i get is he's mentally bucketing you as like okay this person is not going to give me original thoughts and then if you do have original thoughts he doesn't really care what your pedigree is what your accomplishments are it's like okay you're in you're in the you're in the circle of people i want to talk to because you have original opinions which goes back to this peter thiel question the famous interview question he has which is what's something you believe that few others would agree with you on and he's asking for this secret what's a secret you know what's something you think is true but others don't think is true because any and that being one of your kind of main questions will filter for people who have these unique insights i've also noticed that he does another thing that's actually pretty interesting and i think this is one of the reasons why he's hated by a lot of people uh so he's shockingly open-minded almost to the point of like seeming stupid and like so like for example when he supported trump people were like what are you doing like that's the worst thing right and um i like heard his explanation and i actually don't remember what it was but the feeling that i had was like that's logical but like my i don't like trump and my emotions feel this way so i just can't go along with it but he was very logical and he does this thing where he says if someone says like do you think drinking eight glasses of water is good for you he would say like well you know a lot of people think that it is great for you because the doctors in research have proven that x y and z on the other hand dehydration plays a role in health yes but on the other hand um it's actually overrated and you should consider doing this and a lot of people think that that's true and so he actually says both sides of everything like when he answers a question he goes well a lot of people believe this and then other people believe this and then some people believe that and it's kind of intriguing so i heard you say that on the pod and in my head i was doing the thing listeners do and they're like oh i have something i would add to this conversation so i'm glad you brought it up because that's a technique have you ever heard of this technique called steel manning no do you know what straw manning is yeah it's an example like um um um well i can't even think of an example okay straw manning is basically when you let's say you are debating somebody something about something you're arguing about something or debating or um having a conversation and you kind of pigeonhole somebody's view into like you kind of create this really weak version of their argument so that you can knock it over really easily right like imagine a man made of straw you could just blow it you could just blow a gust of air and it would just fall over right away so it's like saying well sam i know that you you think that everybody just needs to shut their eyes and put their money into the vanguard etf no matter no matter what it's like well no that's not actually my argument but if you make it sound so if you make if you make a weak version of my argument then yeah it's gonna be really easy to contradict it um and that's what most people do so that's the like what i would say the common person habit is when there's something you disagree with you sort of if to present their side you present the straw man which is the absolute weakest version of that argument so you can knock it over and put your your view in place and what the smartest people do is the opposite they do something called steel manning which is even if they disagree with something they'll they'll go into it and they'll say you know people who believe that you should do x would say and they will they'll make the strongest possible argument for that thing right they'll it's almost like an in good faith way of figuring something out so the straw man is like a bad faith way of doing it's like i'm gonna i'm gonna kind of like cherry pick the weakest parts of your argument present that as your full argument and i'm gonna get rid of the the the nuance or the context or whatever else and the steel man would say you know um trump supporters uh people who who who support donald trump you know the straw man is uh they're just racist people who you know hate mexicans or whatever right like they're just you know whatever and the steel man version of it is you know some people are um the top priorities for them are their economy especially if they live in states like ohio and you know michigan or whatever and um they've been decimated for their jobs and they actually see that trump is willing to invest in their jobs and so it could actually be really great for this this and this reason although he says some things that are very like uh uncharacteristic and offensive to certain groups um he really you know he doesn't do a good job of that but the pros outweigh the cons and that would be the reason you would support donald trump and so steel manning is this tactic that i think if you want to be if you want to like build yourself into a learning machine who gets smarter over time you want to learn steel manning which is how do you understand the other person's viewpoint and actually build their argument stronger than they could build it themselves so that it doesn't mean you have to agree with it it means you have presented the strongest case on both sides and then you decide which one resonates with you which one is the the more true version or the more correct version that you should go with rather than making an unfair fight i think that's a like a legitimately life-changing skill i've just learned not skill but like lesson right that's one and i think peter thiel does that so it's not that he says oh some people would say this and some people say that so i don't know it's he still man's both sides of the argument and then he decides which one he believes is the correct one um and i think that's like a really powerful thing to do that's a good one that him and other smart people i know do that's great i'm gonna start doing that i i and i i wasn't i didn't know what that was and i don't actually know too much about uh logic and arguments and things like that i don't i don't understand it entirely right i haven't studied them give me one other thing i've been observing which is people who grow up and in high school do speech and debate are in college do speech and debate i'm just noting noticing that that is a common thing amongst among successful people i know and um there's really like i would say like three or four really common uh success paths that i like if i look at a whole bunch of successful people that i've met and i trace back down i'm like okay here's four pats that like like wow they all like this cluster of people all had that same experience growing up that's weird like this this group had this so i'll give you a couple of them one is speech and debate this comes this is sort of best done with like um either entrepreneurs investors or sales people so they're able to just really effectively tell their argument actually when i did the episode with hussein minaj uh the the comedian i was like you know you're like you're like me you're an indian kid growing up stand-up comedian's not usually like a career choice so like when did you figure out you wanted to do that he's like oh he's like i went to a chris rock show or i saw chris rock uh stand up he's like as soon as i saw it he's like i was a speech and debate kid in high school and i just saw this as humorous speech and debate i was like oh he has a he has a stance that he has to take which is like you know um you know women love behind things right and then it's like and then all it is is supporting arguments that ladder up to to like re-support that argument at the end but the supporting arguments don't have to be like super literal they could be like humorous i said it on this podcast i think that my speech and debate class in college was the only effective class i ever took oh you were one too i didn't even know that you were sweeping the vacation oh my god that makes perfect sense and i could and i i remember all the ones that i gave and and the really good part is when they make you argue about stuff that you don't actually like right yeah so totally because that's the thing in debate you don't get to choose the thing you already believe in you're assigned it's like you're going to argue for this thing whether you actually believe it or not so you have to get good at like steel manning that argument basically um so okay speech and debate is one i've traced another one is um hardcore gamers so people who get really freaking good at video games like i'm talking about like competitive or like complete obsession if channeled properly that same type of person can um can use the same kind of like strategy cooperation grinding mindset um like ability to like understand the rules of the game and then find the shortcuts find the hacks in the game find the glitches of the game to get in you know the infinite money hack basically so i know a whole bunch of people that got super successful in crypto they all came from like this runescape mafia it's basically a bunch of dudes who used to go in this game called runescape and they were trading in the arena basically they were like buy sell they would they'd go farm and get some virtual goods and they'd go flip them and they were basically digital flippers and like guess what that same group of people is really [ __ ] good at crypto it was early on it figured it out early they were good at poker they're like that same skill set applies to a whole bunch of things that can be successful so hardcore gaming is another one um there's an obsession and a strategy component to it that i think plays well later um and these are ironic because that's one thing your parents if they saw you doing they'd be like what a waste of time why are you just why are you wasting your time playing video games go learn something useful when in actuality the skills you build gaming are so applicable later i think that there was a time recently where i forget exactly what it was but someone was trying to solve a a a not a math problem but some type of like code where you had to like sequence dna something i forget get exactly what it was where you had to do like a series of incredibly hard problems in order to solve something very important and no one could figure it out and then this like medical board put it out for gamers and turned it into a game and they solved it in like a month or something like that no way yeah that's amazing yeah like we both invested in synthesis school which is basically teaching kids through games it's the it's a riff off of when elon musk was at spacex he designed a school for his own kids to go to and they called it astro which is like to the stars and it was a school insides of spacex that only the rocket scientist kids basically could go to and elon's kids would go to it and then they basically spun that out and sorry the the premise of the school was kids will learn more when they're having fun and they're engaged nothing is more fun and more engaging to a kid than a game and um when they start to play the game they will start to learn all the necessary skills strategies and tactics to win that game and so like so they they spun that out at synthesis school now it's available to anybody and so people are you know doing it makes a few million dollars a year of recurring revenue of tuition base of people sending their kids there and the entrance the application to apply to the school is this game and i played it i couldn't even beat the game i couldn't even beat the game that basically an eight-year-old is supposed to beat in order to get into the like candidate pool for synthesis it's like all it does there's no instructions it's you versus a computer there's dots on a screen and you make a move and the computer makes a move you make a move computer makes a move and then eventually the computer wins and you're like oh okay so you're supposed to get to the green dot okay that's how the computer went all right now i'm going to try to get to the green dot how do i be oh i see the computer can move diagonal let me try doing that and it's this trial and error figuring out process that like your brain is just fully locked in by the way it's called um there's basically like an aids-like virus and scientists for a decade or two couldn't figure out the structure of a protein-cutting enzyme and they set it out to gamers and they figured it out in three weeks yeah all of world's problems like you know peace in the middle east all it requires is a video game uh if we want to pull it off just give it to the gamers um even even ethereum by the way i don't know if you know the founding story of ethereum but the guy who made it this guy vitalik um who's this like you know ultra nerd looking guy super nerd alien looking guy brilliant guy like if you read his blog posts so thoughtful so brilliant like next zuckerberg next bill gates type vibes for sure he actually credits that he was a he was a hardcore world of warcraft player he was grinding like crazy he got to level 60 which is the max at the time and he had like leveled up his character and earned all this stuff and then the game maker changed the rules of the game they like changed the way the items worked and like some of his character items like that he had worked so hard for got taken away and he was like so he was just like for three weeks he was like inconsolable he was like just so upset he couldn't believe it and he found it so unjust that the game maker could just like he didn't own his items that the game maker owned the items it could just change the rules on her and rug pull them at the last second and ethereum is basically this global computer where the users own their own you own your own tokens you own your own items you have your own private keys then there's no company there's no the the whole platform is designed so that the the app makers could never do that to you and he credits that as like a pretty major influence in his thinking and like sent him down a rabbit hole of like why is the world the way it is and how can i change it i never heard that story so what what's the uh what's the last one or two last one or two so arbitragers so these are people you've probably met a bunch of people who are like yeah like gamblers or they're successful now but they're like yeah i got my start doing like um you know kind of like an affiliate ad network online sending traffic to porn sites or like uh you know like yeah i realized you could just buy this t-shirt you could drop ship this t-shirt and i could get this 10 vig just in the arbitrage between this ad network and this place this click and that click they just love the action they love the action they learn how to do internet marketing at a like very fundamental level and um and at some point they get sort of disillusioned like okay what am i doing here i'm just sending clicks to plenty of fish and i make you know seven dollars per click margin and i'm just like i doesn't what am i doing here could i apply the same skill to a brand that i create to a product i genuinely believe in to a an education app that i make whatever and they they go on to do some pretty great things so i've noticed that that's one more um and there's there's there's actually a few other archetypes that i i don't want to spend the whole episode doing it like teachers is another one i met the founder of alibaba jack ma he was a former teacher and um when did you meet him i met him in college there was this uh trip organized if there was this thing called kairos which they named yeah i did 100 top 100 college entrepreneurs and it was a total horse [ __ ] like we applied the night before we had we were they didn't know anything about us and we got in because like they i went to duke and they needed a quota of a kid from duke and so they got we got into it even though we had done nothing and um and just to show you how like fake the world is we got into that hundred entrepreneurs thing uh the event took place at the new york stock exchange they had it like shut down because the the guy who started it his dad's like mega loaded and super powerful bill clinton came to speak so it seemed like this ultra legit event it was not legit at all like it was like just a total party and meet up for like random college kids like the forbes 30 then cnn shows up and i get on cnn and i have this clip of me pitching my sushi restaurant on cnn as like the next big thing and cnn runs it as like oh college breakout success here this business is one of the best businesses in college right now so it's like oh if you believe cnn you would think oh this is like a great business idea that they're featuring on cnn no it just happened to be that i was in front of the camera and cnn didn't give a [ __ ] they're just recording stuff and putting it on putting another filling air time you know they didn't care there's no filter uh there's a quality filter and then at the end of that they were like hey you know through our connections we got the sea of alibaba to pay for all of us to go all expenses paid here to china for a week to hang out with him and see their headquarters and all that so i got to go on that with jack ma with jack ma and we talked to jack ma and jack ma tells the story and he goes um people were asking what are the keys to success and he goes in china there's two successful ceo types can i guess yeah go teachers teachers one he was a teacher yeah military correct okay i don't know how you knew that that was amazing have i told that story before you just knew that it's a guess yeah he was like military um you know the rigor of operations uh that you need in business like there's no better training for that than the rigors of military and the systems and the timing the production the detail-oriented nature he's like so any manufacturing business in china the best leaders the best ceos are ex-military and then he goes for the non-factory type businesses like in alibaba teachers tend to do pretty well he goes and we said why you know that doesn't make any sense to me and he goes a teacher is one of the only professions where the success of the student matters more than the success of the teacher like they care more that they're the people under them succeed he goes in management that is you know the best principle for breeding great managers is if you're like a teacher and your success was not in how high you climbed but how great your managers became and um so that was his his reasoning i don't know if that was correct that'd be sick uh but i thought that was tight i can't believe i've never heard that you tell me that story that you got to go to meet jack ma that's actually bad ass yeah there was some crazy stories there but we have some other stuff we should talk about let me tell you about something um go to rockautorockauto.com all right i'm going rock auto like auto like car okay yeah all right i'm on a craigslist looking ass site what uh what is the traffic this is a sampler classic here so this company is called the rock auto rock auto i don't know oh my god 20 million monthly yes okay so i was listening to an mma podcast michael bisping's podcast and he does this ad read he goes if you're buying car parts go to rock rockauto.com they've got every car part you could ever want and i had never really heard of a uh i know toyo or something like that tire sponsors a lot of like sporting events so i understand you know like it's a lot of like meathead car people but i've never heard of an auto parts other than like napa and the famous one and i went to this website rockauto.com because they were sponsoring a bunch of podcasters and it's the most bare-bones site i've ever seen and i was trying to do research on it and there's close to nothing out there there's a few articles from like five six seven years ago but basically started by two brothers i think in michigan they've got over a million parts and uh the traffic is nuts so according to similar web it's like north of 20 million and look at the source mostly all direct and so these guys this so this must be something that um car uh whatever repair shops go to order or just customers are going no it's meant for um um just individuals just nerds just guys who are tinkering or if you just like wow for example something broke on my car and i just like i just need this little part i could replace it on my on my own just like a little like door handle thing and so i was like trying to figure out where to get it and they had it no way so do they own the do they like inventory parts themselves so they don't so what they do is they connect with dozens of or hundreds of suppliers and they just have this like intricate system of distributors uh all over the the country and they send you the part they need and their goal is to have uh the like one part for every car that you need so if you ever need anything for a car they can get their hands on it you know kind of like how bezos said if there's a book in existence we should sell it and that's kind of auto part and i was thinking about this for a few different reasons the first is with ecom i was like what doesn't amazon crush it in and they don't crush it in hardware so like home depot style stuff right uh homedepot.com is like the fourth or fifth or sixth something like that largest uh retailer in the world still and they've not gotten hurt at all with amazon really or a little bit they have but not in terms of like buying screws online and another thing is auto parts whether for cars or motorcycles and so there's this company called revzilla um who was recently acquired for like 500 million dollars and they sold motorcycle gear motorcycle parts and then i was looking at rock auto and then i was looking at a bunch more and it's incredibly fascinating because there's not that many new people in this space but it seems like a pretty huge space you know morgan stanley had this report and they said like it's a 70 billion a year industry but i just looked up the ceo of rock otto he looks like jeff bezos before basis got ripped yeah it's like he looks like hch yeah he looks like the before photo of jeff bezos yeah and uh it's amazing i think it's interesting i've always thought the space because i i something broke in my car like i said and i tried to like figure out how to buy the part and it it's a pain it's a it's it's a pain but the problem with this is is that you'd have to have so many skus um i mean yeah like i'm looking at like bmw like i have a bmw x5 bmw x5 or not even not even that if you just go to bmw it's like you can look at a car from 1939. it's like okay here's the model so here's the makes in 1939 and then you could find a part for the cooling system of the 1939 bmw blah blah blah like it's amazing right it's so hard it's a real it's a really hard problem to solve for but what's interesting is i don't think this is a demand problem which is cool solving for demand problems suck solving for technology problems rocks if you could figure out how to build a mouse trap that's far better than figuring out like are mice even going to go into this thing right um you know what i mean absolutely so that's why you want to be supply constrained not demand constrained when you use yes when you do something and this it's just incredibly interesting to me and i think in order to get popular on this you just would crush uh seo you and and and that's how you'd have to do it and i think that you could do it by sponsoring a lot of youtubers and things like that and uh it's just an interesting business that i don't think has has has taken off like a or an interesting industry i know amazon's thought about going into that space but it's pretty fast but this is worth i bet you rock auto i was looking online trying to like triangulate some of their stuff and i found some old interviews but if they i i would think they have to do at least 100 million in sales and i don't think they other than the recent podcast stuff if i if i bet you they don't spend any money on marketing other than like sponsoring like maybe like some car shows wow unbelievable uh that's crazy right that's a good find great fine great find got to give you props on that one that's it go to their similar web and look at if you look at where their traffic is coming from virtually 100 percent practically all of it is coming from search and direct so people typing in rockauto.com amazing uh what else you got what's this hotel thing you got okay i'm gonna start a hotel i don't know if i'm going to do it today i'm definitely not going to do it today but i'm going to do it soon can let me explain what i'm going to do okay so there are i went and met with some like olympians the other day this guy who is this olympian dmv he's a runner he heard that i liked running and uh he asked if i wanted to get dinner i went and got dinner with him and like eight of his athletes so he like was an olympian and then now has an agency and he has like 41 track and field athletes not really popular for most people for me it was cool and i could like i knew who they were like a triple jumper a miler whatever and i was talking to them about money and they don't make anything like like some of them like have little airbnbs on the side or they bought a car to put on toro and one of them got a is an american record holder in her event another one um won a gold medal and so anyway i was interested in that because i was like man if i wanted to like pay you to be my coach i bet you i could get you to do that like you can't be that expensive and i started thinking that uh have you heard of ufc how they have this thing called the performance institute yeah yeah they built these uh like kind of state-of-the-art ufc gyms where the athletes can go train but i think it's also kind of a tourist not tourist destination but it's like uh there's a public-facing component to it right like you can i don't think there is because when i've only heard about this when i've heard about this i'm like i want to go there i want to work out there i would do they have a hotel i would love to stay there and i think so i think i could create a hotel or a piece of like a large piece of property and here's how i'm going to test it so in this order here's what i'm gonna do i think i could figure out is is there demand for this and the way that i could do it is i could get a bunch of these olympians the idea first is is it a demand for this this being what it just i think i can create like a resort like uh where you go to just to train and work out with competitive athletes okay so and i think i can convince the competitive athletes to live there for most of the year as like a training place and they do a camp in the morning and train for the rest of the day and get paid to do that gotcha okay i think i could solve that and the way that i would try and solve for that is i'm gonna contact like a really nice hotel i'm gonna explain to them what i'm doing then i'm gonna contact some of these athletes and be like hey i'm going to pay you this much money i'm going to charge these people a hotel fee plus a fee on top of that and i'm going to give you a cut of the money and i think i can host an event at some of these places and and make it work so my brother-in-law who's been on the pod before brother aaron for the og listeners that remember him he loves jiu-jitsu and he loves any combat sports he loves training boxing he loves training muay thai he loves training jiu jitsu and he wanted to create this thing so he's created this thing called bali fight club and what he's doing is almost exactly what you're talking about so he's like all right i need to create like an mma style vacation so he's like basically a lot of people are interested in like going to bali being on a beach and going to like a resort he's like so he used to live uh near bali so he's like oh i know like i know the perfect spot for this where there's a bunch of little villas and the villas are like just dope like you're you're on the most beautiful beach you're in a private villa there's like a chef that's like cooking for everybody and all that stuff and each family gets their own villa or each like kind of like resident would get their own or you can buddy up or whatever and um so there's all these little little huts little villas and it's right on the beach and then he's like dude the best kind of like trainers in the world for for combat sports or often in thailand he's like i'm gonna get so he met a pro boxer when he was on vacation in mexico and the guy's like okay i'm in and so he has like a pro boxer a project guy and a pro muay thai guy and they're gonna come on the trip too and they want a vacation also and they're basically like yeah we'll train the the people and they're like you get to train like an athlete trains we're gonna do two a days you're gonna have a massage in between to like kind of recover the body so we're gonna treat you like you're gonna get to train like a pro athlete trains while also being on vacation and the whole thing is like whatever like five grand or something like that five six man and this is live this is what he's creating right now so he's basically he's got like two people he's just waiting till he gets to like eight people and when there's eight people like the trip will happen um and so so that's what he's doing which is very similar to your idea but instead of being a hotel it's more like a a getaway like a like a like i would do a ghetto i would do getaways that i would do getaways at first and then eventually i would acquire a piece of property within an hour of a major uh international airport right you do it in the us yeah like i think you do it in austin probably because austin is becoming like a mini center of like health nerds right um i think that you could maybe do it in california you for sure could do it in like a boulder or florida somewhere in florida yeah i think you could amazing yeah i think that's a cool idea i think it's sick especially because the get the getaway is a great mvp for something like that right and it's easy builds up the momentum and that's not hard to do um so yeah i feel like that's that's pretty great let me tell you one more thing go to manuals so it's called like manuals like uh like a like a owner's manual manuals lib lib like library manualslib.com the ultimate manuals library so it's a website that's just full of manuals okay but get this oh this is great like i was building some i'm assembling something i don't have the manual i need to fix something i don't have the manual it's just here it's like here's my kitchenaid yes this website according to their about page so the way that you find out if a business is interesting is you if you they make money through advertising you scroll down and you click advertise with us and you find out about them yeah they according to their media kit they get at least 16 million monthly uniques of which 90 nearly is from search okay they've got a brown 3.8 million uh products on there with 5.2 million manuals 106 000 brands and 3.2 terabytes of data indexed hilarious dude they just have every manual they scan it and they like seo the [ __ ] out of their like rankings for when people but it gets more interesting it gets more interesting i i was researching this i cannot find anyone on linkedin anyone online who mentions these guys or works there i can't find a thing about it i've looked all over the i found one person who on their linkedin says that they were a freelancer and they're based out of europe that's like pretty much all i saw their main competitor is this is where it gets interesting their main competitor is this company called owner iq and they own this website called manualsonline.com and owner iq it's kind of a weird business but but basically they if you're going to buy something i don't know how they do it but it's kind of like tech target that's another publicly traded company does that they they they sell data to retail stores or brands that somehow helps them figure out who's buying their stuff and they i don't actually don't know what they do with it but owner iq owns manuals online and they do well over a hundred million in revenue and and manuals online is one of their products is that nutty this is wild also if you look at their like traffic uh you know like they really grew starting in like 2012 um they like shot up the ranks into becoming like one of the top sites now so it's definitely it was created in 2012 and it just like pretty instantaneously like within the year uh became an ultra popular uh ultra popular site the uh yeah these types of business print money now this was a ad based business so i guess they're trying to get you to like i'm looking for a manual and i'm like a manual for the thing i bought and then i'm like [ __ ] i'm gonna buy something else because i i don't want to deal with this like kind of what's so there's this company there's this company called tech target and they're publicly traded their market cap is [ __ ] but they still do like nine figures in revenue it's called tech target and i believe if i'm not mistaken tech target owns um like websites like cfo.com and a bunch of other websites where if you are a buyer uh if so they own security docs.com they own techguy.com they own things like that and so basically if you're the cfo of a 5 000 person company and you are the decision maker for buying like this is like an oversimplification but like you're gonna say our company now needs to use quickbooks instead of this other software that's a 10 million dollar a year product that we're gonna have to purchase and so this company called tech target will create cfo.com and create news just hoping that the cfo will read it when deciding between quickbooks and this other website and they'll figure that out and capture their email and contact information and sell it to quickbooks and then all their competitors right so basically it's rooted in influencing what you buy yeah that would make sense to me i don't know what the manual one would because that assumes you've already bought the thing so i guess that's a little bit different but um yeah these are these are great little like kind of secret jam businesses that are um you know like when andrew wilkinson came on we asked him you know what type of business do you want to buy high growth high profits he said i want to buy a new zealand business which is a business that is just independent uh sustainable um does not rely on like one you know like facebook ads or something like some paid channel to like to grow that could change any minute it's not going to be competed against by google and facebook and amazon they'll never care to compete against this and that's a new zealand business that he can you know safely buy these are to me new zealand businesses that you you've identified two new zealand businesses here yeah they're neat i i think they're cool i think that like tech target that i mentioned they're based out of newton massachusetts this other one rock auto i think that they're in sorry they're in madison wisconsin so where the university of wisconsin is and then manuals lib they're like in croatia i can't find a thing about them i can't find it i feel like there's there's a business you can create okay let's say you wanted to create something like this uh i think you could you'd have to look at okay what's new what's a new thing where you need manuals so maybe there's some new product new types of products that are out there that need something like this like for example could be software things like that but software is not not new enough the other one you could do is any professional search so like well it's something that only dentists are going to search for that's like really obscure but really important to them maybe it's around you know certain tools or the software that they use or like you know manuals for the equipment that they've bought uh maybe it's you know treatment uh or like prescriptions or something like that and some people have tried to create like a separate google for doctors because doctors google the [ __ ] out of stuff um but like you know i think that's really hard one another the other way the easier way but less valuable is you figure out how to rank at the top for everything that a doctor would search for and you just become the definitive authority in some profession whether it's car mechanics or dentists or doctors or insurance agents or whatever real estate agents something that they have a lot of searches for that's not like already nobody's created the definitive central repository of information for it that's a perfect segue for what i'm about to say now listen to this speaking of dentists it's not even a segway i'm adding to it and i was reading this article about the top creators on youtube this year number three for the most popular creator of youtube shorts is called dental digest and it's a kid who makes here's the description of his thing satisfying dental reviews dental education and dental lifestyle content this kid's got 6.1 million subscribers on youtube only doing dentist stuff is that ridiculous wow i'm looking at one of his right now so and i think it says uh what did he say uh like we are uh like i'm a third year dental student uh his about yeah his about is third year dental student wants to help you discover your best smile it's satisfying dental reviews dental education and dental lifestyle content how crazy is that he's represented by knight media which is the the guy reed who we had on who uh he came on podcast and he represents mr beast also amazing right designer toothbrush from france 8 million views dude number six on this list is also a dentist dude what's going on it must be that dental content is just interesting for non-dentists that's the only explanation for this because like how many dentists are there they're they're not even eight million dollars i don't know but this guy the dental gi just guy is that i don't think he's doing like popping videos where you like watch someone pull a tooth i think he's like he's reviewing products reviewing yeah he's doing stuff that is not like anyway it's kind of interesting uh so i don't know where we go with this but that was so weird i just watched a video it was so weird it's weird right the world's funny i'm sure there's so much opportunity out there we've just identified dentists manuals auto part we've talked about so much stuff just a short amount of time what do you want to do uh let's wrap it up i have some other ideas but let's save those for the next pod let's wrap it up with one other topic um which one you want to do uh you tell me you pick do uh i don't care let's do uh okay i'm not really ready to talk about this okay i'll talk about this okay so here's um actually i kind of want to hear you talk about this let's do this work week creator economy thing we never really got to talk about that so i saw that adam uh adam ryan i think is his name he used to be president of the hustle something like that like yeah i led our sales team he worked for me leading sales so he worked for he was kind of like your number two guy basically at the hustle for a period of time and he had left he went did a couple things i don't know exactly he was like yeah you're a competitor or something like re recourse or recount i don't remember yeah so he did some education thing i don't know what happened i guess he left that or it didn't work out or something like that so he is he came out with a new company recently and uh it's called work week and so like describe give people like this simple description of what it is and then i want to hear your opinion on it i don't entirely understand what's the url workweek.com.com i think it's dot com i think they got a nice domain there workweek.comworkweek.com and so it looks like so it says workweek.com it says um what's there i'll read about it it says a new kind of media company so it's creating a media company it says you want to follow people not institutions so i think what he's doing is there's a bunch of creators that have their own niche so like maybe this dentist guy would have been a fit so it's like um some guy named jared devchevsky who's doing the healthcare huddle which would be like i don't know was it like a sub stack or something like that it was like a newsletter yeah and it's all about healthcare so he's like he's covering the vertical of of healthcare there's nicole who's covering the vertical of fintech there's the skype matthew who's covering the vertical of cannabis and um i think they were already creating content so they were already content creators he kind of like is scouting them and saying okay uh they have a good newsletter let's say um and he's like kind of like bringing them all under one umbrella i think he gets the rights to their content and in exchange for distribution and money is kind of my guess the website's very nice i like the design of the website very much um but this idea is kind of interesting to me and you're you're my go-to on the media side and i know you you like you like adam and you're not going to like you know say this is a terrible idea or you know i'm just going to say it's a great idea if you don't believe it so i want to know what is your honest opinion of this idea because you know media better than anyone the way okay a few things the way that it's positioned now it looks like it's just an ad agency which in itself isn't like horrible like we represent these creators yes right i think the hard part here is that the creators that they represent are nobodies like maybe there'll be somebody's one day right but at the moment this cannabis health yeah i've never heard of any of these people the yeah the cannabis thing it looks like the the guy dm me one time he had like 2 000 subscribers like the healthcare guy has 500 followers on twitter so not not a huge fan yeah and and so i think uh the problem i mean it's not really a problem you're just building an ad agency i think but in in workweek's case it's kind of a challenge because you don't have any ad inventory to sell yeah you do so that i think it's gonna be really hard i think it's gonna be a very hard business i would never raise money for this i think it could be a really cool business that potentially like makes money but from a creator's point of view i have a few perspectives first of all i i don't love the language a new kind of media company it's it doesn't it's anyone who possesses themselves that's basically a big mistake which is positioning yourself only to other media people yeah yeah and like they don't care they're not your customer anyways right like that's not who you want i guess this is the landing page for a creator it's just jargon is what it is but uh whatever that's that's a mistake that's easily fixed um the from a creator's point of view i think a few things one i think this whole creator economy thing is incredibly over hyped i think that the vast majority of people who are going to be able to make a living from this is um is okay so let's small let's do the steel mining thing so it's so when you say create a economy is over-hyped that means something different to everybody because everybody has their own perspective of like is my opinion overhyped well how do i know so tell me what are people saying about the creator economy that you think is incorrect so people are saying that the creator economy is this like new economy everything's new um that now anyone with the voice can make a living and that's what that's yeah i don't draw banning you strawberry you gave them a loser voice while you said their argument which is hilarious so they say that anyone okay i'm gonna try and actually do it the right way um a lot of people think that like the creator economy it means that uh a variety of different people more than ever before can create stuff that is seen by by people and they can make a living right um that is true in that there are more than ever before but the ratio of people that are going to succeed is still really small and i think it should be small only the best should survive and the best likely don't necessarily need you um or at least they wouldn't be silly enough to sell you their ip or their content you know no one would be crazy enough to do that you know that it's the whole reason why caller daddy bailed and started their own thing um and so it's kind of like a paradox in that the ones that you can acquire you don't want to acquire and the ones that you want you cannot acquire because they're too savvy or you acquire them right you did it all right you bet on them early they did in fact they fail and then when they blow up they're like i'm gonna leave and you're like ah but i bet everything on this creator this is a personality and when they leave i have no recourse i have no leverage exactly it's just like the there's a reason why none of the um what's that thing called uh that was on twitch and on youtube what's it called it was called an mcn a multi-channel network so one big one's called maker's studio i think that's what that's the one you're referring to yeah and it actually had a big exit i think yeah they they kind of like lucked i wouldn't okay luck is a little disparaging but like the business kind of wasn't working but they had a they got a fantastic exit to disney and then you know and the business fall apart good for them yeah right so they timed it well where disney bought it before the truth actually came out but i think what the truth is now is that maybe these things can work but likely it's going to be needlessly hard yeah the same thing happened on twitch uh ninja became the number one gaming star in the world when fortnite became the number one game in the world and ninja got picked up by red bull and ninja was getting paid millions of dollars every single month by both fans as well as advertisers the guy was bank making 30 million dollars a year and this team that had bet on him luminosity they were basically like they acquired his rights to the commercial rights to his channel it's all under contract how much did they spend you know earlier they didn't spend much right because he had no he had no following at the time so it's kind of like you know adam going and acquiring health care huddle at 500 followers you know pick up pick up the option on the cheap you say this guy's really talented he could become something someday so luminosity had him under contract but uh he was like yeah hey luminosity um i'm not sharing any revenue with you and they're this is my fictional account of what happened but they're like but the contract he's like yeah i just i i don't think that's fair uh if you want to go try to enforce this you can but you know i will basically drag you through the mud as like trying to bring me down which is like the worst thing you can do for acquiring new players is have everybody know that ninja is so unhappy with you and does not want to deal with you um and ninja feels like you screwed him and so illuminati said to sit quiet and shut up and just like take the l so they you know they weren't getting paid the full amount or whatever i don't know all the details but like they weren't sharing the revenue that they should have shared uh they still got to kind of be branded on him you know be associated with his brand but they they didn't get the upside of their great bet and then loaded was this talent agency said ninja goes loaded and loaded is like work week and they had all the stars they had all the top streamers on their thing and uh sure enough ninja starts getting a deal with samsung and now these deals are getting big and he's getting equity deals and this mouse peripherals company accessories company and um guess what ninja's not with loaded anymore right because uh why do i need loaded like um i can just do this on my own they're taking too much and you know same thing happened with doctor disrespect he goes and leaves for a different agency that's going to take less and you know like you're it's a race to the bottom as i say where you're competing with everybody wants these stars to be in their like roster and the next guy will do it for less because hey if i can get the top star like that's just good for me even if i even if they're a loss leader even if i don't make money off them and so the talent basically has ended up ended up what happened to those two companies luminosity and so luminosity and the esports team still exist um they just you know they they didn't get the it's like the whole thing was based on we're gonna acquire this talent we're gonna train them we're gonna promote them we're gonna cross promote all the players with each other and we're gonna build stars and we're gonna have this like portfolio of stars that like bring in all this money but like that basically got like torpedoed and anybody who's smart knows this now there might still be one or two teams that the team brand name is like the yankees um where it ends up becoming valuable like i think faze clan is trying to go public in a spack right now which is like crazy to me um and you know they had the same thing the number one streamer they had this guy tfu he was like uh let me out of my contract i don't want to be with you guys anymore because he was getting great money he's like why am i giving 20 30 40 to these guys i don't want to do that and so he's like let me out and they're like no he's like let me out and it was like free tifu became like the big thing the fans are always going to be on the side of the personality that they fell in love with they're never going to be on the side of the team and it's what's going on in the nba right now so this business i think i think like can can these types of businesses work yes but if you it depends what your goals are if you want to start like a tech company or like a vc thing like maybe i wouldn't go this route because i think it'd be it's going to be a huge headache that doesn't mean it can't work but i also think that one of my biggest fears is starting something in the prime of my youth when i have the most amount of energy which is for most people in their 30s and 40s they have a lot of energy they've got some wisdom and they still got some time to create something and you go down this path and you look back after toiling for five years and you go [ __ ] that i i we should have done this other thing right and i think there are potentially other opportunities that are even similar to this in that space where i hope that a pivot can be made otherwise that that five year looking back is likely going to happen that's a good point there's like a graph that's like um like energy starts at this high in your 20s and just goes sort of like down over time which is like energy which is like not just like your actual energy but the amount of time you can amount of your energy you're going to get to put towards your work so like you know oh you got married or you get you're good you're getting a relationship a little bit less time you have kids less time you have like you know let's say other responsibilities come up in your life or you're just you're more you get more fatigued you know when i was in my 20s i used to work 15 hours a day that wasn't i wasn't super productive but i was throwing 15 hours a day at the problem i remember i slept in the office 200 nights one year when i was like 24 25. and so that was like max energy now i work on average five hours a day and um like so energy goes down but then wisdom goes up judgment goes up skill goes up and so in your 30s the lines like cross it's like the highest energy you're gonna have while you have some good wisdom and judgment and then in your 40s your wisdom and judgment goes up but your energy goes down and it's like you know not the peak anymore that's at least my my opinion of it yeah and my point with that is we are in this crazy world at the moment where if you want to work in the creator space there's a few routes that people go a lot of people are creating like little pieces of software that they hope to sell for 5 10 15 a month right like two creators yeah yeah we're two creators and i'm like i don't i wouldn't do that i think that those businesses nine out of 10 times are going to fail 99 of the time they're going to fail you know you look at the difference between a buffer which is like a five dollar twitter sharing tool it did good or it's doing i mean it did well but it like plateaued versus like a hubspot or a hootsuite that like scaled way beyond that because they sold the same thing but this two we're using right now riverside we use this thing to record this you know they charge whatever i don't know nine or twenty dollars a month or something like that to random ass podcasters like us and uh you know they're hoping to be you know it's hard to imagine a world where a business like this gets to like 50 million in revenue right yes it's very hard and and and so i think of creators and i think of that space i'm like uh man that's gonna be really hard like have some people done it yeah mailchimp did it but like there's way less like it's really challenging and um another way you could go is like do this like ad route and like that could be cool as long as you don't want to hire a lot of people you just want to make a lot of profit early on but if i was in this i would totally look at the markets and the markets are like all about this dow [ __ ] if you like use the word dao and web 3 in your memo or your deck like you're gonna raise money right like it's pretty crazy it's all it's just so i'm just like just go over the go it's far easier to chase the market or just get in the mix than it is to maybe do what you like strictly or passionate about this brings me to one thought that's been rolling in my head and i didn't want to bring it up because it's like what does this have to do with anything but you actually kind of tied it in that nicely which is there's a certain luck with your time with the timing of free agency so i thought about this with basketball because um this funny thing happened in basketball where every year the like salary cap changes it goes up or down based on how much revenue is being made and then like every seven years they like renegotiate the overall deal between players and owners and so like there was a time in the like kind of 90 late 90s or whatever where players could it was like they could just get these huge like 200 something million dollar contract seven year eight year there was no like limit to the number of years and then owners got wise that the next negotiation they're like hey like this guy used to be good in year one of the contract by year eight he was totally washed up and i'm still paying them 50 million dollars so like let's make the maximum length of the contract five years and the players like okay so like basically whenever you become a free agent which as a player is your time to go negotiate your deal um like it really mattered like magic johnson back in the day i think he signed a deal where he he had a 20-year deal where he made one million dollars flat per year what and like it was like at the time it was the fattest contract because he was magic johnson but like what magic johnson made was nothing he was making one million a year a scrub today and the nba will make more than one million a year so just the timing of like barely over the minimum what's the minimum half of the money was like yeah like something like that like 500 600 000. and so um you know magic johnson just by being in the 80s which wasn't that long ago like missed out on hundreds of millions of dollars probably a billion dollars total like a star like that with off-court endorsements would end up making a billion dollars over their career so you know that's just like luck of timing okay well there's also a luck of timing in when it comes to business not just in like oh you gotta time the market like oh you know let's say the market's going good and my company got acquired because everybody felt all the acquirers were flush with cash versus a recession not even that what i'm actually talking about is like as an entrepreneur the time like the random time when you free up like you quit your job or your company gets acquired or like whatever that thing was there's so much luck involved in like what's going on in that moment totally i absolutely we have a friend uh sully who came out he was episode one of the podcast and he says the story which is like you know i was at microsoft i quit my job i went home just to my family's house in florida and i was just kind of like okay well what the hell am i gonna do now and so he didn't have a grand plan but he had his what the hell am i going to do now moment at the same exact day that the facebook launched its app platform so he's like i was doing nothing facebook launched his app platform so i was like okay i want to build a facebook app now whereas if he was just still employed or had a different idea six months earlier and he would have been in the middle of that he would have never built that app which have never led to him come to silicon valley getting acquired and getting his first million dollars and then that turned into so much more and like it's not to say all of his success was luck obviously he did a lot of good things but there is some luck of just when you're free and like what's going on in the market like where are the waves happening like right now we're doing i'm doing all this stuff like at this e-commerce company if i didn't have this e-commerce company i would have been all in on web3 i would have been investing more building more maybe started a company in that space because i would have been free to do that at a time when that's the obvious [ __ ] thing to do right now is go work on web3 invest in web 3 and build in web3 or ai or whatever there's like two or three things going on right now where it's like that's the that's definitely the thing to do but if you're occupied you can't do it and so yeah and that's that's a little bit of my point which is i think that i think that if you create a restaurant that's really good and like momofuku or milk bar like momofuku or like that cake like it's not particularly like it's not really different it maybe is slightly better but like whatever he made it work and he became incredibly wealthy that guy david chang and it's a cool gig whatever it's awesome that will work in the 1920s as well as in the 2020s um so you could pull [ __ ] off no matter what there's some stuff that you can just make work and if you just give enough time you'll make that work but then there's other things where it's like there's this tidal wave coming and if you just catch the wave even if you're shitty it's gonna be awesome um i think michael acton smith is his name the guy who started calm he told me that he was like i felt like he was like i didn't know anything about meditation but i was just able to talk to a couple people and i felt like there's this huge wave coming and if i could just paddle just a little bit and catch that wave success is gonna be incredibly easy right and he told me that and i was like oh that's so you're you're totally right if you just catch the right thing at the right time and it doesn't seem to be the right thing at the right the right time but kind of around the right time and kind of the right thing it happened with us at the hustle newsletters we our newsletters weren't this like tidal wave of a business you know our exit wasn't like a 20 billion dollar like but it was like a nice like oh it just so happened that we caught this little trend at the right ish time well there's a i think most people would get some of the like so so the one part of what you said which is just like oh this market's ready to exp like the market is ready so it's like market timing i think everybody kind of gets market timing oh that's a thing it's important but it seems very external it's like oh i can't control that and it's like you hope you get it and sometimes you don't you try to look out for it but you never know what i'm talking about is even the one thing you can control which is your own personal availability timing and so i think this has two things one is like you should recognize that if there's a if there's a like a wave going on and you're occupied with something that's not ideal um like get the [ __ ] out of there because you just needed to be free right now it doesn't matter what you go do in that space you don't even need the idea you just need to be available you need to be single when all the you know when all the the eligible bachelors are walking down the street if you're not single if you're not on the street because that's that's when the parade was going on you're not gonna get you're not gonna get picked up and so it's like being available at a certain time is really really important and also that what that means is don't pick up a mediocre project that's going to occupy you because you just think oh well you know i think this can't hurt i'll make some good money i'll like i'll meet some people it's like well it will hurt in this silent invisible way which is you're going to become occupied and that likely has no longer in the market for good luck to happen to you and that lack of focus is more likely than not what ruins most everyone who tries to do anything interesting i tweeted out this thing to like get to do a little research i i i kind of [ __ ] up i tweeted out hey um what what is the biggest problem in your work life right now like i don't care if you're mega successful or if you're uh just like a mcdonald's like employee whatever doesn't matter who you are everybody's got like some career challenge that's on their plate right now what's yours and i said dm me and so i got a bunch of dms i forgot how did you get what i should have said is i'm not going to help everybody because that wasn't my intent i actually wanted to do research i wanted to know what problems you had so i could make content that like maybe speak like if i know anything about one of these problems great that i could put it out there if that's a common problem people have and so comment because some people i didn't think would be comfortable saying like the issue like what they're struggling with publicly yet at least 100 i don't know 100 200 something like that it was a lot and um and one of the most common ones was like um you know either some variation of i don't know what i want to do with my life but i know this ain't it or i kind of know what i want to do but i'm afraid to go do it like i'm doing this other thing right now and the answer to both of them is sort of the same which is whether you know what you want to do if you don't know what to do if you know this is not what you want to do the fail the first step is make yourself single get out of the bad relationship right like that is the the app because it is taking up space in a way that you're not your brain is not going to like properly assess the cost of that because you're going to just see the small benefits you're getting from it what you're not going to see is that actually you know you nothing can fit in here because that's there um i don't care if you're at microsoft or wherever and so that was like the number one and number two like thing but to me they're the same which is i don't like what i'm doing now should i go do x or what should i go do it doesn't really matter the answer to both is the same which is you got to get out of x if you're if you really like care if you want this to get to that amazing level like if you're okay with it as is fine you're okay with it as is but if you want more and this ain't gonna give you more you gotta get rid of it and that's the only decision you need to make right now you don't have to make the other decision yet yeah i completely agree i think that um just like you just gotta get a swing i told this to take enough swings you'll get you'll get a hit we have this guy who does uh for our ecommerce show he's amazing he's so good at like website optimization and he's like hey i got i want to talk to you like you know you told me i can use this card one time which is like hey give me some advice so i want to use it which is like i kind of want to go do web like i can't stop thinking about web3 i'm super interested in it but i don't know if i'm just like following a hype train and what's going to happen if the price is gonna crash and if it's all a bubble and i don't know all these things uh and i got a good thing going for me and basically i ended up talking him like as i talked to him i didn't talk him out of it i just let him talk out loud to where it was like blatantly obvious that he needs to throw away a good thing to maybe be working with you amazing which is me i'm one of his clients he's got a few clients his business is doing gangbusters and he's very good at it but he's sort of like unstimulated by just like e-commerce at this point and he's super curious about this other thing but it's like how do i let this go this brings in money and it's like i'm good at it my brand is all my identities tied to this and it's like well okay i asked him you know like i'll i'll read two bits of it because in case this like helps people which is i go do you only talk with your employees via text messages or uh slack well i meant like text format right uh yeah i try to i try not to do like calls i told them how many police do you have can we do a call and i was like just type it here let's see if that works how many employees do you have uh there's like i don't know there's probably like 12 in the main in my main ships of like actually maybe 15 of like between the fund and content and e-commerce 15 people probably associated with it but that's a combination of virtual assistants all the way up to like ben who's like you know my right-hand man i called the [ __ ] out of ben but i just typed everybody else um so okay so he he basically was like here's what i'm thinking blah blah i told him i go first question how much runway do you have if live if life costs you four thousand dollars a month to pay for it uh just make sure you have enough savings otherwise you can't really make this decision if you don't have any money uh yeah he was like i have you know like six months totally liquid and i have another six to twelve months that like i could totally eat into without without feeling bad um i think my when i go whenever i talk to people i say 24 months yeah i i just think that's a that's like that's like safe that's very safe i think you know you could do it but that's like 100 we're talking like a hundred grand yeah but to save up i mean that's what that means is weight and i think waiting is a very big cost to pay so you got to be sure you're willing to pay the price of waiting okay so then i said all right uh you presented me with three options but really there's two you said i can take on more clients and lose all my free time no do not do this you can keep your current clients and have some free time and it's a pretty safe path you could do that for six more months and then like collect more data if you're just not sure about something if you don't if you don't have conviction or you could quit what you're doing get rid of all your clients including me and go all in on it it's the riskiest most radical you should do this if you know what you want to do and it really just comes down to that do you know what you want if so then go for it do not wait do not hedge your bets i said if you don't know what you want then do path b where you collect information but be really specific about what you're trying to learn don't just wait for waiting sake and just hope that you'll feel more ready later talk to yourself about what is it that you're actually trying to figure out and then figure that out in the next six months um he's like he said some other stuff blah blah blah and i was like and at the end by the end of it i was like um you gotta ask yourself these three questions if i wasn't afraid of failing which which path would i pick because that's what you really want to do um then i said do you believe that if you put your mind to something you're going to succeed at it and i only ask him this because i could see he's a star he's really good at what he does so i know he is the answer is yes if he puts his mind to it he'll get good at something and then i said um so if you know that if you weren't afraid of failing what would you do if you put your mind to it you could succeed you believe that correct yes okay then what should you do he's like well then the answer is obvious i should go do that thing so i ended up talking myself out of i ended up talking one of my star guys off of my team which kind of sucks but so it happened uh you know if it will soon like you know who knows people get cold feet but like he knows what the answer should be now from his own like i just asked questions they were leading questions yes but at the end of the day they were questions and the answers were very obvious uh to him and it was like you know so why would i not do this you know it all just traced back to some version of like fear and anxiety that's great i mean we're just never going to see how this is you know you only want fear and anxiety driving the car they can be in the car yeah they're a passenger but like they're not allowed to hold the wheel um can we wrap up with one quick thing yeah do you see uh tyrone woodley is now fighting jake paul uh yeah the other guy dropped out or something yeah i'm crazy right what do you feel about how you feel about that so let down yeah let down as well yeah woodley's just the most boring fighter so that just sucks so bored i'm so bored by this i wanted tommy fairy to fight him um dude jake paul though i'm gonna pay money to watch this stuff do you pay money to watch fights yeah i pay when i feel like it's like somebody i i really care about i want like if it's a mcgregor fight i'll pay yeah and i'll pay because hey i don't want to hassle with like the bootleg stream like crapping out at the wrong time and also i feel like i'm gonna get my money's worth whereas if it's just like two if it's somebody i don't really care about then i'll just watch clips or i'll stream it or whatever like i'll figure out another way but i won't pay the 60 70 80 bucks for that what website uh do you use hey what are we trying to do here is you're trying to knock me allegedly are you a narc now [Laughter] do you use a good one uh yeah do you have one that you go to all the time i'll dm you some things that i do uh i used to use this website called project free tv i don't think it's around anymore and i would watch all my free tvs tv shows on that now apparently there's this thing called crack streams which is pretty good may have may have taken a glance at that one yeah but i do the same thing i i buy a lot of them i don't know because it's got a z in the name streams with a z i also uh it's good i also um i pay for youtube tv so i get a lot of stuff there and i pay for espn so i get stuff there yeah so by the way you've heard this story in the past about how um remember when dane cook or yeah dane cook got popular did you ever hear the story of how he got popular was it from kazaa yeah do you know what he did no genius [ __ ] distribution hack this is one of the greatest growth hacks ever when kazaa and limewire and all those different like you know torrent type of downloading programs were out there when people used to download music and all that i can't believe that stuff existed he um he created files that would say like chris rock stand up or it'd be like you know dave chappelle or eddie murphy best stand-up and it would be four minutes of chris rock and eddie murphy and then the next 56 minutes would just transition to dane cook and that's how he got famous so people were searching for those guys they would download the thing thinking they're getting an hour special of that guy right it would start with that it'd be like now dame cook and he would just start with a joke and like sure enough people would listen and that's how he got like his distribution that's how he got his name out there initially well if you think back to it like of course it didn't seem the way that this way at the time but the internet was so small that i remember like i would wait for wait for something to get released and i like knew off the titles like and how many seeders were on there i knew i could get that one like i knew all about it like you knew about kazaa limewire you knew which ones to download for which stuff and now looking back i totally could have been um i could i totally could have manipulated it yeah like i wouldn't have even thought of that but maybe me today would have thought of that back then but i don't know even when i heard that i thought it was genius it's so genius that i'm like skeptical it's true but uh but i've heard it i bet you that guy made so much money because he made money if you were able to make money when uh cds were 18 that was like the the best time in in uh music and comedy and that because the cds were like 50 or 80 cents or something it was just a little piece of plastic right that basically all went to zero and now it's just only live shows back then you've had live shows plus the cds and stuff plus and then he got into movies he i think he became like the most popular comedian in the world for like two years remember that movie he was in with jessica simpson i love that movie jack shepard checkout or something like that yeah where he like runs like a sam's warehouse i love that i loved i used to love date cooking he's like he's like dave or coldplay you're like embarrassed to talk about it yeah except for me i'm like what this is good music what's the problem um all right that's the episode [Music] you

so just some numbers the video got about 130 million views in seven days which is crazy i think i i believe ben you can fact check me on this i believe 130 million views is more than what the actual squid games got on netflix now netflix is a paid service and whatever but like and people watched uh like multiple episodes yeah 12 hours of footage it's yes it's still amazing the fact that it's comparable the fact that somebody just watched the show was like oh yeah we'll do like a backyard version of that and got 130 million people to watch is insane so uh he spent three and a half million on it just to kind of put this in perspective um that's basically half the cost of a 30 second super bowl commercial wow really did you have a sponsor it was fully paid i believe fully paid for by brawl stars the the big the super popular mobile game so if you look in the arena where was where it was hosted it's a giant brawl stars arena they have a huge logo that was in every shot and so for brawl stars this such a smart move they basically paid half the cost of a super bowl ad got more viewership than a super cause you get 130 million people the video is like 20 minutes long 27 minutes long versus a 30 second clip and this is an epic thing that's going to get shared and then they could take this content repurpose it for ads or anything else they wanted to do after the fact if they wanted to so really smart you know for brawl stars three million dollars is probably their daily uh what is a one day of ad spend on facebook or something stars is owned by supercell and supercell's like the the biggest game um the bishop yeah and so if i i don't know if this is how it would have worked if i'm mr beast i think he could have so he would have gotten supercell to pay for the whole thing so three and a half million dollars i bet he also would have gotten another like five hundred thousand dollar just like there's a vague on top yeah just like just for that and then they would have probably i would have said to them also i'm going to keep youtube ads on this right and mr b i get all of it and so if mr beast is getting 130 million views in the first seven days and if you do maybe four dollars per cpm that's around half a million dollars that he got in the first week plus i believe his deal is gonna be a lot better than four dollars cpm uh because he's the number he's like you know one of the faces of youtube these guys have custom negotiated deals that i would bet a lot of money is better than the standard kind of four to five dollars what do you think it is i bet he's getting closer to 10 cpm so if it's 10 that's 1.3 million yeah and just in a week in a week plus according to our notes it looks like he got 10 000 new subscribers sorry i'm sorry oh my god 10 million new subscribers in the first week and a normal week is 400 000 subscribers so he is 20x to subscriber growth so so what does this do he's continues to be the content leader he gets 10 million new subscribers and those people are gonna get notified for his next video he makes a million dollars on ads he gets the whole thing paid for by a sponsor and this is a great example of something we've talked about before we talked about this with elon when elon does epic stuff like i'm going to go to mars we talked about it with i forgot the guy's name mark lazary or whoever it was that's building that epic train train system uh in america uh i i ranted about disney uh disneyland last week because again when you shoot for these epic projects things that get people inspired and excited it's it seems like it's harder to pull off but in many ways it's easier to pull off because you'll get talent to pour in because they want to be a part of something bold you'll get sponsors to pour in because they want to bet on this this epic thing that's going to happen they know that it's going to get a lot of visibility and so and you get your own motivation to get out of bed every day because you're working on something that's so so grand that you know you're more motivated everybody does their best work and people tune in to watch which is like so ben just looked it up 140 million 142 million people watched squid games on netflix 132 million watched uh beast games on youtube so about the same one to one so you get disproportionate prizes when you go fish in a part of the pond that nobody else is fishing because everyone else thinks the water is too deep and it's too scary over there the rewards are like disproportionate even to the effort and the work that goes in

[Music] uh emergency emergency podcast uh i had to do this saw this video the other day i was scrolling tick tock late into the night as i do i saw this tick tock couldn't believe it i almost got out of bed right then to come record this but we're doing it now okay this is the one of the most ridiculous things i've ever seen this guy is going to be skewered for this that's my prediction this guy is going to he might get fired for this uh but he is definitely gonna get wrecked on all of social media for this um let's just let's listen to this so this is the ceo of a company called better.com they've raised like i don't know 750 million dollars a big company they do i don't know mortgages or some [ __ ] like that on the internet so uh here's the ceo let's just let's just take a listen what's this take a listen hi everyone um thank you for joining um already looks like a funeral i come to you with not great news um the market has changed as you know and uh we have to move with it in order to survive so that hopefully we can continue to thrive and okay the market has moved the market has moved what are you talking about uh you have all your employees on a zoom call right now obviously you have some quote not great news to share lesson number one and by the way how does this guy become a ceo of such a big company and not know rule number one if you're letting someone go or you're laying them off and you go into the meeting you gotta rip the band-aid off in the first minute and the first three things you say one of them has to be we're gonna be letting you go today and then you start to explain everything when you do this you do this long-winded buildup people are a confused and b they get really pissed off and it's just self-serving you're trying to buffer the blow you're trying to prevent the the blow from hitting you you can't even say it you're not you're not even willing to say it so uh ridiculous okay let's so the market has moved and we have to move with it so we can survive what is it is you're shutting down the company what's going on deliver on a mission a mission what mission this is the news that you're going to want to hear uh but ultimately it was my decision and i wanted you to hear from me looks at his notes dude you still haven't said it it's been a really really challenging decision to make um are you okay are you has it been hard for you this is the second time in my career i'm curious and i do not do not want to do this the last time i did it i cried um this time i hope to be stronger but we are late oh my god what are you thinking dude i get what he's thinking he's thinking i want them to know that this is hard for me but dude you don't understand what people are feeling right now they don't first of all they don't know what you're saying you haven't said it secondly you're talking about how hard this is for you and the last time i cried no one gives a flying [ __ ] if you cried or not um because you still haven't said it that's also that's the main problem the second problem is you're talking about yourself and no one cares about you in this moment off about 15 of the company laying off their first races the you can hear a guy the guy who's okay the guy who's recording this by the way this is not the screen this is a guy pointing his camera at the phone and you heard him are you feeling serious efficiency and performances and productivity [Laughter] and peanut butter market market performances efficiency and peanut butter what is this guy doing first of all he said we're laying off 15 of the company he didn't say which 15 yet now everybody is just thinking is it me is it not me they have no idea because he hasn't brought the sledgehammer yet and look this is the scroll bar all right this down here is where he should have said it we're now over here we're almost at intermission of the movie and uh you know he still hasn't said it so i can't believe what he just said why did he say performances by the way he's talking about the market has turned so oh is it my performance or is it the market princess and productivity if you're on this call you are part of the unlucky group [ __ ] you dude i can't even help but laugh [ __ ] you dude that is see that guy is saying what he's supposed to say in this moment because of this [ __ ] up hype trailer teaser strategy that the ceo took if you're on this call you are you're not a game show he thinks he's jeff probst he thinks he's a game show host and he's setting up this cliffhanger that actually is pushing them off the cliff and then they're they're falling down to their death so he he comes in with you are one of the unlucky bunch unlike i thought you said it's performance is it performance or is it unlucky or is it the market or is it peanut butter which one is it we don't know yet your employment here is terminated effective immediately are you [ __ ] kidding me what does this mean for what's next you're going to get an email from hr ask hr better.com to your personal email address at and better.com benefits we're all u.s employees we're providing four weeks of severance also you dressed up like a douchebag on this day you award the douchebag uniform the blue collared shirt with the dark blue vest with the khakis that are a little too tight right around the crotch with the crotch facing the camera that is the douchebag that is the douchebag armor that you wore into this and then you're reading it really slow off your piece of paper and you just have a bunch of people enraged at you right now i think there's like i don't know a thousand people in this call or something like that this is something crazy uh a lot of people 100 maybe hundreds of people on this call insane one month of full benefits and two months of cobra for which we will pay the premium so three months total benefits if we um if you elect for cobra if you don't get a communication from ask hr better.com before the end of the day you can email ask hr better.com if you don't get the email thank you for using everything individual contributions to better i wish the news was different i wish we were thriving enthusiastically as we were at the beginning of this year thriving enthusiastically doesn't make sense uh you wish you were thriving of course you wish you were thriving you didn't lose your job ceo who mismanaged during this time you didn't lose your job they lost their job and you're talking about you were crying last time but you weren't crying this time and you probably didn't even cry last time you probably don't give a [ __ ] to be honest with you maybe you feel bad i actually i take the back he feels bad he feels bad he should feel bad but he handled it bad you can feel bad but you gotta handle it good he felt bad and handled it bad peanut butter that's not the case and i am sure you better finish strong and be more successful where are you going what is this wedding speech and you're drunk we i'm sure you will leave us what is he saying more fortunate and you'll be more [ __ ] here in your next endeavor i wish you all the best of luck thank you for everything you've done for better thank you looks looks aggressively staged right did i do it can we end it can i go to lunch do we have my lunch did someone get my lunch and this guy this guy i gotta look this up better ceo salary this might be public uh let's see let's see let's see i feel like this guy so he laid off 900 people in that call we're not going to pay for this paywall by the way what is the stealing part i didn't hear this okay i don't know i don't know what that's about that wasn't in the video but uh yeah i feel like i read somewhere in a tweet now this might be total [ __ ] uh but i've read somewhere that this guy you know whatever uh something like 10 million dollars of compensation last year but that honestly he's a private company so i don't i don't know what's going on they have a spac of course they have us back of course they went public with us that's back let's see better it's back yeah raised 750 million dollars from their stack backers they already had 1.5 billion from softbank so this guy easily easily this guy is this guy the founder michelle garg is he the founder he um google google said what company laid off 900 employees answer better.com uh i think this guy was the founder yeah founder and ceo so this guy easily this company's valued multiple billions of dollars this guy is clearly worth over 500 million dollars probably go for more than a billion dollars and uh he's talking about lunch and his douchebag outfit all right bad terrible way to do it uh there's

when you go fish in a part of the pond that nobody else is fishing because everyone else thinks the water is too deep and it's too scary over there the rewards are like disproportionate even to the effort in the work that goes on [Music] all right what's up what up dude how are you doing um who did you have as a guest on the last episode when i i was doing my own episode and then you tweeted out you wanted to guess who came on two different people the first was our own ben and so ben and i did an episode where we talked about like uh thing people in history and if there's any commonalities between a bunch of them and then noah kagan my friend noah from appsumo i asked him if he would come on and he said yeah so i just recorded two that day cool did they turn out kid or you know i mean we'll see noah noah was good uh ben and i was good as well i just hope that i don't know if that top the topic is gonna be a winner so we'll see noah is amazing do you know about appsumo uh i know like loosely about appsumo so here's what they tell you what i know you tell me what i don't know so what i know is that appsumo is basically it's a website where you can go to get like kind of software deals i would say um they kind of like they go find cool software they make a deal they say hey we'll get you in front of like whatever 50 million people but you got to offer a deal to our audience like sort of groupon style or woot style and apparently he's doing extremely well he's been doing it for a long ass time 10 plus years i think it does over 100 million in revenue so that's what i know about it almost all right so appsumo started as basically noah he emailed the founder of imager uh and basically said hey you guys charge ten dollars a month if i give you a bunch of new customers at six dollars a month can i get a little cut of the pie right and that's how we started he made 10 grand doing that by emailing a bunch of friends eventually it kind of still is this way but they're gonna they're becoming more of a marketplace and a website but for like the last 10 years it's basically an email list and i think there's only 300 000 people on that email list and they email out a few deals a week where they find uh companies that say hey give us a discount and give us a cut of the revenue right and it was doing okay for years it just some years it didn't do better than the year before sometimes it did a lot better and i think it only did okay for a few years now after close to 10 years he their goal this year was 100 million in revenue they're going to miss it by a little bit but he said they're going to get north of 80 million in revenue now he didn't say it on the podcast if i just if you just google it it appears of that 80 million in revenue they pay out 30 to their partners and they get around 60 or 70 of the of the actual revenue and he owns most of the company has never taken any outside money and they have like 150 employees at this point wow uh i didn't realize some of those things and uh okay so 300 000 people on the list so do you know if they send out an email about some product uh have they ever done it for the hustle by the way did they ever like did you promote the hustle in there somehow or no because it's already a free email i i know i don't well no i don't think we've done it in a traditional way it's maybe true i think we've done trends but we've not done it in a major way so you can um sometimes they'll only send it to part of the list and i think that we've done like a part list but uh some of their partners they'll make over a million dollars in the in one day well i guess my question is how many people take them up on their offer so how many do they need for this this business to kind of work so is it because i think it seems like maybe bigger than it is i wouldn't be surprised if it's like yeah a thousand people click the thing and a thousand people is enough for this business to work when a thousand people take the offer is it a thousand or more like ten thousand uh i would think that it's in the single digit thousands if i had to guess that's how many buy because the products are like 400 a year or something like that so you don't actually need that many people to buy in order to make 500 000 to a million of dollars and you're saying they're sending emails constantly and now they have a website that people are doing stuff now here's where it gets interesting i asked him how much could you sell this business for right now he was like the huge range is 300 million to a billion i think that's what he said right pretty crazy right it's it's it it's like noah good job good job noah and like a lot of things like the hustle included like people are like and i say it as well well it's just an email list it's really simple and yeah that's true it is just an email but there's definitely a machine behind it and appsumo is like inherently quite simple um they just holler at companies they say give us a discount and give us a cut of the pie and then they just email that out to people and it's so simple and it just creates so much value there's a ryan hoover did this a while back he created a list of big companies that started off as quote unquote just email list so he created product time product started off as an email list uh production got acquired by angellist which is like a three billion-ish dollar company or more angelus started as just an email list just a list of angels that he was doing craigslist started off as an email list and so there was a whole bunch of products that started off as just an email list some became more than that some stayed an email list yeah groupon started out groupon is basically was an email list for a long time right and so you know don't underestimate do not underestimate email uh that's not tattooed on sam's back uh do not underestimate email let's talk about a couple things i have a i have another business id i have another business i want to highlight that's a uh one of these like that's so simple are you joking that's the business but first before we do that one we gotta talk about this squid games thing that happened the beast games by mr beast um did you watch it when it happened or have you watched it after the fact i heard basically casey neistat who i follow on twitter was talking about saying mr beast uh what he's doing with the squid games thing is one of the most epic things i've ever seen on youtube and casey neistat is one of the pioneers of youtube and him saying that meant a lot yeah exactly that's you know denzel saying wow the great acting in this movie so all right so um for those who didn't see it all right so squid games was this ultra popular i think it is the most popular show ever on netflix um those watch show and it's this kind of like crazy uh korean death game show type of idea where you know a bunch of people enter this game and they're trying to win the big prize and then they get killed they're losing is like you die basically that's like the short version of it i actually didn't watch squid game so maybe i got something wrong there but i did watch the mr beast version of it so what did mr beast do he basically decided i'm gonna recreate squid games but i'm not obviously people aren't gonna die but he did it even better so he invited 456 people to this arena that was built for this and the prize was the number one the winner of the games was gonna win 456 thousand dollars runner-up 10k and everybody who who went got two thousand dollars each and in total the production plus the prize money so i think he did about a billion and a half dollars of prizes and two million to build and produce it three and a half million dollars is what he spent on this content on this 25 minute video so let's talk about what happened so first uh players showed up they're wearing the same outfits as in squid games it's like kind of green windbreaker jumpsuit type thing and they all have a number so player one player 2 player 3 all the way up to player 456 and inside their shirt they have this like pack and the pack is like exploding paint so if you let's say one of the games is called red light green light the old like game we used to play as a kid where if you say green light you start moving red light means you got to stop if you keep going after they say red light you're out and so they here's a green light then you see a red light and if somebody flinched after that their little pack inside their shirt would explode and red paint would come out as if they got shot like you know like the real squid games and then they would be out and then hey you got to go to the next you didn't make it to the next game and so in the end uh you know player whatever player 27 ended up winning 456 thousand dollars so here's i think this is amazing and this ties into some stuff we've been talking about so just some numbers the video got about 130 million views in seven days which is crazy i think i i believe ben you can fact check me on this i believe 130 million views is more than what the actual squid games got on netflix now netflix is a paid service and whatever but like and people watched uh like multiple episodes yeah 12 hours of footage it's yes it's still amazing the fact that it's comparable the fact that somebody just watched the show was like oh yeah we'll do like a backyard version of that and got 130 million people to watch is insane so uh he spent three and a half million on it just to kind of put this in perspective um that's basically half the cost of a 30 second super bowl commercial wow really did you have a sponsor it was fully paid i believe fully paid for by brawl stars the the big the super popular mobile game so if you look in the arena where it was where it was hosted it's a giant brawl stars arena they have a huge logo that was in every shot and so for brawl stars this such a smart move they basically paid half the cost of a super bowl ad got more viewership than a super blog because you get 130 million people the video is like 20 minutes long 27 minutes long versus a 30 second clip and um this is an epic thing that's going to get shared and then they could take this content repurpose it for ads or anything else they wanted to do after the fact if if they wanted to so really smart you know for brawl stars three million dollars is probably their daily uh what is a one day of ad spend on facebook or something stars is owned by supercell and supercell's like the the biggest game um yeah and so if i i don't know if this is how it would have worked if i'm mr beast i think he could have so he would have gotten supercell to pay for the whole thing so three and a half million dollars i bet he also would have gotten another like five hundred thousand dollars just like there's a vague on top of yeah just like just for that and then they would have probably i would have said to them also i'm gonna keep youtube ads on this right and mr b i get all of it and so if mr beast is getting uh 130 million views in the first seven days and if you do maybe four dollars per cpm that's around half a million dollars that he got in the first week plus i believe his deal is going to be a lot better than 4 cpm uh because he's the number he's like you know one of the faces of youtube these guys have custom negotiated deals that i would bet a lot of money is better than the standard kind of four to five dollars what do you think it is i bet he's getting closer to 10 cpm so if it's 10 that's 1.3 million yeah and just in a week in a week plus according to our notes it looks like he got 10 000 new subscribers sorry i'm sorry oh my god 10 million new subscribers in the first week and a normal week is 400 000 subscribers so he is 20xed his subscriber growth so so what does this do he's continues to be the content leader he gets 10 million new subscribers and those people are gonna get notified for his next video he makes a million dollars on ads he gets the whole thing paid for by a sponsor and this is a great example of something we've talked about before we talked about this with elon when elon does epic stuff like i'm gonna go to mars we talked about it with i forgot the guy's name mark lazary or whoever it was that's building that epic train train system uh in america uh i i ranted about disney uh disneyland last week because again when you shoot for these epic projects things that get people inspired and excited it's it seems like it's harder to pull off but in many ways it's easier to pull off because you'll get talent to pour in because they want to be a part of something bold you'll get sponsors to pour in because they want to bet on this this epic thing that's going to happen they know that it's going to get a lot of visibility and so and you get your own motivation to get out of bed every day because you're working on something that's so so grand that you know you're more motivated everybody does their best work and people tune in to watch which is like so ben just looked it up 140 million 142 million people watched squid games on netflix 132 million watched uh beast games on youtube so about the same one to one so you get disproportionate prizes when you go fish in a part of the pond that nobody else is fishing because everyone else thinks the water is too deep and it's too scary over there the rewards are like disproportionate even to the effort and the work that goes in i had a friend it could have been noah in fact you know noah who we talked about he was the number 20 or something employee at facebook and he got fired nine months into his uh employ working there and so he didn't get any of his equity but i have a friend who spoke to mark zuckerberg and he said to mark you know why don't you just sell the company for a billion or why are you raising all this money like things are growing he's like look it's good i only have 24 hours in a day and i'm only going to work the same amount of time in the day whether it's big or small so i might as well make it as big as i possibly can because that's what interests me and it's just as hard it's equally hard to go big as it is somewhat like mild success and that's a perfect example of what mr beast has done is it's actually of equal work you know same amount of time in the day but when you see someone building someone something so epic it's exciting so many people who don't give a [ __ ] about mr beast of which i am one of them i know about this and i cared about it small ambition and large ambition take the same amount of effort if you want to win if you want them to work and uh and that's exactly right and so i think this was brilliant i think this is another example of mr beast being one step ahead of the curve you're gonna see a lot more people try to clone this so the next thing that comes out you're gonna see four youtubers who are the wannabe mr beast try to jump on it and recreate this and by the way this wasn't the first thing he did like this like obviously he's been doing stunts but he even did like a i'm gonna recreate fortnite they like went to an island it was 100 people playing paintball and it was like a game of fortnight and he made a video on that and i think it did well but it wasn't this it wasn't this level but it's those reps that you you know you put in that give you the a confidence and b shots on goal until you get something to work like this and i also was watching a clip of mr beast yesterday just coincidentally and somebody said are you you know you've talked about you want to be a billionaire you want to be the you know the quote unquote the first billionaire creator although there have been other creators that are worth a billion dollars so you want to be a billionaire and they're like are you there are you there already he goes no no no i'm not there yet and he goes um he goes i'm probably the cash wise i'm probably the poorest person in this room and they're like no no way he goes yeah because whatever i have is like paper it's not like it's not liquid and any cash i get i just reinvest the next and reinvest my videos he goes if we make three million dollars this month i'll put three million dollars into the next video we have razor thin margins um he goes i just reinvest the whole thing into content i think on average he said he he said he was spending something like two or three million dollars a month on his content i would have bet which is wild i would have guessed that he uh made around two and a half three million dollars a month in revenue i would have guessed around 30 million in revenue off his operation and so that makes total sense in fact we talked to a couple people i believe he has mr peace has around 30 to 40 full-time people working for him and i actually recently read about like what i was like what is it like to work with him and a lot of people complained they said um they said working with him is horrible he's horrible to work with and i was like well you know what's going on why and they go he's a perfectionist i was like oh okay so it's actually not that bad they would say why isn't this good enough why is this so bad and he would analyze every single frame and frankly that made me even love him but there's something interesting about this which is i actually think being him is exhausting because you have to go up every single time and so let me give you an example of two youtubers that are incredibly interesting to me graham stefan and meet kevin do you know who those guys are i know graham stefan i don't know me kevin all right meet kevin i think is even more famous and he has 2.5 or 3 million subscribers he recently did a video and it was called here's my entire 50 million dollar portfolio at age 29. so i and i noticed that he had done one of these i'm clicking okay okay double click full screen headphones on and i noticed that he did another one of these like nine months ago or 13 months ago something like around a year ago and his net worth then was only 25 and i was like what is going on this guy is nuts and so he's basically this guy meet kevin i don't know his full name he um makes like three to four videos a day and he is talking about like which stocks he's buying uh which um types of houses he's buying for investment properties and he shows his entire portfolio and at the end he goes now here's proof and he logs in to all of his accounts and you can see all of that screen share yes which is amazing for many reasons one he's only 29 and he's a youtuber with 50 million dollars how is he how did he get that money so he's just off of his youtube or he has some other business that he started with at age 19 i believe he started as just a real estate agent so just a normal guy okay and he made a little bit of money like a hundred grand a year took that hundred grand a year and bought some properties and then started a youtube channel in 2010 or 2011 and he just started documenting about his real estate investing slowly that started making additional income using that income he bought even more properties eventually he had like a course and things like that where he was making like one or two million dollars a year so a significant amount of sum or a significant sum then he took that money and he started investing it and started talking about what he was investing and you could see this entire growth over the last five years of his portfolio and how it's grown of course it helps that a he's got now a significant stream of like 4 million a year i would imagine and we're having the best bull market of all time and so it kind of works but that's how he's done it and interestingly this guy kevin uh when gavin newsom was being recalled kevin ran for office and there's this republican name larry elder who got second behind gavin newsom kevin was third with something like hundreds of thousands of votes and so it's this kid's amazing and so that's surprising i feel like a youtuber who's got a big following should crush any politician he doesn't have that big of following he only has 2.5 or 3 million it's not significant and it has to be a california above 18 voter so it's not like it's not significant but my point being with a lot of these youtubers is this video was nutty and graham stefan did the exact same thing he goes here's my prediction mr beast or a mr beast type person will run for president and will surprise people with the type of following they get because oh absolutely whether you want to be president or not you could you know i think the original trump playbook was i'm gonna just throw my hat in the ring i'm gonna get tons of attention and press i'm gonna build my brand off the the massive amount of attention that goes into elections and i'll be the the kind of curveball story that everybody wants to cover everybody's got an opinion on like kanye kanye did it or whatever he threw his name in you're gonna see the wild wild west of people trying to put their name in the hat for running for office or running for these kind of like positions that will sound you know how could a how could a 21 year old youtuber be doing this and they're going to get a little momentum and then that's going to create a press cycle that's going to create more momentum i don't think they'll actually win i don't think they even want to win but it would just be a smart move for the dog dog-eat-dog world of youtube trying to get views yeah and but here's back to the original point of getting views what is exhausting life that you have to go and and i'm thankful that mr beast does what he does i'm thankful that this kevin guy and graham are crazy enough to log in and show me their that is so cool they are [ __ ] the success that is nuts i had this exact thought the other day we um i forgot who i was talking to but i talked to somebody and it was like oh yeah that's a great youtube i've had like five ideas about like oh yeah if we did that as a youtube video it would get clicks right like one was um i was gonna show how you can make ten thousand dollars being a santa like a santa claus for christmas and i was like oh this is easy i'll buy the suit i'll show the economics of that i'll go do the thing that'll make for a funny thumbnail and it'll make for this little story that's semi-viral another one is going and buying buying fancy [ __ ] and like actually like justin khan did a video where he toured a 50 million dollar home it was amazing and it's a you know just it's interesting content right it's like a super it's junk food that people in our niche we just like to consume that stuff like oh yeah what is it like you know um how do you do it how much money do you make how do you invest it and there's all these videos that you can make around this and every time i think of one i think that would work i think to myself i do not want to get on that treadmill i just don't want to get on the treadmill because i know it's like uh the difference between sort of like uh knowledge and wisdom it's like i know this would work but i'm also wise enough to know that that is not a path i want to double down on i do not want to double down on the treadmill path because i don't feel that way about this podcast for example this podcast feels ongoing it's a it's a breeze dude we show up i just shoot the [ __ ] with my friend for an hour um people seem to like it it's so like it's two hours of my week that i like i'm on the i'm on camera i'm on on i'm being recorded and i don't have to like and also because it's a podcast i'm not like worried about how i look and the angle and the this and that like maybe i should a little more but i just don't like the way that you do when you're recording youtube videos and you have to edit everything and clip it and like do all these cuts podcasting is podcasting has that risk reward ratio or that like effort reward ratio that works for me and this like youtube treadmill i think has a much bigger prize but i don't want to win that way there's other ways to win and that treadmill is exhausting it's exhausting and there's exhausting there's a reason why you don't see casey neistat anymore i've watched a couple of recent interviews with him and he said now i don't do anything he goes for those three years that are recording daily vlogs everything in my life everything in my day if someone invited me to dinner i had to message them and say i can't unless someone interesting is coming or you want to go somewhere intriguing because it has to be content and i lost a lot of friends me my wife almost divorced and it was exhausting and now he's 37 years old he's financially successful and he goes i'm not doing it anymore i have to take a break and so i think it's cool to dabble with it but i am wary of the treadmill now you did a video so kind of on the other side of the coin you've been putting out your fitness content which i think is probably just fun for you and motivating it's fun and then you did a video that i loved which was you put a video up on i think your own just your personal youtube channel of this real estate project you're doing so i wanted to ask you about this here's what for those who didn't watch it here's here's the the summary of the video uh you bought a piece of land right next to your house i think like adjacent to or like literally your neighbor you brought the neighbor lot next to your house and it's got this like really run-down shack on it like it's a large piece of grass with a really shitty shack that somebody was living in and it's 20 years it looks brutal like this is like you know i wouldn't wish this on an enemy uh these conditions so it would look like just like from this run-down shack and you're like cool like here's the thing i bought and you you broke down the economics you're like you know i brought this so how much did you buy for exactly 650 000 650 000 she bought the whole thing and you bought it leveraged or you bought it all cash cash okay you bought it all cash why didn't you borrow because i wanted to purchase before they put it on market so basically the background buy now it was a 90 year old couple that who owned it and they rented it to a guy and i the day i moved into this house i used a little bit of research and i found who they were and i said hey you know just so you know my name's sam i'm i live now next year property if anything ever happens you want to sell this please contact me and so the man died on a monday the wife called me on a wednesday and said would you like to buy it and i bought it on a thursday amazing okay i love that and you're like this is going to be my first kind of like you don't know [ __ ] about real estate you don't [ __ ] about building any like a home um and so you're like this is gonna be fun it's gonna be a hands-on project i'm gonna kind of document it as i go and then you had this spreadsheet which basically said all right look i bought it for 650k and um and then you know in this in this area there's a sort of like a price per square foot that you can get and here's the range and then i talked you got bids from some contractors and you were like you know i can uh you know on the low end it seems like you could build it for this much and then if i'm conservative and it might be more expensive than we think it might cost this much so i might have to put a million dollars in to build the actual structure in the home modern ground up and uh so you know i might be in for 1.6 million but based on the the price per square foot in this area i should be able to sell this for two it should be worth two or two point five like when i'm done with this thing i'd like the margin of safety was really strong it seemed like just like a an absolute no-brainer of a deal assuming this is how you want to spend your time right like the time is almost more expensive or the risk here more so than the buy is great you made your money on the buy as they say in real estate rather than trying to make your money on the sale yes but it's not taking nearly as much time and i'll tell you why so what i did was before i even bought the piece of property i found things in the area that sold for my ideal price per square foot right i went on zillow and redfin i found the architect and then i called them and then i also called the builder and i go hey guys how much would it cost to build this exact same home right now right and they told me and i go great um and how do you do that yeah and i bought this flop a lot and i call them again i go hey um you know that house that just sold for a thousand dollars a square foot do that again over here for me please you're not trying to innovate and add the sandpark touches of like uh a you know a 3 000 square foot gym and like a thousand square foot house like you're doing a normal house build out it's a normal house build-out but i said make it a two-car garage because i may if i decide to live there i'll build the gym there and that's basically it yeah okay i just said i took i took a house that was crushing it that i just sold for a lot of money and i said and i hired the same people and i said do it again by the way so i'm not i'm not spending any time on it i spend no time on it just the fact that it's next door also is surprisingly gonna be like a 50 savings in the time and headache that's involved with this because uh like my family did this we've we uh we had a house in san francisco and then we bought a house two doors down and just the fact that it was two doors down had like all these extra benefits which was like it was super easy to go see it was super easy to like manage any construction that was going on it's they like share a fridge in the like garage it's like oh yeah just use the extra fridge across the street uh my sister runs a business out of one of them and she's able to manage it from like without having to get in her car and commute somewhere and just just it being like within eyesight and and like a two-minute walk away is so important and like if anyone's gonna do a project like this do not underestimate that i've now seen it a couple times and i feel this way this is my rule with friends and family also which is you want to live so close to your best friends or family that you could go unplanned to their house like you don't need to pack a bag and think about okay well then how like what you know when should we go should we beat the traffic and then yeah we're gonna have to head back for the night it's like i should be able to pop over and pop back unplanned because it's so convenient and like the difference between 15 minutes away and four minutes away is gonna fundamentally change the way like the amount of times you you see that person or do that thing so why did you bring up that youtube video by the way because i thought it was awesome oh thanks and i just wanted to hear more about the like and the like the actual real estate side of the side i think that the the the numbers are the way they're going to work out and not a lot of people believe me but i think it's gonna happen this way i'm gonna make half a million dollars in profit or more from it i think there's a world where i make closer to a million than half a million there's i'm gonna sell it or rent it out there's a i have a few options i can live in it and sell my home yep but the way that all this math is gonna work it's gonna be what both this house and that house i'll have made around a million dollars in profit in like 18 months right um because things just worked out and so i'll make more from this real estate project than i will my entire hustle salary combined ever and it only in this project for example but you're gonna have to invest right that's the that's the kicker here so like you you couldn't have done this back then because you didn't have a spare 1.6 million dollars to go like invest in buying the lot plus building the home out or if i did do it it was like all of my money right exactly so you know you would have to go like completely all in on it can i tell you what else we got can i tell you about let me tell you about a company that interests me okay so i was talking to someone recently and i can't say who it is but they had a google chrome extension that made something like 25 million dollars in revenue with only two guys two people it's amazing so i got curious extension did or no no i yeah um roughly uh helping people on amazon sell stuff okay cool so like kind of like a what's that thing called jungle scout something in that world yeah um and so basically uh i started i i got kind of curious so there's two extensions that caught my caught my attention the first and they're basically the same thing with almost exactly the same name the first is this thing called ad block i think that's the one i use the second one is called ad bot ad block plus so that's why it's a little confusing and so adblock was created by one guy in georgia named michael gundlach and he uh he just kind of built this thing in 2009 and he's been the only employee the whole time and i went to his personal website to learn about him and he only has 55 followers on uh twitter his website is called sorryrobot.com that's his personal website and he has like python projects a unity game that he built called asteroids and even has an mp3 of him singing a christmas song at church during christmas time this is like by the way his linkedin his job description is just a guy uh he is in duluth georgia and it says i am not available for work please do not contact me about job opportunities i created adblock the most popular chrome extension for google chrome extension and for safari with around 20 million users it's neat before that i did some other neat things and he was the only employee and then i did some research on his competitor called adblock plus now this company they have a few few more employees i think they've got 20 or 30 people and because they're based in europe when you're a european company oftentimes at least in england and i know it's a lot of the k uh a lot of cases in different european countries if you make over 20 million dollars in revenue you basically have to file a report that reveals your revenue and profit and so i went and looked at this company called io it's called io they own ad blocker plus in 2017 they did 44 million dollars in revenue and 26 million dollars in profit which is astounding and they had at least 100 million users however if you look in the group the the chrome plug-in store uh adblock plus has around 150 000 reviews and it says they've got over 10 million users if you look at ad block which is the one founded by this one guy they've got something like 300 000 reviews and uh also it says 10 million users and so there's potential that this one guy had a business making all of this money tens of millions of dollars a year very likely tens of millions of dollars a year in profit just off a chrome extension is that amazing this is amazing i'm i'm still on this guy michael gunlock's uh website sorry robot.com resume um pdf and i i think you said this but i was reading while you were talking so he was an engineer at google working on google ads and google adsense did you already say that part no and he worked on google and basically he goes nah [ __ ] that i hate these ads so his job was he goes at google i kept the global at google ads and adsense networks alive and kicking um in my spare time i built this other thing and i built this other thing uh you know like because google has that 20 times like i built this javascript framework blah blah so basically he goes from working at google and google adwords and ad sets to creating adblock and makes 20 billion makes more than that uh off 20 million users who who love this thing and what year did you work at google i believe like oh five 2005 yeah so which is like right after the ipo basically yeah so he probably made 30 million dollars at google like collectively it's pr that's what it's worth now if you held it so it made tens of millions of dollars off of that and then reportedly now the thing about this guy is everything's very quiet about this guy he's hard to find everything's impossible however i think in 2015 an anonymous buyer bought adblock interesting there's a world where it could have been sold for like two or three hundred million dollars i mean there's a world where that exists uh maybe it was lower but it was it's a it's a huge problem like he stopped he he stopped working on ad block or you know it sold probably 2015 which is kind of scary because these chrome extensions are a giant security hole for people because chrome extensions can like read and write all the data on your as you browse the web so that's all every email you're writing the text is can be picked up by these chrome extensions and even if they start off safe because you know just a guy from duluth georgia built it and he's an engineer who has the right intentions somebody who buys it with the wrong intentions can really like do some dirty stuff yeah you know with the data and even modifying it and things like that so you got to be careful with chrome extensions i try to install the minimum amount of chrome extensions as possible yeah they are pretty scary and um yeah they're nuts and the but it's a wild business i think that what here's here so i love these extension style businesses there's a few platforms that i think are quite interesting the first google chrome still makes a ton of sense the second um shopify still makes a ton of sense our friend andrew has a business where all he does is buy buys uh shopify plugins and it's market cap it's a publicly traded company it's like in the 600 million dollar range it's on the canadian stock exchange but the third thing which you probably have not thought of and the fourth thing you definitely haven't thought of salesforce plug-ins and then finally zoho plug-ins incredibly interesting so we used to hire this engineer uh at the hustle and he would he was in another country and we would pay him 20 bucks an hour to just build little apps for us for our sales team and uh i think zoho i would imagine is which is like a salesforce competitor but a little jankier has an equal amount of users as salesforce i think you could build a really great business just doing salesforce plug-ins right yeah and we're rolling them up um so i i don't know if i'm allowed to talk about this but i'll say it in a vague way uh met a guy i heard about a guy that was rolling up games inside of a big gaming platform so there's like a very popular game and there's games within that or little like modules people create and they monetize and this person was rolling them up and they're like dude does that mean like these are created by like i don't play games like you know okay so for example there are big gaming platforms like fortnight and minecraft and roblox and like all these different games that exist and inside the game you can create little experiences and you can monetize them um kind of like people who create like different colored guns for call of duty yeah although i don't know if i don't know if you could do people create those i thought the game created those but like yeah there's there used to be mods and you know mods of different games and maps and things like that that you can create that's always been kind of like a part of it but some of these games now are so big and they actually like formalize their little creator economy inside the game and the person i knew was rolling them up and they're like these are selling for nothing because they're like it's just like a kid who made this it sells for like less than you know like 1x revenue or something like that like it's like crazy like compared to going and buying that same cash flowing asset on whether it's fba or shopify or something else now everything has a different profile of like maybe this game is a fad maybe people will stop using this maybe you know the game will change the rules and you're screwed all of a sudden so yeah there's some risk but uh i love these game plans of go to these niche platforms we've talked about etsy we've talked about poshmark um fba we've now talked about zoho and salesforce and slack and like all these different platforms there are little apps that just make fifty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars a month and you can go and you can buy these out and you can roll them up and you can have a company that does 10 to 20 million dollars of revenue profitably and you could buy your way there uh without even having to invent anything all you got to do is go get cheap cheap debt buy this thing and profit um and it's really like that simple but there's one major thing which is if call of duty or fortnight or whatever it is they go hey we're gonna go in a different direction yeah exactly and that's why you got like that's the same thing with fba right and all these like thoracio and all these roll-ups fba is not i mean it's you're dependent on a single platform which is amazon that's known to compete very hostilely and there's other other they could change the algorithm and all of a sudden your thing that was at the top is now at the bottom um there is definitely risk and so you got to look at like okay if my payback period is nine months i feel pretty good about it if it's three years i don't feel so good about it anymore and so that's where you got to like you know place your bets can i tell you about a really random small one like that okay so our buddy uh ramon tweeted this out he goes here's an example of a silly stupid business so ramon is ramon vanmir on twitter and so he goes simple website moneymaker this emoji website gets five million visitors a month and all it does and i use this by the way all the time because if you're on your computer and you want to use an emoji it's not easy to get the keyboard up for the emoji thing so you just you you just google like laughing emoji and then it gives it to you and it says click to copy your to your clipboard and then you go and you like copy it you paste it on twitter or paste it wherever you're writing your email or whatever and so um all it does is it lets you look up you look up emoji copy paste them and it'll also explain what the emoji means um so there's like emojipedia is a good example of this so emojipedia emojipedia yeah i don't know if you've ever seen this it's like the top-ranking um one that comes through uh when you search for this stuff uh it's like wikipedia but for emoji and so ramon was looking at you know like depending on and it's just plastered with ads there's like ads everywhere on the site and it's like depending on what the ad revenue is like this site could be making between 50 and 150 000 a month of all profit like do not underestimate these small simple sites and we've talked about this with crosswords uh sudoku games things like that just like these really simple things that people like to search for and if you could own the domain you could just have the really simple like online game or like scrabble scrabble word solver um you know crossword hint get hint cheats you know whatever um those little websites can be really good so this emoji one i thought is another example of that and even better i was like oh who owns this thing i was looking for the michael gundlach some random engineer who's like oh yeah i got a huge company that owns so some company bought it they own it and it's called zedge and i was like okay what the heck is zedge z-e-d-g-e and this is one of those companies that you're like really this so zedge is a public company its market cap is around 130 million dollars so it's a very small small cap public company on the new york stock exchange and what they do is they it's a publisher or roll up they bought a bunch of these little apps and websites that just get a bunch of traffic because people want self-expression so they bought wallpapers ringtones stickers alarm clock sounds emoji emoji pdf like things like that they bought all these brought them all into one roof and then they're a public company so you can go see a bunch of their numbers so they'll do like you know it's almost like 50 percent um they'll do like 50 profit on their on their uh on their product like at least operating profit um and then you know like the ebitda will be closer to like you know two million or whatever on their uh under each quarter why the hell would a company like that go public don't go public uh yeah i think there's a bunch of reasons why they might go public um but i just thought it was interesting so they have about 350 million people have downloaded like their wallpaper app they have they say they have 40 million monthly active users um and these companies that are just hidden in plain sight so it's like um you know let me just look at their annual revenue again i don't know if i have annual or quarterly i think that they do about 20 million dollars a year in revenue and 10 million 10 million about operating profit and um yeah so they did 2017 they did um let's see pull this up okay sales and revenue is a little lower than what i saw here but i'm doing this quick so basically for the last five years it's just been flat like 10 million dollars of revenue two million dollars of cogs you know their gross income is between seven and eight million and then then they pay for a huge amount of you know like um other sales and you know ssg a uh expenses um and so you know they're they're not showing a bunch of profit at the end but i would bet that these things are like spitting off profit if you want uh you know they're putting money in their own pockets basically out of this so i thought that was just like a really crazy little company behind behind the stuff and it just shows you how much money is in really simple things that a lot of simple things that a lot of people use so like alarm clock sounds wallpapers that sort of thing what um what's live reviews uh this is an idea so so i just got a sauna and i know you're in the market for a song oh what time did you get so i got a sanctuary a clear light sanctuary uh like the infrared sauna and i like a lot of it like i like the size the look the shape all that but it doesn't make me sweat enough and so i'm like well that's the problem with infrared that's the problem with infrared that's the point of the sauna so i'm like well that's a bust um and i'm like so i'm like first i realized okay i didn't have one of the panels plugged in so that's why it was like you know part of it was like dead okay that was one issue it got better and then it's like well the best way you use it is you break a little sweat before you go in so you just do like a quick five minute ten minute cardio just because what infrared's doing is it's not warming up the air it's warming up your body yeah just like microwaving you it's microwaving you which seems like pretty awful for you but i guess it's not so bad i guess it's good for you actually um you know blah blah blah heat shock proteins blah blah blah so um so i you know i broke a sweat before i got in and it was better but i was like dude i'm not trying to do all this i'm trying to go sit the sun on sweat in five minutes so i think for my house my space like i didn't want to do extra electrical i didn't want to like do i didn't want to i didn't have a huge space where i putting i put it in my garage gym so like the dry sauna in retrospect i would now hold that for a dry sauna but uh it didn't really fit my current situation so you know whatever it is what it is so i was thinking like god i i actually did the research i i talked to people i read reviews but you know the thing that i feel like is missing is i wish there was just so like people have tried this qvc thing where it's like oh i'm gonna go live and i'm gonna sell this item and people have tried to make qvc for mobile and it's never really worked and i don't know if this would work either but i kind of wish this existed just based on this current experience and told me maybe there is a maybe there is a product here which is why can't why can't i go on and just say i'd like to talk to somebody about saunas and why isn't there a person live on video who is a third party impartial source that can basically show me live on video talk to me about what i'm looking for dude this is exactly what mark laurie said so mark laurie the guy who started jet.com he sold it for three or two or some billions of dollars to walmart he said one thing that they were working on at jet that could have been a massive business but they shut it down for a bunch of different reasons but he goes i actually think it still could be big was concierge shopping so you simply log on and you just tell us you know i'm looking for a toaster and a clerk is online saying okay for your needs i think this is best would you like this one and he said that that would be a big business yeah and so like even with this actually if you go to the website to buy this thing you can't just buy the sauna there's no buy button you had to call someone but this is their sales rep right so i called the sales rep it's 8 p.m she picks up she's an american person i was like whoa what the heck like i was like you worked this hour like who are you like you were really good at what your job like you know you built a lot of trust quickly and you got me over the line to buy the six thousand dollar sauna um on the phone here and and she was like yeah like where there's a network the way we work is we only sell the sonic company yeah so it's owned by jacuzzi the the the you know the jacuzzi company so she's like yeah it's basically we have a network of sales reps we all pick up the phone uh you could if you're offline you're offline you you didn't get that commission she's like i get a commission if you buy um and that's how we make our money and she's like yeah like i make good money like i'll sell i was like how many of these you selling today she's like on a good day i could sell like four of these in a day and on a bad day i'll sell like one or zero dude listen the reason why you and i are pretty good at what we do which in this case i'm referring to just coming up with ideas like people say [ __ ] to us all the time it's and i get i'm kind of like jerking ourselves off here sorry but because of that question that you just asked and i do that all the time and people are amazed that you could do that like when you're just going to a food truck you'd be like hey how many customers you get a day and they just tell you and so what you just did is a perfect example you got intel that is hard to find but it was very easy to get right and i asked multiple i asked and you could triangulate that's the the secret yeah you don't ask a very rude question how much money do you make or how much does this company make i said what's a good day you know how many do you how many of these do you sell on a good day so yeah already i softened the blow by saying good day and i'm asking just for a day that doesn't seem like top secret information okay cool then i say and then i was like i was like and you're great at this like i i was like i really like this like this was like kind of an awesome experience for me on the phone i was like are you one of like the better sales reps like do you like are you like a top performer or you like uh like are you kind of like middle of the pack she's like no i'm like actually one of the top performers blah blah blah and she's like you know i picked up the phone at 8 pm a lot of people just don't pick up the phone like i'm i work like i work hard and i was like oh interesting okay cool and then i was like i was like how many reps are there i'm just like and again i'm not like digging i'm not like saying like and um okay my next question is how many reps are there i'm like i'm just sounding amazed because i was amazed what you say to that reply is wow are you guys all in america yeah yeah we're all in america wow which i mean were there like ten thousand of you of course you know it's gonna be close oh no it's way smaller hundreds oh like a hundred ah more like 800 right right exactly exactly and so i was able to like suss out how this system works i was like i was like well i was like that's great so i was like i was like so this is awesome so i bought this thing and you're gonna make like what 400 or 500 bucks off this yes and she's like so now i know the commission structure is like you know i was able to kind of like and i'm just doing it because i'm curious i have no agenda i'm not starting a sauna company i don't care but i'm just trying to learn and then like you know i took a piece of that to our own i had a meeting with our own team for e-commerce i was like hey you know i had this kind of great experience you know should we be having a phone number on the site and like should we be helping people like that like how would that work we're a way lower price point like would this still work and um and then i met this guy uh ezra ezra uh firestone is his name yeah he's amazing he's super well known in the e-commerce space and he's got this famous brand called boom by cindy joseph or something like that is that makeup right it's like kind of like makeup and like anti-staging face cream stuff like that for like women who are like 50 to 70 or something that's what it looks like to me at least and this brand does great i think he's pretty open about it like he publishes stuff like i think they do like 80 or 100 million dollars a year of revenue and he told me that uh he told me on a we i did a talk at ecom world he was interviewing me and of course when was that uh like i don't know a couple weeks ago oh that's pretty sick he's that's a pretty legit thing yeah so he goes he was like you know so how do you do your sales like i don't know what do you mean like this is shopify you push the buy button he's like okay so you don't do any live chat yeah we have chat but like whatever customer service he goes okay interesting he goes for us we do phone you guys you don't need a phone i go no we don't go do you does anybody do phone does that [ __ ] work same thing same type of question that will get somebody to like defend the thing they do that [ __ ] work that's what you said i was like there's no way does that [ __ ] work and he was like dude 30 of our sales close over the phone and i was like bing data point interesting should i be doing that that's like a learning the next thing that you ask is yeah but there's no way that's profitable and they'll say yeah of course it's profitable we only pay them eighteen exactly eight dollars an hour am i a bad entrepreneur no i'll tell you that i'll tell you how it all breaks down so yeah that's exactly the how much do they pay people questions how do they pay people how much do they pay people an hour uh i don't know i didn't ask in this case because we were live on the panel but you know it had this been this normal conversation i would have would have been uh breaking it down that's badass um all right you want to do one more wait what's this fluffy stuff about luck of timing let's do this do a non-fluffy one because i feel like i've been doing a lot of fluffy stuff lately i feel like we've kind of been on a kick of like sort of fluffy stuff because if you let me i'm gonna talk about mindset all day and the second thing is we did a lot of like gossip about like you know like billionaires and their like affairs and [ __ ] like that so i'm like okay just noted i'm gonna like to turn that down a little bit so i want to do one more cool idea because i think you know people love that [ __ ] okay so rebase um have you seen this before before i put it on this sheet no i'm looking it up now all right so you know the guy who's behind this that guy levels um levels dot io who is oh i love that guy kind of like his name's peter levels i think is his name uh his handle is levels.i o so he's amazing prolific guy he was ahead of the curve on like remote work so i remember maybe six years ago he was he created you know nomad list he created a remote like a remote like uh remote working slack was like oh if you're a remote worker pay 10 bucks and get into slack and hit like 6 000 members i was like whoa you made a lot of money off this little like just a slack invite i've never seen that and he reveals all of his revenue so i don't what's his so it's levels.io that's his that's one of his sites he's got like four sites i think and if you go to levels and then scroll all okay so he has his is his twitter name is levels io i yeah it's probably pronounced actually differently and you can see a link to all of his websites and looks like he's got close to 10 there and if you click them and then see the little meter in his location oh well that's amazing for one amazing that's a feeling oh my god that's beautiful so good so on twitter where you put your location and most people just write like san francisco or new york instead he just he used the emoji for to create like 10 squares and it's like a meter and it go and at the end of the meter it says five million dollars a year and then he shows the meter is like like 60 of the way there um which shows that he's kind of like you know he's probably at two and a half uh to three million dollars a year is what he's making it's just a subtle it's a subtle thing very nicely done very interesting very cool i like it and if you go to any of his sites so it looks like he's got eight or something sites listed and you click around you're gonna see a phrase on all of his sites called open startup and i just sent you a link do you see the link i sent you and you could see all of his metrics so you can see how much revenue they have how much like he's got weird metrics how much co2 removed from the atmosphere github commits daily revenue daily signups meetups organized new paid membership uh live streaming events um last month sign ups how many customers are in total how many page views where the pages are coming from you can see everything the uh the uptime of the websites this guy's amazing and if you know just nomad list is doing 531 000 a year it's halfway to the goal of a million dollars a year from this business and this guy we just explained how he's kind of got this like unique little easter egg on his twitter he's got like little things like that throughout all of his websites and so this guy is in my mind he this man's an artist he's this guy's like he's an artist who just so happens to uh his art just so happens to make money this guy's i love this guy i don't know his name peter peter i think he said peter levels that's his full name i didn't know that i always just thought his company was called levels so if you look at like one of his um things i was going to show you so okay so his latest thing this thing called rebase and he tries to like sniff out a trend and then quickly spin up the semi-viral slightly profitable like a semi-viral simple profitable version of a website so uh what is rebase rebase is people are trying to relocate with the pandemic and with tax changes and with cryptocurrency and all this good stuff people are more like kind of uh you know like fluid than ever there are people are gender fluid and they're location fluid there's a fluidity going on so he basically said uh portugal came out and portugal said we wanna they i think in 2021 they had the largest population uh decrease in the last 50 years and so they decided all right our population's shrinking we need foreigners to come live here and spend here and work here so they said the portuguese government said we want to attract high-tech remote workers and they gave out they create a program called the nhr program and so the nhr program basically has a bunch of benefits now i don't know if they're all as good as advertised meaning like i didn't go read the fine print but here's some of the things it says zero percent tax on foreign income so they're not going to tax you for income that comes outside of the state um zero percent tax on crypto it's considered a currency unlike in the u.s where it's considered a property uh zero percent tax on dividends zero percent tax on wealth 10 tax on pension 20 tax on freelancing so that's like you know where what a lot of people would do there there's no minimum stay you can get fast track for eu passport um you know they have a whole bunch of like you know sort of things that are uh benefits for coming here you know we're we have a 90 vaccination rate we have friendly people blah blah so that's so he created a website that just has the sales benefit the benefits of if you wanted to relocate or get a passport in portugal and then what levels did was you basically created uh okay here's the on-ramp to portugal so it's like for 150 bucks you'll do an on-boarding call and we'll walk you through it and it'll be a tax expert and a lawyer that will analyze your situation for 650 we'll get you set up with portuguese residency and you'll get a portuguese tax id for 150 150 bucks a year we'll do your taxes and it's like start now here's the button and i was like this is such a smart simple um you know simple idea and already it's like booked out so you know he his max was that he could do that the lawyer could do 50 50 calls per month and immediately it was at 300 calls per month and so he's like trying to hire another lawyer so he can scale it up a little bit more if you had to ask like someone asked me the other day like who i admire and i would ask it a little bit differently which is who am i jealous of this guy peter i'm looking at his websites i am jealous of i'm jealous of so many things about him the first is creativity it just oozes and second he can do it like every like everything that i see on his website i'm like oh my god this is perfect this is the perfect example of how a product should be made uh he's this guy is incredibly prolific and incredibly he's like a music producer to me like he's a producer of websites he's just making these little hit songs uh and they're not like he's not trying to be justin bieber like the one mega hit franchise uh that goes on tour he's just a producer that makes dope beats and instead of beats he just makes dope websites and it's like pay for a dope lifestyle yeah i mean subscription revenue he's got like look at inflationchart.com that's one of his yeah this website tracks real inflation which is happening the governments don't tell you about in their official numbers okay super easy i understand that's just a really cute neat widget again even on um on what's it called the website i was just talking about on rebase the very first benefit it goes mcdonald's has the royale deluxe mcdonald's in portugal has the royal deluxe and the big tasty double that was the first benefit right because he could have just gone into like tax benefit tax benefit but he let me get you let me break you know let me let me break the ice here a little fun little easter egg a little fun little nugget that just shows you who this site's built by it's built by somebody who's got a personality it's built by an indie software maker not some stiff company or bureaucracy and i think these little touches matter that's why he's an artist this guy's amazing i love this guy good good good fine um i've known about him for a little while i i always thought he was really talented i didn't realize that he was like the kanye of like internet website builders uh yeah he's great um okay so i wouldn't even say he's like you know rick rubin or something like that he's got he's got his own stick um anything else we want to do otherwise we could wrap it no no we could wrap it we could save that other i i want to hear about some of these things that you have on here but we can save them okay sounds good we're out [Music] you

no it just started as a side hustle like i was in a basement in san francisco that was like yo i i have a theory about what i think will be big and i want to make 3 000 bucks a month never was it like i want to make millions of dollars or i want to have a bunch of people or i want to have a bunch of customers [Music] how are you sam how are you today i'm good what are you doing well i just got back from albuquerque i was hanging out with my family and then uh i just got home and there's like back-to-back meetings before we go to the trail of lights tonight in austin i know i neville and neil i've heard all about you guys are going to have some exciting times tonight did um do you wait you weren't working today like a normal schedule uh i actually work really best in airplanes so i got up worked in the airplane landed and just been kind of back-to-back meetings now until 6 30. do you enjoy having a normal schedule now it um i had some trauma you know by the way like silicon valley tech worker trauma is like my boss didn't give me a 20 raise it was a 10 raise and i am traumatized like when i worked at intel all i did was meetings and it was like and i was like this is the worst thing ever and now i'm i'm in all i do is meetings [Music] but then you know i will i will say though today i was in some meetings and i was interacting and i was like man i love you people there's some meetings where they suck and you have to figure out how to get rid of them or change the meeting and there's somewhere it's like wow we're business forward like there's things that are happening that are making [ __ ] happen in the business so noah you noah kagan's here founder of this company called appsumo which we'll talk about in a second but you basically like you you kind of i don't know do you say you stepped away you weren't like actively running the company day to day for like a couple years now you're the ceo again i so i was active for a long time now i'm not active it's amazing it's the best i don't know like i don't think i have it in me at least not right now to go back and do that do you think that you have it in you uh it's hard it's it's i mean i was not working i mean it sounds such like an ass stuff but like i wasn't really working i was doing podcasts which isn't really working and um i was making a lot of money and now i'm working i actually think i'll make the least i've made this year wait what what does that mean you're making a lot of money from what well eamonn so we hired this guy to run appsumo.com he was running it and i was like oh well let me make youtube videos and i'll do podcasts and i'll like build send fox and experimental stuff and then i would get paid and then eamon wanted to step out and uh to be an advisor and i stepped in and now i'm having to do all his work i will say and then yeah i think i'll make less money this year two things with that one sometimes when you criticize another because i criticize damon a lot um but just like productive just like you could be better you could be better yeah like jewish why are you doing this yeah yeah jewish mother like noah why not your your cousin so you could have been like your brother he's a doctor and uh um one under being in his shoes definitely makes me uh respect him so much more but just a lot just a lot like he is a very impressive guy also get a deal with me but i'd say the second thing is that um the work now is harder it's hard but it's much more rewarding and so i was even writing that down in my diary this morning i said dear diary hard work is rewarding noah you have the weirdest so like you talk about having a diary you always talk about going to therapy which is no big deal these these all these things are great but you act like a tough guy sometimes and then you talk about like uh oh you got to complain to your diary you kind of i think you know i think of myself like a chinese dish i'm like sweet and sour pork you know like you're not really supposed to have pork as a jew and then sometimes it's sweet and then sometimes you're like kind of sour it's just like it's a it's a mixed bag it's a variety it's uh entertaining you're uh since i've known you now for i think like eight or nine years and you've all you're you're cagey with numbers so i don't want to push you if you don't want to be pushed can you talk about how big you guys are now given i mean in your youtube video i think you said 100 million in revenue yeah we're not going to hit it we actually missed our goal this year um it's going to be less than that it's weird you said 80 in another video what i think because someone doesn't want to tell you how much they make as a cage um yes i don't think that's wrong though i don't like talk i don't talk about a lot of stuff either i say like round numbers sometimes or i'll just say i don't want to talk about that all right how much did you sell the hustle for let's try these let's try kg numbers um tens of millions of dollars uh yeah i mean how much do you make a year now working at hubspot well i get paid uh i got i get paid a whole lot of stock but my base salary i think is only 250 000 maybe only well my stock is is significant i will say this is you know in all these shows nowadays and crypto people they're always like this is not financial less i'm gonna give financial advice i buy a lot of hubspot stock i think it's one of the most undervalued stocks on the market so dude by the way when they bought us i think it was um they were worth 17 billion dollars or 16 billion dollars in late january around when they bought us i think today it's 40. so yeah that's gone up a lot so and that's why when people ask how much we sold for i'm like well we sold we i basically i got tens of millions in cash and then i also got hubspot stock but it's already it's it's up significantly since we sold so and i don't know like what price do you say and yeah sorry i don't know and i don't love exactly saying where are we gonna ask who's wealthier you or sean oh dude i don't i don't know i i hear i'll tell you this we did a podcast we did a podcast recently and i basically said my goal was to make at least 20 million dollars by the age of 30. and i did that dude good for you and that was the goal but you know like i i also don't i own assets now in the in some real estate and i own um hubspot stock and airbnb stock but like you own appsumo which an 80 million dollar your business do you think you're worth two or three hundred million dollars um i think epsom is worth somewhere between a quarter billion and a billion dollars isn't that crazy uh yeah i don't really look at that as part of my net worth i just look at my own it's interesting we've talked about this a little bit like i think there's silicon valley entrepreneurs that think about your valuation of a company and then there's me and you who are normal people that are like what's your profit what's your revenue all right you're worth a million not like oh well the multiple is this if they say multiple they're silicon valley well uh i mean you guys would sell for if you're if you're if you think you're if you said that you're going to do in the range of 80 million in revenue i mean i don't know how i would value that five times profits or five times that number i guess right i don't know man it's a it's a little surreal i and i don't i'm not sure how different my life would be my brother did ask me he's like if you were to sell you know how much would you sell for and i was like i don't know like if it was a billion that's like and i think people don't realize that like when mark zuckerberg i worked at facebook and i heard uh catherine's like shut up talking about that but you got to give him credit man he turned down a billion dollar offer at 24. yeah he's crazy like dude you took the first offers anyone offered you no i didn't but but like yeah it was like eager i mean i think i said i would love i say that with love dude no we we we had a few other ones but it was a good one and i knew that hubs i didn't know i was betting that hubspot stock was a good buy and i think that i just like i'm not zuck i i i can't imagine working dude he gets do you think his life is enjoyable i can't imagine it's enjoyable no i mean i guess he enjoys it but i i just think that that's hell to me that's why he has to have a virtual character enjoy it more for him yeah i don't know i mean like we have you and i have this buddy we remember that one time we were out to eat and you could say i don't know you're he's your friend so you could tell me if you want to say his name but he was like noah you're not growing at three times a year what the [ __ ] you're leaving so much on the table and you're like dude i just went mountain biking like on a tuesday and then on wednesday i like did this and then on thursday i did this we're gonna make like 80 million in revenue this year and i own most of it i'm so happy and he was criticizing you as a friend and uh and i was like no is he is he crazy like you you got it this is perfect this is don't change this is perfect it's um i i don't know i guess how you want to live do you think that i guess that changes over the years right and i think what what's that no no how you want to live i mean i think in your 20s you're just like scrambling and wanting to i know for me i wanted to prove myself i wanted to have status i wanted to have it and then as your 30s you know i'm still doing it no i'm just like you know you you figure out more what really gives you fulfillment i think everyone's got their own stuff i think figuring it out for yourself is a really tough thing you um how many people work there 100 i think now we have 140 isn't that crazy it's yeah yeah it is crazy do you like it it was just started as a side oh sorry am i cutting you off dude no keep going i want to hear from you i just started as a side hustle like i was in a basement in san francisco that was like yo i i have a theory about what i think will be big and i want to make 3000 bucks a month never was it like i want to make millions of dollars or i want to have a bunch of people or i want to have a bunch of customers why three thousand a month a thousand was for living a thousand was for eating and a thousand was for saving that's funny that's almost exactly what i did too it was about that number um did you well how big do you think it was going to get i never thought that far ahead i mean there's a go for it i keep interrupting you i'm sorry go ahead that's all good man well like there's a there's a quote i read by paul graham and it was like if you're so worried about what's gonna your company's gonna be in 10 years like you're never going to make sure you can take care of your customers today and your business won't exist in 10 years so don't worry about it and i just kind of i guess that's how that's that's served me well i think someone asked me they're like what did it take to become a millionaire and i think one of the things for me was just like following the curiosity and i was like curious about all the stuff that like that we me and you get paid for yeah i mean i'm in the same boat i think when i having 140 employees would i don't know if it would freak me out but like i remember do you still look at your payroll when you pay it every two weeks well so do you want to just tell you the call i literally that's why i was late to the podcast yeah because i'm you know we're we're taking the whole team out to costa rica and then we're also we're it was some spend for advertising it was like 50 000 and i'm just like yes we make revenue but at the end of the day if you don't have income and you're not a funded business you're gonna go out of business and so i think it's figuring out how do you create you know checks and balances so i'm not stressing about it weekly but there's definitely some net income issues that are keeping me up and then we're doing budgeting projections and the [ __ ] up things budgeting is if you budget for 100 million to 120 million whatever 150 and you spend on that and you don't make it then yeah you get kind of [ __ ] too i think that you and i are similar in that like when when i see the so i'll like say yeah i want to i think we can hit 100 million in revenue and then they say all right well then we have to spend 80 million dollars and i look at it and i'm like oh my god what the hell what is this 50 000 expense what is this 10 000 expense are you crazy we can't do this this is ridiculous and i get fearful i think that's the cool thing about having a guy like amen where he's a little bit less attached this company called nerdwall you know nerdwallet yeah tim chen uh gave me a little bit of money to start the hustle and it was his idea to give me money he was like hey can i give you some money to start this and uh i took it and they just went public at like three or four billion in valuation and i went to him one day i go tim we're spending 80 000 a month in expenses we're making more than that but like that's crazy he goes man it's just an excel number like it's just an it's just it's a spreadsheet you it has an input and an output that's all you should care about you shouldn't actually care that it's 80 thousand dollars a month and i still find myself freaking out over that stuff and so for you let's say i don't i don't know i imagine your payroll is like 10 40 50 million dollars a year or something like that or your payroll and marketing expenses i would i flip out when i think about that because that's all basically your money whereas with amen or someone else you could be you could be more detached yeah i mean eamonn always cared and eamon i have a lot of respect and admiration for him and he's still very involved i i think the way that i've tried to approach it generally is two pieces number one when does the red flag need to be triggered so every week we have a monday kpi sheet that they update our gross margin they update like customers and so there's color coding and it's like okay are there red flags in any of the numbers that i need to call [ __ ] on and i think that that obviously reduces your anxiety and it helps you make sure that you're trusting but verifying i think the second thing around it is that how much if something is a profitable spend how much should you spend it depends on it all depends on a lot of different stuff but if you're spending money and you're making 30 profit go all in hunt there's no budget it's unlimited and i think that's part of the question with the spending for me is that where is our spending very profitable like is it in marketing is in development is in sales is it in the partner success team or is there things like that that should be more like aws where they're they're a little bit more scalable up and down and they're not as profitable so we need to be mindful of that how big do you think this business could get in like 10 or 20 years do you have do you ever think about that i'm just trying to survive to next year dude i mean you know it's funny we've had as we've grown and it's been interesting because i have my youtube channel which is a very small team of like five people and then we have appsumo which is a larger thing i come back to the why right like on appsumo it's very simple we promote dope tools at great prices and we help people start and grow online businesses appsumo.com and um i think we have to come back to that because we were like we're gonna be in five years i'm like probably helping people grow and start online businesses no i know you're going to be doing the same thing but like the revenue was i mean we were yeah we we went to the spreadsheet and we tripled numbers silicon valley double double triple triple from in and out and uh we became a billion dollar company revenue in like five years or something like that i i think right now candidly some of our mechanics in terms of the scalable business means as we add partners do we get customers and this business grow um the how do i sit more clearly it's just not adding up like we added more partners this year and the proportional amount of customers did not come with that and so we have to work a little bit more on that flywheel which is well i think that you must with trends so we had trends our subscription service we [ __ ] crushed it during coven we crushed it and i think now sales slow down a little bit i think it's cyclical but in this the like i bet if i had a bet covid was like the best times you ever had um cope was great man i thought it was just great in general right i thought it brought there's a lot of good about cover just about humanity and not the death part maybe but like the bringing people closer i don't know man i've been doing the internet [ __ ] since 2004 i've never had a recession and it's not that i have some superpower but it's like well the only way to not have recession is just keep doing things that people want and basically i think one of the other key things to kind of consider is how do you have discipline when times are good so you don't have to be as disciplined when times are bad and i think right now candidly with appsumo i think we're being a little bit undisciplined with our spending and our hiring because times have been better and i'm trying to get that a little bit more tighter whether the you know the future is good or not why is your youtube team so big five people i don't even think it's that big mr beast is like 100 people no way you think he has 100 employees at least 50 full-time at least 50 full-time 100 contractors yeah and are they what's his name the mr beast jimmy jimmy are they all like it's cause it's like the jimmy show right so it's like whatever he wants you do do i think that'd be weird to have 50 employees where it's like hey guys next week i'm thinking i want to do this the reason i would hate that is because then you've got someone like hey jimmy what if we had a rolling stone song in the background no i don't want that just like let me do what i want to do please just like fulfill that it's a so we have a head of staff and one thing i've never one thing i hate i hate when someone's like hey can you remind me about this and i'm like no [ __ ] just write it down i just told you you want me to remind you like do your job but i will say you know becoming ceo which i never called myself over the years until recently and uh is that there is times you're like yo remind me and you're like oh my god you're gonna remind me her name's anna who's head of staff she's phenomenal and then with the youtube channel i'm like hey i want you to come back with more ideas come go pitch me 10 more ideas go go and they come back i'm like this is the best ever and so i think it is figuring out you know what areas you like to play in and then being around people that you're just consistently impressed with but having people that'll do help you figure out [ __ ] oh god it's epic are you getting noticed on the street now no not just really you don't it varies in austin you know it's kind of our hometown so i think more people do it um not not actually not even though the channel's gotten bigger we doubled this year i actually used to get noticed a lot at the gym the guy hey bro i'm like hey i don't know i'm always still excited when people came to come and say hi i just got uh did you get recognized yeah weekly i just this like this morning just walking down the street and uh it makes me a little nervous sometimes because i'm like thinking i gotta like uh like like like uh i love smoking cigars and i'll just walk around smoking cigars and i'm like i don't want people to see me smoking it makes me a little nervous don't you think it's flattering i'm always so i always feel honored that like i feel like i've worked on yeah something i've worked on has impacted this person and they're excited to to say hi to me like who who have you seen that you've said hi to that you're a little nervous the other day i saw logan paul and i and i and i respect logan paul and i said what's up and i just i just pounded and i go and i just pounded it while i was walking by she's huge drew logan's huge was this year new york when i was in or i guess it wasn't the other day about two or three months ago i saw him and i and i respect it i respect what he built and he was a big old dude and i i i could have stopped and be like hey like this is what i do for a living your brother was on my thing and i probably we probably got friends of friends but i was honestly kind of nervous and i just like just pounded it when i walked away well you i'm sure i'll do a twitter thing like hey i want to have logan on the show but anyways that's that's awesome man did you see my twitter thread about when i met the silk road guy no you didn't see that i posted it the other day i was looking through old dropbox pictures and um or go to my instagram or something you'll see it and uh i posted your yeah i want you to see it it's me with ross albright the guy from silk road oh i think i remember that story you posted about it yeah i talked about it like here but i was looking through old dropbox pictures and i found the pictures of us together and i originally took them down off facebook because i was nervous but now it's no big deal and i posted the pictures about how i met this guy named ross at a party and we just chit-chatted and he got arrested like a months later and i know i recognized him and i was like oh my god that was ross the guy we hung out with at the party how much better is your life now being rich it did you you know that 70 thousand dollar um that 70 000 study i've heard that it sounds like [ __ ] to me it's [ __ ] it's way better it's way better it's significantly better it's significantly better i think like i still worry about stuff and i was just talking to my friend about this today and i was like why am i nervous about this and that i told neville i go neville get neville bought this 800 vacuum and i was like i went to up to his house to borrow it and i was like i can't buy one of these it's 800 it's too expensive and he's like why are you worrying about that i'm like i don't know it freaks me out i'm afraid to buy stuff so do you have that yeah well i think two things are interesting one i went to the grocery store i was with my parents you know for thanksgiving my mom we get grapes i really into green grapes lately and she's like noah these are really expensive today let's not get them i'm like deborah it's your birthday i'm going to treat you you get two of them so i don't i have no problems anything that's health related i'll buy i don't know i'm still mindful of it i think what's fascinating on the other side of it sam is like i mentioned it to you on text but you didn't want me to talk about it which is like crypto and nft crap which all these you know former shopify store owners now are crypto experts which is funny and um i like trade and i'll make or i'll buy something and make like a hundred dollars or i'll lose like a thousand and i'm like not devastated but what's the same they're like appsumo like we promote partners and you know we'll do like a million dollars in a day and the partners make like 700 000 and our customers are happy and i'm like well that's cool yeah it's it's funny there's a phrase it's called a a penny poor pound rich i think right or uh yeah something like that do do you uh we're talking about crypto but you don't actually buy crypto right you just bought a bunch at one time and you held on to no well two things one thing i want to highlight this is a phrase that chad said my business partner at appsumo.com you like how i plug it um he actually had this phrase that was great he's like noah don't confuse the ant hills for the mountains i was like damn that's good and he's like when we're doing work at appsumo and you know the different products we've built or you know whatever it is he's like is this a macro thing or a micro thing and let's do the macro thing let's get some [ __ ] mountains man he's like don't sweat this [ __ ] stuff and i'm like all right but that's hard man especially i i was telling someone recently where there's all these productivity tools and everyone's all these everyone's always like what's the latest pretty i'm like you're not even doing anything like don't worry about the calendar and the productivity tool worry about just doing important things this is the best productivity tool the back of an envelope that's damn it's a good that gets the job done oh my crypto thing yeah i buy i'm a boring investor so i think there's active income and passive income and i try to focus on my active so i just started buying in 2015 and i just put it on autopilot and i just auto bought it every month for the past six years and it's like made up of a substantial i mean you've you've done well with it i think which is pretty great i'll tell you the number on that that i don't mind well okay i mean you can i don't have to tell you it's fine i if i had a bet can i can i guess oh yeah or i'll be kg i would guess between one and two million not four million but it's four million yeah isn't that nuts i well it's always so funny because then you're like yesterday i was this weekend i was like disappointed i didn't buy crypto punks when my buddy was like you should buy it buy it dude but it was like 50 000 and i'm like that's [ __ ] crazy to buy status and imagery and like it's an investment it's only investment when it goes up it's gambling when it goes down well the nfts i think are mostly [ __ ] stupid oh don't get me started dude i just went on a deep hole are you on board or not dude i just got scammed i lost my i'm like i can't i don't even know what happened for the past two weeks i'm like yesterday i woke up at 8 am to buy apes i just spent 1600 on apes what of the of the 4 million in crypto how much did you what's your what's your basis there um i could pull it up it's probably maybe about half a million or four hundred thousand isn't that amazing is it is that crazy uh yeah well i think i've always just it's interesting because i've always not always when i started using it i was like oh i can see why this is going to be big um but yeah the return on it as an investment is pretty insane that's nuts what else and like what else could do that like some public equity equities uh but you don't even angel invest do you i mean angel invest could do that it just takes forever yeah it's not i mean i think the best investment for everyone is their own business so if you look at it like active income like really creating your own company has pretty much the highest multiples i can imagine also you can control it if you can get something to work because most of them don't work that well yeah but you got to grind sometimes often i talked to this guy i was biking on saturday and this guy named nick he's like man i got a grind and i was like how much do you i was like how much does he make he makes he's like 60k and i was like why don't you you know it doesn't i don't care i'm not judging him how much it's like but if you're gonna grind at least grinding something has higher upside for yourself because it's the same amount of work like he doesn't work harder than me i don't work harder than him i just worked on something that from a strictly financial perspective has a better opportunity when you're working with eamonn so eamonn uh is uh was your ceo good friend my good friend too when how often would you talk to him it varied like it varied probably like once a week on fridays and then one a little bit throughout the week but they actually kept me out of slack they kept me out of everything because it's kind of like a noise like my mom's a jewish mother it's like noah what's that on the screen what is that it's better to be out and i think that's probably the reason he wanted to step out and this is i don't think we're airing our private stuff wait he wants to step out because you were nagging him yeah i think to some extent i don't think anyone feels really excited no one wakes up like excited you know unless it's some weird kink uh to be like hey oh what are you doing today and i think there's probably a little bit too much of that uh do you think that i mean i have i've had people quit for that reason i do the same thing you and i are very similar you know that right and uh and i did the same thing where i'm like why are you doing this what's going on today what are you doing right now today like what actions can we take immediately to fix x y and z and i think you need both you need that urgency but like if you have a good if you have a winner you do gotta let them chill and get it done um do you think that eamonn whenever i have hired people to run stuff i always i get i freak out i'm like this guy's gonna when he finds out that i'm like profiting off their work like they're gonna bail this is so unfair and i hope they don't figure this out did you freak out about that i used to have a lot of that where i never would post anything on social same like i wouldn't post any activity i wouldn't post like my you know our youtube videos like hell i made my first million like i would never say [ __ ] about that and eventually uh i got to a point where i was like well am i helping these people do their best lives at the company or what i can am i do my best to pay them whatever they want so like with eamon i'm not going to share his numbers but i asked him i was like how much do you want to make and he said numbers and he made more than that and so i never really felt this never felt guilt because that guy got more than he wanted and i got well too but i think within the company it's also people are free to work wherever so it's like how do you create an environment that people are like yo that guy's doing well and i'm doing well are you interested in any projects right now you had send fox did you shut down send fox uh no we're still writing send fox.com it's a mailchimp alternative um what do you like what type of projects are keeping you up the two things that i'm i mean number one is appsumo so you know becoming more of a marketplace so you buy or sell software tools books and then the second stuff is like all this nft stuff is mind-blowing there's just so much so sam i think like you you kind of smirk and you know i at first i think that's what a lot of people have done with it the same with crypto when i was buying in 2015 we were like i don't i don't fully get it but there's something just interesting same when i joined facebook when i joined facebook you were like you're gonna go work at a social network okay same you know it seems weird but there's just a lot of these really interesting use cases that uh i'm very tempted and i'm very excited about right what use cases so some of the really interesting ones one is called city dao so basically everyone pulls their money and then they buy a city so they bought land in wyoming and now if you own one of the nfts or tokens within it you get votes to what they're going to do with the city so i find i find that really fascinating plus everything's public so you see who's voting you see what the votes are there's not much hidden there's other ones that i've liked one's called head dow it's kind of a stupid-ass one i think conceptually it's really interesting i don't know if it's run well um but what i like about it is it is a uh fund where you buy their nfts so there's ten thousand everyone buys an nft and if you hold the nfts um and the fund goes and buys stuff and based on your nft you get some return for whatever the the fund invests in so it's kind of like a index fund of crypto and other assets so i think there's just something what's the city one called city dao the who's who's organizing it city dow i don't know but it's all public for the most part but there's just there's so much stuff like that like think about this you can do housing so like right now housing is like noah owns a contract goes to the thing and all this well it's like you can have a house that's shared by a thousand people or like roblox or minecraft and the game stuff is really interesting where it's like there's not like facebook and twitter that get everything or roblox it's like the creators and the consumers own the whole thing same with appsumo like how can we create it so the whole customer base owns appsumo so they're incentivized even to start doing apps more i guess it's kind of like owning a share in amazon but kind of on a deeper level are you have you ever like paid money to be part of like a membership group like uh tiger21 or anything like that not yet i've always not yet so there's this thing called uh what's it called friends with benefits have you seen that i've heard of it what is this and so i think the market cap is like hundreds of millions at this point and so it was basically a a soho house online so like cool new york young people paid either 500 or a thousand or two thousand dollars to be part of an online group that held meetups and it was like hot people and [ __ ] young people wearing vans and supreme and [ __ ] like cool kid [ __ ] and it was uh you know you had to buy an nft or a coin to join the the community and you're incentivized to make the community awesome because people could sell their membership or like give it up and it could be worth more than when they initially bought in that and i think that's interesting there's just a lot of you i mean it's still so early so what's gonna like what's gonna like after the dust settles and the consolidation of all the junk because i'll tell you i jumped in there's all this discord discord you know it's like slack for juvenile delinquents dude it's so hard to figure out i feel so old it's not just that it's just hard to use and then it's just like so spammy like i go in it and they're like there's just a lot going on in the space and so trying to try not to rush into anything but just understand like all right i think appsumo we did a good job where people are like i want to start businesses i want tools and it's like how is entrepreneurship and startups and stuff evolving and there's definitely something where there's so much money and there's so much speed being happening in this crypto nft space um that i find just i don't know at this current time i'm like obsessed with the guy or the people setting up the town in wyoming how are they going to make a profit how did they get paid so there's a lot of different dude there's all these different i fully don't understand every single one out there um i'm not biology but what they do is a few different things so one they could keep some of the assets so when they so they do a few different things when you mint the tokens or the nfts to give out you people buy into it so when i create the baseball cards and i sell it to you it's like one each each to for you to buy i the the city dow keeps all that and then they could decide how much of that goes out to use to buy land they could say 80 buys land or 50 they can decide that the second thing they do which is really interesting this is what's really clever about nft stuff is a lot of times on the secondary sales the original owner gets a cut you know that yeah i didn't know how much though so it varies so you can have a thing where if i create nfts and it's ever resold i get five percent of all sales forever so there's just some there's some really interesting things and then you can have people contribute more uh there's just a lot of variations and look in the end of the day people have had partnerships so this is not brand new i think the the medium of exchange through crypto and all this stuff is creating new new opportunities you you and neville and a couple other friends went and hung out with peter thiel a few weeks ago and you could decide what you want to publicize or not but one thing that i think i can say is um i think he said this to neville or something where he was like you know businesses are are neat but they die and he said something like a city any city that's ever been a somewhat major city it's never died before and apparently his obsession right now is on cities uh and i actually invested in this one company where they're doing uh gene editing you know what gene editing is not familiar it's like basically the the kind of explain like i'm five version is if you get a disease and your skin like goes away or something happens to your skin and it gets messed up gene editing you can tinker with someone's genes and it will grow they'll grow back new skin whereas before they probably wouldn't have the issue with gene editing is that it's highly regulated by the fda and so like the future of gene editing could be like if you're an amputee you can grow back a new leg or or you could grow a new liver or kidney or whatever you know [ __ ] like that and peter thiel has this city in like bolivia somewhere in central or south america and he basically is like the founder of this city and this company that i invested in is based out of that city because there is no fda in that city which is like potentially horrible but it's kind of interesting he said that he's in he's incredibly invested and interested in new cities and uh i think so i think that's cool when i hear about all these new startup people like mark laurie the founder of jet he has the new cities i think these new cities are actually incredibly fascinating yeah i uh i'm i'm more interested in kind of like shared home ownership i think there's something just kind of clever like how do i own a building but there's a lot of people that own it a lot of people can use it i think there's just like too many people that have too much house for just one individual so i like the the concept of that what do you think about meeting peter thiel you know what was it there's a lot of interesting things about him um i think one i tweeted about this at no kagan was that his he just uses like an iphone 7 right like the guy's like what are we on now what i've got the new one what is that yeah 13 pro.5 whatever and he's on a seven yeah and he had like you know crappy ass new balances he looked like he was wearing like mervyn socks and like you know like wrangler jeans i gotta give a [ __ ] about it and you know was he really do you think he was wearing regular jeans wrangler just like nor like kate mart jeans just like normal and you know but he also had three security guards and you know cameras and they checked the building all that kind of stuff i think i admired that he is a thinker and it made me appreciate you know i met him when i worked at facebook and i still remember this story he like bought into our poker game and then he had to go meet with zuck and then he lost and then he's like hey can i get my money back and then boz who's now like the cto was like [ __ ] no yeah yeah peter did and i was like can't believe that also we would say no the guy who's the only you know the main investor at the time uh i think the other thing that i appreciate about how much how much was the buy-in like 10 bucks and he asked for it back yes there's money but i was like what are you doing dude like i i was kind of surprised he wanted it back but then i like that boss like [ __ ] you he said that exactly like that he said [ __ ] you no no no he just was like no and then the funny thing about that i i like busted out uh i don't know i mean like 20 minutes later and i go outside and his like half a million dollar mclaren is sitting outside i was like all right all right what did you tell him that do you remind him of that story when you're with him recently i don't think he remembers me um but yeah i think the second thing about him is that he's a very i was just looking at my notes of him i don't mind sharon i think just like he he's just a deep thinker it just felt like this guy's like really like him and this is another you know him and like keith boy and all these guys they're a lot of history readers they're like deep ass like reading boring [ __ ] books about 1900 history that i just won't i'm not won't i just don't do and i think that gives that's where a lot of their advantage comes from so ben who's on this podcast has this podcast that's on history and he just talks about historical figures and he does a biography on them it's incredibly fascinating and right before you came on we did a whole podcast on history and how um you could just learn you could learn you basically could just not make the mistakes that other people have made just from reading about them so it's kind of interesting uh keith or boy i don't know keith or boy other than twitter dude he comes off like such a jerk on twitter i don't know if i want to hang out with him but i definitely would want to meet uh peter thiel dude he's a legend i love me keith boy him david sachs oh i don't listen to all in show um i don't even know is he is he cool keith is sharp keith doesn't really respond to me he he doesn't respond to me as much anymore because i've been trying to get him on my show uh on the no kagan show and um but he's just [ __ ] bright man like the guy's very bright i think he's very astute i also like people that have like i think lately i'm more considerate and i like when he's at a level of wealth in the hundreds of millions that it's just like [ __ ] and he's like yo that guy's a dumb ass san francisco's [ __ ] i think this is crying i have a lot of admiration for anyone who hasn't i like that too i just think that you could do it i don't think that you need to be polite all the time i'm an [ __ ] too i just think that like when you are a boss and you're a winner and you maybe pick on the weak ones publicly in a in a rude and abrupt way it makes you look weak and soft and like a bully and i think that i that's how i don't like how it comes off online but whenever i have seen interviews with him he seems incredibly kind not kind but polite i don't know i mean i think i guess i also agree with his opinions so i don't mind his approach like he's like liz warbin sucks miami's the best here's like businesses that i'm um you know really bullish on you like miami i'm more neutral to it i haven't spent enough time it seems appealing like there's i really wanted to go to art basel like that's on a bucket list man to see all the cool art and nft and just like the vibe uh i'm not i think every city's got every everyone has a calling when they get into a city miami's never called me to live there when i visit but it's enjoyable would you stay i do intend to stay in austin for a while yeah i think it's also you if you ever feel like stuck in life like i was feeling a little flat and like frustrated with a lot of work [ __ ] going on and you know i don't know i wanted pity party and i think to take you know to take a power party and you got to get the [ __ ] out so like i was in albuquerque last week i'm going to go to cabo this weekend gonna go to the bay or in la in a few weeks i think you can get the [ __ ] out sometimes and just change geography so tell me about peter thiel what do your notes say i would okay here's a shocker this is shocked me sam if you had five he's probably worth like 10 billion i was like peter how much are you spending on longevity and he's like almost nothing what that's crazy i would like that's spent everything on that i was like dude drop a bill give me a billion i'll solve it so he doesn't spend anything on longevity he spends very little he's like i do oh i don't know how to say some of this stuff he does some stuff like male things to help but like very like i thought he would be like yeah i have scientists on staff and i have an institute and i'm like you know the other thing is i was like oh do you have a crazy diet and he's like he's like none of that really is going to move the needle dramatically he's like i i eat dark choc i eat chocolate cake at night like he was telling us how his assistant hides food from him so he doesn't eat it when he travels like you think the guy who's like this genius which he is is like hyper disciplined he's like no i'm not but he also knows he's not so he accommodates so i i think i was just shocked that he's not doing more longevity you know we talked about um on the podcast we talked about this guy named brian johnson who started braintree and he's like a billionaire guy now and he's got a whole website where you can look at where he's spending millions of dollars a year on his on longevity and you can go to his website and look at all the stuff that he's doing and it's incredibly fascinating and when i saw that i'm like this is exactly what you should do if you're if you're that wealthy and i'm amazed that peter thiel doesn't do that yeah that was shocking i was shocked that he had low willpower he talked you know because you kind of you watch all these [ __ ] videos and you listen to podcasts like i wake up at five and i have you know celery and i take a cold shower he's like nah i like eating chocolate cake and he's you know and he was drinking wine and like he eat carbs and i was like he's a [ __ ] human which made me have a lot of appreciation for him and i i mean and i felt like he also was very generous way more than i thought he stayed and talked to us the whole time like four hours without checking his phone without tweeting any [ __ ] and was very present which i really appreciated i read this book with him in ryan holiday and ryan holiday said something really i thought cool about him where he said basically if you ask him a question he'll say well you know some people believe this other people think that it's this this and this like he like looks at uh he looks at all sides and he doesn't actually always tell his opinion it's an interesting thought um i think one of the things he had a lot of phrases do you want to hear from these like he just had these phrases i'm like man these are great phrases look ahead function i thought that was good what's that mean uh basically like how are you looking when you're thinking about a decision how are you looking ahead to what the outcome could be i thought that was really clever like how much are you thinking further ahead on things uh zombification he's like everyone is a dumbass there's no everyone has like the same thoughts he's like i'm looking for anyone who has unique thoughts um incremental versus monumental shifts that's a baller one that's a really good one um companies are mortal cities are immortal yeah i was i was thinking about that and we i was talking to neville he goes yeah peter told me about this and he uh and i was like yeah i think that's true and i was trying to think of like a city in america that has like just gone away and one that was at least a mediocre city and there's nothing hmm well i think the thing that i never thought of that he had i was like whoa that's so interesting like we think of cities is like um he was trying to talk about how cities you're kind of like a shareholder of a country and i never thought about that he's like you can you know remote work is the worst thing that can happen to cities did he have an opinion about that yeah he thinks places like california francisco are people can vote now with their feet and so the ability to work remote now hurts them um yeah and and i agree with that but doesn't he live in l.a yeah yeah that's kind of weird right i i admire that i think i get annoyed with people like i'm in puerto rico to save ford nichols and i'm like well yeah but you have to puerto is actually not horrible but you have to live there yeah there's no [ __ ] power for two weeks if there's a hurricane and look there's dude you're on the beach there's i love mexican food it's got margaritas it's got a good life but the other side of that is like is that how much is it worth to live a sub-optimal life and i admire that he's like [ __ ] it i'm in l.a i'm going to live baller um even whatever tax rate this is i read that in that same book what's that ryan holiday book it's awesome do you want to tell you or not tell you no conspiracy or conspiracy theories or something yeah that's it that was just conspiracy theory is that it conspiracy um he's in that book he said that wherever peter thiel goes 24 hours a day he's got a black mercedes waiting for him oh that that's what was outside the car that was outside the restaurant was it a black mercedes yeah yeah he had a disco ball inside it was crazy and he and i i think i'm almost positive he says it's running at all times he tells me they have to have it running that's really interesting in the book that's what he said uh he goes he has a mercedes form all the time and uh apparently he's got like some residence or something in new zealand where uh i think there's also a jet waiting for him uh like in a close vicinity wherever he's going and he goes just in case if anything bad happens he could bolt to new zealand i think the question that i'm curious that you got me thinking about for myself or for you or for the audience is that if we had a billion dollars how would we live differently what do you think you do you still want to do stuff right like you still want to work like work is fun people are like oh it's like dude sit around all day see how that goes [ __ ] boring it's [ __ ] lame um not too much i think i would just do the things i'm doing at a higher level now i would like not worry about buying houses i'm not sure dude i don't know the absolute stuff is hard i don't think i would pay right away to get out of it but i'd try to figure some something else it's it's tough i got another like year or two in it for this this role uh then probably buy houses and i'm just trying to figure out how to adjust the work to only do the area i want i would accumulate large amounts of land and i would create nice residents on all of them so me and my friends can just go and like it's so rare that we can go someplace and do whatever we want and that's exciting for me like that's what we we should do do we have any friends that have lots of land that we can go and shoot guns and drive motorcycles and [ __ ] and just be like 12 year olds that's what i'm talking about i thought we were gonna say i was really hoping sam our answers would be like you know i would take that billion dollars and give it out to the world well i'm not giving it to the world but i would like any anything like like i felt bad remember that tony shay uh tony the guy from zappos you know that's sad it was sad and but when i saw that i'm like man i wish it didn't go that way but at the same time like he would travel with an entourage and i'm like that is sick as you know the substance abuse things was bad but wherever i went i would just say crew who who's who's coming with and you and i have a friend uh this guy who started rent jungle or not rent juggle jungle scout greg mercer and he bought these fancy seats to f1 and i don't know how much it cost but i bet you this box cost fifty to a hundred thousand dollars and he was like um hey do you want do you wanna come and i just had cheapo tickets and he's like we took care of everything and i was like what i was like well how much is it i'll pay you he goes no no it's cool man it's fun i like sharon and he brought me and it was awesome and he's told me stories about how he takes people to telly ride just if he's doing cool [ __ ] he's like hey anyone who wants to come come with me and it sounds awesome that's what i want to do i did i think i've told you this i did my will like a year ago and it was kind of like it was surreal i was like i guess i'm gonna maybe die one day but then it really inspired me to to live while i'm here and spend the money now while i'm here so even with my brother i'm like do you want to kill me and get the money now or can i just give you some of it now and it's just it's exciting to start thinking about how to live like you have the will and like live like you're dead and enjoy the money with friends like you're talking about that's a great way to approach it do you are you gonna have kids anytime soon i mean it feels weird making a will where you gotta like give [ __ ] to your mom and your brother yeah my brother has a kid which i was like that guy's gonna get all this money like that's crazy it's not even yours yeah it's not even minor it's not his like it's not your kid i mean it just feels like you're not like you love him but you're not it's not your your blood or your you know it is part some blood i think genetics some uh yeah i think i'll have kids i mean i maybe i'll go to sperm bank and just donate a ton and then each of those kids gets like a mill maybe they get each one of them gets a crypto punk yeah [ __ ] um we're going to wrap up here in a minute but this has been a a meandering episode i actually think it's going to go over kind of well i i i think people are gonna dig it i you know i got nothing to say to that i thought it's interesting i mean talked about a variety of subjects and then what what do people want out of the show why do you think people listen to something to like entertain like empty calories frank business advice so there's a few things one i will say i'm shocked anyone listens but at this point we're at we're at we're we're like over a million downloads a month now um which is crazy so some episodes like 50 60 70 000 downloads which is pretty crazy um two shockingly people find us funny like that's what the comments say which amazed me and three i would say sean's really good i think sean's good i think a lot of people listen for him you're good too man you're just a good follow-on i mean i think what it is is you're the only ones left podcasting like everyone gave up like a few years ago and you're like no one told you so you kept going it's been so hard it is hard man but i think that's you know you forget my mom always says this like you forget how hard the last lap is and i think sometimes when you just kind of push through and you're like oh i guess that wasn't so hard and the further away you get from it well is youtube easier you think uh it's hard you could you could what define easy right is the [ __ ] answer um yeah it's challenging and it's in a different way i think the intimacy of an audience is really high with podcasts like they're really spending a lot of time with you youtube it's harder to be successful on it i think it's harder i don't know harder but there is a broader audience available for you to reach so that's why i spend all my time so i stopped podcasting more or less i still have my show that noah kaden presents but you know of my content creation audience building 95 percent of that's in youtube world it's harder for people to do it like that you can't just go back it's so hard it's so i know you put out a video like well all of it takes forever it's just like i think you know the [ __ ] answers find the thing that you could work forever on my video that i i made my first youtube video i'm gonna start doing one a week it got 3000 views baby oh which one the drinking one no the um real estate one about my project how many 4.3 000 views 2.4 000 that's good man look dude i didn't even remove the descript logo at the bottom because it cost 25 and i was like i don't know if i'm gonna even do this next next month did you edit yourself yeah good for you there's there's no editing they're just like i spliced clips together how was it for you how was this experience doing it it sucks i hated it but um uh it's it's cool to see the result like i understand why you know who the best at here's the best youtuber i think out right now he's he's out of this world nick bear oh dude love nick bear nick bear's the best youtuber i've been seeing lately the other day he put out basically a documentary and he's doing like one or two a week um he did a documentary on the leadville 100 this 100-mile race he did nick bear's the most impressive youtuber i've seen lately do you agree with have you had him on your show yeah but it was a little bit more it was before he was really famous nick is just dope man he's just like a good dude and like you when you find out he like started his business at 4 00 a.m when he was in on and on base in korea he's like damn that like i'm not surprised when people are successful i'm like oh yeah you put in the work and you stuck with it for a long period of time that's it did you meet him in person yeah it's awesome is he just yoked yeah yeah i'm gonna i think i'm gonna work out with them next month or in january oh you should stop with them yeah i think part of it is like you know i've said this before it's like most of my net worth is from who i know and so nick i gotta meet him and help out help his stuff helps me out um but there's certain people that you see like nick that you're just like yeah man i hope you get there and he's getting there obviously but there's just people you want to see succeed i think people don't want to see me and you succeed sam but they they just can't stop us some do some are like noah why do you say that i want to see you succeed but i think it's just like no you you and i are very punchable that's why we do boxing we let other people have a chance to punch us let me ask you a last question what what what can i learn from nick from you knowing him oh i would definitely have him back on the show um when he was on the show he was super like almost naive like it felt like like not but that not a bad way where he was like learning as we were talking to him like he acted like he was unaware of certain things and i'm like dude i know you know about this but you're just like a sponge and you just are trying to get me to tell you everything so you know he was just interesting he just felt like a student yeah that's i mean it could be his i don't know if he's trying to be strategic about that i think that's interesting um i don't know i i guess with nick i'm impressed his evolvement from like someone who was a marine or i think he was a ranger to a business operator also he's kind of in a to some extent commoditized space right like the sugar powder yeah the powder that get everyone gets from the same place but you put a different sticker on it i think i've been impressed specifically with nick how he evolved from like uh you know i'll be straight like a meathead jock lifter to like one a content creator at like an elite level from the storytelling and i think it's just his physical fitness is really well-rounded so well-rounded man who on earth can weigh 195 pound and you know squat 500 pounds and run a three-hour marathon it's so interesting there's a lot of there's a lot of good youtubers out there man it's just unbelievable how much great content is being created who do you like we'll wrap up with that who do you like uh let's look at my homepage so obviously noah kagan colin and samir are studs i i love colin smear oh dude you know who's the best andrew callahan channel five he was the all gas no brakes wait what oh he is dude watch the check bake so channel five with andrew callahan uh watch the um watch the pickup artist boot camp or check oh yeah this guy he used to be part of like a business that he bailed on he was i think for vice or something like that all gas no breaks yeah yeah he's sick colin and samir are sick on on just specifically on creators um i like watching dude my weird freaky fetish lately is just i love watching like outdoor survival same which ones uh who's the guy in ohio dave canterbury so i watched dave canterbury actually just writing all these down dave cannon barry yeah dave canterbury architectural digest is gangster i love seeing like celebrity homes do you like primitive technologies uh i think i've seen them i think i'm pretty aggressive on unsubscribing for some reason i unsubscribe from them i see primitive dude i'm looking at dave cantonbury he looks amazing this is exactly how i want my guys to look have you watched the show alone no oh oh on hulu yes have you met like with the guy that looks like uh like he like he's wearing like bear skin around he looks like a native american the white dude but he's like i actually don't know where he is and there's another caves of missouri uh there's a bunch of weird-ass people in there but dude it's epic so i i definitely would recommend alone so i like all the survival stuff from that i watch a lot dude this is the weirdest one i watch a lot of squash videos i probably watch like like it's on right now watch this while you're talking to me sam i have it on in the background like hydraulic hydraulic press no squash like the game like the british gabe why are you watching that i just leave it on it's just like white noise i put on the background so i watch a lot of that on youtube that's kind of a lot of that's the main things like outdoor survival architecture of course neville and uh yeah that's about it all right well ben what do we think i'll tell you some i'll tell you another good book i read man i'll tell a weird one that people have dude i've been reading all crime books so like like the real murder mystery well yeah i like that but like i just like one on 9 11 um another one favorite book this year favorite book this year okay you're gonna like this one because you do this it's called travels with charlie in search of america john steinbeck wrote it in 1930. and john cybeck you know famous author and he was like you know i live in cape cod and i'm rich now i'm in my 60s i've been reading writing about middle america for the past 50 years and i'm so out of touch right now and he just drives his uh pickup truck around america and just talks to people and writes about it and it's amazing do you know who lieutenant dan is in um forrest gump yeah yeah he's the narrator of the audiobook so that's a good one and then empire the summer moon you'd like that one it's about oh i heard that one what's the comanche indians um and they're they're just nutty like the texans were evil and the indians were evil to each other uh the indians and the uh uh texans were just like it's about how they just destroyed each other and then finally the operator which is basically the guy who killed bin laden and he like tells the story of finding bin laden and that was is that good some of these military books were kind of weak not man that one was pretty spectacular yeah i mean he talks about like finding he he goes in depth about hunting down bin laden and and shooting him in the head like it's intense all right a few questions here one do you get books from the library at all no but either you or neville have been bragging about how amazing it is dude i'm a huge library guy there's a chrome extension called library uh it's called library extension that'll show you if you can get digital or audio books for free and it shows you when you go to amazon so you just put in austin library dude i use all the time how do they make money i just donated i don't know how they actually make money okay uh but thank you for those books dude yeah library extension you just add the austin library uh one book i

oh and it's on kindle unlimited it's free on kindle dude hell yeah all right i'm i'm gonna do that any other ones uh that one was awesome i really enjoyed that i didn't know if you wanted more yeah dude we're reading the same travel stuff so i'll give you another one then um little golden america in the 1930s two russian journalists from the ussr were welcomed into america and they just traveled for uh four months all over america and they're like you know it's pretty crazy in america and they just like you just explain from their perspective what america is about they're like in america everyone's so optimistic for example we met these guys it's cool and it's no one knows about it in america but it's one of the most popular books in russia in russia you book read you uh uh what else oh dude there's some other good ones do you read about the dude you know ryan holliday's book list is really good uh his email list his email list he just recommends books i don't know how he could he consumes so much i don't know dude he's like audiobooks it's like 10 a month there's no way he he does an audio book no i think he reads he's probably like it has to be paper and if it's not this like certain density of organic paper i won't read it he once said if you're not taking notes then you're not reading effectively i think that's true yeah but that's like i mean i'm not gonna take notes on like killing up bin laden i don't think but most of the books on kindle are physical i either highlight and then i'll reread them yeah but dude if i'm just listening to like a book like about these guys walking around their underwear trying to like get from place to place i'm not gonna like you know or like fight club i'm not gonna like write notes any other ones um dude trevor noah's book i was

part okay i really enjoyed that these are just ones from this year all right i'm gonna wait i think this guy james frey million little pieces didn't he isn't he famous for a bunch of stuff yeah he actually wrote a few other books and then there's some like drama about him oh uh they say that he lied about his book my my uh yeah the apparently he uh it's made up there's debate about that so it seems like for the most part a lot of it is not made up and there's just a few pieces that are yeah i remember this because he went on oprah years and years ago and there was this big controversy well so she talks [ __ ] on him and then she actually apologized i believe because i got you after you read the book you're like is this real or not real i can't believe it that's how crazy it is yeah all right i'm going to read it this is good this is the best part i'm going to read all these things i mean i i could i try to walk a lot so i listen to all these audio books so i'm gonna i'm gonna uh download this one a million little pieces i'm gonna get the uh the guys doing their underwear thing and i already installed the library extension bro game over come on this little gold in america do they have an audio book or just paperback uh you could do a paperback or you can um there's free pdfs online did you see the description of it it's interesting there's like no reviews of it but in the first page they go we translated this into russia and yet no one or into english and yet no one in america knows about this however in russia everyone reads this book in schools like this is like the kids summer reading for schools it's like very very very popular um do you see it yeah how did you hear about this goodreads recommended it to me when i was reading the in search of america uh the john steinbeck book i loved that that was one of the best like i it was like i got addicted to that it randomly popped up on things recommended and it had five out of five reviews five out of five stars on on goodreads and it had like three thousand reviews but when i googled it i couldn't find a thing about it so i was like this is kind of intriguing did you look at it on goodreads uh i do not like anything it's so funny goodreads i saw someone talk about this maybe it's you it's like the site that hasn't been updated from like 1960 but it's still dope it's still like a there's like there's nothing better yet it's badass uh the guy who started it spoke at hazelcon his name's otis chandler and his grandpa started the la times and otis sold to amazon for like a billion dollars i think either i think it was a billion or a hundred million but he sold it to him like 10 years ago or something like that so we just knocked it out the park do you ever you ever blown away by like how much awesome books are out there that we don't even know of like this book existed i've never [ __ ] heard of it and it's gotten reviews i'm like i did not know that yeah and i've always thought i want to read all this but then you know i started thinking one time i i listened to like thinking real rich on audiobook and i loved the narrator and i was like i don't remember those narrators or the the audio guy i want to remember his voice because he's so good and i looked at what else he had done and he's read like a thousand self-help books and i'm like wait a minute you've read all these and you're still [ __ ] making 50 bucks an hour reading these damn books what the hell man this is not effective and so after that i i almost quit reading business book or self development books entirely yeah it's just boring i'd rather read like biographies or like i'm reading this book this running book right now out of thin air the best right i just started it's really interesting i've been liking i guess outdoor activity books so well out of thin air that's not that's a different one wait out of thin air oh you're thinking of um the one about the guy in alaska who what's out of thin air oh it's about kenya yeah this guy like goes and runs with kenyans i think into thin air the john krakauer one which is also awesome but okay someone gifted me this out of thin air book and i wasn't sure if it was that good is it amazing so far pretty interesting i mean the i'd go read free country that one is like i didn't want to read it because i didn't want it to be over all right i'll read it all right i gotta rock this was good [Music] you

Sam Parr, founder of The Hustle, was able to retire with over $20 Million by the age of 31.

Of course, he's still working and doing what he loves. But the goal from a young age was simple: work super hard early on to have the ability to retire or spend his time working on what he wants to work on.

He did that through a few ways: starting and selling multiple businesses, investing, and of course, living frugally!

so there's this subreddit that i go to and i love it it's called uh fat fire and the idea is people who want to retire relatively young with a lot of money so they can live a fat life without working and so basically if you post on there a lot the mods the community leaders of the subreddit will verify your net worth to make your sure you're not full of [ __ ] by the way did you have a goal like this like i want to retire by x age or i want to be like yeah this wealthy by this age what was your like how did you phrase your goal uh i i wanted to have 20 million dollars by age 30. gotcha all right that's what i wanted that was my goal i created that goal when i was in my uh when i was like 19 or 20 years old i mean i can't confirm or deny but you know mission accomplished is what i would say i sold my company i achieved it at 31 i sold my company at 31. right um and so my that was my goal because i asked a rich person who i knew i asked him how much money do you spend a month and they told me 60 000 a month and at the time i was like i don't know like i can't imagine there's a world where i would just weird yeah yeah i'm like that just sounds crazy but whatever like i asked like eight people and this person had the highest number and i was like okay i'll just do that because i'll be conservative and then uh a percentage of your portfo of your liquid portfolio and basically it continues to grow have enough money that the earnings the the the sort of compounding earnings on the money being invested in something safe like the stock market s p 500 type of thing can um can cover your burn rate so there's two things that matter what is the what is the amount that i have invested and what is my life burn rate that's why a lot of people who like fire they go move to like you know bum [ __ ] you know middle of nowhere and they they're like oh yeah i got rid of my car and it's great now i can you know i got rid of everything i own and me and my wife we only eat apple cores and now we were retired it's like but fat fire is different fat fire is like now i kind of want to ball out i'm not trying to like skimp on my lifestyle so okay what do i need to achieve and what do i need to optimize while still not giving up like what i find to be enjoyable in terms of lifestyle yeah so that's how i made up that number and i don't even i spend 15 000 a month i mean when i sold i had saved a like seven figures of course that includes my wife and i and she also uh worked at airbnb and so airbnb went public and she had worked there for a long time airbnb went public in december i sold my company in february so it was like on december 1st and then like february 1st it was like that those two or three months was like massive right and so but prior to that or that it take her out because we don't want to put her business out there so let's just talk about you um in your early 20s what were you making so um from age 22 to probably 26 and 27 i paid myself something like two grand a month so in the brain so the first year of business i probably paid myself twenty thousand dollars for the first year and then i paid myself forty thousand dollars for the next two years and then um seventy thousand dollars and then the last year that was 24k a year and then 40k a year and then you said 70k roughly you know it was like 20 40 40 70. yeah so that's four years in and then the year we sold i paid myself close to 300 thousand dollars right and i had a few other investments like some angel investments and um like some weird things that kind of paid off but basically like for the longest time i mean i was living i the way i rigged it was in san francisco my rent was only 400 because i rented out this big place and i only had 25 grand of my name and i spent all of it to rent out and furnish this place and then i rented it out to people who basically subsidized it for me so i was living like a poor person and um so i was able to save a little bit of money living like like a wealthy person really you were living in a place and it was only costing you 400 a month which is great example by the way because there's a lot of people that will be like i want to move to san francisco but i can't afford it all you're saying to me is i lack creativity and resourcefulness because what you did is available to everybody go find a place that's at market or slightly below market price and what you did i think is you cut a deal with the landlord you were like i'll never call you for anything yeah i told it breaks i'll fix it i think you live there for like a decade or some [ __ ] and you'd never like set like seven years never spoke to the person yeah i never saw him i had not one said have i ever seen him actually if he showed up at the house you wouldn't know who that guy is i would not i don't even remember what he looks like i couldn't even tell you what he looks like i think his name was chris and so you cut this deal and you're like look i'm you basically became the landlord well i showed i showed up and i was 22 and it was a four thousand dollar or five i forget how much was it forty five hundred dollars a month for a four bedroom house and he goes is it just you i go look it's just me right now but i'm gonna get like some friends to move in um i'll like sign a lease a sublease with them and i and i can have you approve it right but basically like i'm gonna pay you on time all the time and my the preferred relationship you and i have is i never see you again and are you okay with that and he goes yeah he goes don't don't be late and i go okay deal anyway it yeah and so at this point yeah so it was a slow build it took like five six seven years but then what's crazy is i'm 32 now i started hustling at age 20 probably 20 like making like real money on my own like livable money and at this point at age 32 i'll make more this year from a couple like side investments like a real estate deal that i did i'll make more this year than collectively all of my salaries combined while working at the hustle exactly and that's that's the exact same same case for me and i think that's actually really common and i think the reason i bring that up is because it's interesting to me b i think that's really comforting to people because when you're in it and you're not making any money and it looks like other people are all making hell of money it feels it could feel very bad and you can question if you're on the right path or not and this doesn't mean you're definitely on the right path but it means when this path of entrepreneurship works that's commonly what it looks like so don't be surprised um all right so let's get back to which by the way um when i was getting going i was always so envious of other people like my friends i'm like [ __ ] you got a job at google you make 150 grand a year and you have all these benefits i haven't been to the doctor forever this is awesome i'm so jealous so you would come to you'd come to my office and you'd be like dude this is your office and yeah yeah and then we'd be eating something you'd be like this is this cheese just always available whose cheese is this they just bring you cheese i felt like i would be like you'd be like look this cheese is from whole foods this is expensive cheese i'm like bro stop talking about the cheese right now but it was like i remember you were noticing all those things in a funny way i was like you guys have an espresso machine he's got a woman's bathroom what the hell is this machine yeah i remember i was like freaking out that you had an expression like espresso machine i was like what the hell is this and i remember like i used to take food to go so anyway um yeah it accumulated quickly and i think it for most people it's i mean it like i think that it's basically it's like you're poor you're poor you're poor and then it's like suddenly it's like oh holy crap i'm not anymore and you know you have that moment and there's a subreddit called fat fire and they talk a lot about that and there's this guy who has a series of threads called confessions of a hecto millionaire and he's doing like eight parts and i linked to it in there i see five here yeah and the mods have basically um approved it so basically the mods have like this guy dm'd him dm'd his accountants or account information or something so they like verified that he's uh as wealthy as he is but basically in the beginning uh thread he says um you know i'm worth north of 100 million dollars i got wealthy originally because i was an employee at a tech company that made me 30 million dollars and that was like 15 years ago and then i invested in this and then i did this and then i did this and i'm gonna answer a lot of the questions that i think a lot of people ask here and the mods have approved that i am who i am and i'm gonna tell you all about work and purpose my time and routine why i keep a low profile how relationships are complicated what i spend on a monthly basis um what my investment in portfolio management is and it's incredibly fascinating i love this stuff where you get behind the scenes of people you normally never have access to and so it's a great series it's a great thread it's awesome

so disneyland does about 3.8 billion dollars a year of revenue every day about 50 000 people come to the park so you know just roughly speaking they make about just over 200 per guest per year and that's that's not counting the hotels the flights and the and a bunch of the auxiliary stuff so a ticket into the park is like 120 bucks and then you spend like another 100 bucks on food and merch so what happened so walt disney basically his story is kind of amazing so he he grows up and he he's actually from your your hometown i don't know if you know this you probably probably do but he's from missouri and i didn't know that apparently there's a place in missouri called electric park have you ever heard of this no because this is the inspiration for disneyland when he's eight years old he goes to this place called electric park and electric park was kind of known for two things one it was it was an amusement park and the second is it was really clean and that's like one of the biggest things about disneyland is disneyland is really clean so imagine having 50 000 guests over to your house but somehow everything stays really really clean um and that was like he's fanatical about this so he goes to electric park and he wants to be a cartoonist he uh ends up working at an ad agency and then he creates his first business it's called laphograms and he's basically doing these like kind of like animated uh cards but you know a bad business deal leads it starts working but then he cuts a bad business deal where uh he's owed a bunch of money by one client and then they don't pay him and the business goes under and so he says okay let's go to hollywood and um and he tells his brother let's go to hollywood and let's create another business and so they go and they create disney brothers cartoon studio and this is where they create mickey mouse this is where they create snow white that's the first big hit so the company goes from like in debt or making no money to making millions of dollars off of snow white that was like the big win and so he's like okay this is kind of working and the business is doing all right it's not going gangbusters um but it's a float and he's working on his next story he's working on pinocchio he's working on a couple other stories and he's always had this crazy idea about amusement parks ever since electric park and he takes his daughter to the local merry-go-round and he's like ah this is like so boring like why isn't there something more grand than just this merry-go-round like my daughter loves this but like this is so boring for the parents and this is just one ride like what if i made a place that was um you know what if i made a place that was fun for both the parents and the kids to go to which is like a similar theme with all pixar movies and disney disney movies which is like the movie is enjoyable toy story is enjoyable to an adult and a kid it has like two layers to it both can enjoy a different piece of it and so he's like and so what how did they actually come about this how did they actually like figure out the idea so they started by doing research they went to every theme park they could find they went to the world's fair they went to a whole bunch of places getting inspiration and ideas and mesh and thinking about what is bad about this experience what can be made better so things being dirty blah blah blah and he's like okay um he starts thinking about the design of the place and electric park had this um train that went around the whole park and so if you go to disneyland that's still the thing there's right when you enter there's a train and the train will take you around the whole circumference of the park and he's like all right i'm gonna build i used to tell people one of these days i'm gonna build an amusement park and it is gonna be clean and he takes two guys off of pinocchio and he says hey listen um i want you guys to start uh start working on like secret project x and um he's like you know it's a shame that when people come to hollywood there's nothing to see here like people all around the world have heard of hollywood they come here there's the sign where it says hollywood and the letters on the hill but there's nowhere to see hollywood so he basically is like uh guys if anybody came to even see our animation studio they just see a bunch of dudes hunched over over drawings it's not they're not very impressive let's build something amazing in hollywood and guys get super excited they start doing research but then reality hits they have to they're working on pinocchio they ought to ship it they're working on fantasia they got to ship it then world war ii happens so all of all of world war ii happens and then he comes back because he hires this guy kimball to work in his studio and kimball's like this junior kind of animator guy and kimball invites all the co-workers over to his house for like a barbecue or a birthday party or something like that and in the back in the backyard of his house he's like oh by the way you guys don't know this but my hobby is i build these little trains almost like the steamboat style train like it's like a life-size thing it was very small uh it's like you know one one uh like whatever one link of a train basically you have you cause this guy's name is ward kimball if you google him he looks like a cartoon and you can see his his train too so walt goes to this thing he's blown away he's seeing the train up close and he's like dude ward built this thing okay we're the whole mickey he says he comes back to the office he sends a memo he says mickey mouse park is back on and he tells the shareholders shareholders say don't do it movie studio is already on on edge this sounds like a big distraction it's against the charter of the company uh we don't want you doing this he says okay um no problem i understand i'll create a new company so he just creates another company to create the park he's like i'm still going to do this but if you don't want in i'll do this myself and um and he calls it like a red law or whatever something like that which is like you know uh walter backwards uh is kind of the name where he names it he starts working on it and so he's like all right how do i fund this thing he thinks it's going to take five million dollars to build disneyland and in actuality it ends up taking 17 million dollars to do it and so he's like all right how do i fund this he uh he takes his uh his life insurance policy and he takes a big loan against that that gives him like you know 100 grand or so to go do this then he sells a house that he had in palm springs so that's like the next seed money that he goes through that pretty quickly then he goes all right i need some bigger money how do i get millions of dollars for this okay he goes to abc the tv network and he says hey abc you're struggling right now you don't have much tv programming i will create this this program called like whatever like the wonderful world of disney or something like that i'll create a tv show for you that'll air every sunday if you invest in my park idea so disney basically puts down half a million dollars plus another about six and a half of loans and bonds and they owned 34 of disneyland and so that's how he got the next seven million bucks and then he did the same thing with two other companies and then he sold some sponsorships he he like accumulates together the 17 million dollars hustled his way he hustled his way to doing it the other thing that he did was he was like all right um you know this this thing works because um he's like i gotta hi i gotta have like the uh the rides work automatically and so he created this thing where if you go to disneyland now you sit in a ride and you go and it's sort of like a it's like a stage play that plays out but it's all synchronized when your little like roller coaster cart enters this room the lights go on the character makes a sound and then when you leave the room it all folds back into its thing and that's called animatronics and so basically audio animatronics was like the thing he wanted to do which was like he wanted live animals but it's too much work so instead of live animals he created these robotic animals and he said i'm going to synchronize the movements to music on a loop and there's this one guy who was just working on only this and he was kind of in front of a green screen trying to make this like puppet do this thing synchronized to music and eventually they finally figured it out and that was like the big breakthrough so okay let me fast forward a little bit they open the park they build the whole thing in less than one year they open the park and he only invited like 1500 people to it or something like that uh like invite only launch but somebody counterfeited the tickets and so double the number of people showed up with counterfeit tickets on day one because double the number of people showed up uh everything breaks the plumbing breaks because there's too many people using water in the park more than the load was able to handle so he they come to him they want we got a problem the plumbing is broken you have to make a choice toilets are water fountains he's like toilets for sure and so he there's no water there's no drinking water that day the asphalt was still so freshly poured that like women's high heels was getting stuck in the cement oh no because it was like caving in it was basically a giant disaster and he does some pr he basically says look um we have you know we had to work out the kinks give me a month and basically give me give me some time and this thing will be smooth and sure enough within a month the the baby is you know humming and in seven weeks he does a million visitors so it was kind of an immediate hit once he did it because it was such a famous idea it was disney right off the bat or at this air at this point how famous were they they were like i mean they were a big deal they weren't like semi-famous they hadn't had like i mean nowhere near what they are now but like they were semi-famous really the abc show which he was doing while he was building the park was almost like the hype video for the for the park launch was he just grinding the whole time yeah a crazy amount of work and so he he creates this thing and you know it's basically the sixth or seventh most visited tourist destination in the world now and um you know it's kind of this crazy place i think which is kind of shocking i think disney or the theme park division prior to covid was the most profitable part of the company wasn't it except for well not profitable because it had a lot of expenses but in terms of gross profit yes because they had a lot of revenue and a lot of expenses um but now disney plus is like the bigger thing because disney plus is like pure profit business basically took all that ip that people loved and created a streaming service but before that before covey before plus i like disneyland it wasn't it wasn't a project it was a like a major a value creation a lot of value was created there i wanted to know is this a is this a loss leader or is this a um a cash cow and it's it's more like a cash out it's hard to tell because every company's like accounting makes everything look like it's like losing money you know what i mean like accounting can make something look amazing or terrible regardless of it but you know the parks division parks and resorts was doing you know billions like 30 billion dollars a year or something crazy like that so it was you know obviously became a smash success when he wanted to do disney world in florida he creates five stealth companies because he's like disneyland was a hit he's like i'm looking for the second location if anybody finds out where i'm looking the price will go up so he creates five shell companies he starts buying up land in florida sure enough it leaks out the day after it leaks the price per i think acre went from like a hundred and eighty dollars an acre to eighteen thousand dollars an acre basically he couldn't buy any more once the news leaked and uh and you know he had this like kind of like inspiring vision so he's like disneyland i want this to be the happiest place on earth and he's like i want people to have no problem no problems with here i want this to be an escape from your problems you know you know um in real life and disney world he's like he created this thing called epcot which uh i don't know if you've ever heard of epcot but epcot is basically a standard government agency no it does sound like it though epcot is like right next to disney world it's this huge dome looking thing and it stands for it's an experimental what is it it's experimental prototype community of the future uh something like that of tomorrow and that's what it stands for um and so what he did was epcot is basically like it takes the cutting edge of what the future looks like and it creates like a mini simulation of the future so you can go and see the latest what the what the future is going to look like in terms of technology i've been once when i was a kid yeah that's kind of amazing and so um and he's like you know but all of these projects i'll read you some of the quotes that i thought was pretty great for him as like an entrepreneur he goes um i want this to be the happiest place on earth i want compared to kids have fun together he goes um when it came to epcot he's saying uh where is it he goes i want this to be a living blueprint of tomorrow i want this to be an always evolving thing epcot is never going to finish because tomorrow will always be different than today uh disneyland itself will never be completed it will go it will go on as long as there is imagination left in the world and so since then you know they built the park for 17 million but obviously they pour in like hundreds of millions of dollars every year to upgrading the parks changing the the rides and the themes and all that stuff um in order to kind of continuously evolving

what is it about this writing style that's so slippery that i just can't get it's like a tick tock feed i can't get out of it you know and so i would say it's like more like a door where you kind of got to go knock and take a leap of faith that there is something on the other side of this you can't see exactly what you're going to get until the door opens [Music] all right we're live cool sweatshirt um what's going on oh dude i already told you i couldn't i can't talk about it on on air but i am uh you know there's some days where a fire there's a fire on the third floor and you gotta grab the extinguisher and go put it out and so that's what i've been doing today is putting out and i'm glad that i did this which is we had a bunch of family coming in town for thanksgiving wife was like oh yeah it's great we got my sister coming we got this person coming this person's coming from india it's like oh god okay um she's like you know we should host thanksgiving i said you know i love the giving spirit i love the idea but we're not hosting anything on thanksgiving why because we have an e-commerce company and black friday is the biggest sales day of the year and she said well what are we gonna do like you know it's just gonna sell online like we're not gonna go to the warehouse or something and go fulfill it you know so what do we do i said sometimes you gotta create space cause you just wanna be available you wanna have buffer you don't wanna be fully booked in case you need to do it maybe you have an idea that something you can do to drive sales or in this case what if [ __ ] absolutely hit the fan and you had to do something to recover which is exactly what happened today i created space my ceo was like oh i'm just going to go pick this person up from the airport that day it should be no problem guess what she's in the car the shit's hitting the fan and she can't get to a computer and she's did not create enough space and so that was a great that's an evolution for you because you are not the man at creating something he's not a space creator uh that's that's come with you know some gray hairs in wisdom is is this idea so i'm glad i did it because shit's hitting the fan today and you know i'm just hoping that i told you before this i'm hoping that uh you know my my safety my savings my under the mattress savings of good luck needs to be cashed in today i'm just i'm reaching under the mattress i'm hoping it's still there i feel like i put it there i'm hoping that good luck is still there i need it today well okay so i've got so what we're gonna i we're gonna talk about uh products and media that we like but and i have a couple i have one thing in particular that's gonna make a difference on your day today actually okay um we can talk about it later but so today's episode is we're gonna talk about products and media that we've consumed throughout the year that we think are cool because i like talking about gadgets and and media and so do you um the stuff that you talked about laps last episode was actually quite amazing uh that article about um uh data and how it's easy to uh read data yeah just kind of like a great find it's kind of is that the idea right fine these these are exactly fines we've had this year whether it's a product or it's a piece of content great finds i think that's in the the thanksgiving spirit it's like you know being thankful for it but also people have time hopefully people are creating a little space you know you spend some family time and uh but but me people have time over the holidays and this is a good chance to either buy this as a gift for yourself or somebody else or to just check something out that you haven't tried before all right well let's start do you uh you name one and i'll name one or i can name a couple what do you want to do okay let's do let's i think we both have an app that we really like uh two different apps so let's do the category of apps so what's a great find you had that's an app this year okay z unfortunately a lot of things i might name are going to involve fitness a lot of them are going to be money related this influence your a lot of them will be money related though actually and relaxation and mindset so uh the first one zero it's called zero i believe kevin rose started it okay so i i never thought that i was intermittent fasting but in order just not to overeat throughout the day i just wouldn't eat breakfast turns out that's called intermittent fasting that's not why i did it um this app called xero it's free they have a paid version which honestly i don't think it does anything but the free version you you say when you had your last meal and it just tells you don't eat until and then you uh in my case it's 16 hours it's awesome i love it i can't believe how that one app actually makes me want to stick to it as opposed to when i'm on my own so that's that app has made a meaningful change in mind what are you fasting you're doing 16 16-8 are you doing more intense than that i do i do 16-8 so basically i'll stop eating at 8 00 p.m and i'll eat again at noon right so six that means 16 hours not eating eight hours eating and when you eat in your eight hours are you like you know eating kale salads or you eat whatever you want in those eight hours what do you want i don't eat whatever i want i usually eat meat and vegetables that's what i i work hard to do size no portion sizing within that eight hours you're fine you eat until you're full um yeah i i portion control yeah definitely i i very yeah for sure i try to eat 2 500 calories a day good good um all right so i have uh anything else on xero i think that's a that's a good run i've tried it as well i like it it's a super clean interface it's like i like apps that just do one thing really well and that's what that does um okay here's an app i think i've talked about this but i got big into breath work and so there's two apps that if you want to have kind of like a happier life there's a lot of apps that will distract you instagram tick tock whatever there's apps that'll make you more productive but they'll distract you from the real world that's like email slack maybe twitter and then there's apps that actually center you and ground you and so my phone had enough of the distraction apps i had enough of the productivity apps where i was lacking was hey how can i use this magic wand that's how i think of my phone it's a magic wand i make i just i install an app and that's like a spell that just could do some magic thing i can get food to appear at my doorstep or i can you know summon a car or i can do all kinds of different crazy stuff i can put my you know my mom thousands of miles away her face can show up on my phone well this one gets me grounded and so there's two apps i want to call out one i think we've talked about before it's called the five minute journal um i ended up meeting the guy who who who made this app i didn't know that was an app i thought it was a notebook there is a notebook and then there's the app apps it's a paid app i think it's three bucks or five bucks or something like that which is so funny because when i saw that i was like i don't pay for apps i was like wow like my threshold for paying for [ __ ] on a phone is so low compared to like a parking it's a parking meter but i get to use this app forever that some guy created and coded and makes it do all these things so five bucks and what it does is you open it up and it basically just has a quote while it loads it's always a good quote they do they have good selection and then it basically says what are three things you're grateful for today and the act of writing those down is great this looks great um you know not to get super cheesy but basically the more grateful you are the less stressed you are you cannot be grateful and stressed at the same time you cannot be grateful and afraid at the same time you cannot be grateful and angry at the same time so if you just want to not be any of those bad things just focus on being grateful rather than not being whatever it's like when you tell somebody relax when they're really pissed off guess what they don't really relax very well so you're telling somebody to not be angry or not be stressed doesn't work but telling but getting somebody to shift their focus to being grateful works actually really well what questions does it ask just says what three what three things happen today that you're grateful for and it's today it's things that happen today not like what are three things in your life that you're grateful for then you just sort of monotonously you say my health my family and my friends it's like no what happened today that i'm grateful for what's a moment of today then it forces you to slow down time because you're like [ __ ] what did i even eat for lunch today what did i do today and then you're like you think of one thing and you're like god there must have been something more than that that i'm grateful for you kind of suck at it the first day they suck at it the second day by the third day something happens during the day and you're like ah i'm gonna write this in the app tonight um like that's the thing and so it forces you during the day to actually take note of what you're grateful for which makes you a more grateful person all right uh let me just tell you something really quick so andrew hueberman one of the things on my list andrew huberman recently had a new video come on come out called the science of gratitude and how to build a gratitude practice andrew huberman was on our podcast he's got this amazing pod youtube channel where he talks about the science behind different things and how you can use it to help you and his latest thing is on gratitude and he says that he's been doing gratitude and i don't want to get into the signs but basically there's something about like the prefrontal cortex and how gratitude actually releases dopamine and it's proven to make you more motivated and happy and he said a lot of people including him did exactly what you did and he goes i think that's works but we have loads of studies that show that the actually slightly more effective way is to do one of two things and i believe those it is um you try so the most effective thing is that you you read or you remember you read something that someone has written to you and so someone's expressing gratitude to you of course that's not entirely practical right and so there's uh a few things that you can do the first thing is that you can think of a story when someone was helpful to you and if you if you focus hard enough it actually feels real and the second thing that that i do me and my wife is every couple days we have a set time that we sit down and we say here's what i'm thankful i'm thankful that that you did this and then the second thing that you can do is you can actually think of a story and my life just do the opposite we just say everything we hate about each other every two days and uh and then that sounds good then we get to get it off our chest she loves she's really good at the game i'm getting better uh it's just it's a good thing it's called the hateful eight just eight minutes of just like hating on each other um and uh the second thing that you could do is you can think of a story of of someone being helpful to another person and they put these guys i believe in a mri and they scan their brain and they watched a movie or a story about holocaust survivors being helped and surviving and it like changed something in their brain and it was proven to make them more motivated why is that the most convincing thing ever everything that they're like they did an fmri study they scan people while they watch this the brain lights up like a christmas tree it's like the most like that's the most i'm just gonna make that up whenever i want to be more convincing with my thing i'm like yeah people who buy my my power writing course uh we've done brain scans it shows that actually there are there you know how there's a part of your brain you can't access with this course you actually access it the scans they speak for themselves i did a transcendental meditation thing and uh it's like a style of meditation and they like i went to the seminar and they're like it's proven with brain stance to be different than mindfulness and i was like really i mean like you're both you're you're they're kind of the same thing you're being quiet and just like like i don't understand how but anyway that's what they said so uh anyway go ahead your second thing well one more on that great gratefulness thing there's one other technique that i it's less convenient but when you do it it's awesome it's called flooding have you ever heard of this no all right flooding is when you basically you create a flood of memories of great moments in your life the easiest way to do it is you open up a photo album and you flip through it or you go through your camera roll so if like me and my wife we get together we'll have our camera roll open and we'll just be showing each other photos from you know three years ago remember that trip remember that day remember this thing we did laughing about it what happened that day and just if you just do that for even 10 minutes you just revisit those photos i'm not a big photo guy i actually hate taking photos in the moment i find it to be just incredibly like off-putting and my wife's like the opposite she loves taking photos of everything but i gotta admit this flooding [ __ ] is amazing it works i literally love her more after we do it because i remember all these amazing times i've had with her and i don't have to try i just like look at the photo and it's there it's better than better than my imagination so that's what you're gonna have to do today in order to get over your heartache your money loss i know i know we'll have to figure it out one more app one more app so the other app is called othership uh so this is this just came out i invested in this thing because i'm a believer in it i struggled with meditation meditation was very hard for me so even though i was friends with the founders of calm and they gave me a free account or whatever never really used it couldn't couldn't get myself to enjoy doing it and i'm the type where if i don't enjoy it it's just very hard for me to stick with anything i don't enjoy i don't have enough willpower or don't want enough willpower i don't know what it is but i'm not great at it so i wanted the benefits of meditation but i didn't enjoy doing it breath work has become like a revelation to me it's a form of meditation it's very similar but focusing on breath and a guided breath work session so i've tried wim hof loved it wim hof has a great app too it's a free app and other ship is like a souped-up version of wim hof and uh this guy robbie created it he's amazing at it he guides a lot of the meditations himself he built his own like home oasis in his he was like really early at ethereum hey like he was the first marketing guy at the ethereum foundation when it was like whatever you know 60 cents or something so it's just like mega rich so he got like you know even with barely putting any money in he got like kind of loaded and then he sold some of it and was like okay i'm gonna turn like half of my i'm gonna make this huge like kind of cabin out of the garage type thing like a mega garage he turned it into like this like 20 person sauna plus cold plunge plus like amazing meditation room plus greenhouse and all this other [ __ ] you went to it uh no he's invited me it's in canada i haven't gone yet but um it's amazing he hosts a lot of people there he invited us actually so you're welcome to go anytime and um they do like guided whatever like microdosing lsd if you want to do that or whatever no you can do you can do anything you can do anything in this place long story short he got really into breath work along this journey and cr now this is what he does he's like i'm gonna i created this app i'm gonna i'm gonna bring breathwork to the masses and i do it every morning and it's amazing so that's my uh other ship is the name of the app all right i dig that all right i'll i'll tell you one all right so there's this subreddit that i go to and i love it it's called uh fat fire and the idea is people who want to retire relatively young with a lot of money so they can live a fat life without working and there's this guy and so basically if you post on there a lot the mods the community leaders of the subreddit will verify your net worth to make your sure you're not full of [ __ ] by the way did you have a goal like this like i want to retire by x age or i want to be like yeah this wealthy by this age what was your like how did you phrase your goal uh i i wanted to have 20 million dollars by age 30. gotcha all right that's what i wanted that was my goal i created that goal when i was in my uh when i was like 19 or 20 years old i mean i can't confirm or deny but you know mission accomplished is what i would say i i sold my couple i i achieved it at 31. i sold my company at 31 right um and so my that was my goal because i asked a rich person who i knew i asked them how much money do you spend a month and they told me 60 000 a month and at the time i was like i don't know like i can't imagine there's a world where i was absolutely weird yeah yeah i'm like that just sounds crazy but whatever like i asked like eight people and this person had the highest number and i was like okay i'll just do that because i'll be conservative and then if you withdraw only three percent of your 20 million that gives you like six hundred thousand dollars uh a year to spend there that that's what that number is that's that's that's right fire philosophy and fire stands for financially independent retire early so yes so you can you can you can spend uh a percentage of your portfo of your liquid portfolio and basically it continues to grow have enough money that the earnings the the the sort of compounding earnings on the money being invested in something safe like the stock market s p 500 type of thing can um can cover your burn rate so there's two things that matter what is the what is the amount that i have invested and what is my life burn rate that's why a lot of people who like fire they go move to like you know bum [ __ ] you know middle of nowhere and they they're like oh yeah i got rid of my car and it's great now i can you know i got rid of everything i own and me and my wife we only eat apple cores and now we're retired it's like but fat fire is different fat fire is like now i kind of want to ball out i'm not trying to like skimp on my lifestyle so okay what do i need to achieve and what do i need to optimize while still not giving up like what i find to be enjoyable in terms of lifestyle yeah so that's how i made up that number and i don't even i spend fifteen thousand dollars a month so i don't spend even close to that but i i saw this thing yesterday which is somebody was saying they posted like my company here's what my company's revenues were for the this i think i said chris cantino uh it was like oh company's revenues for the first seven years and it was like you know zero thousand twenty thousand fifty thousand hundred fifty thousand three hundred fifty thousand seven million twenty one million or something like that right i i'm making it up but there's some slow build and then suddenly things really take off and i think they sold their company it was a soap company i think uh for 100 million dollars i think i have that right is that correct you know this guy no i know who you're talking about though he tweets great stuff you said his name right yeah so okay so so he tweeted that and i got me thinking i was like it's it's true a lot of success i would say the common you know when success comes through the front door this is how it arrives slowly and then suddenly when it rains it pours when it rains it pours and i started thinking okay is that true in my life and i started writing down i wrote down how much money i made from the age 20 to the age 31 because i also got wealthy basically at 31 and um and it was like you know zero thousand dollars then negative thirty thousand dollars with that first startup then i i got a job and the job paid me a hundred twenty thousand dollars i thought it was great that was hundred twenty hundred twenty hundred twenty and i went to 160 and then it like stayed there for a bit and then i totaled it and i said wow at age 31 i made more than the previous 11 years before that combined and i was like you know this is my advice to young people always is if you're going to take a non-traditional path like entrepreneurship or betting on yourself rather than a corporate career track corporate career track you should be increasing you know every two years by a certain fixed percent and you're great that's your lifestyle if you take the non-traditional path you go try to be a content creator entrepreneur or something else it's going to be this slowly than suddenly path and don't if you're 22 don't count your earnings at 22 or 23 or 24 you're gonna check the scoreboard at age thirty was my my motto might be or or regardless of 30 or not after like eight or nine years you give it give it a decade and you what you need to is total it up in 10 years how did i do versus counting every year because you're gonna lose lose lose lose lose win big and uh that's off that's off to the path so i was curious for you if you did that is your path similar or if you charge it out for 20s to 30s i don't know if you want to share the exact or whatever but yeah i can share some i mean when i sold i had saved a like seven figures of course that includes my wife and i and she also uh worked at airbnb and so airbnb went public and she had worked there for a long time airbnb went public in december i sold my company in february so it was like uh december 1st and then like february 1st it was like those two or three months was like massive right and so but prior to that take her out because we don't want to put her business out there so let's just talk about you um in your early 20s what were you making so um from age 22 to probably 26 and 27 i paid myself something like 2 grand a month so in the brain so the first year of business i probably paid myself 20 000 for the first year and then i paid myself 40 000 for the next two years and then um 70 000 and in the last year that was 24k a year and then 40k a year and then you said 70k roughly you know it was like 20 40 40 70. yeah so that's four years in and then the year we sold i'd paid myself close to 300 thousand dollars right um and i had a few other investments like some angel investments and um like some weird things that kind of paid off but basically like for the longest time i mean i was living i the way i rigged it was in san francisco my rent was only 400 because i rented out this big place and i only had 25 grand of my name and i spent all of it to rent out and furnish this place and then i rented it out to people who basically subsidized it for me so i was living like a poor person and um so i was able to save a little bit of money living like a wealthy person really you were living in a place and it was only costing you 400 a month which is great example by the way because there's a lot of people that will be like i want to move to san francisco but i can't afford it all you're saying to me is i lack creativity and resourcefulness because what you did is available to everybody go find a place that's at market or slightly below market price and what you did i think is you cut a deal with the landlord you were like i'll never call you for anything yeah i told it breaks i'll fix it you i think you lived there for like a decade or some [ __ ] and you'd never like set like seven years yeah never spoke to the person yeah i never saw him i had i not one said have i ever seen him if you showed up at the house you wouldn't know who the heck is i would not i don't even remember what he looks like i couldn't even tell you what he looks like i think his name was chris and so you cut this deal and you're like look i'm you basically became the landlord well i showed i showed up and i was 22 and it was a four thousand dollar or five i forget how much was it 4500 a month for a four bedroom house and he goes is it just you i go look it's just me right now but i'm gonna get like some friends to move in um i'll like sign a lease a sublease with them and i and i can have you approve it right but basically like i'm gonna pay you on time all the time and my the preferred relationship you and i have is i never see you again and are you okay with that and he goes yeah he goes don't don't be late and i go okay deal and we are never late i never one time i i i'm an idiot one time i shot a bb gun in the toilet and it broke the toilet and so we just went to home depot and like bought a toilet and just replaced it you know what i mean so we would do stuff like that all the time if somebody said hey which of your friends shot a bb gun into the toilet i feel like i'm like oh you know sam sam's great he's a great guy i bought we bought like an airsoft gun or something we're like let's see how strong this is and we really want to shoot it in the house because it went through the couch uh anyway anyway it yeah and so at this point yeah so it was a slow build it took like five six seven years but then what's crazy is i'm 32 now i started hustling at age 20 probably 20 like making like real money on my own like livable money and at this point at age 32 i'll make more this year from a couple like side investments like a real estate deal that i did i'll make more this year than collectively all of my salaries combined while working at the hustle exactly and that's that's the exact same same case for me and i think that's actually really common and i think the reason i bring that up is because it's interesting to me b i think that's really comforting to people because when you're in it and you're not making any money and it looks like other people are all making hell of money it feels it could feel very bad and you can question if you're on the right path or not and this doesn't mean you're definitely on the right path but it means when this path of entrepreneurship works that's commonly what it looks like so don't be surprised um all right so let's get back to you which by the way um when i was getting going i was always so envious of other people like my friends i'm like [ __ ] you got a job at google you make 150 grand a year and you have all these benefits i haven't been to the doctor forever this is awesome i'm so jealous so you would come to you'd come to my office and you'd be like dude this is your office yeah yeah and then we'd be eating something you'd be like this is this cheese just always available whose cheese is this they just breathed out i felt like i would be like you'd be like look this cheese is from whole foods this is expensive cheese i'm like bro stop talking about the cheese right now but it was like i remember you were noticing all those things in a funny way i was like you guys have an espresso machine he's got a women's bathroom what the hell is this machine yeah i remember i was like freaking out that you had an expression like espresso machine i was like what the hell is this and i remember like i used to take food to go um so anyway um yeah it accumulated quickly and i think it for most people it's i mean it like i think that it's basically it's like you're poor you're poor you're poor and then it's like suddenly it's like oh holy crap i'm not anymore and you know you have that moment and there's a subreddit called fat fire and they talk a lot about that and there's this guy who has a series of threads called confessions of a hecto millionaire and he's doing like eight parts and i linked to it in there and five here yeah and the mods have basically um approved it so basically the mods have like this guy dm'd him dm'd his accountants or account information or something so they like verified that he's uh as wealthy as he is but basically in the beginning uh thread he says um you know i'm worth north of 100 million dollars i got wealthy originally because i was an employee at a tech company that made me 30 million dollars and that was like 15 years ago and then i invested in this and then i did this and then i did this and i'm going to answer a lot of the questions that i think a lot of people ask here and the mods have approved that i am who i am and i'm going to tell you all about work and purpose my time and routine why i keep a low profile how relationships are complicated what i spend on a monthly basis what my investment in portfolio management is and it's incredibly fascinating i love this stuff where you get behind the scenes of people you normally never have access to and so it's a great series it's a great thread uh it's awesome awesome i love it great find um okay let's do some more so uh what do i want to do okay let me do um uh let me do it you want me to do a quick one while you're thinking do it do a quick one okay and i can keep right on so you just let me know so all right this is a little black hat here but i'm gonna tell you so there's this company called i think it's made by the same company it's called web archive it's the greatest thing ever i love web archive and they have got this side project called archive today so archive dot today have you ever seen this yes i have seen this it is awesome so if you ever want to read so there's a bunch of products out there on how to read articles that are paywalled or behind some type of like thing that you can't see them um so there's um outline.com which is kind of cool there's this other one that's called um 12 foot and and yeah it's called 12-foot ladder and so it basically says show me attendance over the paywall yeah so listen to the tagline show me a 10-foot paywall i'll show you a 12-foot ladder brilliant right genius brilliant and it doesn't work all the time working very well that's the problem with 12 foot yes yeah archive today works i've never used it and it not work and so if you ever want to read something and you don't feel like paying the paper like you just want to read like uh article and not all like pay for it archive today is the greatest thing i've ever seen yeah and the internet archive is just like a treasure right like it's a non-profit thing it's a great way to go look up what did the original version of the airbnb website look like you can go to the wayback machine which is something they've created and you can type in airbnb.com you can go back and you can see oh wow it used to be called air bed and breakfast and it was like catered toward conferences because that's how they initially got their start and blah blah blah so you know the internet archive which is the nonprofit behind it is amazing they actually bought our friend's company they bought xavier's uh book company as well because they're going to like scan all the books and make them available for people and things like that so they just it's it's amazing you know they're based in inner sunset right where my office was that's right that's right um okay let's do some more uh okay so i basically made a pretty big and i think at the at the risk of us sounding like kind of like overly obsessed with fitness which is like ironic because at least at least you're ripped so i think you could get away with being obsessed with fitness i'm not ripped yet so it's like a little bit it's a little bit weird when i talk too much about it but you're pretty big investment in this because and your and your improvement has been massive i basically when i was how much did you weigh when we first started filming do you know i have no idea but i basically gained like 40 or 50 pounds over the course of like my last startup and like never lost it so you think you weighed i used to do like 250. not 250. i think the most everywhere was 225. and i don't even weigh much less than that now but it's a different weight it's yeah it's like muscle versus fat it's like converting right so um so yeah i basically you know ballooned up again you know i used to be whatever 175 or whatever and then all of a sudden i'm 225 and felt really bad and you know it's not healthy it doesn't look good all this stuff i would when i would see a photo of myself i'd think that's a bad photo of myself and after three years i'm like hey how come all the photos are just bad photos of me oh wait maybe i'm like actually just like massively out of shape here so i invested in basically three or four things now that have paid off and i'll tell you one that i don't think paid off so um so i think fitness takes a couple things uh at least for me and that's uh time so i was like okay what are some things that i if if going to the gym is taking too much time what's a way that i can hack that so first of all i built a home gym so there's no going anywhere but even me you could put a a peloton right next to me that doesn't mean i'm gonna ride it you can put my foot in the straps it doesn't mean i'm gonna push like there was many reasons for many years that i didn't exercise regularly and so one was just bringing the gym home then i got a trainer because i said well if some dude shows up i'm not just gonna ignore him like i'm clearly gonna like do the workout i think that's the biggest thing that made a difference i like i i have a friend who is um who who is a wealthy guy and he was like hey can you tell me what to do and i'm like no man get a coach for like 250 bucks a month and they'll tell you what to do and you don't think you just do what they say and he was like that's really expensive i'm like dog you live in a four million dollar house like why do you like your your body's your house and you're not going to spend 300 or something to fix it yeah that's wild um my dad does that my dad's like oh you spend on this personal trainer five days a week like that's crazy uh i have this trainer i found in india he just does it on zoom and he's only four dollars an hour i was like four dollars an hour he's like yeah he wanted six but i got him down to four he was so proud and i was like oh that's i mean that's amazing okay is it such an indian thing he's like yeah he's really good he's really fit no no i was like no he's good for you he's like oh well i you know i don't really do it like you know it's he's like it's only four bucks so i don't even mind if i skip it i was like exactly like you literally don't do it it's not working for you you're not exercising regularly you're not getting in better shape so how is it really that good uh so anyways i invested a bunch of stuff and i took an approach which was like i wanted to leave myself no outs so i took a like burn the boat strategy so first i talked about it publicly and i talked about it publicly because if i talk about it publicly i'm gonna be humiliated if uh you know i'd feel embarrassed if i talk about this and i don't do it i don't back it up same thing i did i think i vouched for that i made it super convenient so i did home gym and i brought i had a trainer come to my house i paid the extra to make sure that that happened okay so now i'm doing the workouts okay cool now how do i do it where i actually enjoy it well i invested in making the space nice so like i went to your gym and i was like wow this feels great i need to get a floor like this and i bought these rubber tiles and i did all this stuff to make the gym feel better and i like got like the sound system i did a bunch of things to make the environment one where i would not dread going there i would enjoy i would want to go there and a bunch of things like that so those were all great investments i felt like great finds for me was like these little rubber tiles and it took time and energy to research these and i didn't outsource this i was like no i need to find the best one because i want this to feel a certain way and i i crafted that kind of vision for myself same thing i just got a sauna set it up yesterday did the first sauna session in it and i'm like this is amazing um it's sick right already already this is one of my great purchases of the year and i just have had it for one day i got this clear light sauna infrared sauna and i know that some people are like don't do infrared and some people are like buy this other brand instead whatever no clear light's good clear that's a great brand uh you know but some people are like you should do the dry sauna not the infrared from what i could tell um it's totally fine and it's uh importantly it fit into my life whereas the other one would have required like a whole bunch of like waiting for like a bigger space and electrical and all this changes to be made in order to work as long as it can get hot enough it's good yeah exactly so those have been for me the best one now here's the worst the worst buys the worst things i did i anything that i attached to my wrist has just failed so um i bought an apple watch um lost it got stolen slash watched i don't know what happened it was at the office and it was gone um second one uh bought a fitbit lost it whoop band have it battery's dead don't charge it regularly enough for it to be useful um so everything i've tried that's like a fitness tracker that is like a wearable device it doesn't work for me because i'm too disorganized and lose [ __ ] and don't keep things charged and ready for the morning and then charge it for sleep i had an ura ring i lost that too uh i have i have failed on like five wearables this year so i got same count myself out on that do you wear a wedding ring i lost my wedding ring as well so that's the same you know for bonus points dude that's why i wear these like uh 20 rubber ones yeah mine was only a 60 wedding ring anyways so i didn't feel i mean the sentimental loss yeah but uh you know i kind of knew that hey i don't know if i'm a ring guy i never ring in my life yeah and sure enough just taking it on and off ended up i lost mine the first week so yeah i lost mine on my honeymoon the world's best husband all right okay let me give you a different one have here we go let's shift to media uh great podcasts articles youtube channels whatever that we really like i have a whole category called canceled comedians which is like there's a whole bunch of people that i love their content they're cancelled by you know society but i love they're still they're just as funny as they were before everybody found out that they like you know like to have sex with 18 year old girls or whatever like um so there's this guy crystalia who got canceled i don't know a year ago i found him really funny before i find him really funny now and he also has these little like almost like inspirational moments in between the comedy that i love there's this video he has called life rips have you heard this video no but i love him all he's saying is like uh you know this [ __ ] was happening in my day or whatever and he's like he has this phrase life rips which is like he's saying like life is awesome and he's like just remember he's like life rips and then he he he tells the story it's just he's a great storyteller amazing storyteller he tells a story about life rips it's a feel-good moment it's a reminder that actually yeah you're right instead of focusing on my problems all day let me just focus on the fact that life actually really freaking rips and um and then he brings that in he brings that as a call back into a bunch of other podcasts that he does where he'll tell a little story he's like you know this is a life rips moment and just that philosophy has like made me really happy he does this thing also where some he'll be recording the episode and you'll relate to this he's he's kind of like um i think a lot of great entrepreneurs and artists are this way where they're like sort of like perfectionists in a way like they want things to go well they want well well-made stuff and so let's say there's a technical problem where he's like um he's like let's pull up that clip and then like the computer crashes or like somebody walks by and unplugs his microphone like midway through or whatever like kicks out the power cord to the lamp and instead of in that moment getting mad he just has he just replaced it with this thing where he just goes yes the cord ripped out of the wall he'll just like he'll be like yes we can't find the file or he'll be like yes dude yes we absolutely can't show the thing i'm talking about yes nobody has any idea what i'm trying to say and he just like instead of being like oh no this sucks which is like such a pattern that we can fall into he just does this little yes thing and i kind of stole it in my daily life my wife hates it she thinks it's like very annoying that i do this like she doesn't understand what i'm doing she doesn't know the reference not she will but it really she doesn't list the podcast either so she still probably won't but it's such a hack dude it's such a hack to just instead of just letting this little inconvenience this little thing that went wrong f up your mood just like rewire the response to something that's almost iron it's like sarcastic but it actually becomes real by the time you do it jocko who's this guy who goes on joe rogan he does the same thing he's just like it's crazy i don't know maybe sealed type dude super hardcore and his whole thing is around like you know pain is good and so like he'll be like um you know oh you got shin splints good like just running i love that it gets me fired up he'll be like you know oh you know your uber ride didn't show up good time to have a hike it's like you know he replaces of uh that sucks yeah good time to time to get tough or good good gotta go earn more money lost all mine like you know whatever it's like almost comedic how like how extreme he is with it but not gonna lie this [ __ ] actually works and so that's my that's my content recommendation do you have um i've got a all right i've got a bunch but do you have a car any type of cardio machine at your house a treadmill yeah um and a rubber all right yeah you do have a rower i have like a light you have like a rower that makes you feel like you're on the swiss canal or whatever i have like a rinky dink you know 120 costco rover all right i don't think you're going to want to do this then but i was going to say tomorrow so i've been doing i'll do it on my shipping i've been doing these things where like i'm like all right everyone this sunday 60 minute row poster results such a impressive fitness influencer move motivating do you have a but you don't have a bike do you have a bike i have a bicycle not like a not a spin bike i have a cab it might be easier if you do in the back so i'm gonna get up early tomorrow like 7 30 or maybe seven and i'll get this thing done and you just post your results and be like i just and so i tweeted out i go tomorrow it's a 90 minute day we gotta because and people are like isn't that boring and i'm like yes that is the point we should go through pain tomorrow before we get thankful right so if you want to do it with me uh do a 90 minute any type of 90 minute steady cardio um good i don't think you know when i watch my kids well well that's why you gotta get up really early to do it you gotta like go through hard uh some hardships i don't think you're gonna be able to run for 90 minutes but even like a brisk walk honestly for 90 could work but just like as long as your heart rate's like 140 140-ish um all right let me let me let me let me tell you uh five or four i'm going to go fast on some bits of media the first this happened earlier this year there's this amazing video of rose nambiunis this awesome ufc fighter but the reason she's interesting is she's like really quiet and introspective and seems like a sweetheart not like a fighter and there's this amazing video of her about to fight this badass woman from china who just looks like the terminator and she's repeating to herself i'm the best i'm the best i'm the best and when i first saw that i teared up it's the greatest it pumps me up it's amazing the second thing primitive technology by the way can i just give a recommendation there for people who don't follow the ufc they're going to watch this thing back whatever uh you know if even if they went and watched it it wouldn't have the same emotional resonance it resonated for you because you know how much of a terminator that other girl is you know rose's backstory and she struggles with anxiety she's not a bravado type of person so for her to say i'm the best it's not bravado and trash talk it's literally self-talk so she you know can perform her best and not let anxiety get the best of her so you know the backstory but i think everybody should have these go-to's these this stash of like inspiring moments that you were there for that you know the context you know the backstory and then you could just put them it's like that flooding thing i was talking about earlier you can just go back to it and you can instantly get that feeling um and you should just have a well of these which i like i i think that people should know that i mean like successful people i don't know if people consider me successful or not but i know that like way more successful people than i do this but i rely on like like i'll like read a book about someone who i admire and i'm like how would this person react to this situation totally like i i do that all the time or i'm like sometimes i'll even do it with like ufc fighters i'm like this guy just got punched in the face and he got up like i can do it um so i like that rose number units thing the second thing is primitive technology have you heard of primitive technology no what's that click the link it's in there so this guy has 10 million subscribers on youtube in his videos of which there are how many are there maybe we've talked about this guy he's like caveman yeah there's maybe only 20 videos and his very first video has 31 million views it was six years ago and it's him not talking not saying a word he's in the woods and he's building a hut and eventually it works out to build like a proper house and he does it without saying a word and he does it with only using things that he finds in the woods no power tools no nothing he builds a kiln he builds a tiled roof i'm on that video it starts and she's just pan the camera is just planning at this just this spot on the ground in the middle of the forest it's clear like there's nothing here i'm going to build a little hut here click to the end click to the end he's doing that like a clay hut with a fireplace in there with a fireplace and a chimney yes and the whole video he doesn't say a single word all you do is he's literally his bare hands yes just building it and then he'll like make like a hammer out of like uh some he'll make rope and then he'll make a hammer out a rope and a stick or a a rock and a stick do you know this guy's backstory like this guy looks just like everybody i went to duke with like who is this guy and why does he tell us it's in australia i believe and he owns this land and so if you go to his about page he just it just says where is this and he goes queensland australia do you live in that wild i don't live in the wild but i love going out into the land i do these projects yeah and so he doesn't talk much he doesn't do anything his channel has gotten one billion views and all he's doing is building like dude there's another one i'm watching him make fire just with he's just rubbing his hands together like this with a stick in between he just made a fire while you were talking it's so relaxing it's so awesome i love it so do you i love to be honest do you actually want because i see this i'm like this is so cool and i like click through one and then i'll be like oh this is just something i'm gonna go tell other people about i don't i wouldn't never actually sit here and watch this for 30 minutes i've watched all of them do you have apple do you have apple tv uh no i don't but i have apple tv so my version of tv is youtube so first thing when i sit down the couch i go straight to youtube and i'll just watch like a 30 this 30 it's like this is like that tv show how stuff's built do you remember that yeah but you do it in the background or you actually just watch pay attention to him yeah maybe i'll like be talking to sarah or cooking yeah i'm like oh my god wait watch this look what he's doing yeah maybe it's in the background i mean do you i don't actually sit down and really watch tv unless it's a movie um or the challenge or the challenge okay so this is amazing okay primitive technology all right let me keep going let me keep going um i'm gonna roll okay the the third one how to be great just be good repeatedly this is an article by steph smith who works for me there's two reasons why i love this article the first that is one of the best headlines i've ever read yes it is a wonderful headline and she writes this article about how great things rarely uh are you like trying to be great it's more so just like being kind of good but doing it consistently and in my life i have found that with this podcast with a bunch of other stuff like i'm like i don't want to do this today it's like all right fine i'm going to do it anyway even though i know today i'm not going to do a good job of it i'm just going to get it done and she does a really good job of articulating why that works so i love that article um all right i'm gonna keep going um the the next one there's this guy who's got a youtube channel called more plates more dates yeah i watch this guy he is amazing he looks at pro athletes and actors and he and he's a i guess he's a i think he's a doctor i don't know what his background is he sounds like he knows what he's talking about and he tells you what steroids he thinks different people are on i watch season every time i do i regret so much i'm like what a waste of my life i just did um but i he comes up in my feed and i'm like oh i know that person yeah are they on steroids and then like 30 minutes later i'm like i cannot believe i've let this be in my brain for the last 30 minutes what a waste of my brain it's interesting though because they'll explain like the science behind it he's like you he's like a lot of people think that this athlete is doing epo you wouldn't do epo because the way that your body works is this this this and this and he like it so it's kind of interesting he goes but you would do hgh because the way hgh works is it's proven to do so it's like a science it's interesting all right and then but yeah there's a little bit of science it's gossip from a person who i believe is reputable uh not in having firsthand knowledge of the people but firsthand knowledge and doping and the final thing i found this book it has two reviews on amazon um only two reviews on amazon it's amazing and so apparently the in the for or in the forward they say that's one of the most popular books in russia but i i didn't know that and they translated it into english so these two journalists from the ussr in 1933 made a deal with the us government that they would let them come in and spend three months doing a road trip and so they saved up a little bit of money they came here and they bought a camper van and they spent three months traveling america talking to people with nothing to do really just all they just wanted to learn about of america and from an outside perspective they show what makes america special and it's incredibly fascinating because we take a lot of things for granted and they criticize america and this is in the 1930s so this is this point is particularly particularly true they criticize like our race relations and things like that this is like this is crazy how people treat each other but there is a lot of good including they say there's something about americans that i've never seen ever before which is they always think that they are going to overcome any adversity and they always are optimistic about like some situation and also oddly they're friends with their bosses so like they work together to achieve things and they don't like like their friend like you could be friends with your boss and you cannot hate them or want to rob from them right and people are and and it's a wonderful book it's written in the 30s it's awesome so that's my book oh it's called uh little golden america nice uh that's great you've read you had the whole thing i've yeah i'm finishing it up now and i actually posted a link on my twitter where it's free like a pdf uh okay cool i like that um okay i have a couple quick ones so a chrome extension that i'm liking a lot it's called everyday and it's basically a habit tracker so um so if you go to the website i think it's called everyday let me just find the everyday.app i think is the thing um and basically you just say what you want to do so you're like i wanna like for me for example i have morning routine i have clean lunch clean dinner um i have workout i have my uh gratitude thing and then that's it and so and then basically what it does is it just lets you create a streak so you just say yes i did it this day i uh i intentionally skipped it i'm allowed to skip it or i missed and it just keeps track of your streaks and it creates this awesome green grid of like as you do your habits you get this really satisfying completion of like your grid being green it just shows i'm doing the things i said i wanted to do which for me is and most people is all of the challenges all of the challenges not oh i just don't know what to do it's i'm not doing the [ __ ] i know i should do and um so this is just you know a great tool and i think it's great because it's chrome extension so it's in your face you don't have to remember to check it it's every time you open a new tab in your browser it's going to remind you oh yeah i could i knock that out right now you know yeah i could actually just do that right now and i can get it done um so it's a i actually have my own chrome extension and i've replaced it with this one that's how good it is so um you know this is one of my one of my favorites downloading it now okay let me give you a couple other things that i think are really cool you showed me this camo it's an app for your iphone now we spent a lot of money and time you may not be able to tell right now because we're both not in our main studio or i'm not in my main studio you're you're in a different spot i look good i don't know i don't know no i'm not traveling you've been traveling so yeah you know on different videos we have different level of quality or whatever but we did we both tried on our own and then we hired people to like hey uh how do people get that fancy ass blur and like super hd video it's so hard and they're like oh you got to buy this uh canon uh which one 50d 40d 60 70 which which d do i buy okay i'll get this one oh then i need like some kind of um cord or like a capture card or how am i gonna do that it's so much tripod paint a butt batteries oh but the battery's gonna die during the episode so you have to actually get a double battery or a dummy battery pain in the ass so and it's thousands of dollars for the camera itself was like 1500 or something like that so it's really expensive and you were like oh dude i'm just using this iphone app called camo that just you just download the app and then uh it just uses the native iphone like portrait mode to make your camera look good and you're like look i'm just using my phone i look just as good as you i was like yeah i'm using the 2000 thing and it's really hard to set up dude it's sick it's only 30 bucks and look i'm traveling and i just bring this with me because it's my phone i was like oh my god it's i think it's 40 or 50 bucks i don't know if this is it 30 maybe it's i don't remember i actually think in the new ios it's just this is just baked in actually i think they i don't think you even need this anymore um but for now and if i don't if i'm wrong about that ios you mean it's coming out soon like in the new ios there's gonna be part of the native camera so you don't need an app to do this i think but one coming out soon or one out now i don't know it's now soon something um something like that so but in the meantime this app camo is kind of amazing uh great business by whoever's doing this and amazing timing because the whole world went remote and everybody wants to look good so uh that's definitely one of the best products the analogy we made or someone made is having camo it's like in the 70s and 80s and 90s when it mattered that you wore a suit having a camo is like showing up in a meeting in a nice suit exactly exactly um so so i think that's a great uh product okay i'm gonna give you a youtube channel so you did more plates more dates um the binge i've been on is is like kind of embarrassing almost it's these old-school direct sales seminars so i'm like okay how do i um i don't know why i like this i'm not even doing anything that has direct sales like there's not a product i sell that's direct sales i'm not a salesman i've never been one uh but i'm just like fascinated with the art of persuasion and say which ones and so um so there's a couple that are really good last night like for example i fell asleep last night while listening to it if you just search tony robbins sales rare and it's like uh there's two there's one where he explains how he sold how he got his career started he doesn't talk about this much he got his career started selling audio cassettes like music music tapes to people um you know to to people and he'd do these like you know he'd go and he's like yeah like the way we would do it is a woman would reach out to the potential customer and they would say we'd love to have uh we'd love to give you a free gift and um we'd love to tell you a little bit about our company and it'd be a free gift he said yeah it's a free gift it's usually worth 100 um and we'd love to give it to you and you know feel if you'd meet with our person and then tony was that person and he would be like he would walk through the step-by-step thing and he'd be like i would say this and why am i saying that i'm saying that because blah blah blah here's the thing about how people buy he's like and he's got his whole philosophy and he even says in this thing he's like you know would i do this now no because i feel like it's a little too pushy and but i'm always the type where i wanna know what's the real potent [ __ ] that works i wanna know the borderline illegal version of sailing and persuasion and then it's up to me to decide am i going to keep the knob on level 12 or do i want to turn it down to nine but i don't want to look at this i don't want to be at level six because i was too afraid to ever find out what is what does maximum persuasion look like you know what is what's the channel called uh i don't i just look at the individual videos there's not any channels so like gary halpert rare or gary halpert 1980s or gary halpert original seminar tony robbins young tony robbins rare tony robbins original seminar tony robbins direct sales tony robbins infomercial and i'll go either i'll just find their material and i'll deconstruct it myself like what's working like we had craig clemons on and craig clemens comes on the podcast and he's a friend of ours and he's uh doesn't he he's a great person on the pod but he doesn't go first he doesn't talk a lot about his company so he's got gold and hippo they've sold like over you know i think he sold over a billion billion dollars worth of product in his lifetime uh and gold and hipaa will do you know over a hundred million dollars in sales but it's like hey what golden hippo is a holding company what are the companies underneath and he doesn't really like go list out the 13 companies or whatever however many there are underneath it um nobody really pushes him for that and he's kind of like at the made it stage now but his he got his start early on doing sales for a guy who's like a dating coach and it was like i bought that dude you're dating and like how to how to basically it's all different titles that all mean how to get laid and if it was a wife i was like how do you get the man of your dreams how to get a husband how to whatever and he taught and so i find these old interviews or old seminars he did with that guy eben pagan and i'll go watch those and i'll see oh interesting he's talking about this headline he wrote and why this headline is amazing why he thinks it worked and this other one and why it totally didn't work and what he learned from that and i just find these to be like it's like puppy chow to me it's just i i can't stop consuming it even though i really have no direct use for it uh i just love it so i'll tell you guys listening um gary halbert so gary halbert's this guy he died somewhat recently from just like a heart attack or something and he was an amazing copywriter and he might have died in prison or soon after he was in prison for a handful of years because he sold something ironically that's the guy i want to learn from yes and the world famous that's why you took it too far like wall street i'm gonna learn from him i'm not gonna take it as far but i wanna learn from that person i think he went to prison for mail fraud or something like that so basically people bought stuff and he just didn't fulfill it and so he was just like i sold it and i just lied and that's obviously wrong but you can learn a lot from him and he's got these amazing things called um the letters from boron they're boron letters sorry and they're all free so if you google gary halbert boron letters you can find them for free it's a series of letters that he wrote his son bond from prison and he teaches him everything he knows about life and selling yes and so like you can go and read it he wrote them all by hand because i was just so and you're going to read it you're like why would you why is this so good it's so good if you know why it's so good it's almost like that it's like it's no it's clearly good like you start you fall down like his slippery slope you're like why is this so interesting why do i want to keep reading this exactly you don't know it's not like like it's not a um it's what i'll call a door not a window so a window opportunity is one where you look right in and you could see what's in it for you and you're like oh okay like for example let's say you wanted to get better at copywriting the thing is not called how to get better at copywriting and he doesn't say here's five copywriting techniques no he actually writes these as letters to his son and then he just shows you great copywriting and then he sprinkles in lessons as he goes but it doesn't come to like letter five or whatever there's like it takes you you're just interested you're hooked and you don't know why and that's the technique and then you gotta like figure out why is this so damn good what is it about this writing style that's so slippery that i just can't get it's like a tick-tock feed i can't get out of it you know and so i would say it's like more like a door where you kind of got to go knock and take a leap of faith that there is something on the other side of this you can't see exactly what you're going to get until the door opens yeah this is a winner um all right well i think i think we just like laid out a ton of interesting stuff uh ben are you there and by the way we should put uh links to as much of these as we can in the show notes i'm also gonna send out a newsletter of just like summarizing these um just on like whatever my own like my weekly newsletter whatever seanprey.com and because i think these are

the only thing i think people love more than their kid or love as nearly as much as their kid is their dog and um and so i'm surprised that there's not a place like disneyland for dogs that is basically the happiest place on earth for dogs [Music] dude next thing is kind of weird let's see if it works yeah what's your prediction let's do it uh let's predict it now you think this goes anywhere you think it becomes worth something or no so the background here is our friend is this guy named nick huber who goes viral all the time for writing about like storage units uh self self he's a self storage guy on twitter his handle is sweaty startup i'm an investor in his so i'll disclose that i don't know what that means here but i'll we'll say it um he created he made this thread like as a joke or he made a joke about tomatoes i don't even remember the joke how he could grow tomatoes and sell them or something and people like made fun of them and it went crazy viral and then he created a tomato nft project called bromados as a joke but kind of not a joke do i think it's gonna go anywhere kind of like well executed where you're like this isn't a joke the art is amazing the art is great it's great in the sense that it's like well executed bad art like it's a tomato that's a bro that's a guy so uh do i think it's gonna go anywhere of course not no i don't think so do you there's a chance uh like i don't know if you saw that he uh he posted a tweet from this account that's called i think cosmo davichi or something like that did you see that tweet that he posted where somebody he's like oh this just got interesting and um that's that is one of the most popular nft curator accounts they own like tons of punks and board apes and whatever and it's supposed to be a snoop dogg snoop dogg is the one who uh i don't think it's him who writes the tweets cause it's like a totally different writing style but he says it's snoop dogg um snoop dogg says it's him and they funded it obviously with like millions of dollars worth of nft purchases and so i thought that was kind of interesting that he's got some um some you know some heavy hitters in this uh this nft world and a few collectors space together how did he do it so like he told me that i think there's like either one or two or three like there's like four thousand i don't remember some like single digit load usually it's ten thousand or eight thousand but uh it doesn't matter but let's just say ten thousand because that's what most of the projects are how do you literally make an image because like his images are all different is it like some code where you're like you have like 18 different features and it's and it swaps them yeah exactly so you have all these traits like hair eyes nose mouth body shirt pants whatever and then each one might have 10 variations 12 variations 25 variations so there might be 25 hairstyles and then you go through and you set you so you have an artist make 25 hairstyles and it's just the hair part and then they say you say the rarity you say okay this is the most rare hairstyle the golden mohawk i only want that to appear one percent of the time so you put that in all into a program and it spits out a collection of 10 000 variations 10 000 combinations of these things and with the rarity uh so that some of them have the super rare attributes and then some of them have very common attributes that's how all these work what program do you use for this i don't know what people use i think it's maybe just one smart contract or maybe there's a special app for this i'm not sure what what people use damn i mean that's crazy that's that's crazy to me but it's gotten so easy that like you know nick can take his tomato meme and get it done now he hired a good artist because the art he has is like actually like really good it's 3d art it's really really nice but you know you see a different um 10 000 art collection drop you know every four hours or something in the comments okay so like i bought one yesterday so if you go to openc dot io i saw this it's really it's funny like these are such a it's such degenerate gambling um but i saw this thing go if you see it on twitter early you should basically go mint the thing or buy the thing so i saw this thing called chain runners it took off uh right away i saw people i saw interesting people on twitter talking about it i think uh the first guy who really i i think i s the guy who kind of think kicked out kicked it off in the tech industry was the founder of figma who this guy's zoink um and so the founder of figma which is like a multi-billion dollar design company uh he is a big nft collector he he owned one of the most rare crypto punks so he changed his profile a picture to this or or like you know posted about it and immediately like i start i started seeing every vc doing it so i bought in and you know i made double my money in a day and you know you can get in and out of these things very quickly um there's another uh i'll tell you about another one of these this is kind of in the weeds so i almost regret doing this early on in the show but let's do it there's this thing called wolf game so go to wolf dot game and i think this is kind of a sign of something that's to come it's a little confusing when you when you first go to it i only understand let's say thirty percent of it right now but the part i understood made me think oh [ __ ] this is something new so what is this so crypto is now going into gaming and what does that mean that means like in the old way of gaming you would put like let's say a game like world of warcraft people who played world of warcraft would spend thousands of hours grinding that game playing that game leveling up their characters earning new stuff and they would get zero economic value for it so you would you would put you know thousands of hours in and you would get zero dollars in return but hey you got the shiny helmet and your character now says level 60 congratulations it was that was still good enough people did that people all around the world do that then games like fortnite come out fortnite says hey you can play this game it's about shooting each other but you can have your character have all these special eye special um costumes they do nothing for you in the game they're all it doesn't make your character any better but if you buy our in-game currency called v-bucks you can buy these special like capes and swords and helmets for your character all right great people spent billions of dollars on v-bucks um and and bought tons of stuff in the game and if they decide like many people who were 12 years old playing fortnite and dropped you know 180 in the game buying stuff now if they're tired of fortnight they want to go play a new game that that money is lost you cannot take your items to another game so why is crypto gaming going to be big it's going to be big because when you buy an item in a game you're going to own that item and then other games will allow you to bring that item in so it'll make it'll make it way more valuable to buy things in games because you're gonna be able to use them you're gonna be able to resell them later if you get tired of the game and somebody you want to sell it that doesn't exist today in most games and secondly you'll be able to take it with you to other games all right so now let me tell you what this wolf game thing is what a wolf game is is it's almost like a gambling system so you imagine uh if you go to the website it's like little pixelated art like 8-bit yeah it looks neat like it looks like kind of punk rock a little like i all this this whole this whole genre of people online it totally is like the freakers what was it called you know what i'm talking about like the um uh like the steampunk type of vibe yeah yeah that's definitely like this big overlap of like steampunk and crypto so here's how the game works in a very again i don't even understand the full game but here's how it worked when i when i went to it you could buy a sheep so let's say you buy a sheep if you if you stake the sheep in the in the barn meaning you put your sheep in the barn every day you're going to get every sheep produces 10 000 uh wool and um and so your sheep is kind of like working for you it's like farming wool for you okay and wool has some value well wall is like it's the in-game currency it's like v-bucks so so you buy a sheep the sheep produces wool for you okay that's interesting you could also buy a wolf if you buy a wolf or you own a wolf here's how a wolf works this is the story of the game the story of the game is if you put your sheep in the farm they're safe because the farmers have made a truce with the wolves to say do not attack uh the sheep in the in the farm and in exchange for the safety it's like a mafia in exchange for the safety you get 20 of the wool as a wolf as a bribe as the pace is so crazy if somebody ever takes their sheep out of the farm they can keep 100 of the wool for themselves but there's a random chance that the wolf will come eat your sheep and take all of the wool and maybe take your sheep or something like that and so the wolf would then get 100 there's a small chance that you might lose your freaking sheep and so you could play it safe and pay the tax or you can risk it for a bigger reward and you can lose your sheep and so the whole game is basically about owning these sheep owning these wolves and the like random chance the random probabilities of certain things happening and the whole time you're accumulating wool which has some has some value in the game right it's the it's the in-game currency and i thought this is very interesting it's kind of a stupid silly game but it's interesting because um it's a game that didn't just like add crypto at the end it kind of started with this like the game is designed around by this character the character earns you money by this other character that character steals money or collects attacks and it's basically a game that's made to make you money and i don't know if you know what's going on with axi infinity but this is like a yeah i mean the the the the infinity thing is like the biggest money maker in the world right now it seems yeah they've made like i don't know over 2 billion the game has made over two billion dollars in like a year and it's this new model called play to earn and play to earn basically just means normally when you played a game you played just for [ __ ] you know shits and giggles but now if you play and you do well in the game you actually are earning the in-game currency which is like could be cashed out at any time and so there are people we have a friend that has a team of people in the philippines just playing the game full-time he pays them a salary and they pay the game for him and they it's like a investment property they make back 25 percent yield on top of the salaries that he pays them he pays to play this game all day do i i think i can i i i can imagine it because um you know people will obviously see this so it's like kind of [ __ ] up uh i think a lot of people will have a bad reaction to that so i don't want to say their name because oh my god i didn't ask them in advance all right that's amazing do you want to um all right well so like right now i'm looking at a sheet and you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten things here honestly they all seem pretty good do you sort of like start banging through some stuff yeah let's do it uh your boy went to disneyland last week had a ton of time i had to skip one episode of the pod but that made me get exposed to a bunch of new ideas and then i got sick so i haven't been able to work i've just been sitting there you know doped up on benadryl so i got all kinds of of crazy ideas that i want to bounce off you the first one is about disneyland okay so i got this text from sean saying i'm at disneyland or no maybe there's a tweet it was a tweet i saw a tweet you go i'm at disneyland and all i want to do is land on dilf of disneyland dad i wanna dad i wanna f of disneyland yeah have you ever seen this instagram account dools of disneyland no but i understand it's basically just like hot dads that they take pictures of that are like happen to be in disneyland that day and they're always like doing something that's hot to the mom like oh he's you know wiping the daughter's mouth because you know he didn't just leave it dirty you know he's picking he's changing a diaper or whatever it's like that's what's hot uh that's awesome so that was my goal i did not make it on a different then pretty upset about it yeah you know i will recover um okay so disneyland is kind of amazing and when i was there i was pretty blown away and my wife was blown away so my wife doesn't really care about business you know she's interested in it but she's not like a nut about it like you or me even she like basically grabbed my arm halfway through the thing it was like this is amazing she was like i'm kind of blown away by this guy's entrepreneurship to create this place because disneyland is kind of a one-of-a-kind type of idea and it's meant to be you know the happiest place on earth and it really is for a lot of people when you're there uh you can really see um how happy people are and in doing research for this i went and watched this documentary about the starting of disneyland and in the comments or at the end of the video he goes that's what that's backstory of disneyland but it means something different to everybody in the comments say what it means to you and the youtube comments are like eulogies it's like essays about what disneyland means to these people it has like a huge emotional register all right so let me break make out some of the numbers so let's start with the numbers and then the backstory some of the numbers so disneyland does about 3.8 billion dollars a year of revenue every day about 50 000 people come to the park so you know just roughly speaking they make about just over 200 per guest per guest per year and that's that's not counting the hotels the flights and the and a bunch of the auxiliary stuff so a ticket into the park is like 120 bucks and then you spend like another hundred bucks on food and merch while you're there man i feel like it was a hundred dollars when i was a kid yeah actually it started so i went back i was like what was the initial price of this because disneyland prices have been inflating actually like crazy there's a chart showing inflation of disneyland and it's like just up and to the right disneyland started at three dollars and 25 cents to get in back when it when it launched in 1955 so you know the minimum wage back then was 75 cents and i think the average person's income was like four grand or something like that so you know everything has gone up um but now you know they basically have a off-peak peak time so if you go to peak time it's gonna be 200 something bucks normal is like 150 bucks and low is like 100 or something like that so um so what what happened so walt disney basically his story is kind of amazing so he he grows up and he he's actually from your your hometown i don't know if you know this you probably probably do but he's from missouri and i didn't know that apparently there's a place in missouri called electric park have you ever heard of this no because this is the inspiration for disneyland when he's eight years old he goes to this place called electric park and electric park was kind of known for two things one it was it was an amusement park and the second is it was really clean and that's like one of the biggest things about disneyland is disneyland is really clean so imagine having 50 000 guests over to your house but somehow everything stays really really clean um and that was like he's fanatical about this when he designed the park electric park in kansas city yeah i see it when he um when he designed the park he made it so that i think every 30 feet there's a trash can because he watched guests at amusement parks and he would see that if you if the trash can was further than 30 feet away or whatever they would just be like ah [ __ ] they would just leave it on the ground or throw it on the ground or whatever just dispose of it in a bad way but if there was a can within 30 feet they would like make the effort to go toss it and so he made it so that at any point and i tested this out when i was there i was i would often like check okay am i 30 feet within a trash can and sure enough like it's actually like legit there's always a trash can near you and this place is super clean so he goes to electric park and he wants to be a cartoonist he uh ends up working at an ad agency and then he creates his first business it's called laphograms and he's basically doing these like kind of like animated uh cards but you know a bad business deal leads it starts working but then he cuts a bad business deal where uh he's owed a bunch of money by one client and then they don't pay him and the business goes under and so he says okay let's go to hollywood and um and he tells his brother let's go to hollywood and let's create another business and so they go and they create disney brothers cartoon studio and this is where they create mickey mouse this is where they create snow white that's the first big hit so the company goes from like in debt or making no money to making millions of dollars off of snow white that was like the big win and so he's like okay this is kind of working and the business is doing all right it's not going gangbusters um but it's a float and he's working on his next story he's working on pinocchio he's working on a couple other stories and he's always had this crazy idea about amusement parks ever since electric park and he takes his daughter to the local merry-go-round and he's like ah this is like so boring like why isn't there something more grand than just this merry-go-round like my daughter loves this but like this is so boring for the parents and this is just one ride like what if i made a place that was um you know what if i made a place that was fun for both the parents and the kids to go to which is like a similar theme with all pixar movies and disney disney movies which is like the movie is enjoyable toy story is enjoyable to an adult and a kid it has like two layers to it both can enjoy a different piece of it and so he's like and so what how did they actually come about this how did they actually like figure out the idea so they started by doing research they went to every theme park they could find they went to the world's fair they went to a whole bunch of places getting inspiration and ideas and mesh and thinking about what is bad about this experience what can be made better so things being dirty blah blah blah and he's like okay um he starts thinking about the design of the place and electric park had this um train that went around the whole park and so if you go to disneyland that's still the thing there's right when you enter there's a train and the train will take you around the whole circumference of the park and he's like all right i'm gonna build i used to tell people one of these days i'm gonna build an amusement park and it is gonna be clean and he takes two guys off of pinocchio and he says hey listen um i want you guys to start uh start working on like secret project x and um he's like you know it's a shame that when people come to hollywood there's nothing to see here like people all around the world have heard of hollywood they come here there's the sign where it says hollywood and the letters on the hill but there's nowhere to see hollywood hollywood i'm i'm so out of it is disneyland in l.a it's in l.a yeah oh it's in anaheim okay i for some reason i thought it was in florida that's disney world got it dude you're like not in disney you're not in the busy world at all okay um so he i mean i know a little bit but come on disney world at disneyland that's an easy confuse no no that's that's fair that's fair um so he disneyland came first so he basically is like uh guys if anybody came to even see our animation studio they just see a bunch of dudes hunched over over drawings it's not they're not very impressive let's build something amazing in hollywood and the guys get super excited they start doing research but then reality hits they have to they're working on pinocchio they have to ship it they're working on fantasia they got to ship it then world war ii happens so all of the all of world war ii happens and then he comes back because he hires this guy kimball to work in his studio and kimball's like this junior kind of animator guy and kimball invites all the co-workers over to his house for like a barbecue or a birthday party or something like that and in the back in the backyard of his house he's like oh by the way you guys don't know this but my hobby is i build these little trains almost like the steamboat style train like it's like a life-size thing it was very small uh it's like you know one one uh like whatever one link of a train basically have you have you this guy's name is ward kimball if you google him he looks like a cartoon and you can see his his train too so walt goes to this thing he's blown away he's seeing the train up close and he's like dude ward built this thing okay the whole mickey he says he comes back to the office he sends a memo he says mickey mouse park is back on and he tells the shareholders shareholders say don't do it movie studio is already on on edge this sounds like a big distraction it's against the charter of the company we don't want you doing this he says okay um no problem i understand i'll create a new company so he just creates another company to create the park he's like i'm still gonna do this but if you don't want in i'll do this myself and and he calls it like a red law or whatever something like that which is like you know uh walter backwards uh is kind of the name where he names it he starts working on it and so he's like all right how do i fund this thing he thinks it's gonna take five million dollars to build disneyland and in actuality it ends up taking 17 million dollars to do it and so he's like all right how do i fund this he uh he takes his uh his life insurance policy and he takes a big loan against that that gives him like you know 100 grand or so to go do this then he sells a house that he had in palm springs so that's like the next seed money that he goes through that pretty quickly then he goes all right i need some bigger money how do i get millions of dollars for this okay he goes to abc the tv network and he says hey abc you're struggling right now you don't have much tv programming i will create this this program called like whatever like the wonderful world of disney or something like that i'll create a tv show for you that'll air every sunday if you invest in my park idea so disney basically puts down half a million dollars plus another about six and a half of loans and bonds and they own 34 of disneyland and so that's how he got the next seven million bucks and then he did the same thing with two other companies and then he sold some sponsorships he he like accumulates together the 17 million dollars hustled his way he hustled his way to doing it the other thing that he did was he was like all right um you know this this thing works because um he's like i gotta hi i gotta have like the uh the rides work automatically and so he created this thing where if you go to disneyland now you sit in a ride and you go and it's sort of like a it's like a stage play that plays out but it's all synchronized when your little like roller coaster cart enters this room the lights go on the character makes a sound and then when you leave the room it all folds back into its thing and that's called animatronics and so basically audio animatronics was like the thing he wanted to do which was like he wanted live animals but it's too much work so instead of live animals he created these robotic animals and he said i'm going to synchronize the movements to music on a loop and there's this one guy who was just working on only this and he was kind of in front of a green screen trying to make this like puppet do this thing synchronized to music and eventually they finally figured it out and that was like the big breakthrough so okay let me fast forward a little bit they open the park they build the whole thing in less than one year they open the park and he only invited like 1500 people to it or something like that like invite only launch but somebody counterfeited the tickets and so double the number of people showed up with counterfeit tickets on day one because double the number of people showed up uh everything breaks the plumbing breaks because there's too many people using water in the park more than the load was able to handle so he the they come to him their wall we got a problem the plumbing is broken you have to make a choice toilets or water fountains he's like toilets for sure and so he uh there's no water there's no drinking water that day the asphalt was still so freshly poured that like women's high heels was getting stuck in the cement because it was like caving in it was basically a giant disaster and he does some pr he basically says look um we have you know we had to work out the kinks give me a month and basically they give me they'll give me some time and this thing will be smooth and sure enough within a month the the baby is you know humming and in seven weeks he does a million visitors so it was kind of an immediate hit once he did it because it was such a famous idea it was disney right off the bat or at this air at this point how famous were they they were like i mean they were a big deal they weren't like semi-famous they hadn't had like i mean nowhere near what they are now but like they were semi-famous really the abc show which he was doing while he was building the park was almost like the hype video for the for the park launch was he just grinding the whole time yeah a crazy amount of work and so he he creates this thing and you know it's basically the sixth or seventh most visited tourist destination in the world now and um you know it's kind of this crazy place i think which is kind of shocking i think disney or the theme park division prior to covid was the most profitable part of the company wasn't it except for well not profitable because they had a lot of expenses but in terms of gross profit yes because they had a lot of revenue and a lot of expenses but now disney plus is like the bigger thing because disney plus is like pure profit business basically took all that ip that people loved and created a streaming service but before that before covid before plus i like disneyland it wasn't it wasn't a project it was a like a major a value creation a lot of value was created there i wanted to know is this uh is this a loss leader or is this a um a cash cow and it's it's more like a cash out it's hard to tell because every company's like accounting makes everything look like it's like losing money you know what i mean like accounting can make something look amazing or terrible regardless of it but you know the parks division parks and resorts was doing you know billions like 30 billion dollars a year or something crazy like that so it was you know obviously became a smash success when he wanted to do disney world in florida he creates five stealth companies because he's like disney was a hit he's like i'm looking for the second location if anybody finds out where i'm looking the price will go up so he creates five shell companies he starts buying up land in florida sure enough it leaks out the day after it leaks the price per i think acre went from like a hundred and eighty dollars an acre to eighteen thousand dollars an acre he couldn't buy anymore once the news leaked and uh and you know he had this like kind of like inspiring vision so he's like disneyland i want this to be the happiest place on earth and he's like i want people to have no problem no problems with their hair i want this to be an escape from your problems you know you know um in real life and disney world he's like he created this thing called epcot which uh i don't know if you've ever heard of epcot but epcot is basically a standalone government agency no it does sound like it though epcot is like right next to disney world it's this huge dome looking thing and it stands for it's an experimental what is it it's experimental prototype community of the future uh something like that of tomorrow and that's what it stands for um and so what he did was epcot is basically like it takes the cutting edge of what the future looks like and it creates like a mini simulation of the future so you can go and see the latest what the what the future is going to look like in terms of technology i've been once when i was a kid yeah it's kind of amazing and so um and he's like you know but all of these projects he i'll read you some of the quotes that i thought was pretty great for him as like an entrepreneur he goes um i want this to be the happiest place on earth i want compared to kids have fun together he goes um when it came to epcot he's saying uh where is it he goes i want this to be a living blueprint of tomorrow i want this to be an always evolving thing epcot is never going to finish because tomorrow will always be different than today uh disneyland itself will never be completed it will go it will go on as long as there is imagination left in the world and so since then you know they built the park for 17 million but obviously they pour in like hundreds of millions of dollars every year to upgrading the parks and changing the the rides and the themes and all that stuff um in order to kind of continuously evolving so that's kind of amazing i originally i i brought up six flags to you a while ago do you remember when i brought that up yeah so the guy who invented i don't know if he invented but he he inspired me and he kind of invented the genre a little bit of email newsletters it's this guy named bob pittman and he had this accelerator called the pilot group and basically he funded a bunch of entrepreneurs and he taught him like he's like here's what i think you should do and uh like five or six relatively big name companies came out of it like purewow daily candy thrillist which is a multi-billion dollar media company called group nine and like two or three others that you someone here would recognize i forget what they're called and he did this newsletter thing and he like made it huge prior to that he was the ceo of six flags oh really yeah which is kind of interesting and before that he invented or he was like on the founding team for mtv he helped he was the first ceo and president of mtv and his uh big thing was being prior to starting the newsletter businesses he was the ceo of century 21 real estate which is a multi-billion dollar thing clear channel outdoor uh he was the ceo for a minute of aol and then he was the ceo of six flags it was a killer company when he ran it and i think pre-pandemic they they raised uh they had too much debt but it was making good money so these companies i think are pretty badass actually and they're going to roar back right now if you started working on this two years ago you'd be in an awesome position right um and so i wanted to talk about some of the like kind of spin-off ideas that's you know that's that's the backstory of disney but when i'm there i'm thinking how could this be better and uh so i have one one tip for disney disneyland itself which is obviously the absolute worst part the only part that takes away your happiness at disneyland is waiting in lines so the average ride you know you're waiting 30 minutes to 45 minutes just to ride this ride for 90 seconds and uh especially if you're waiting with like a little kid the kids don't understand that you're waiting they're like i want to go now i want it my turn like my daughter just it's my turn now it's blushy's turn now let's go and i was like well they do kind of nothing to make the line experience better well don't they have a fast pass that everyone buys they used to and they got rid of it because a bunch of reasons i think a everyone was buying it so it became less useful that b um they got a bunch of [ __ ] for it like oh you know kind of elitist it's elitist exactly so they had to kind of back off that so they do have this thing called the vip tour that you can pay for that basically takes you to the front of line of everything but you have to pay it's what is it it's basically you pay six to ten grand a day for a group of up to ten people um and so if you're willing to drop you know a thousand dollars per person uh you can do you probably just feel like a huge douche though like doing that totally totally uh yeah because you're just looking at a bunch of sweaty crying babies yeah like get out of the way plebes yeah exactly and so uh but i gotta you know probably just feel good so i think the thing that they that disneyland needs the site so there's psychology that's associated with this there was this um ted talk that got popular back in the day and i don't really remember it exactly i'm kind of gonna butcher it but this guy was like there was this problem which was like with a subway station or train station and everybody was so annoyed uh with like i guess like uh how long the train took to get from one place to another they people hated writing the driving train so they they commissioned this like bounty they said requests for proposals um you know guests are not happy because the trains are running too slowly and most people the common way to solve this was engineers are like we have to do all these we have to do this massive engineering overhaul to make the train go 20 faster 30 faster it's just require billions of dollars and the transactions shut down for two years while we rebuild the train with this new infrastructure that's going to be faster and then one guy was like a psychologist and he was like why don't we just wait make the ride more pleasant so that you don't feel the the slowness of time he's like you don't have any food carts on the train like there should be a food trolley that's walking through the train for pretty cheap like stacks and he's like the person will see the trolley then they'll the focus will go away from just waiting for the train to arrive to at their destination to like waiting for the trolley to get to them and then they'll buy i believe and they'll be eating the snack and like that was uh like two a two dollar solution that would that actually like improve the writer experience by like you know whatever someone amazing about percent i think it's rory sutherland who created this that's roy sutherland i if i remember correctly yeah that's right all right i knew i recognized this guy he was so he's a marketing agency guy and he was the boss of ogilvy uh one of the big uh advertising firms and their whole shtick is just like perception and i think the the talk is all on perception and and this exists everywhere so like instagram i remember when they first came out one of the things that was a magical experience about instagram was aside from the photo filters was that when you would take a photo and you'd say post it would like instantly load and post and people were like how did you do this like that's incredible and um you know back then iphones were so bad and the connections were so poor that it would take like multiple minutes to upload a single photo onto the internet and these guys are doing it in a few seconds they weren't probably actually uploading it well there's no no they weren't they actually were so first he was like dude why don't we just like say it's done and then it'll happen in the background and like whatever but people would go check and they say oh it's not posted here this app doesn't work so what they did was they realized oh every what everybody does is they wait till the caption's done to start uploading they may tell you the photo the filter the caption until they start uploading the photo what they did was they separated and they would do it all on one screen so what instagram did was they would let you take the photo and filter it and then they would say next next you would hit a button and then you'd start to write your caption and they knew people take like two minutes to write their caption like they're trying to think of what to say and during that two minutes they would just upload the image in the background so the image was already uploaded back then like during that wait time um and so they instead of making you wait they did it while you were already doing something else and that was like a big thing so this perception stuff actually does have an impact on products that's what i think disneyland needs to do i think another example of that is when uber first came out and maybe they still have this when you pull up your phone or when you used to pull up your phone they would show you all of the cars in your area crawling around the map oh yeah they're so close to you and i think that was faked actually and it was fake it wasn't real yeah and it wasn't real but it would make you feel like they're everywhere and if you just click it now it's about to be here and sometimes i don't remember why if it was random you would open it up and there'd be no cars around you're like oh f that i'm gonna go to lyft but it was fake and this idea there's this great book called the design of everyday things by don norman and it's a famous famous book and in one of the principles of great design is you need a feedback loop for example if you were to click a button on your computer like a submit button and it wouldn't tell you it was submitted or something like that or when you close a door you don't hear a click that lack of that lack of feedback it it it's annoying it's disturbing it bothers you and so this is kind of in line a little bit with that yeah totally um and so i think what disneyland needs to do is they need line entertainment they need something to happen in the line to keep you occupied they need to extend the ride essentially into the line there needs to be things built into the line little characters that come out things that drop from the ceiling you know little magical snowflakes that fly out every two minutes uh you know candy that gets thrown into the crowd whatever something needs to happen in the line that's my my one tip for disneyland okay besides that i was thinking why aren't there more of these so disney was built in 1955 and you have six flags you have like kind of like smaller adventure parks but what are the other opportunities here so i think if you take the elements of it you have a target which is let's say a kids you have ip that they love so you know they're excited to go see mickey mouse and lion king and aladdin and buzz lightyear from toy story and all these characters that they've seen in the movies they get to see them in real life that's the big thing and um and then you have rides and you have food and you have also you have parades and amusement like entertainment that way so what other niches are like do you think that there's other business opportunities that somebody who is like a walt disney somebody who is a creative creative mind could go build today what do you think is out there yeah i i think there's many and i think that we've actually talked about a few so the the first one which people laughed at but it's kind of amazing was the museum of ice cream and i i thought that was amazing another one is meow wolf meow wolf is this business that has locations in arizona new mexico and vegas i think i don't remember where else supposedly they do north of 100 million in sales and it's basically like in it's like if circus soleil was a museum and you could walk around and like touch different art and it's kind of like all in your face and it's kind of interesting i think you can do that um i think that there's one thing that i think is kind of amazing that's out right now which is it's called the van gogh experience and so i like van gogh stuff my wife is like a huge into that and so we pay money and we go to the van gogh experience and so i i do think that there's like little niche things uh that you can do um related to this um i think that like what i would do is i would look at what the most popular exhibits of science museums and art museums are and i would make something special out of it for example do you remember like 15 years ago the body uh what was it called um bodies bodies i think that's all it was that was it was like a huge hit success and you'd go to all the science centers or whatever they're called science museums throughout the country and they have like real life bodies that you can that like cadavers that were donated and they dissected them and they tell you how the inside of the potty works that i mean i don't know if that's a main stay somewhere but like that's a good example what i would do is i would look at all the science museum and all the art museum exhibits that are long the longest lasting as well as all the uh broadway stuff that's the longest lasting and i'd be like all right well those are all hits like why are they hits right right things that i p that people love yeah i think if you i think i think that the trick here is unbundling so i don't think you want to make the full theme park i think you want to unbundle components and either just remix those or just do only that thing so i'll give you some of the ideas that i had uh while i was waiting in line for 45 minutes for a ride i came up with all these are the ideas i came up with while i was sitting in line so the first one was target market um the only thing i think people love more than their love as nearly as much as their kid is their dog and um and so i'm surprised that there's not a place like disneyland for dogs that is basically the happiest place on earth for dogs i would take my dog there if i could just have give my dog like an amazing day um i would do it uh you know i don't know about you you're a dog guy too i don't know if you have that that pull ideally it'd be local not like you know got to fly to l.a to go do this so maybe it's maybe it's more like a traveling circus but why is there not just an incredible set of experiences that uh dogs love you know dogs have a blast in and you can just see your dog doing it and take pictures of them and give them give them what they deserve what do you think dude it sounds like an insurance nightmare any more than an amusement park with like yes on roller coasters yes so much worse you have a foo-foo dog that is like won't hurt anyone i've got like a 80-pound pit bull who's well-behaved but if he ever wanted to hurt something he'd kill it and it sounds like it'd be so challenging to like i mean i would be stressed out about that constantly okay fair enough we got some liability concerns all right what else uh we've talked before that ip how do you get great ip so disney obviously used the disney portfolio of ip mickey mouse goofy donald duck whatever what are the one of the new forms of ip so i think if you ever use youtube for kids you're like coco melon blippi these are characters that they watch just as you know just as much as like you know disney movies because um so they're on youtube they're invented by like kind of individual people there and then they got all rolled up by this thing called moonbug and moonbug owns a bunch of this stuff and then moonbug got rolled up by that thing that kevin mayer is doing billions i think he was the former ceo of disney then he partnered with blackstone and blackstone gave him two billion dollars or something like that to go buy all this ip so he bought reese witherspoon's movie studio for 800 million he bought coke melon he bought blippi he bought about about all these different you know different uh forms of ip so i think that youtube channels have iep that people care about that is uh if you if you combine them all together and there was you know the way that disney does it's like there's different areas of the park for each world each character theme i think you could do it that way dude yeah i'm on board with this keep going religion is another one so um isn't isn't there doesn't that exist isn't there like a like a muslim version of this never heard of it i thought that there was but uh in the south uh they have their maybe it's christian there's like a christian theme park have you not heard of this it's like a bible i think it's like a bible theme park there is uh it's in the yes it's like a christian i i don't the holy land experience is one of them and then there's a holy land and then there's ark encounter with like a real-life size noah's ark but there is this thing called a holy land experience it's based out of orlando florida yeah okay i don't know if that does well or not but i could see a religious themed theme park doing well right then the merry-go-round that's mary you know you got g you got jesus jesus's uh you know jumping right whatever you know you you just go totally totally uh fun with religion yeah okay so it's a non-profit so you could actually go and look at all their expenses and revenue it looks like it brings in uh 10 million a year in ticket sales yeah i think it could do i think you could do a lot better than that them setting it up as a non-profit tells me that you know their ambition is probably not not not huge there with it so i think you could do that with any different religion um okay what else the other side of it is like you unbundle parts of the experience so maybe the parade is amazing and like you know the parade is is one of the experiences that you could just offer individually or maybe like museum of ice cream i think that's a good example is it takes the go take cute photos in front of all these different backdrops and with you in some costume i think it unbundled that and it just offered that there's no roller coasters it's just a photo part and so i think there's a whole bunch of things here and i think this is going to get bigger because as the world gets increasingly digital there's going to be this demand for real world experiences but the real world experiences can't be something that i could do digitally just as well it has to be unique and it has to be sort of exhilarating in a way that is a it's a reason to get out of the home it's a reason to get away from a screen and so things like we've talked about in fitness like tough mudder or spartan race things that are like you know photo things like a museum of ice cream and now i think that theme parks are another one where there's a big opportunity to do this well so i used to work for that tv show i've talked about a bunch american pickers and we had this store and it was in nashville it was a really small store maybe 4 000 square feet or less it wasn't very big at all and people complain all the time like oh i thought it was going to be huge it was tiny and people would come from all over the world australia europe all over the south i mean people from the south love this crap and they would come and they would it was free to come and they would just want to look at all the items that they'd seen on tv and i remember correctly on and this was in 2010-ish when a good day we would sell 30k in t-shirts and mugs just at that store we would crush it just off that store if i was a mr beast or someone who wanted to partner with mr beast or there's a bunch of these youtubers they do a lot of interesting things there's this one guy i think his name is petcock i forget his exact name he's this older guy on youtube with 20 or 15 million subscribers and he shoots every gun so like any type of gun you can imagine he has like shot it like an old revolutionary gun or some like weird experimental shotgun and it's got a huge following but he's in the middle of like he owns like a plot of land where it's like it's like you know you could do anything you want same with there's a couple other guys there's another youtuber named roman who's got uh he's based out of ohio he's got this massive plot of land and he's always like inventing all these weird go-karts and [ __ ] or mr beast always does this weird like epic stuff if i was a youtuber i think you could create like these epic experiences do you remember that thing called do you remember woodward no what is that so woodward was this it started out i think in pennsylvania and it was called woodward camp and it was a sleep away summer camp in woodward pa and it was a huge outdoor skate park with bunk beds and stuff and as a kid you would pay two or three i don't remember thousands of dollars it was expensive enough that like my parents never would have done it and it's in this rural area and they uh you pay all this money to go to this like sleep away camp and you skateboard and bmx and do all this like crazy [ __ ] as a kid that you like think that like that you see on rocket power or whatever and it crushed and it eventually was sold to powder uh or what is it called powder it's like the largest um or vail resorts one of those it's like the largest private equity land owning and resort companies in the world and they eventually bought it for a lot of money and so anyway i think i think there is a lot of movement here you saying the mr beast thing just reminded me um have you did i talk about this movie this documentary boys state on here did i talk about this no have you have you watched this thing no boys boys state unbelievable documentary gotta watch it it's uh it's on um if it's on hulu or apple tv plus or something like that i got right you got recommended to me i watched it i loved it so what boys state is it's a camp it's a one-week camp i think in texas and it's austin it simulates texas politics so you get there and uh it's like on day one you get divided into like kind of their version of the democrats and republicans it's like you know you join team blue or team rent and immediately they become like super [ __ ] tribal and like hate the other side which is hilarious because they just like it's arbitrary it's completely arbitrary so what this documentary is is it follows one session of boys state uh hold on one second if you and you could i'm actually looking at the notable alumni from uh it's like everyone uh like so i mean there's like hundreds of famous people who went famous politicians who went to it yeah exactly so you go there and you you get divided up so you're on the blue or the red team democrats republicans they call it something else i forget and then um the documentary follows what happens that week which is you uh you run the party basically nominates people so you can say i want to be governor i want to be treasury i want to be you know vice governor or whatever the whatever the offices are so like there's a handful of roles you first um you first you know debate or you nominate yourself and then you give a speech debate in your party to be the nominee for governor and then you run against uh the other the other side and uh and so it's it's kind of an amazing documentary because it just shows how instantaneously these games these politics games just completely infect your brain and change the way you act and like these kids who are like i don't know how old they are they seem like they're in like 8th grade or so i could be wrong on that but they're like they're acting just like a politician acts they're like making promises they're talking about what's wrong in the country and one side loves guns the other side hates guns and it's literally such a simulation and then at the end then it follows the election and the election happens and it kind of culminates and like you know it follows these five characters and it culminates in one of them winning the thing and um it's just a crazy documentary so i think that that experience of a camp is kind of interesting too to me uh i think this has been going on for like 70 years and like you said a whole bunch of like famous politicians went and actually did this when they were kids and um you said mr beast that reminded me of like why isn't there a creator camp like okay why we talked about boy scouts going under and like who's gonna replace boy scouts if mr beast basically said come to this one week sleepaway camp and create become a creator like create your channel and like it's all about you're gonna be here we hand you a little selfie stick with a camera and you're going to create your vlog content you're going to create your channel you're going to create your brand you're going to have your fans you're going to follow each other's channels and like it's just a place to like come to learn how to be a creator and that's actually a fantastic idea because if you look at the stats i think that either you or me or one of us shared something where they asked like 15 year olds what they want to do when they grow up and like 20 or 30 like a shocking large number said they wanted to be a youtube creator and the second largest thing i think was a twitch creator like it was still the same thing yeah basically it's a video like a youtuber basically is number one and that that's just kind of all-encompassing of like an online content creator and it used to be back in the day like athlete musician um you know politician scientist astronaut and like 10 about 10 years ago you know it flipped and uh and youtuber became number one and people you look at that they shake their fists and say this is what's wrong with the country and uh other people say other people who realize that you can't pass a judgment like that it's a sort of like is what if that's what people want that's what people want you just also if kids if kids are actually going to follow through on what they would say when they were younger there would be a whole lot more marine biologists in the world [Music] exactly like i would be a dinosaur right now yeah it doesn't seem like there's exactly that many vets out there exactly um so i think that's a great idea as like you know if a couple of youtubers got together i think they have you know and i think it's fan service too so i think you would just become more famous you'd build fan love and you'd print like i don't know 20 million dollars every summer um running your camp uh it's pain in the ass but you could do that and i think like i went to a space camp from nasa when i was like in fifth grade did you really the state of texas sent every fifth grader to it so it's kind of amazing what yeah and they only did it once so i was just lucky to be in that timing i wanted to do that when i was a kid so badly it's an amazing thing you go there and you get to be in a rocket ship and like you get to play commander and like do all this stuff but i feel like for many jobs there's a version of that like i think people are fascinated with prisons i think they're fascinating with the police i think they're fascinated with the army and like if you could create like amusement parks or simulations of that where you get to take your pictures you get to touch the stuff you get to see how it works you get to learn some things uh people will pay for that and i think they're going to see more out of home experiences like that get built can we move on to the shitty billy of the week yeah or do you want a different one no it's good it's just a crazy story i don't even know what the point of this point of this one let's go to different one all right let's do a quick one quick idea this i saw this i kind of caught my eye this guy um what's his name i'll give him credit real quick somebody somebody sent this to us in the facebook group and uh i thought which one interesting so it's a special names.cn so uh what's the guy's name the guy's name mike mike benitez share this so specialname.cn what is it basically there's a story that came out of this girl who paid her way through college she's basically made a few hundred thousand dollars and all she does is she names chinese babies with american names so so basically in china every uh chinese person typically will have a western name so you know if their name is hard to say they kind of know that for for business purposes and travel purposes it's just easier to have to like be like yes i also go by mike or i go buy emerald or i go by you know samantha and so um but the problem is you know it's not your native thing so if it's like if i try to pick a chinese name right now i might pick something that's really weird or off like it doesn't sound quite right and so you see these things where chinese people name their baby like rolex uh would be like their western name it's like no no you shouldn't have picked that one like you know that's kind of a strange name if you were trying to have like an easy western name you actually like backfired so what this woman's service is she you can go to specialname.cn and the site is hilarious if you go to the website it's like are you on the website it's it's like yeah i'm looking at it look at the encounter it says the baby we named and it says a million they've named over a billion babies but the english is is off yeah well the actual site's in chinese i think it's a google translate that you're looking at yeah you just say boy or girl i think you submit some information or a picture of the baby and she just closes her eyes basically and says jasmine no so you you pick five attributes like um nice honest kind eager keen and i did that and it gave me the names zachary caleb or harvey and it says the famous harveys are harvey firestone harvey ball and then caleb caleb carr i don't know who that is that a famous actor uh zachary taylor i guess the american president yeah it's pretty funny and so this uh site i thought what what an example of niches make riches and like just solve a simple problem for people and uh you know this girl's made you know hundreds of thousands of dollars just off this website and uh i thought that was like how does it make money just to add really cool side hustle for a college kid it just makes they just make money through ads i think yeah i don't know exactly i thought you pay her to do it uh but maybe you're saying you just got a name right away i just got a name i was doing it on my phone so it might be ads or it might be a premium upsell and they and they and the logo is just this generic looking white lady like that's like the spokesperson if that's her or not [Laughter] that's definitely not her so let me do this oh yeah i know it's like a cartoon um this is awesome so this is a hilarious little side hustle that i loved um okay let's do uh let's do this shitty billy of the week i read the story and i was blown away this is not really this is interesting only in that it's a train wreck did you see this story about this venture capitalist that came out just now so there's this guy named michael gogan he used to be a partner at sequoia right like the one of the biggest venture firms ever is he the one who stole money from them no he got fired because his girlfriend came out and accused him like sued him for or accused him of of like sexual abuse she said you know he's i've been in a relationship with him for eight years or ten years or something like that and he's extremely abusive sexually to me and blah blah blah she's a stripper that he met somewhere and then she became his girlfriend and then whatever and this the suit he he didn't lose the suit he you know she kind of like he got acquitted or whatever um but you know still sequoia was like you know we decided it's best to part ways so a story came out in the daily mail you know it's good because it's on the daily mail which is like you know just the the trash of the trash but it's the junk food you can't resist and um basically there was some wild [ __ ] about this guy so here's the allegations that are in the article the article says michael gogan uh he basically after he left sequoia he goes to montana and he basically sets up his like estate in montana he owns like i don't know uh 100 000 square feet of like space of houses in in in montana he is like the big fish there he owns a bar under the bar he created this thing called the boom room and the boom room is where he takes like you know girls that he meets and he so this guy's on his fourth wife the article talks about this spreadsheet of five thousand women that he slept with and it's just wait say that again say the five thousand thing again a spreadsheet of five thousand women that he slept with is okay circle says do the math if you so if you if this has happened over a 20-year period yeah 365 days times 20 is 7 300 divided by 5 that means he had to have sex with a different woman every once in a while every yeah every day and a half is that crazy what i don't believe that that doesn't make sense to me i don't know if it's true i don't know if he did it or he didn't sort of like the wilt chamberlain did this once where he claimed he slept with ten thousand women and people were like that means you slept with two women a day like this doesn't make any sense um yeah his response by the way he was like yeah sometimes it was three though exactly most pimp response ever so this guy this guy's wild so so he basically um there's tons of so what happened was he had created this like security company to cover his tracks and it's like a private security company and he hired these like ex-military people to run it for him and they were kind of like his fixers they're the ones who came out and exposed this whole thing and are now suing him for 800 million dollars so they're suing him because he basically made them do a bunch of stuff that like got them in trouble so he'd have to pay off women that he would sleep with um and they would have he'd be like you need to do this like i'll put money into your account you pay her off and um and eventually one guy so he had a friend who um the story is he he brings his daughters over to the friend's house um with their babysitter but then he leaves at the babysitter has sex with a babysitter and the friend is like dude what the hell are you doing you just have sex with the babysitter in my house like uh this is messed up and he's like he calls him a pedophile and he's like dude uh like i don't you know don't don't bring up my my flaws and like you know there's a one-time thing and blah blah blah and the guy's like oh this messed up and he's like starts threatening the guy he threatens the guy and says if you come out and say this i'm gonna like ruin you and um the guy's like you know if that he then sleeps with the guy's wife as like you know part of this part of this process the guy gets really pissed and he's like threatens to basically expose him for all the stuff that he's doing um while he's meanwhile like an investor and all this stuff you know leading this professional life the guy's worth five billion dollars by the way so he's he's a he's a multi-billionaire himself so the guy goes to his like security guy and says we need to kill him we have this guy's getting too he's too big of a risk he threatens to bring everything down we got to kill him and don't and they're basically like in the article it's like don't like communicate anywhere except for wicker this like self-deleting text messaging app um and the guy goes to him and says hey hey he talks off the ledge no let's not kill this guy whatever but that was like one of the allegations and and so people have come out against this guy but he bribes the police and so like multiple police chiefs have like lost their job because they failed to investigate this guy because he basically bought them off and how much do you think how much you think you'd have to bribe a montana cop to shut up like a million dollars i mean yeah i think i think nine out of 10 police officers would take a million to shut up oh in my deep experience bribing cops i mean i have no idea yeah i think like half a million dollars would do right like for a lot of these women it's like jewelry uh like he slept with one woman then she got the husband found out got divorced and then he paid for he bought her a five bedroom home and also paid for her side of the divorce and uh you know that was like one of the things that he did and so he just had this like elaborate web of you know crazy like this crazy sexual life layered on to crazy like payoffs and bribes and cover-ups and then like a whole company dedicated to like this private security company whatever that means and then like police bribery like this is like a crazy ass three-part movie and then you look at this guy and he's just like this you know cookie cutter white vc looking guy it was like such a wild story i thought and um yeah sometimes truth is stranger than fiction so i am i've read i i i read a little bit about like odd billionaires and i've maybe interacted with one or two before and does it do have you ever met someone who's like in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars who has like some weird [ __ ] where like like they have a uh like for example this is like public knowledge peter thiel basically employed this this three lawyers big shot lawyers and their and basically when he was outed as gay by gawker he employed and this is a great book by ryan holiday i forget what it's called but he employed these three lawyers and i forget when he was outed but something like oh nine and he goes uh however long it takes your full-time job decade yeah yeah he goes just wait for gawker and those guys to screw up and when they slip up tell me and we're gonna pounce and he employed these guys the whole time and there's some crazy stuff about peter thiel like for example in the book they said that he has a black mercedes with the engine on everywhere he goes in the world so like that's what like he always he's got a team and they they have to have a car like at all times and he also has land in new zealand because he's a little bit nervous about apocalypse and so my question is have you do you think you've ever met like a billionaire or someone like that who's got some of these weird ass things like a like a security force who does exotic things like this a fixer yeah i think so so i worked with this guy i've talked about him before i worked with this crazy kind of like the filipino guy yeah in indonesia um crazy guy in indonesia that was i talked about before i mean he's like a drop out in grade school self-made i think he's worth 500 million dollars kind of like at his peak and 500 million in indonesia is like you know 10 billion dollars here in america and um and you know he he had a crazy elaborate like business like his him as my boss was really weird like he was a really insane boss i told you but he had a giant projector in the office on the wall that had everybody's computer tracked and your productivity was like this like he bought the software from boeing and basically used it to like show like your little square would flash red if you weren't being productive enough and i don't even know how it was like measuring that like just how much you were typing i guess i don't know and it was like this intimidation thing you know he had four women that just managed his email um like if he did good in a meeting he would walk in the next day and just hand you keys to like a new mercedes that's outside he's like this is yours drive it around and like you know he did crazy [ __ ] like that like i remember a meeting once where a friend of his came in from singapore and they were basically just openly talking about like a insider trading slash pump and dump scheme that they were doing and i was like whoa that's like crazy illegal um and they were like yeah that's great we're going to make so much money this is it's going to work it's going to be you said that you said this is illegal i didn't say i'm just sitting there in the room being like in my head i think this i'm 20 years i think i was 21 years old i didn't know [ __ ] about [ __ ] at that point but i knew enough to be like i think this is wrong what they're talking about and then he would you know every day would after work would take everybody to the bar or whoever his kind of like insider crew was and two girls would be there and those are like you know his escorts for the day or whatever and like this is the way he did business and he he bribed officials and he did all kinds of stuff he ended up in jail he ended up dying in jail he actually died this year and um you know this was a pretty crazy life uh and i worked with this guy for only like three months and then i left and i came back and started a startup here but like you know that guy was wild like he lived a wild life that's awesome yeah i've uh i don't know if i've have any first handout knowledge of or if i've like been friends with people maybe i have and they just haven't told me but uh i do believe that like people like this guy this gogan guy i don't know i've been practicing this gogan guy is like on some jeffrey epstein [ __ ] right like this is a modern day jeffrey epstein situation um maybe i guess it's not underage girls i guess that's that's the difference but like basically you know just like a harem of women and cover-ups and bribes and intimidation and he's got this bunker and he's like bribing police and like if these things are true which you don't know if they're true or not but this thing came out it's pretty crazy uh it's it's a wild story yeah this is crazy i i didn't know about this i i would believe just based off what i believe this is very this could be very true like this doesn't shock me like knowing what i know a little bit like and i have heard like rumors of people who i'm like secondhand or third hand connected with that they're freaks and uh like i hear some stories about what they do to cover it up and i 100 believe this and from silicon valley who are very successful like things that i didn't realize until i kind of got closer to i'm not inside that circle because i'm not like in that that tier but i had a couple friends in that circle and it's like two things that are way more common than i ever would have thought swinging swinging is like super common in silicon valley dude the swinger lifestyle weird it's weird you know what this pineapple thing by the way tell me so i i learned this from tic toc i don't know if this is real or not but basically like this this the silent symbol for signaling to others if you're a swinger or not apparently is a upside down pineapple so if you go to a house and they have a picture of a pineapple that's upside down it's a wink to anybody else who's in the lifestyle that hey we're down uh i had no idea that's crazy or if they're wearing like pineapple earrings or something at a party i've got a girlfriend who does it and she uh and and she tells me about it and my wife and i were like i was like sarah like you know like i'm not interested in this just so you know like i don't want to do this this is this uh and she's like yeah me neither but it's so fun to hear about yeah exactly i'm like uber uber dude i've got a couple friends that are into it down here in austin where i live uh these guys have this company you know on it um aubry marcus and then he's got this other guy named kyle uh who is a friend or works there i'm not sure the relationship but they like they mix work and play and they're open about their how their they have open relationships and they talk about it uh kyle kingsbury i think his name is and they talk about it on the podcast on their podcast that they they share they share relationships yeah it's i mean you know more power to you if it's your thing uh i what i'm saying is i didn't know how common that was or like swinging or that lifestyle but it is very common amongst like successful silicon valley people same thing with drugs like you know either micro dosing or normal dosing of certain drugs like i guess like there's a certain level of uh party that i just never did and had never had the urge to do um that i think is like pretty common amongst uh amongst like this group of people and like you know good for them dude i've i'm i'm such a prude i've been out with like some like really powerful people who i looked up to and i saw them whenever i've seen him do coke i'm like oh i i don't uh i don't really like you as much as i used to like you exactly it just like it made me uncomfortable i didn't feel i didn't like it but uh this is crazy and it is way more common than i than i thought living in silicon valley i think what it is is like if you're a nerd and you're now worth a billion dollars or hundreds of millions which is basically the same thing and you could do anything you want you want you want to do stuff and also if you are young and you have money you have to up the ante consistently so dan blizzarian has this new book out and either in the book or an interview about the book he was saying how he's like man i've had every woman that i could ever want i have private fancy chefs i drive the best cars i fly private i do i do the fanciest stuff none of it makes me happy anymore because i have to go bigger and bigger and bigger in order to help my dopamine and make it work and and and now like none of it makes me happy so i just like i try to be simple now although like it's really hard i i but all the items they don't they don't bring me joy um speaking of making me happy there was this thing that i saw that i thought was pretty cool it's not really like a business idea necessarily but i think it's worth a read so let me put a link to it uh worship the link um one sec let me grab it basically there's this guy i want to give him credit because it's a very interesting read um and i'll explain it while i'm looking for the link so basically there's this guy who dan liu i think is his name um how do you spell it dan normal and then and uh go to this link so go just search uh or nevermind i'll just slack it to you um so go to this link and this guy this post and basically what all he did was he's like hey um you know there's there's all these like claims that you'll hear commonly you'll hear them over and over and over again and they've referencing studies and um they have fancy names and then their reference studies that people take them as facts and then if you're he's like turns out if you actually go read the study the claim is either way weaker than what people use it as like i think or it's literally the opposite it gives four examples and i loved reading this so i want to go through them real quick so one is unhappiness which you just said so we had talked about this before which is people have this thing where they say there's a there's a link between happiness and uh and income and basically the thing you'll hear in pop science is seventy five thousand dollars you know your happiness doesn't go up beyond that amount so what does this mean and it's totally small you should chase money and um don't chase money you should it's not gonna make you any happier and so he's like so he goes and he's like because it's become common knowledge that that money doesn't make people happy how much is enough um you know people have different things if you google it if you say happiness income it'll say um household income of 75 000 after that your day-to-day happiness doesn't rise um he goes this happiness uh income like study was actually done multiple times not just one time and um and you know the problem is like when people looked at the graph it looks like happiness goes up up up up up and then it flattens out he's like the problem is it's on a log scale and like most people just don't know how to read a long scale graph a long skill graph means you're going up by factor of 10 every time sorry so even if it's even if it's flattening out that might be going from 10 to 50 it just doesn't look like as big of a jump because it's not like the increments are a log scale so basically if you actually look at it if you actually look at the and you know this got published in dan gilbert's like book uh on on behavioral you know economics and stuff like that and basically um if you actually look at the chart the chart shows that uh if you look at it on a non-log scale which he puts the graph here it's basically like the more money you have the more your satisfaction goes up and there's no flattening out it doesn't go up at the same rate so yes it's true that going from zero dollars to thirty thousand dollars to seventy five thousand dollars gives you a bigger jump in happiness than going from one million to two million or two million to four million but the happiness does keep going up uh your life your satisfaction does keep going up on all the reported scales it's basically like you know there may be some point where you stop getting returns but we haven't found it yet you know like uh on average people have not found that yet so um actually there are things that like um that i and if you dig in he actually pointed out some that there's there are some things that that uh contradict this claim so what people used to say is oh yeah you'll get that money then you'll return to what they call your set point of happiness so you get all this money you win the lottery yeah within a few months you're back to your set point of happiness if you're depressed before you'll be depressed after and um and he's like you know it turns out that that's not true winning the lottery actually does make you happier if you look at if you actually look at the study the second thing is the the reverse they also say is true something bad happens to you people will say oh you're so resilient you'll bounce right back to your previous level happiness and he's like actually if you look at the study it actually does show that disability divorce loss of a partner or unemployment actually have long-term negative effects on happiness and even like unemployment after you get re-employed it still persists and that's what the studies actually show he's like it's kind of amazing you know how this can happen like the study literally says what the answer is and that people will summarize it as something completely different like they'll either take a very weak effect and make it sound like it's a total like strong effect or they'll take something that said no correlation they'll say it's a correlation he has four examples or usually what happens is like there'll be a time where um someone has one cute line in a study and then a news article cites it and then a thousand things exactly here's another example of that yes have you heard that uh it it's a crazy stat i don't remember exactly somewhere like half of americans can't afford a 500 bill if an emergency came up so i i went and read i was like i don't believe that that's true and i went and looked at where i started i researched this a while ago and it's [ __ ] it's it's that that's a what happened is um there was a study done and there was a line in the abstract saying like uh you know like this could be as bad as it said something like a non-committal like perhaps or maybe or like something like that where it's like i forget exactly how the scientists or the the the how she phrased it but it's it's not true it's not a fact it was like a it was just a line and so many people cited that and ran with it to believe it's true another example is uh i believe the food pyramid so the food pyramid i if i remember correctly they were it was like a hypothesis or something it was like we just we think this might be true um and like some people were just kind of tink it was like a it was like a project someone was tinkering with and i think it was who the world health organization took it and ran with it and they're like well you know we don't know if this is real and in fact in the 90s they had to change it because they're like well we actually put like all fats and all carbs in the same category when they're like you know it was just like this oversimplification that some people were just tinkering with and someone ran with it and there's loads of examples we should actually do an entire podcast just on examples of that another one is like dude have you ever heard that you could see the great wall of china from space i've heard that is that not true it's of course it's not true if you can see the great wall of china from space why couldn't you see like a highway yeah it's true the height wouldn't really matter because it's so easy to get these one-liners and run with them and you can they're really cool you could find a lot of them in interesting studies and i've actually been learning peter atia this guy named peter tia has this really good blog post on how to read studies and so i read health studies all the time and you can go and read them and they'll make these broad claims but you'll say oh well you tested this on only 20 people and they just these 20 people like called you or checked in with you occasionally for the like three weeks like they called you every other day we don't know what they were doing throughout the day like there's just so much information going on who knows you know exactly what happened it's not good enough to say it's a fact there's a there's a name for uh effect i don't remember the name of it but uh it describes this phenomenon the name doesn't really is it dunning-kruger danny kruger is a good one that's in this in this thing that he talks about but there's an effect like this uh which is like there's something that happens where you read a newspaper story and let's say day to day you read the newspaper you say okay this is good it's informing me i trust this this must be true if it's here and then you read about something you know about and you actually see oh my god like i actually know about this and this is actually either not quite right totally off or misses it leaves out some important information so you would think that people would once they have that experience they would like re-adjust their trust in the rest of the newspaper and the name of the effect is this some kind of like amnesia effect where like you um you turn the page and then you resume trusting the next thing that you didn't know about that's in the newspaper it's like even though you just sort of proved to yourself that like this should not be the you know the record the canon of like what's true and what's what's not about a subject um but there's this common effect which is that people will experience it on something they know and then as soon as they get back to something they don't know they uh sort of rebound back i forgot the name of that but i've seen this to be true you know for me for me i i i hope at least at least you know that was one of the biggest changes of my childhood was i used to think if something was in the newspaper or on cnn that like yes that's what it is and you know and you know it changes it when you become the person writing it so i became the person writing it you know i created a website and i would write stuff and i saw people cite it sometimes you and i will say stuff and we're saying like around or we're saying i heard this crazy story about x y and z and hopefully we think that people are saying like you know this is just banter and like we don't it's when we do know the facts we'll say it's a fact so but oftentimes we're like you know i think it's around blank and i'll see people cite us and i'm like well you took that out of context so i i was just i wasn't well researched on that i was just kind of i kind of knew it and once you become the person making the news you see that it's [ __ ] and that's why i believe that fake news even though people are like criticizing trump for that i'm like that is actually real it's very easy to make fake this you know what's the difference between you know cnn and the wwe there's not much they make up story lines for entertainment and uh and so like you know the all these three-letter acronyms the nfl same way it's story lines for entertainment and like if you say that the news is just reality tv right it's story lines loosely based on reality um that's very different than you know getting your information from it and i get it it's tiring to go try to get accurate first-hand information a lot and people use shortcuts and that's why that's why the system is the way it is but um you know the sooner you sooner you realize that the news is just entertainment the faster you'll either stop consuming it or consume it with like a very severe filter that says this may or may not be true i'd like to cross-check this again if it's important i should go dig into it if it's not important you know i should kind of like you know take it with a grain of salt this is great [Music] you

but i would also say there's been a big lesson i've learned that is anytime people live anytime you discover a group of people who are very interested in and living a lifestyle that is different than yours it's very easy initially to write it off and just say oh that's frivolous that's um that's just kind of like whatever you know they're out of touch or uh they're weird or whatever like it doesn't really matter what what category it is like when i when i saw gamers and people who stream video games and watch other people playing video games it was so strange to me i remember making fun of this kid in college because i walked in on him and he was watching somebody else play a video game on a live stream and the guy was playing in korea and i was like you're watching a dude in korea play this video game why don't you just play better yet why don't you get outside and like let's go go get some food and i made fun of him for and then years later i'm like selling my company to twitch and like i'm i'm like talking about how great this trend is and he's like called me he's like you motherfu you know like i dude you made fun of me for this 10 years ago and here you are now like now you're on board and that's happened to me so many times in life that now i go the exact opposite way i see some somebody like you who says the same thing that our other buddy said which is maybe i should go to the mayo clinic and get these advanced scans done once a year i think huh maybe that's something more people are going to want to do why would he want to do this why are people choosing plant-based lifestyles what is that all about you know like and so now i lean in any time i discover these things and that's become some of the best a like either like discoveries life changes i can make or b investments it's a great way to invest because you're actually on the like the cutting edge of stuff you're in early which is super important obviously there's a book on like a famous business book on it where he talks i think it's crossing the chasm or something where he talks about like early adopters and then like the there's basically this like bell curve of people where it's like in the beginning of the belt curve it's like late people who are late to it and then like the middles like the average joe and there's like early adopters and then there's one more like cutting edge and you and i both have like a handful of friends of which i would actually say that i i forget the names of them but in that bell curve there's people who are getting names because you got the idea right but you uh like butchered all the names so it's basically the earliest is innovators and it's like the people actually like figuring things out and then there's early adopters then there's early majority that's the kind of like big chunk late majority that's the other part of the big chunk and then there's the laggards who are like you know people who still have aol email addresses and like you know are looking driving around looking for blockbusters and for a lot of things i would say you are on the right side you're uh either an innovator or the one next to it an early adopter and i'm trying to go i'm intent i'm intentionally trying to go that way so i thought uh you know i'm just not that i'm not like a futurist type of guy because i've been so wrong and i figured out the formula for it the formula for it is um have an ego make a prediction be wrong like five times and have it rubbed in your face how wrong you were boom you're not you're now a futurist uh like i remember the first time the iphone came out and i was like who the [ __ ] wants to like read tiny text on a screen like that's awful i was like nobody's gonna watch a movie on this i was like yeah you can watch who would ever watch a movie on this like tiny square like that's like that would be the worst it's worse than an airplane headrest like i remember saying these things to people and you know like i was in college i was like a junior in college there was nobody remembers this but i remember being that wrong snapchat i remember being that wrong my username still has the word test in it because i was so certain i was like snapchat this is this is stupid right this is just for kids and dick pics and stuff like that like certainly won't go on beyond this bitcoin i was wrong early on right like guys in my office were telling me about it back in 2012 2013 and i was kind of laughing and saying guys let's focus on something like legit here and now i'm like you know a [ __ ] bitcoin evangelist and so like twitch same thing i was wrong about streaming i've been wrong so many times that i've actually flipped the script now i kind of had to reassess my life and say i'm not gonna be very good as a technology entrepreneur or technology investor if i just continue to write off the big things as dumb and stupid early on like i need to go the exact opposite way okay what would it take for me to do that and i just i just inverted so instead of you know anytime i see that the same feeling i instead lean into curiosity what's making people want to do this when i think it's so strange and now that's that's like flipped the script for me and we either had justin or emmett on at hustlecon or on here and they're talking about justin tv which was the site before twitch became a thing and it was basically uh anyone could log in and create their own live tv channel and emmett i believe you could tell me if i'm wrong i believe the story was like emmett with like there's a small corner of the site where these like guys were watching video games and it wasn't a lot of people like thousands of people but they were spending two percent i think of the traffic um at that time but they were spending a significant amount of time watching and he was like that's this is the one that we got to go to and and i don't even think it was that as data-driven actually the data pointed against it because again i remember it was a small trap it was a small amount they had a combination of two things working in their favor number one emmett was like i i guess actually the number one factor was they were [ __ ] the current thing wasn't working and they had like no like they had nothing to lose they don't they were gonna run out of money and fail or they had to try something dramatically different and when you feel like you're [ __ ] and you have nothing to lose you actually have the one of the greatest assets on your side um which is that you know when you have nothing to lose you play completely differently than when you feel like you have something to lose so that was the first thing they had to change they the things that were popular were all like illegal streams it's legal streams of sports so they knew oh people want to watch this but we can't ever build a business around this yeah so what 90 of people are doing on this site we can't use the two percent thing worked and then the other one was he was like i personally like watching these so he's like i'm gonna go with that like these are my favorite things to watch on the network so if i'm gonna work on this i'm gonna work on the ones that i personally find you know the most interesting and actually most of the company wanted to go work on the hotter sexier idea which was called uh what was the thing called the video thing they had not vidi their their their version of that called social capital cam so the company split in half they said all right justin tv is not gonna work abandon ship and we gotta figure out you know what's the what's the emergency ship and so they had this i think michael cybel who now runs y combinator and justin khan they wanted to do social cam it was instagram for video instagram is the hottest startup in silicon valley but it's photos we're gonna do instagram for video and they were able to instantly raise money they got tons of initial hype and traction and press and all the talented people in the company wanted to go work there so i talked to this guy jacob who's the og designer at twitch and he's still there he's still at the company today and i said uh how'd you know like to bet on twitch instead of social cam he goes oh no dude i wanted to be on social camp they were just like nah like we don't like teams full bro like you go work on on the thing with emmett because emma's his childhood friend he said you got to go to that one he's like oh [ __ ] all right whatever you know so like that was what seemed like the great idea but actually what emmett did which was leaned into this really weird behavior unique lifestyle that these gamers were doing where they were streaming themselves playing for eight hours a day that turned out to be the thing and that's kind of my point which is like i think that there's like these i i do it on online communities particularly reddit but you can right now you can do it on twitter or you can just type in like any idea or any hobby and type in the word forum and you can just find like these niche communities of people that are kind of freaks and it's fun to like learn all about it like for example intermittent fasting fasting is now like we all talk about it um i remember like eight years ago i remember business insider wrote an article about like a microsoft executive and they mocked him for the like intermittent fasting what is this and uh but there's there's been communities online where i've like read about people doing this for forever and you're like fasting like no like breakfast is the most important meal of the day just look at anything they make fun of silicon valley for at the beginning coronavirus like vcs are so paranoid about the real world that they're wearing masks to conferences guess what everybody's doing now i'm wearing masks right oh my god intermittent fasting silicon valley's latest craze not eating till noon every day you know what a google what google engineers are doing right it's like media loves to make fun of it guess what that's what everybody's going to be doing um you know what are some other things that are like that i think you know some of them are meditation by the way was like that too people made fun of it and then you know boom it's like the new yoga uh the other ones i think that are happening are like stem cell or any like blood platelet spinning stuff where it's like oh you have knee pain well these guys they like go to puerto rico and like go to germany and like get this [ __ ] blood spinning treatment and go get stem cells injected on their knees that and uh now they feel good and gene editing i think is gene editing's one another one uh breath work i think breath work is where meditation was i invested this thing called other ships they just actually launched their app i use it every single day and um like i use it religiously because it makes you feel so good and to to the average person like i do it outside now after huberman was like get get some light on your eyes first thing in the morning so i do it outdoors um and i'm sitting in my driveway basically doing it and neighbors are walking by they're walking their dog what they feel is a very normal behavior go go for a morning walk and they see me like doing [ __ ] breathing techniques on my driveway and they think i'm a nut uh and i love it i go louder as soon as somebody walks by because i want them to know they live next to somebody from the future dude there's this guy his name was bill uh well we'll start with there's this guy named arthur leonard he's uh he's dead now but in the 60s and 70s he was a new zealand track and field coach and he had runners like paul walker uh or not paul walker that's john walker uh peter fury yeah yeah peter snell and all these like new zealand guys who started winning the olympics in the 1500 meters 5k and 10k and everyone's like dude what are you doing with your runners and he goes we run like 120 miles a week we do long distance running and we go slow and we just do it just a shitload of it and this one coach from oregon got really interested and uh his name was bill bowerman and he goes well i'm the track and field coach at oregon university i have all these great runners what are you doing and he goes over to in the 1970s in new zealand and he learns from arthur leonard and he comes back and he starts making it popular and two things happen university oregon gets really good at track and field and he ends up um making shoes for his runners so they can run a little bit faster and he calls it nike he calls that company nike he starts it with a with another runner phil knight and the other thing that happens and this just it worked out perfectly is he starts talking about it to all of his friends he even writes a book about it and i believe it's called like the joy of jogging and the idea of jogging it wasn't even like a thing in the 70s people like what do you mean you're just going to run like art isn't yeah like aren't the police gonna go after you and and like like it was like astounding like prior to the 1970s right so there was it was a jogging craze of the 70s prior to that people didn't go out and run that just like wasn't like a thing and so anyway that's like another example where like running became popular and bowerman created nike to kind of capitalize on it

what else could be kind of a status symbol i think i have a couple yeah i think like the splitting time thing between cities um it's still expensive but it's one place it's still expensive but it's not prohibitively expensive um so like i think that that's going to be uh far more con i'm doing it now and i realize i'm like in a fortunate situation but i think that it's far more uh accommodating than ever before uh so i think that like that part-time living in in splitting time between cities is gonna be quite common um i don't know what else yeah i think that's a great that's actually a great one uh it's sort of like if you look at what do our what do our rich friends do now that's not common and then that's just gonna become like like more people are gonna do that thing so like you know like you're talking about having a few either airbnbs or like having three homes and just shift like throughout the year just shifting based on where you want to be in whatever season you want to be in and not having like a hometown um dude here's more of a thing here's one and you're getting into it now i've been into it for a minute as well which is did you see well kinda i tweeted out asking people to see to say like what what like so i'm i'm i'm building this house um and i'm like how would you optimize it for longevity health and fitness and i got so many amazing replies and the most consistent one was cold plunge and sauna so many people are interested in that and i think that that's a much bigger trend than i ever thought so i think having home saunas and in home cold tubs that is something that's going to be that's i think we're still in the early stages of that i never would have thought that that was going to be a thing uh yeah that's the i just bought a sauna by the way like two days ago i know i saw you what's his name andrew said like don't do infrared and you're like uh but i bought an infrared is that so okay yeah uh by the way there's a sick company so check this out is it uh david david's company florenz have you seen this this guy just dm'd me who i'm friends with he spoke at hustle again he goes hey i just met with shawn about my sauna business and he said this guy yeah and he said that you also like this type of stuff have you um did you go look at it did you see it get sick uh he just he dm'd me a video and you want to explain what it was so basically uh uh floor so there's two that that got um that got uh they got kind of like highlighted here um where are you at the url is we are florins um how do you spell florins uh f-l-o-r-e-n-s f-l-o-r-e-n-s okay um okay so basically we are florenz uh so basically what he's done is he's built a in a custom kind of like new version of in-home sauna it plugs into a normal normal outlet which when i was looking up saunas that was like one big thing it's like you have to i don't have to get an electrician out here to handle the power of the sauna it's like small enough where it fits in uh it's like a great like like it's like made for like you know one person can fit easily then there's a super nice like super clean design so like most saunas kind of look like this kind of same cabin looking feel this looks like it fits in like a modern home it's like very slick looking um and so he's building this thing and he showed me one he's got it i'm gonna go visit him he's got one down here not too far from where i live uh so then there's one then there's one in the presidio called ancient ritual have you seen this one that's the one i saw ancient ritual so and so there's two so ancient rituals the other one that people are kind of hyping up and i think that one is like almost like peloton for asana so you get in normally when you get into a sauna you're like on your own it's like dude here go sit in this this hot box and like think or you know talk to the naked guy next to you like i don't know like do whatever you want to do i think what ancient i don't know exactly what ancient rituals doing but i think what they're doing is it's sort of like a guided meditations they have sounds they have scents they have like um they'll talk you through like what to what to like it's like it's like calm or like headspace like meets a sauna uh that's my like prediction they're a little bit they're very stealthy there's like nothing on the website but that's my understanding of it just from uh figuring it out dude the florence thing is amazing yeah so i'm really excited about both of these i don't think either of these just like you know mega huge business but i think it's i think it could definitely be a really healthy business um and it might be one of those that surprises you maybe there's bigger demand maybe this is maybe this ends up like pools right like i think um our buddies are in the they bought a pool construction company he was telling me something like you know um like some absurd percentage of homes like uh 50 of homes or whatever in in areas that can host a pool like will get a pool in the suburbs and um and it's like a it's that's not the exact percentage but it's like it's a 50 000 average ticket um it's the number one like kind of like optional upgrade to a house that that happens and um and so you know those companies are doing really well pool construction companies and so maybe if you fast forward 10 years down the road sauna and cold plunge is going to be as common as swimming pool is in america like i could i could see a world where that's the case i definitely could too so um i'll have to remember exactly what these the the study says but there's a there was a very reputable and famous study and it said two interesting things the first thing that it said was if you sauna for two 20-minute sessions a week it decreases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease by something like 30 or 40 percent a massive number then it said if you sauna for three 20-minute sessions a week it's gonna decrease it by like 60 like it's like the numbers are like astronomical just from two to three let alone zero to two and so sauna's like i i i the what the way it works is basically like when your body heats up that much i guess it stresses it and that that's a really healthy and good stress and uh anyway it's pretty sick i'm all about that

it's sort of like if you look at what are our what do our rich friends do now that's not common and then that's just going to become like like more people are going to do that thing i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what's going on so did you see uh andrew huberman replying to my tweet yeah i did i feel like kind of giddy a little bit i feel a little honored yeah do you feel like it's kind of cool to interact with him right uh yeah i think he's great i just really i think he's really great uh like the cool part about this podcast is that we me and you get to hang out often and then once in a while like there's a bunch of guests i would say for all the guests i like them all but maybe two out of every 10 i'm like oh this is a this person you know they're my kind of people i just really get along with them and i really respect what they're doing and he's definitely one of those people so hear me out i think that we should get okay so you have to go somewhere on wednesday and so i went and found a guest tell me what you think about this guest and then when i got this person i was real i realized we should do this way often way more so i met this guy and he has his business that's like a fine local services business in in california and i go what did you used to do and he goes i was in the cia i go what did you do there and he said i would go to the middle east and i would try to commit peop get people to commit treason and i would do it by trying to influence them and persuade them and basically give me secrets so i can uh you know we could do espionage and i was like that's the most amazing thing i've ever heard can you tell me everything and i just sat down for like an hour and i asked some questions and i asked him to come in the podcast through the podcast or that was pre-pod pre-pod and so i i go dude you just want to come out and tell me all these he like told me stories about being in like an alley in lebanon trying to get some person to show up and he the way that he convinced he's got all these like weird stories and and and it's about persuasion and influence and [ __ ] and i realized i'm like sean and i should just start doing that way more just getting people who are like interested in regardless if it has to do with money or not yeah yeah i think that's cool i met a guy once who he was like using our product and we held a meet up and like i think 200 people flew to our office and there's a big party basically and uh this guy he was like he was always very mysterious because our product was kind of like clubhouse so you could just kind of sit there hang out all day just chat it was always online and i was like oh so you like don't work or what's the deal like you're always online doing this he's like oh yeah i'm like in between you know gigs and i was like i'm unemployed i didn't really think too much of it but when he showed up i was like i noticed two things one is the guy was incredibly muscular like you know i kind of like bumped into him and it was like i hit a rock and i was like oh that was so strange but he wasn't trying to look super fit but i could tell it's like you know those people that like yeah they could do 90 000 pull-ups it's like oh your core is just incredibly you're just your whole body's made of muscle um it's not that you have giant muscles but your whole body is a muscle and um so it's like okay that's interesting noted and then later on in the night he um like i introduced him to two people one person was from russia he spoke russian with them i introduced another person from pakistan and he spoke like urdu with them and i was like how many languages do you speak was he a white guy white guy and i was like and he spoke with like almost like a perfect accent and i was like what the hell why do you know how to speak in all these different languages he's like oh um and he kind of like as the night got on like you know he wasn't drinking but we were all drinking and he's like he kind of confided he was like yeah i was actually a spy for many years and he starts telling me these stories and they're so unbelievable that i'm like i just kind of think this guy is he lying is he telling the truth it's very hard to tell because the stories are so good like you know the story is like you know he's in a bar in russia and you know this mobster's there and then yuri milner the famous investor comes in and he's like okay i want to talk to yuri and yuri just kind of blows them off and he says something in russian and this is like the perfect one-liner and i was like what's going on here so we go to the battery later that night the battery is basically this private members club in san francisco that is like a soho house for san francisco and my the previous investor who bankrolled my whole company the idea lab that i was working at he created the battery so we go we're hanging out there and on the way out it's like two in the morning we're leaving and the battery has i think 14 hotel rooms but really there's like the penthouse that you rent out for parties and the penthouse i think was like 10 grand a night at least maybe 15 grand a night to rent out um and there's an elevator that goes straight up to the penthouse and so at that elevator we're walking out and at the elevator is elon musk he's getting in the elevator and it's him it's jason calacanis and there's two other people we don't know and uh and i was just like you know kind of like fan girl mom was like oh [ __ ] that's elon musk and so the guy the spy guy he's with me and he goes oh elonzer he goes hold on he walks over and they're waiting for the elevator the elevator is about to be there he walks straight up to them and he goes like classic pickup artist doesn't address elon he goes jason he's like jason and he goes to jason calacanis jason is like oh hey uh what what's up he's like jason um i met you last year at the conference and i told you you know what what i do with the government all that um and i offered you a tour i i offered you a tour but i forgot to give you my number um let me give you my number now and i'll be able to get you that tour and if uh if if elon wants to come he can come too oh my god he's like he's like he like focused on jay's cat guys it was just sort of like uh you know elon if you're interested you're welcome to join as well you could tag along and then he walked away and i was just laughing because it wasn't like some super it's like he tried to do a super smooth move wasn't that smooth in my opinion but it was still hilarious and he had the balls to approach so you know good for him so who was the guy i mean i don't want to say his name but yeah he's just a guy and i like haven't seen him since that was my one night with the cia guy well this guy's coming on uh when you're gone and long story short we should do more cool [ __ ] like that yeah for sure speaking of cool [ __ ] can you i don't know what's going on with this constitutional [ __ ] and i know you know everything about it can you tell me because it's actually amazing or like yes i got a dm a few days ago and said hey a group of us are getting together to buy the constitution okay like like like the united states constitution the united states constitutes i think there's um 11 of them right 11 copies i think there's only one that's in the hands of private buyers this is the one who owns it um so i don't know who owns it but it's being auctioned off by sotheby's so they said hey there's a sotheby's auction in a couple days we're gonna create a dao which is a crypto term for basically like a group just a group of people think of it like a company um we're gonna form a dow and everything anybody could contribute contribute any amount you want and we're going to try to buy the constitution and i was like what the [ __ ] and i was like you know i was like that's great um i was like how much is it you know how and i think he said they're gonna need i want to say 10 or 20 million dollars i think it's 20 million dollars that they're going to need to raise who messaged you um i mean i don't think they all want their like name out there necessarily okay well who's the organizer behind this it's a gr it's a small group of kind of like nft collectors okay it's not packy or no he's kind of so they they basically approach me [ __ ] and i think some others to try to help get the word out so the the amazing thing is so there's a thing called the created constitution dao and um and they have raised in three days i think three million dollars from two thousand people something like that so i'll just pull up the twitter handle so the twitter handle is constitution down and it says we the people for the people we're buying we're buying the constitution um from sotheby's in four days we need your help and then if you go to the website that shows that they have uh it says amazing copy at the top what if we held hands and bought the constitution together it was just a hilarious way of putting it and then it says uh they've raised 3.6 million dollars so far and i think they need where do they write their target um okay i don't think they write their target anywhere here uh but i i'm pretty sure i i asked the guy i'm pretty sure they said they need like roughly 10 to 20 million dollars that's crazy it's actually pretty amazing so who who how does it work who owns it and who and how is it tracked and how do you know to trust these people the way this would work is a group of people get together they buy a thing now this is how they've bought several other things so they bought uh people are creating dows to buy crypto punks so oh you want a crypto punk but a punk cost like a million dollars now you don't have a million dollars well you want to put you want to invest 10 10 000 into a crypto point cool so we can all pull together 10 000 each and buy a crypto punk collectively for a million dollars and we all own whatever that math comes out to as you know we don't do public math something like whatever you know less than one percent of the crypto punk is yours and you can sell your stake in the crypto point so they fractionally own it so that's what i think they're trying to do here is they're trying to fractionally own uh the constitution which is a hillary they're going to turn the con they could take the actual constitution they're going to turn it into an nft and then you can fractionally own the nft and what laws or loose understanding of it how does it protect the investors how are the investors protected um protected in what way what do you need protection from who's that to get you um they can lie about the price that they sold it they can never sell it they can uh who so okay we're buying it if they get a hold of it then they can accidentally custodied i don't know how they do custody so like i don't know who actually holds the keys maybe it's a group that owns the keys i think the way the dow is structured is there's a wallet the wallet holds the nft and it requires x percent vote in order to do anything with it to move the nft again um so you kind of vote as a group and if whatever over 50 of people do it then um then then they're gonna do okay hold on let me tell you what this person said um so okay maybe i could say his name it says it in his profile so this guy austin kane reached out he goes um we're he just he started off hot we are literally purchasing the constitution of the united states okay i go cool how much is it uh sotheby's estimate is around 15 to 20 million we're building around the clock your the nft we did shaped his views on this idea so i'd love to have you be a part of it blah blah and they're basically pulling together assets i think the discord group that they have has like thousands of members like i think they had 10 million in soft commitments like verbal commitments and 3 point something million actually funded commitments and so uh you crowdfund the dow um and then i think they what they plan to do is they actually plan to hold the physical constitution in like the smithsonian or something like that um so they they plan to like have have do they make a profit does this guy austin make a profit for organizing um i don't know they don't you know there's not a ton of details and about the how the dao is structured and whether they have like some preferential thing and you know by the way so this is the same dude they got 10 million in three days 10 million they're soft commitments they have 3.6 actually wired into their wallet and you're going to say we had this for the jordan thing and yeah uh looking like i was talking to a friend about that the other day i'm like i still think that would be great the only reason like if we ever actually wanted to do this i think there's the difference is is that that that constitution is likely just being sold to the highest bidder whereas if jordan found out that someone was gonna do xyz he'd be like no [ __ ] that i don't want to do that yeah yeah perhaps perhaps uh then again it's been on the market for what seven ten years something like that so maybe maybe he's ready to sell if somebody can actually uh you know meet the price i think one challenge we had was a we're just busy and just kind of [ __ ] around saying it somebody would actually have to go boots on the ground figure out yeah go see it go figure out why it's not selling figure out what the you know the the rules are around could people airbnb it or could you turn it into a museum or could you do something with it or is it literally going to be an inactive asset um you know but i think this is something that can happen there's another version of this have you heard of kraus house no what's that so i'm a little jealous i didn't think of this idea myself but i might just i might just do my own the name is really good kraus house so kraus house which is k-r-a-u-s uh house um it might be the weird spelling of house too but basically they're uh it's crosshouse.club and here's what it says we're a dow of basketball fans and we're crazy enough that we're gonna try to buy an nba team and so they're basically trying to do the same thing they're trying to crowdfund and buy an nba team today nba teams are owned by billionaires you know successful business people steve ballmer types who go buy these teams for one to two billion dollars and the idea here is why don't why wouldn't all the fans of let's say you know like the die-hard crazy fans of you know the grizzlies or whatever the like uh why wouldn't they band together could they band together could they raise enough money um between fans of the team and investors who just would love to own a piece of an mba team and you buy the team and then you you control the team through the same sort of vote so you decide which gm do we hire do we keep this person on for another year or not and so it's sort of like a crowd controlled nba team which is you can't that's a yeah it's a dope idea it's incredibly it's impossible because with buying a basketball team uh or any american sports mage like one of the top four or five sports it's impossible to buy or not impossible the the issue is not the lack of money the issue is that it's like you know in england they knight you and they start calling you sir richard branson in america we allow you to buy a sports team like it's a select group of people and very few people are actually allowed to do it and it's done that way on purpose so for all the people that's like true you basically you have to get approved by the other 30 owners so um you know they can vote to block you but it's not to say they would vote to block this like i think this could generate a ton of uh attention and press and be seen as pretty forward thinking i don't think it's a given that they would block this um i don't think it's a given that they block it but my point is is this is not like a thing like oh i'll just get the money and buy it i'll just go and buy it right yeah but i do think money is the limiting factor here because uh if you go like there's a team that's for sale right now and if you want to buy them you have to go put up the you know sort of like you i think you need to come over the top with the bid so you're not going to get a deal here you'd have to say okay you know the price is 2 billion we're going to play 2 billion or we're going to pay 2.4 we're going to play 3 billion because we have to be the winning bidder and if you could choose between a simple clean transaction with another billionaire you'd probably take that so we're going to have to like buy something that's got hair on the deal now there's another group that's doing this in a much more uh practical way and i don't know if practical is better so what they're trying to do is they're they have a dow and they're trying to buy a like fourth tier um soccer team and like the english premier league or whatever so there's like not a not a team that's i don't know how soccer works but it's like not the actual premier league but it's like you know there's the ranking system where you can like ladder in or you can get demoted out so they're buying one at the bottom and that's like a no it's you know the show ted lasso they're basically trying to do ted lasso so they're buying this like joke of a team who did that and they're like great it's another group of people another another crypto group uh that's putting this together and they're they're buying the team they're gonna oh and that they can do that's a pretty permissionless thing and the price is like not you don't need two billion dollars to do it you can buy it for 10 million dollars and so you're gonna buy this team for 10 million bucks they're gonna crowd control the whole thing they're gonna min nfts because they're gonna own the ip of the team brand and they're gonna they're trying to be like they're trying to show what uh technology kind of like first crypto first team how they would run their team as an example that other bigger teams might be able to like look at and say oh that's smart how they are they meant to they sold 20 million dollars of nfts for their team and every jersey comes with an nft how does that work um or well you know there's a social token that gets you access for season tickets like what does that mean and so they're trying to demonstrate it that way and they're trying to literally rank up and the goal is to eventually get into the premier league and be you know can they one day go play against manchester united or whatever um that would be the dream i don't want to spend much time talking about nfts and crypto because i'm so bored of it but i just read this amazing wall street journal article about gary vaynerchuk did you happen to see that i didn't see that but uh i've been following kind of what he's been doing but tell me what stood out to you gary's if for the listeners gary's been on the pod a ton if you everyone probably knows who he is if you don't know he's basically he's a celebrity for having a big mouth but he's like cool and he's and he talked but he talks a lot and he owns an agency that at this point is quite large if i had a bet i would say they're like a 200 million revenue business like it's really big and he bootstrapped it and he is on fire lately so basically before we get to the article lately he launched a thing with michael rubin where um i forget michael rubin launched two new businesses and gary's a partner in one of them i think it's the like nft trading card one is that it yeah you told me about this yeah yes and then he also is doing he has a new book coming out and he just launched this thing like a year ago we had him on when he did it called v friends which i think it's like a collection of nfts i think it's valued north of 500 million dollars right uh i'll have to look up the latest but yeah it was basically like a top 10 top 15 it's been a top 10 top 15 um crypto project for its entirety basically and i talked to him like the day at launch or something like that um i was with him at this dinner and i think he said that he had made like 20 or 30 million dollars that day from it like just a huge sum of money there's been 93 million dollars of sales of v friends and i think he gets you know let's say at 10 to 10 to 15 stake a royalty on every sale um so i think it's pretty easy to estimate at the i think at the low end he's made 10 million dollars off of v friends at the high end it could be like 30 million so he's just like prolific let's say what it does he he decided to make a a nft token that he could own it and it guaranteed you one utility just the way we did the nft that said you get five minutes of air time on our pod someday by the way the guy who bought it reached out okay what do you say he's an interesting guy doing interesting things and so you know he wants i asked him i said do you want to cash that in or you're gonna hold and uh he hasn't replied yet the um uh garyvee did one where he said if you own wait is the buyer at my conference is the buyer just a rich guy is just like a rich crypto guy i think he's yeah i think he's like crypto rich basically not like mega mega rich not like crypto billionaire rich i don't think um but just like a wealthy crypto guy who's yeah like got in early-ish and has done very well and is now in doing a bunch of things so anyways gary vee's his nft if you bought it great you have this nft which might be cool as an nft you might like the art it might be might he might launch more products into it someday but at the very minimum it gave you access to his conference so it was a conference ticket in a way for uh that you could use and it was only i think the only way to get into the conference maybe so that's what he did and he hasn't even i think he just announced when the conference is to happen and it's going to happen for a guaranteed three years or something yeah so kobe kind of bumped it back but whatever so kind of cool so his latest thing he's got this new book it's called 12 something 12 things to be a good leader something like that i forget and he had a rule that or he created this thing where if you bought 12 copies of the book you would receive a mystery nft it's still to be determined what that nft or uh and token actually like what does that actually get you but he that's what he promised and so far as of today it is the largest pre-order ever in in publishing history he has uh i think as of yesterday he has sold one million copies of his book before it's even gone live and the people have no idea uh you know what what they're getting the way that he did it was he last night or a few days ago he did a three hour live youtube and instagram thing where he told people to buy the book um and his whole stick is basically like i don't ask for much and i provide a ton of content when i have a book come out i'm begging everyone to buy it so that's kind of cool and that's what he did and it's the largest book release ever and that is nuts that is so crazy so uh the way you and you know why people are buying this right you know why people are buying 12 copies of this book because oh did i not say the 12th copy they get one of these tokens right they get they get a mystery nft so he promised you that there's going to be an nft it's going to be good and it's going to be for anybody who buys i think i don't know if there's tears or what but like you know 12 or more uh books you're going to be able to get one and so um and so so it's kind of crazy right like that's and one million books is an insane number of books to sell very few books do a million a million copies i think um i was looking at this site because i i signed up to write a book next year with uh tucker max's thing and i was like okay so what's like good you know it's good like a hundred thousand copies ten thousand cop no i bet it's like a thousand they're like like you know some stat 99 point whatever percent don't sell a thousand won't even sell a thousand copies ten thousand copies it's like you know yes the best sellers do eventually sell you know like a hundred thousand copies and then there's things like you know like four-hour work week or in this category at least atomic habits i think atomic habits he did three million copies sold in the first two years or something like that and the biggest winner of the past five years is mark manson's book which one was that the subtle art of not giving a [ __ ] that book was so big that when i was reading the uh quarterly reports for who whatever it's owned by harper's which is owned by one of rubert murdoch's companies i don't know if it's fox or news corp but anyway they like one of their big things was talking about that book and how it's like saved their publishing business right uh and there's basically so so why did this work so uh one reason why it worked is because gary's been doing this for you know he's been building trust for like 20 years uh you know like i've known about garyvee for 10 years and i you know he didn't start then i don't think so definitely before that so he's built up a lot of trust and he's like maniacal about content production like he he creates so much content in addition to everything else he does um and it helps right the content helps feed the agency it helps feed all the things he helps sell books but like the amount of content he produces is wild so he built up this trust he was talking about nfts he's talking about trading cards before trading cards had their huge run-up so if you're like oh gary's time about trading cards i don't know about that i'm gonna i'm gonna hold off and see how it goes then you just see this huge run up in basketball cards then garyvee starts talking about pokemon and um then he starts talking about nfts pokemon goes up through the roof nfts go up through the roof and then you look at his tracker you say oh man he kind of was also big on social media before social media was obvious he was saying you know i remember when instagram got bought he went on the news and everybody's like underpriced he was like this is this is a steal and everybody else thought oh my god they paid a billion dollars it has zero dollars in revenue like what are they doing and he was like are you joking like this is a this is this absolute steal by facebook he was talking about musically and music how people were making how kids were making music videos before musically turned into tik tok and i remember tons of people making fun of them like okay you know great yeah yeah 12 we're all going to be like 12 year olds making dance videos in our bedrooms he was right so he's right on social media he's right on baseball uh on trading cards he was right on pokemon then he was right on nfts he started talking about nfts and if he's had this huge bull run partly because he a guy of his stature him and logan paul when they started talking about pokemon they started talking about nfts it actually drove a lot of attention into nfts a lot of adoption so um then he launches his own and you're like oh do i want to buy this v friends this doodle that he made it's priced at two and a half eth so he auctioned off the initial ones at two and a half eighth uh today the floor price meaning the minimum you could the lowest price you can buy it for is 8.1 so if you just bought if you just bought hit uh that's like do eight times roughly four grand so you know 32 32 000. um so basically you you're up almost 4x on you're up 3x basically on the last thing he told you about so this time when he says hey buy my book i'm going to get you a special nft you might have missed v friends you missed the nfts when i told you about them you missed you know the basketball cards before they they all got hot get this one right and i think if you have a track record of being early and right this kind of like fomo builds and people just start to trust you and i think that's what's happening right here is people are like all right cool i'm in i'll do this yeah and i think what i would like to do is i i don't know this but eventually i would like to do it is i want to look at what he's been wrong about so gary is right a lot but he takes a ton of shots and i was reading glass door reviews of vaynermedia to understand like what's what's cool about working there why people like it so much uh and they were saying like the the haters of which they're always be haters where it was like the negative reviews said something like he's always saying the latest and greatest thing is going to be the next big thing for example and then they named like four apps and i'm like oh i'm not even like these are dead those are cool like two years ago and so i'd be curious what what he's been wrong about but i do think that that he's likely right more than he's wrong and he's been right in big ways yeah um i was actually watching so he did another cool thing actually not to make this the kind of the garyvee hour but um he did an interview with mark zuckerberg which i thought was a pretty big deal amazing amazing it was so good yeah he was good dude steamrolled sucked too he kept interrupting him which the comments were just ripping him for he steamrolled mark zuckerberg yeah he somebody said in the comments they go uh gary's talking to mark about social like he's his big brother and mark's little brother but you know obviously mark's like we're like invented social networking and like runs runs the world um but it was true he really was kind of like all over him he's a better talker than mark right so it's actually kind of natural he's a better um speaker he's more engaging and he has he's quicker off the cuff and mark is a little bit more you know rehearsed and kind of thoughtful about his words that doesn't always play super well you know in front of a camera but uh what did you think of that interview did you hear anything that yeah i thought it was great i thought gary said something cool about how he's like i knew nfts were going to be big because of farmville and how people would pay for these badges and then he also referenced another facebook app that i didn't i don't know what it was but my contacts clues were like okay it was like a thing where you could like purchase a cool picture and he was like that's how i knew it was going to be big and mark goes you know i never really thought of that and i thought that was funny i thought that was pretty cool also mark's haircut was horrible as if they just like put a ball on his head and just cut the bangs around it what's he doing with a bad haircut like that it's all actually gary had a great line in that which he's like he's like basically mark's talking about like the the the metaverse you're gonna have this this avatar you're gonna have like your character who has its own virtual clothing and it wears that like it looks like a sim basically if you ever played the sims and he's like you've been living this life like basically like mark already looks like a sim like mark looks more like a character from a video game than an actual human being he talks more like a character a video game than a human being and he wears the same exact thing every day on purpose which is what your character in a video game does like black shirt blue pants and he said any and he nagged him but he didn't go into details but he was he was kind of like complimentary like you've been ahead of the curve but i thought it was hilarious um you know that he caught him on that in a way um all right let me ask you a quick question so i've been thinking about this something i've been thinking about we've had a bunch of friends talk about screen time limiting screen time and i've been thinking about this so i just did a very short amount of research so basically uh i was curious about what trends have existed where rich that separated rich people from poor people for example um in in the greek and roman era which actually i don't know what years those were actually um bc sometimes bc uh basically the you were rich if you were uh very very white and roman poetry would praise the white girl and that meant like the the pale and paleness was yeah it was a was a mark of beauty and um of social class and things like that because basically you're not outside working really hard of course uh that changed and in the 1960s like uh it kind of started right around that time where being tan meant that you have leisure you know you have enough time to go hang out outside and have fun and skin tone became kind of a marker of wealth and and during world war ii women were using tea bags as self self tanner coco chanel around uh the the 1930s 1940s talked about uh being bronze and being tan and so now it's like became popular b-tan so what do you think and i'll tell you what i think mine is what do you think in like 20 30 50 100 years is gonna be that thing my opinion is what it's gonna be is a lack of screen time so not like like it's gonna be like oh you use a computer no i don't know i don't usually yeah i think it's gonna be people and so like uh mark laurie talked about that i believe jack dorsey talked about that elon musk has mentioned it bill gates says his kids don't get screen time that's what he said yeah he said this a few years ago this came out i think he kind of backed off because it sounds really bad because like dude you addicted the whole earth to social media and you're like don't let your kids do it but let me see what the the exact thing is but i remember for sure um that he either limited or um or said you know uh said he wouldn't do it so dude i noticed that once i kind of got a little bit more success in my career like i don't check anything on the weekends and like some for like different projects like i'll get to it when i get to it like i'm just not going to check my email uh i i don't want to be on the screen yeah i remember it was a big deal when he said i think his kids were like under three at the time so it was like uh you're probably not doing a ton it was like my daughter's two she has a ton of screen time but like you know i get mark zuckerberg doesn't have to do that necessarily so he he was like yeah maybe when they get older as they get older i'm sure they will but uh but people were like hey you know the people the media sort of out to get you you know in this kind of case i've got i've got a couple like pretty wealthy friends and they'll be like yeah like our kid has never like we don't use our phone in front of them um we don't let them see a phone and then i you know i'll go and hang out with other friends who maybe aren't in that position and like we go out to dinner and they're playing on the phone the whole time and so that's my prayer i think it's already happening and i think it's going to happen the next 20 30 years there's a few more so there's actually um there's actually uh you know other ones so i think back in the day being fatter so having a big belly used to be a sign of wealth yeah because obviously you had enough like means to to eat food and you were you had a leisurely lifestyle and now it's the exact opposite right so like um you know having you know abs is more seen as a higher status thing than having a belly uh somebody you said i have a big nose people used to tell somebody told me once like oh back in the day that was like a sign of like great power and authority or something like that i don't know if that one really could change over time because you can't really control it as much i guess nose jobs but but i think you're absolutely right that these things shift over time that the status signals that you have shift and it's basically you want to be doing what the masses are not doing so um you know if everybody's on horseback you want to be in a car when everybody's on in a car you want to go learn horseback riding um that sort of thing same thing with like hunting like you know uh having others hunt for you and then now it's like a status symbol in a way to be able to have the free time and the skill to be able to go out and um go out and go hunting like have a hobby have a hobby like that i think that um i think you're absolutely right that being away from like the digital experience like how like being able to not have to either work online play online or talk to people online it's going to be a status like it's definitely like a status symbol because it's going to be so rare it's going to be rare more rare than whatever you know a diamond or gold or anything like that is because everybody is going to be completely engrossed as we already are halfway there in like kind of like the online world so having anything in the offline world is going to be like a extreme luxury and that actually like if in terms of like money making and business that actually like is an interesting trend to look at um there's this thing called the uh what's the dumb phone thing is it called a light phone um i keep hearing a lot of people talk about this thing have you heard of the light phone i i don't know much about getting it so basically if you haven't seen it the light phone is a really minimalistic looking phone looks pretty cool honestly uh looks very clean design it's like a very basic phone that doesn't look like an app it looks like it's all remember remember zune or microsoft it looks like the early cell phones but just like cleaner and um you know like a flip phone or whatever and basically it's just a phone that doesn't have apps so you can text on it you could call on it but you can't use the internet beyond that and um it's meant to be like hey do you want to like you don't want to be detached from the world maybe your kids or whatever like uh you know as you you know if you need to be reached for an emergency but uh but you don't want to be kind of like on instagram you know at the time i think it's a great idea the problem with it is kind of inconvenience with it which is like i think you need to like you need to be like switch your sim card every time you want to use it and [ __ ] like that if you want to use the same phone number so that's kind of annoying but um but i think it's great and i'm surprised this isn't bigger i think it was like a kickstarter project uh i'll buy it i'm going to buy it so we just did this nft thing and we said we'll do content stuff i'm going to set us up with the or i'll set it up and you can decide you want to go with the health thing with that executive checkup and then i'll i'll buy one of these uh light phones and we could talk about it i think it's amazing i think it's cool you can still use music i think it's really cool yeah i think it's great and what else comes to mind that's like this uh so what are some other things so there's obviously in-person experiences so travel meetings concerts i think that already kind of has like a bit of a premium but i think that'll get extended the premium will get larger the the rarity will get will get higher on on that because if most meetings just happen over zoom then you'll it'll be a special meeting when you make an effort to go fly and meet somebody face to face um same thing with a concert if you're you know going there and being there and experiencing it it's going to be one of those feelings you can really only get by doing that so it's going to become more valuable over time like i was talking to a comedian and he said like he's like dude i was worried like you know after covid what would happen he's like demand is roaring back he's like the demand now for shows is higher than it was pre pandemic and so you're asking what else is like this uh well the rich people poor people think what else could be kind of a status symbol i think i have a couple yeah i think like the splitting time thing between cities um it's still expensive but it's one place it's still expensive but it's not prohibitively expensive um so like i think that that's gonna be uh far more com i'm doing it now and i realize i'm like in a fortunate situation but i think that it's far more uh accommodating than ever before uh so i think that like that part-time living in in splitting time between cities is going to be quite common um i don't know what else yeah i think that's a great that's actually a great one uh it's sort of like if you look at what are what do our rich friends do now that's not common and then that's just gonna become like like more people are gonna do that thing so like you know like you're talking about having a few either airbnbs or like having three homes and just shift like throughout the year just shifting based on where you want to be in whatever season you want to be in and not having like a hometown um dude here's some more of a thing here's one and you're getting into it now i've been into it for a minute as well which is did you see this well kinda i tweeted out asking people to see to say like what what like i so i'm i'm building this house um and i'm like how would you optimize it for longevity health and fitness and i got so many amazing replies and the most consistent one was cold plunge and sauna so many people are interested in that and i think that that's a much bigger trend than i ever thought so i think having home saunas and in home cold tubs that is something that's going to be that's i think we're still in the early stages of that i never would have thought that that was going to be a thing uh yeah that's the i just bought a sauna by the way like two days ago i know i saw you what's his name andrew said like don't do infrared and you're like uh but i bought an infrared is that so okay yeah uh by the way there's a sick company so check this out is it uh david david's company florence have you seen this this guy just dm'd me who i'm friends with he spoke at hustle again he goes hey i just met with sean about my sauna business and i and he said this guy yeah and he said that you also like this type of stuff have you um did you go look at it did you see it that's sick uh he just said he he dm'd me a video and you want to explain what it was so basically uh uh floor so there's two that that got um that got uh they got kind of like highlighted here um where are you at the url is we are florins um how do you spell florins uh f-l-o-r-e-n-s f-l-o-r-e-n-s okay um okay so basically we are florins uh so basically what he's done is he's built a in a custom kind of like new version of an in-home sauna it plugs into a normal normal outlet which when i was looking up saunas that was like one big thing it's like you have to i don't have to get an electrician out here to handle the power of the sauna it's like small enough where it fits in uh it's like a great like like it's like made for like you know one person it could fit easily then there's a super nice like super clean design so like most saunas kind of look like this kind of same cabin looking feel this looks like it fits in like a modern home it's like very slick looking um and so he's building this thing and he showed me one he's got it i'm gonna go visit him he's got one down here not too far from where i live uh so then there's one then there's one in the presidio called ancient ritual have you seen this one that's the one i saw ancient ritual so and so there's two so ancient rituals the other one that people are kind of hyping up and i think that one is like almost like peloton for asana so you get in normally when you get into a sauna you're like on your own it's like dude here go sit in this this hot box and like think or you know talk to the naked guy next to you like i don't know like do whatever you want to do i think what ancient i don't know exactly what ancient rituals doing but i think what they're doing is it's sort of like a guided meditations they have sounds they have scents they have like um they'll talk you through like what to what to like it's like it's like calm or like headspace like meets a sauna uh that's my like prediction they're a little bit they're very stealthy there's like nothing on the website but that's my understanding of it just from uh figuring it out dude the florence thing is amazing yeah so i'm really excited about both of these i don't think either of these is like you know mega huge business but i think it's i think it could definitely be a really healthy business um and it might be one of those that surprises you maybe there's bigger demand maybe this is maybe this ends up like pools right like i think um our buddies are in the they bought a pool construction company who's telling me something like you know um like some absurd percentage of homes like uh 50 of homes or whatever in in areas that can host a pool like will get a pool in the suburbs and um and it's like a it's that's not the exact percentage it's like it's a 50 000 average ticket um it's the number one like kind of like optional upgrade to a house that that happens and um and so you know those companies are doing really well pool construction companies and so maybe if you fast forward 10 years down the road sauna and cold plunge is going to be as common as swimming pool is in america like i could i could see a world where that's the case i definitely could too so um i'll have to remember exactly what these the the study says but there's a there was a very reputable and famous study and it said two interesting things the first thing that it said was if you sauna for two 20-minute sessions a week it decreases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease by something like 30 or 40 percent a massive number then it said if you sauna for three 20-minute sessions a week it's gonna decrease it by like 60 like it's like the the numbers are like astronomical just from two to three let alone zero to two and so sauna's like i i i the what the way it works is basically like when your body heats up that much i guess it stresses it and that that's a really healthy and good stress and uh anyway it's pretty sick i'm all about that do you want to talk about these last two things you have on here i'm very eager what those are yeah let's talk about them by the way just to put an end point on this um like we talked about this because just we're interested in it and like whatever it's just this is our hangout if you want to be able to on the wall great but i would also say there's been a big lesson i've learned that is anytime people live anytime you discover a group of people who are very interested in and living a lifestyle that is different than yours it's very easy initially to write it off and just say oh that's frivolous that's um that's just kind of like whatever you know they're out of touch or uh they're weird or whatever like it doesn't really matter what what category it is like when i when i saw gamers and people who stream video games and watch other people playing video games it was so strange to me i remember making fun of this kid in college because i walked in on him and he was watching somebody else play a video game on a live stream and the guy was playing in korea and i was like you're watching a dude in korea play this video game why don't you just play better yet why don't you get outside and like let's go go get some food and i made fun of him for and then years later i'm like selling my company to twitch and like i'm i'm like talking about how great this trend is and he's like called me he's like you motherfu you know like i dude you made fun of me for this 10 years ago and here you are now like now you're on board and that's happened to me so many times in life that now i go the exact opposite way i see somebody like you who says the same thing that our other buddy said which is maybe i should go to the mayo clinic and get these advanced scans done once a year i think huh maybe that's something more people are going to want to do why would he want to do this why are people choosing plant-based lifestyles what is that all about you know like and so now i lean in any time i discover these things and that's become some of the best a like either like discoveries life changes i can make or b investments it's a great way to invest because you're actually on the like the cutting edge of stuff you're in early which is super important obviously there's a book on like a famous business book on it where he talks i think it's crossing the chasm or something where he talks about like early adopters and then like the there's basically this like bell curve of people where it's like in the beginning of the curve it's like late people who are late to it and then like the middles like the average joe and there's like early adopters and there's one more like cutting edge and you and i both have like a handful of friends of which i would actually say that i i forget the names of them but in that bell curve there's people who are getting names because you got the idea right but you uh like butchered all the names so it's basically the earliest is innovators and it's like the people actually like figuring things out and then there's early adopters then there's early majority that's the kind of like big chunk late majority that's the other part of the big chunk and then there's the laggards who are like you know people who still have aol email addresses and like you know are looking driving around looking for blockbusters and for a lot of things i would say you are on the right side you're uh either an innovator or the one next to it an early adopter and i'm trying to go i'm intent i'm intentionally trying to go that way so i thought uh you know i'm just not that i'm not like a futurist type of guy because i've been so wrong and i figured out the formula for it the formula for it is um have an ego make a prediction be wrong like five times and have it rubbed in your face how wrong you were boom you're not you're now a futurist uh like i remember the first time the iphone came out and i was like who the [ __ ] wants to like read tiny text on a screen like that's awful i was like nobody's watch a movie on this i was like yeah you can watch who would ever watch a movie on this like tiny square like that's like that would be the worst it's worse than an airplane headrest like i remember saying these things to people and you know like i was in college i was like a junior in college there's nobody remembers this but i remember being that wrong snapchat i remember being that wrong my username still has the word test in it because i was so certain i was like snapchat this is this is stupid right this is just for kids and dick pics and stuff like that like certainly won't go on beyond this bitcoin i was wrong early on right like guys in my office tell me about it back in 2012 2013 and i was kind of laughing and saying guys let's focus on something like legit here and now i'm like you know a [ __ ] bitcoin evangelist and so like twitch same thing i was wrong about streaming i've been wrong so many times that i've actually flipped the script now i kind of had to reassess my life and say i'm not going to be very good as a technology entrepreneur or technology investor if i just continue to write off the big things as dumb and stupid early on like i need to go the exact opposite way okay what would it take for me to do that and i just i just inverted so instead of you know anytime i see that the same feeling i instead lean into curiosity what's making people want to do this when i think it's so strange and now that's that's like flipped the script for me and we either had justin or emmet on at hustle con or on here and they were talking about justin tv which was the site before twitch became a thing and it was basically uh anyone could log in and create their own live tv channel and emmett i believe you could tell me if i'm wrong i believe the story was like emmett but like there's a small corner of the site where these like guys were watching video games and it wasn't a lot of people like thousands of people but they were spending two percent i think of the traffic um at that time but they were spending a significant amount of time watching and he was like that's this is the one that we got to go to and i don't even think it was that as data-driven actually the data pointed against it because again it remember it was a small trap it was a small amount they had a combination of two things working their favor number one emmett was like i guess actually the number one factor was they were [ __ ] the current thing wasn't working and they had like no like they had nothing to lose they don't they were gonna run out of money and fail or they had to try something dramatically different and um when you feel like you're [ __ ] and you have nothing to lose you actually have the one of the greatest assets on your side um which is that you know when you have nothing to lose you play completely differently than when you feel like you have something to lose so that was the first thing they had to change they the things that were popular were all like uh illegal streams it's legal streams of sports so they knew oh people want to watch this but we can't ever build a business around this yeah so what 90 of people are doing on this site we can't use the two percent thing worked and then the other one was he was like i personally like watching these so he's like i'm gonna go with that like these are my favorite things to watch on the network so if i'm gonna work on this i'm gonna work on the ones that i personally find you know the most interesting and actually most of the company wanted to go work on the hotter sexier idea which was called uh what was the thing called the video thing they had not vidi their their their version of that called social camp social cam so the company split in half they said all right justin tv is not gonna work abandon ship and we gotta figure out you know what's the what's the emergency ship and so they had this i think michael seibel who now runs y combinator and justin khan they wanted to do social cam it was instagram for video instagram is the hottest startup in silicon valley but it's photos we're gonna do instagram for video and they were able to instantly raise money they got tons of initial hype and traction and press and all the talented people in the company wanted to go work there so i talked to this guy jacob who's the og designer at twitch and he's still there he's still at the company today and i said uh how'd you know like to bet on twitch instead of social cam he goes oh no dude i wanted to be on social cam they were just like nah like we don't like uh team's full bro like you go work on on the thing with emmett because emma is his childhood friend he said you gotta go to that one he's like oh [ __ ] all right whatever you know so like that was what seemed like the great idea but actually what emmett did which was leaned into this really weird behavior unique lifestyle that these gamers were doing where they were streaming themselves playing for eight hours a day that turned out to be the thing and that's kind of my point which is like i think that there's like these i do it on online communities particularly reddit but you can right now you could do it on twitter or you could just type in like any idea or any hobby and type in the word forum and you could just find like these niche communities of people that are kind of freaks and it's fun to like learn all about it like for example intermittent fasting fasting is now like we all talk about it um i remember like eight years ago i remember business insider wrote an article about like a microsoft executive and they mocked him for the like intermittent fasting what is this and uh but there's there's been communities online where i've like read about people doing this for forever and you're like fasting like no like breakfast is the most important meal of the day just look at anything they make fun of silicon valley for at the beginning of coronavirus like vcs are so paranoid about the real world that they're wearing masked conferences guess what everybody's doing now wearing masks right oh my god intermittent fasting silicon valley's latest craze not eating till noon every day you know what a google what google engineers are doing right it's like making media loves to make fun of it guess what that's what everybody's going to be doing um you know what are some other things that are like that i think you know some of them are meditation by the way was like that too uh people made fun of it and then you know boom it's like the new yoga uh the other ones i think that that are happening are like stem cell or any like blood platelet spinning stuff where it's like oh you have knee pain well these guys they like go to puerto rico and like go to germany and like get this [ __ ] blood spinning treatment and go get stem cells injected on their knees that and uh now they feel good and gene editing i think is gene editing is one another one uh breathwork i think breath work is where meditation was i invested in this thing called other ships they just actually launched their app i use it every single day and um like i use it religiously because it makes you feel so good and to to the average person like i do it outside now after uberman was like get get some light on your eyes first thing in the morning so i do it outdoors um and i'm sitting in my driveway basically doing it and neighbors are walking by they're walking their dog what they feel is a very normal behavior go go for a morning walk and they see me like doing [ __ ] breathing techniques on my driveway and they think i'm a nut uh and i love it i go louder as soon as somebody walks by because i want them to know they live next to somebody from the future dude there's this guy his name was bill uh we'll there's this guy named arthur leonard he's uh he's dead now but in the 60s and 70s he was a new zealand track and field coach and he had runners like paul walker uh or not paul walker uh that's john walker uh peter yeah yeah peter snell and all these like new zealand guys who started winning the olympics in the 1500 meters 5k and 10k and everyone's like dude what are you doing with your runners and he goes we run like 120 miles a week we do long distance running and we go slow and we just do it just a shitload of it and this one coach from oregon got really interested and uh his name was bill bowerman and he goes well i'm the track and field coach at oregon university i have all these great runners what are you doing and he goes over to in the 1970s in new zealand and he learns from arthur leonard and he comes back and he starts making it popular and two things happen university oregon gets really good at track and field and he ends up um making shoes for his runners so they can run a little bit faster and he calls it nike he calls that company nike he starts it with a with another runner phil knight and the other thing that happens and this just it worked out perfectly is he starts talking about it to all of his friends he even writes a book about it and i believe it's called like the joy of jogging and the idea of jogging it wasn't even like a thing in the 70s people like what do you mean you're just going to run like art is it what yeah like aren't the police gonna go after you and and like like it was like astounding like prior to the 1970s right so there was a it was a jogging craze of the 70s prior to that people didn't go out and run that just like wasn't like a thing and so anyway that's like another example where like running became popular and bowerman created nike to kind of capitalize on it let's wrap up with this last thing here what's what is this i always enjoy your wisdom [ __ ] put yourself out there announce what you're trying to do and how you're trying to do it so this actually came from the facebook uh the zuckerberg interview with garyvee so garyvee goes you changed your name to meta you change the name company's name to meadows like you know like what's that about you kind of wanted to like announce this to what's kind of like the thinking behind that because i i think i get it but you know explain it and zuck basically said this thing he goes um he goes you know i think this is really important and he goes you know how it is when you run a company because you have you know hundreds of employees thousands of places we have thousands tens of thousands of employees it's really hard to get the message out inside your own company one of the best ways to get your company to realize you're serious about something is to go talk about it externally so that's the first thing he said and i thought that was so true when whenever a statement gets made publicly inside the company they also read that article they read that press and say i guess we are committed to this i guess we are i guess that is a top level priority and they start to take it seriously so all of a sudden the product managers start adding features for that thing or the top talent will switch to that division because they know that that's an area for growth for the company so it works internally then he goes the other thing is he's like you know we um we wanted to put a message out there to the world like he goes i think it's really powerful he goes we wanted to say what we were doing so that people who want that to exist will come work for facebook and gary goes yeah it's like a recruiting thing right he goes he goes yeah he goes it's kind of amazing you know if you just say what you're trying to do and how you go about doing it that like it repels he goes you get a lot of hate and he's like we always get hate anytime we announce anything we get hate um he's like so that's gonna come anyways and he's like when you say what you're trying to do what you're trying to build uh you know what you're trying to do with your life and basically how you're trying to go about it you will repel the people who find that off-putting and you will attract the people who want it and he said it so simply this is not a oh i've never thought of that or wow that's such a new concept it's not that but it reminded me of like a lot of good things that have happened in my life that simply came from saying what the hell i'm trying to do why i'm doing it why i'm so excited about doing it and how i'm planning to go about it here's what i plan to do because the other thing facebook announced was we're investing 10 billion dollars into you know the metaverse uh this year like into our ar vr projects and 10 billion is like a huge number and so that basically says we're changing the name and we're investing 10 billion dollars that means this is our future this is the bet and um and so that will attract talent now i just thought that's such a powerful concept for anybody it doesn't even really matter what the what the stakes are like i've done this when i try to hire interns most people want to try to hire interns they spend all their time you know they'll they'll write a blog they'll write a job post and then they'll like you know hope and pray the right person comes by and the better way to do it is you write a job post that would attract the you think about who the ideal person for this is and you say what would make them stop what they're doing and be like holy [ __ ] i gotta check this out i gotta go reach out i gotta talk to them and so now you're not going to write a normal job description that says the role the responsibilities the requirements minimum you also need to know who you don't want to work there exactly and it'll work out so like i put a thing up on twitter once i remember i think i've talked about this before on here i put up people [ __ ] on you people [ __ ] on me uh they present me for everything i do this one this one was i kind of like almost hand wrote it and made it look handwritten and i said hiring an intern i said you're gonna get three years of experience in the next 12 months i don't drink coffee so you'll never have to go fetch me some you're not going to know what to do i'm going to throw you in the deep end but don't worry don't don't worry i won't let you drown and i said you're going to work on this this and this for me because i'm trying to do x i don't know i still want what the startup was at the time is i'm trying to build x and i want somebody who can come in and do things like a b and c and who knows what else um and i basically was like you know whatever and there's a ps at the end and this got like hundreds of applicants to come in why just because i didn't write a normal job description secondly because i said it i said what the hell i'm trying to do and it attracted the type of people who who want to do something like that with their life you know they found they found an overlap between their interests it sounds again so simple but if you kind of check yourself you say have i done that when's the last time i put a stake in the ground i put a flag in the ground and said here's like i'm sampar here's what i'm doing so that you would attract like-minded people i think you kind of did it with the fitness influencer thing to be honest you go i'm going to do it i'm going to get away from this business stuff and i'm going to focus on being i'm going to become a fitness influencer i'm half joking but i'm also half serious and um and then you started posting the content every day and you started like doing it in public on facebook you post on twitter you post it and i'm sure some people make fun of you or some people leave kind of comments that are like slight jabs or whatever um but like you put it out there and i'm betting your dms are full of people who are now yeah it's sending you cool equipment ideas yeah flying out to meet you like that's just what happens when you do that when i when i tell people someone was like do you want to make money off this i was like no but like i would love like a professional athlete to think that this is kind of cool and be like oh i didn't know you like fitness you would have come over right uh or you know like achievement like he didn't find us this way but he's like oh you're into like you know the body and things like that that's neat i want to learn a little bit about the media business can i uh learn it from you um have you read the book 48 laws of power i haven't read it now but i've heard some of them and i find it weird uh like the summary basically the guy goes on tik tok i don't know how he's in my algorithm but the author robert greene he does like one individual power at a time on tick-tock and it always comes up but it'll always be something so generic that i don't know how to like it's like very weird he'll be like laws of power like um don't you don't want other people to like you or something like that it's like something it's like it's something like that and i'm like okay i don't know what this is dude why is this book so hyped his books are like so in-depth i believe that like in some prisons in some state prisons throughout the country and some states have banned the book it's it's it's incredibly interesting too powerful it's no for real it is it's crazy it's a crazy book and log number 25 i used to memorize the laws when i read it log number 25 and i just had to google it now i don't remember it that well log number 25 is to always uh or consistently recreate yourself and he says be the master of your own image rather than letting others define it for you and incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life and with this facebook thing as well as a lot of other things they get made fun of for doing that but these huge gestures oftentimes work out well like i did uh here's this little example of it i had a twitter bio for the last few months i just changed it but i know i thought it was good 10 million in rev or something i basically said every twitter bio i ever saw was like the past and i thought okay i see the value in that like it's good for somebody to land and know what you're doing but i thought what's more interesting is like what are you trying to do now i said how could i plant my flag just in the top of my profile and it was very controversial i think a lot of people felt i don't know they don't tell me but i'm i'm assuming there are there are a bunch of people out there who probably read it it was like this is kind of cringy or like why is he saying this is weird and there's some people that would deal with what was it all you did was said i want to make a hun no the business will do 10 million in revenue this year i said three things i said four things i said i'm trying to be in a great mood daily yeah i'm gonna get into phenomenal shape for the first time in my life i'm going to make 10 million dollars by december and i'm going to um i remember my last one was uh something else but those are the three there's something about fitness maybe the second one is getting phenomenal shape for the first time that and uh something else maybe it was like i don't know blah blah blah family something to make me sound good after i said i want 10 million bucks by december okay so i put that out there and i got i would say five really important messages from there of like really great connections that came out of it from people just being like yo like respect i respect you for putting that there uh i i might be able to help you with the fitness thing or i might be able to help you with i see you have the mood thing what are you doing for that i want to learn i'm like great i would love to teach it um or 10 million bucks how are you planning to do it how far along are you come on i get an email from one guy he keeps saying how far long are you getting close your thing is inspiring me my i set my goal too my goal is not 10 million my goal is 100 000 but i want to make 100 000. and so like it attracts like-minded people um and i and i i don't even think that that was that good of one version of this i think the the law 25 you just said is super important to like continuously reinvent and craft it and like play with it um don't get stuck in like whatever you used to say three years ago or even three months ago necessarily if it's no longer the the most badass exciting fun version of you and what you're trying to do do you um and what does it say now you want to build a 100 million dollar brand or something yeah so i'm building a 100 million dollar brand and i put that i'm investing in company badass companies like xyz what are the odds that um what so you're building a business right now which we purposely don't talk about it but you're building a business right now that's in a totally separate field than you are in now if yeah if you you being like media uh media different than anything i've done before also yeah yes and many people including me well i haven't done this but this is something i would have i would do would say well what the hell just focus on like the main thing yeah um but do you think it's gonna work out like it seems like it might work out right yeah i think it's gonna work out um i'm pretty i'm like i think it's gonna work out i the reason why i mean i started with my wife so like i wanted to start a business with her i thought we had the idea together i thought that would be fun i never did it normally i would go work all day be super like you know excited and stimulated by like all the [ __ ] there she's not into tech she's not into like the stuff i'm into so i'd come home and you know she'd say how's your day and i'd be like ah it's great like you know it's hard to much further in depth than that right so this was a cool thing we could do together while we uh you know like had our first two kids and i got two little kids now so that's why i went into this very different thing and also as a challenge and also we have a couple friends that also do e-commerce and we're doing really well with it so i thought okay i can learn from them and and kind of we can bounce off each other bounce ideas off each other would you sell it next year for like 20 or 30 million dollars no i think it can get to i think it gets 100 and like i think we should just go all the way that's pretty awesome and you're enjoying it still it's not exhausting uh it's a pain in the ass tons of times but like you know overall yeah like somebody like our buddy uh suli who um who i talked to and kind of like look up to his business mentor he was like he really wanted to advise and help me with it and i was like okay um why do you want to do this like you know your time on this is not gonna not gonna pay off like you know you have if you just spent that same hour in your other business or in one of these other 10 things it's just honestly it's more valuable for you and as your friend like i don't want you to make a decision today that is actually a bad decision he goes uh like don't worry about that like he goes i'm basically you know like i was like you could just be having free time he goes uh yeah i don't this is my free time he's like i i'm only happy when i'm in a prison of my own making i thought it was a badass way of saying it he's like you know i don't want to do nothing i like doing hard things challenging things as long as i get to choose what the hard and challenging thing is if it's something i don't want to do and it's even remotely harder challenging i'm like a whiny baby but when it's really hard but i chose it i i picked this poison then uh i have so much fun like i just wake up every day energized and i was like wow that's a great way to know yourself yes well um we can wrap up there i think what did you uh where's ben ben what do you think i think we covered a lot of interesting things i like the the philosophical wisdom [ __ ] yeah the end was really great it got my wheels turning about like what i can build kind of in public how i can put myself out there more i love that part i think building in public is overrated by the way i'm gonna do it with this ketchup thing but i think it's overrated you know it's better than building in public just doing cool [ __ ] not talking about it and being private [Music] yeah that's fair um i'm actually i'm doing both right now i have one thing that's in private and a bunch of stuff that's in public and i actually like them both um ben what if i said what if you were gonna put yourself out there what are you trying to do how would you put your plant your flag so that you could like a magnet attract like-minded people to you what's your what's your version of i'm banned and here's what i'm trying to do right now well so i mean obviously a lot of people know about my podcast already how to take over the world and uh i'm trying to make it a top 100 podcast in the world across any country so we're trending in the right direction but uh i haven't really put that out in in public yet and uh i guess now it is so there we go sam asked an important question every every goal or dream should have a time associated with it yeah you always have to have it you know so what what would be otherwise you know it's a it's an endless wish so what would be what do you want um how much time is left in 2021 uh we got six weeks yeah uh let's say in six weeks what's that let's uh i got a little more than a month all right everybody go subscribe if you listen to this go subscribe to the how to take over the world pocket it's honestly an amazing podcast that's why we've run some episodes on this feed before uh all right we'll get you closer um and i think you know like if you just said all right i think one of the reasons people struggle with this question is they feel the pressure like oh [ __ ] this is my purpose in life or my mission in life i better get it right and actually you want to do the exact opposite you want to treat it like a kid when you say what do you want to be when they grow up and they say i'm going to be a dinosaur i want to be a firefighter i want to be a pizza man i want to be a pizza and it's like okay the best way to get to this statement is actually to put zero pressure on it and say it out loud and then say it all out again say a different thing out loud say like play with the ideas until something sticks with you and hits with you and then you say okay and then how do i juice that if that's the dream on level seven what would it be on level ten what would it be if i turned the knob all the way broke the knob off the volume thing and it's now at like volume 12 accidentally what would that be of this of this podcast like what would it be right now if you cranked it up but by the way i feel like we both put ourselves out there of like putting a number to it meanwhile sam is like i'm just gonna be a fitness influencer but like where's where's your number in timeline saying um no i have one [ __ ] it's to be away 185 pounds by january 15th come on okay okay i have it written down on this piece of paper that's not that's not an influence that's not an influencer goal that's just a fitness goal that is where are you at now so you're at 196. sam's basically saying in the next two months i want to lose 11 i want to lose 11 pounds but i'm more i'm you know he's already like you know somewhat in shape so you know i don't know if it's i don't feel like a body fat thing or whatever so now what will that attract it'll attract other people who also want to lose weight or have just done it right those are the two people that are going to reach out to sam hey me too or i just did it you can do it too here's what i here's what worked for me and so like that's the power of doing this and of saying it out loud is convincing yourself and ben don't come at the master when it comes to goal setting okay i'm the self-made i'm i'm the man i'm a manifest cowboy baby i get it done i just want to know when you're going to have a hundred thousand instagram followers sam that's all i want to know the manifest cowboy is hilarious my buddy uh has the best nicknames i just discovered because he he showed up for this thing and i was like dude you showed up like i thought you'd be late and i thought like you know you might skip it today because you didn't have to do it and uh our other friend was there he goes that's why they call him mr show up and i thought he was joking and then literally someone called him mr i was like is that your actual nickname mr show up and he's like yeah he's like that was the thing he's like he's like anytime somebody needed like whatever was a ride to the airport oh you know like you need to ride home for the airport i'll be there just give me 15 minutes i'll show up you'd give them a throwaway invitation to a party be like hey i'm going to this thing um but uh you know you won't know anybody there and it's two hours away and like it might not be fun he's like cool i'll go and they're like you showed up to the party like you don't know anyone here i can't believe you showed up and that became his reputation who is this guy is this guy dom that i work with i love this guy and he's like i thought that nickname mr show up like i wish that was my nickname because i can tell you one thing mr show up is gonna win in life because eighty percent of life is just showing up and uh and and if you're mister show up you're you're acing that part of life that's hilarious um i think it's gonna be a good app yeah i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

* Focusing on What Is Most Important by Pomp - https://pomp.substack.com/p/focusing-on-what-is-most-important

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
i've heard uh a phrase it's like basically what rich nerds do on the weekend everyone will be doing in 10 years right yeah and that's exactly what this is i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want [Music] on this episode we are talking about the bar stool sports drama dave portnoy versus the world we have a billy of the week this guy brian johnson who to me is kind of like the elon musk you've never heard about we have two business ideas one around an e-commerce idea and then another one for restaurant drive-throughs and then we end with a funny story about this dog walker that went to sam and we play a little game called how much is pomp worth where we guess how much our friend is worth because he just gave back all his investors their money and he's just gonna invest his own money from now on so that's the episode hope you enjoy did you see sean that people were tweeting saying they liked what they liked hearing what ben had to say and then he retweeted that as he should dude i retweet every compliment not every comment but if i get a bunch of compliments like if i check my phone and there's a bunch of compliments in there one of those is definitely getting retweeted uh yeah i think it's obnoxious when other people do it but i also notice it and so i'm like oh this is effective obnoxious but effective we uh we have some cool stuff to go over today but the coolest one is the dave portnoy stuff yeah let's talk about this i've been wanting to talk to you about this same since it happened and it's still happening so that's great it's like there's just more that's come out and also i think you surprised me because i think you're not i thought you would be so pro dave portnoy and i think you're actually not from our text messages so first explain what happened and then we'll we'll debate it okay so let's start with if you don't know who dave portnoy is dave portnoy is the founder of a company called barcelo sports they're basically known for like smut bro comedy that's actually pretty genius and i'm typically a fan of it it's like if espn was drunk this is what they would this is the news they would make yeah exactly um that's a great way to describe it and dave portnoy is a he's what this isn't an insult but he's kind of like trump in that he's like ridiculous and he's got fans that will do anything for him and he plays this part that's exaggerated and silly and and just overboard and everything he does um so the business insider released an article last week on friday or thursday coincidentally right when bar stool which is owned by a publicly traded company had their earnings call they released their article at the same time and it basically was an eight-month investigative journalistic piece where this woman named julia black spoke with loads of people who had sex with dave portnoy and this is basically him or her or both the girls dming dave and dave had there were screenshots that said something like do you want to be famous if yes i'm a good place to start so like saying like some silly ridiculous douchey stuff and the women saying like i would love that yes i'm in and they have sex no problem but in the article some of the women accused dave of having basically rough sex nothing like illegal i believe was he was being accused of but basically like saying like he spit in my mouth i had to wear a leash he filmed me things like that not illegal then hearing this dave gets livid and he goes on a scorch earth war mode where he goes after business insider and he mocks them because their founder henry blodgett years ago got in trouble with the sec he goes after our friends morning brew because they are owned by business insider and he is just going crazy on everyone and the fans of dave portnoy are attacking these people like crazy and it's become a little bit of a frenzy and it's pretty wild that's basically the summary right yeah i'll fill in a couple of uh tidbits so so dave is what do you need to know to admit to having to have an opinion on this so dave is not married he's a single guy i think he's in a relationship now but like you know he's a bachelor right so he can do whatever he wants he's a rich guy he uh he's just he's in his 40s and so there's always this kind of like it's not illegal but is it wrong thing when it's like a guy who's 40 something i don't know what is he 44 or something like that one of the women was 18. uh 19. 19 i think yeah 1920 something like that so you know there's always this sort of thing where you're like uh okay it's not it's not illegal but is it right you know some people have an opinion on that all right but whatever he's known for being like um like i'm not like a loudmouth but he speaks um he doesn't like pull any punches so he's direct he uh i think he's a fairly honest guy um and he's honest to the point of uh fault sometimes so for example the news the news story hits what a 9 out of 10 people do especially ceos of companies presidents of companies he's not the ceo he's like the chairman or president he um you know you're supposed to sort of lay low your publicist will release a press release that says you know we categorically deny any wrongdoing um you know the truth will come out and uh and you let it blow over and you hope you didn't get cancelled he did the opposite so he comes out immediately on instagram live or it's instagram ig tv and he just says look my lawyers say don't say anything but i'm going to say exactly what's going on here um so here's the deal these guys have been i've known for months these guys are putting out a hit piece because they contacted like dozens of people that i've been with and they said they're fishing for something bad about me and then these people would come tell me hey dave you know there's a reporter asking around for you know if if you know if you've done any wrongs to me and i said no because you haven't but like just so you know this is what's going on so he knew this was coming finally it drops he addresses it directly and he said he basically turns it on them he said you try to cancel me i'm gonna cancel you and so all of a sudden on twitter cancel business insider uh is is running because he's like look you're trying to profit off of this story you you act like oh which is part of the story which is this article is paywalled it's payable and they're sharing it like crazy they're putting tons of ad money behind this come read this story about dave portnoy the bad guy we are exposing the bad guy but you just gotta pay 9.99 a month if you want to read the story so he's like dude you're using my name and likeness you made up this story where there's nothing wrong um you know these are consensual relationships with legal adults um you know he's like i feel bad if somebody felt bad after we hooked up and they they didn't like me or they didn't like what that they did it like okay that's that's one thing but this was a completely legal consensual thing what are you digging up here what are you trying to say and then he goes on the he goes on the offensive whereas most people are on the defensive he goes on the offensive so he's getting people to cancel their business insider membership he's getting people to unsubscribe to morning brew unfortunately a bunch of people started sending death threats to our friend and people who work there and that's not cool and he's like go buy my pizza my pizza's out in stores let's go go buy a p there was another angle to this by the way that really pissed him off so i think he was a little bit mad at the hit piece and then i think he went scorched earth once the there was a reporter for business insider that started reaching out to barstool's advertisers and saying hey are you aware of the story we wrote about how bad dave is and and business and at bar stool like you know would you like to comment on being an advertiser on their platform basically trying to take money out of their pockets trying to get the advertisers to to to cancel their relationship with barstool which is not journalism at that point that is like warfare as far as i'm concerned and it is warfare as far as dave is concerned too so that's when he went really like nuclear so all right and let's let's say a few more facts here and um a few more facts i'm gonna try and be as factual as possible but you know i'm gonna be i'm gonna paraphrase at one point he did a live thing on youtube and he made jokes but i don't know if they were jokes where he said something like you know i think i'm gonna hire a private investigator to go and follow every single morning brew employee and find everyone who they've had sex with and see if there's any dirt there right and what else has he done that that we didn't say that was like part of the facts well i guess we should say what is the the sort of the the the crime or the wrong doing so so the business insider article made it sound like a girl goes to his house knowingly that dave wants to hook up hooks up with dave feels shaken up about it afterwards because it was kind of kinky and crazy she sleeps on the couch she leaves and a few days later she tells her friends that she's feeling depressed and suicidal and uh and her mom i think is the one who went and reported to the police and said dave is a bad guy you guys need to be on the lookout for him and the police are like wait what did he do um you know and it's like and the mom's like he's i went to the fish market and they said that he's here with a different girl every week and it's like all right you know being a player in a crime you know that there's no crime here ma'am like i understand you're upset that your daughter you know had a bad experience but that is not a crime you know and in a follow-up on his feed he tweeted out a picture that she sent him afterwards that said like i want to get with you again he he basically leaked the dms and the dms were basically like they hooked up okay she slept on the couch then she she shared a photo online of her with dave kind of like to get the attention from her friends and whatnot on social media to get the likes uh you know her kind of posing next to dave and then also you know he was like you know do you miss me and she's like ha ha yeah and you know she's basically they're like planning their next hookup you know and it you know never happened so he kind of he he sort of the insider article made it look like he traumatized slash you know almost raped these women but then he released the dms which were basically like them joking around after the fact and saying uh you know you know do you miss me uh you know when are we gonna hook up again blah blah blah and the girl's definitely like down as far as the dm's got now that's not to say it wasn't like you know a bad experience or weird experience but again that's what the allegations were so that's what that's what came out now i wanted to get your take on two things one is this offensive versus defensive strategy what do you just think about this in terms of the art of war so what do we learn from something like this because cancel culture is everywhere i think you and i both don't like it we don't like the general quick trigger that exists with cancel culture and how like how that's just becoming more and more common uh for a variety of reasons but then how do you deal with it what's one to do so so what do you think about this offensive versus defensive strategy there's two parts to the story there's like the actual deed and things that he's accused of and then there's the reaction so in terms of like i think from just the article it's clear he has done nothing illegal um i don't agree with what he did and i personally it i find it to be a sleazy and unethical move that said my ethics don't exactly to hook up with somebody much younger than you or what bothers you i think that's weird yeah i think i think a 45 year old fooling around with a 19 year old i think that's a little weird um but but i think p that's people's right to be weird right the law there's a clear like cut off you could do what you want right you're not putting me in a leash in bed but if that's your thing that's your thing there's that who you gotta say i don't want my daughter to be part of that i don't want my family to be part of it i wouldn't i wouldn't do that to people and i don't really want to be friends with someone who does that so i don't agree with it i don't want it in my life but people can do what they want as long as there's adults who are consenting that's cool there's a difference between you did something wrong and need to like you know not have your job or your company needs to suffer and you need to go to jail there's like your reputation needs to be besmirched versus i don't like that behavior i don't want to do it myself and i don't really want to hang out with people who do that right those are two totally different responses and what you're saying is more like the second one which is i don't want to do it and i don't really think it's cool i don't want to hang out with people who are doing that but you know you're not saying that uh this guy's a trash bag totally uh well i don't know if i'm do i think he's trashy yes totally totally i do but that there's nothing wrong with that right yes just because i don't like it yeah there's nothing wrong with that you know everyone can live their life straight bullet here i had to hit her like that so i do think that he's trashy but that's his right you could do that now the reaction i think is totally inappropriate uh and i think it totally makes him look butt hurt i think it makes him look weak i think it's a bad move the reason why it's a bad move is because dave has fans and he could be like well you know i'm only maybe he could say he's only joking maybe he could say um you know i'm not saying that i'm gonna do something bad right but i didn't believe this until i had someone close so we're i'm friends with the morning brew guys and i see how i actually they didn't explicitly say this but i think that they're fearful that something bad's gonna happen because dave's fans are gonna go after them i actually believe that might actually happen and because of that i think that like when you have that great responsibility and that power of these crazies so we'll do whatever you say you have to act careful and i don't think that he's being careful i think he's being harmful additionally the guy a lot of the people who work at that company morning brew is just like my company it was like dumb 24 year olds who are like talented but like inexperienced at life and don't know how to handle a lot of like stuff because they're still learning i saw dave like tweet at some of the young people who worked there and i was like i mean this this guy is just an instant bystander he didn't do anything wrong why are you making fun of him i think it was i i agree with you i think it was a big mistake to go pick on the little guy he had it right at the beginning when he was picking on the big guy oh business insider you're you're trying to ruin my reputation you're trying to hurt my business and my advertising my revenues and my my name and you're trying to profit off that it's a good move to go after business insider the brand the big name the ceo of that who's like you know some 50 60 year old guy who's rich and successful you know okay that's fair game um but when he was going after morning brew that's a different company bro like that's a this is they didn't even that's not who wrote the article just because they own this asset like you know that doesn't make any sense if they own a rental property somewhere you're gonna go deface it like you know that doesn't make any sense so i thought that was a bad look and i thought that picking on those founders who didn't say a word against him picking on the employees of that company now you're punching down and so i think that was his tactical mistake in this art of war i liked what he was doing i also disliked the which is like hold on stop there yeah stop there swinging below that's the rule here swinging below you can't do so like when you're trying to create an enemy you always got to go up right you always have to go up if you go down you're a bully if you go up you're david yes exactly uh and so he he had he had the momentum on his side because he had um you know he was the one being picked on he said i've done nothing wrong and he has fans and he could have set mobilized the army if he had stopped at cancel insider go cancel your membership over there because these guys are just trying to make a quick buck on the salacious story that would have worked um that would have been you know the good version of revenge and then he went to the bad version of revenge okay so that's the offensive verse defensive let's say that something happened to you and um you know would you do you think you would go on the offensive uh or would you be a lelo kind of guy offensive offensive for sure yeah i think it's good to go on the offense even though uh like i guess have you ever had a situation like this come up where you had to kind of go on the offensive thank god no uh i don't think so i don't think so uh okay good i'm glad if you ever need to go on the offense if i got your back because that's the other thing he did it all himself whereas he could have had other people kind of go to bat for him and create a little bit more uh not just one man versus the world um i also see you have a business idea here what is your business idea wait i do there's one under here i don't know did you write that maybe some maybe ben wrote that uh it says it says business idea twitter beef as a service is that you oh my god no that's not me but let me wait let me tell you one one thing or there's some more facts here this story that is actually quite interesting so a publicly traded company bought bar stool like uh they bought part of it like two three years ago maybe a year ago i forget exactly i think recently they announced they're gonna buy the rest of it so how much uh of bar stool does is made up or how much a pen the owning company do you think does bar stool make up ah that's a hard question i don't know i know the answer okay yeah go for it i think it's like eight percent so if you like in terms of like revenue and value what's pens uh what's pen's market cap nine billion okay so bar stool was bought for 600 million i think i think and their revenue is probably 100 pens is probably like uh five or something like that whatever it's a so it's a small percentage however barstool makes up a significant amount of the like brand equity of pen right so like no one has known i mean very few people knew about pen it wasn't they don't they it's a regional casino yeah i believe it's regional it's like on the east coast now it's a global name because of barstool and because of dave so i would argue that while it only makes up five or ten percent of the actual metrics for business it actually um accounts for like 60 70 80 90 of the brand equity so here's the thing the stock went down i think 30 the other day when this got announced in my opinion i wouldn't want to own this stock necessarily because i think more of these things are going to happen however i think there's a the pen is actually an interesting buy right now because if barstool only makes up like eight percent of the their business and business is doing pretty good the business of barstool the ad business would have to go away almost entirely for this to make up like a meaningful impact and yet the stock went down 30 this might be a good stock buy right now i was i was looking at the map it might make sense to buy this stock stock market sam i love it stock pick at the end of this segment uh yeah yeah i just i think i think that's probably right uh i think barstool is is uh this is gonna go away and you know this 20 dip that it's taken is not uh that's not that's not a permanent thing but i would say um a not financial advice before we get sued and b um i think that this is gonna be something you see over and over again you see it with dave chappelle right now he's going on the offense uh you saw with others would they just disappear they'll lay low for a bit right louis ck or you know the different different people who got canceled and they go disappear for a while then they come back two years later and they sort of beg and apologize and try to get back in the good graces of things i think that uh i think that going on the offensive is gonna become much more the norm and uh you're gonna see you're gonna see that now he is perfectly positioned to do this because he is like you said a trump type of character he always speaks what speaks his mind he's always kind of you know off the cuff he has devoted die-hard fans that will believe him even when he's in the wrong they'll back him up and so you know i think that that was uh that was working in his favor here if you're the ceo of pen how do you feel right now and what do you do i don't know who we should look him up i can tell you his name is jay he's a young guy his name is gonna say if i could just look at the person i can figure out uh no it's jane jane ciccotti or something like that yeah that's what i mean jay or he's like a youngest guy he looks like he's in his mid 40s maybe it's a girl jane the ceo of pen yeah ceo of penn national gaming jane skagetty or something like that well for the there was a guy who oh yeah i see you tomorrow the guy that you see his name you see jay snowden yeah he was the guy who was like uh he's he's the president and chief officer and director of pen gaming since 2020 i don't know what's going on i don't know why they have two okay whatever um you know i think they're probably like you know a bit nervous about this whole thing but um you got to know who you're getting in bed with when you buy barstool you know it's coming with the hair on the deal and the hair on the deal is its greatest strength which is that you know the the big personas the no [ __ ] given attitude towards content well they're using this content also he turned he turned scandal into more content but do you tell dave to chill to cool it or do you just stay out of it entirely you got to have them find the line right that's what i'm saying we're saying we're showing some points where he crossed the line in the wrong way so there's like you know don't turn this into an actual legal problem and b um you know make sure you're doing this strategically in the art of pr war here you need to be punching up not punching down you need to be don't stick your your you know don't do do you teach him an incident you teach him or do you say dave you cannot do this again strike one like do you are you disciplining him or i think you're good you're getting in the car you're sitting shotgun with him you say okay look i know how you feel right now and normally we would say this but i know you don't want to do that you don't want to just kind of hide away and let this thing blow over okay we're on board but let's set some ground rules right we want here's how we want this to end right it's like a negotiation with a uh with somebody who's got he's taking people hostage it's like how would you like this to end um you know do you want to get out of here do are you trying to hurt people what are you trying to do and okay i can help you get there you want a pizza let me order you a pizza right now you need a car you need to get away car how about you let someone out and then i could work on that car for you um that's that's the way i i would be talking to dave if i was uh you know jane cicada dude these businesses when you when you buy media companies hubspot did it with us and we're not anywhere near as extreme but when you like this whole thing of like every company is a media company when you start getting to that territory i think it's good but a lot of people do it not realizing that these are some of the consequences right yeah you're in the media all the time all right let's do another let's do another segment i got some ideas for you i i wanna i want to do some business ideas so i've been looking at um i've been looking at a bunch of e-commerce companies and i'm in e-commerce myself plus invested in a couple and just friends with a bunch of store owners and we look at kind of the numbers and i look at some business that are doing well some of them are not doing well and i wanted to share with you an idea that i have that i don't know if it's a really dumb idea or really smart idea i can't tell you okay you tell me which one do you think it is okay so in e-commerce e-commerce is amazing because there's way less friction you don't have to go into a car drive to a store spend the time you don't you just you can be on your phone on the toilet you're shopping and you push two buttons and hey it's gonna arrive in two days that's kind of a magical amazing thing what's the one downside well for the the downside is it's hard to know if the product's any good or bad because you didn't see it you didn't feel it you didn't touch it and you don't know if you could believe the reviews but even more than that uh in the whole one huge category of e-commerce is fashion and apparel and in that fit is the number one thing like you know you're wearing a black fitted shirt right now it fits you very well but you don't know are you a large an extra large a medium in different brands it's always different and isn't that just like kind of a crazy thing that we just don't know what size we should buy like that's like the stupidest reason for that it's crazy it counts for like 40 of returns or something ridiculous like that right like i think it's crazy returns account for like you know somewhere between i don't know three and ten percent uh you know of revenue for these brands and then of the reasons for returns it's not that it was defective it just didn't fit right and so what how do we solve this problem okay so i invested in this company bolt that does one click checkout and it's basically like hey why do you have to type your freaking card and address in every single time if you do it once we should just let you check out again saving that and you know you don't have to create an account with every single merchant like does it work for shopify so shopify has their it has their own called shop pay and amazon has their own one click checkout this is bolt the reason it works is because it's for everybody else if you are not on shopify you're not you're not named amazon then you probably want to offer the same level of like frictionless checkout but um you can't get people to make an account with your little leather boots company you know maybe they made it with this jacket company and now they should just be able to check out at the boot company even though the jack and the boot company are two separate things all right so bolt is kicking ass and it's multi-billion dollar company already and they made checkout more frictionless okay so how do i make deciding to check out more frictionless so here's my idea i think you got to have a brick and mortar location i think you basically put up pop-up stores a court you put up actually like nice kind of showroom style stores in la you know sf new york you just go through all the major cities go to the top 20 cities and you open up in downtown a fitting booth and it's called the perfect fit or true fit and what is true fit so you go in and this thing is going to measure you head to toe using the whatever the best goddamn technology is in the world for scanning a body and knowing its exact dimensions like a tailor measuring your crotch and all that it's going to basically measure you automatically like a when we get like a dexa scan or something like that you go lay down in this thing and it's going to measure you for five minutes and now you have your true fit and any store you go to you could just log in with your true fit uh or just saved in your browser and saved on your phone and basically it just gives the store your exact it knows what your exact sizes and fit is and maybe even your preferred fit like do you like things tighter or looser yeah do you like it you know baggy around the stomach or tighter on the stomach right like maybe you even have that level of preference and then every store it's like an api so every store would just say oh cool like just like we all have the metric system we have this like standardized system that we can say oh i can i know how to describe the length of my thing because i can use the metric system i can use inches or millimeters or whatever it's going to be depending on which system you use but we have these central systems so i think we need one for fit and i think if you created this you could just say you come in you get scanned for free and now you're going to have better fitting stuff better fitting shoes clothes jackets all that stuff on every website you visit and then you go to the websites and you say hey would you like people to return less of your stuff would you like them to know exactly what size to get without having to go look at your size chart and then go measure the you know how many inches their chest is like yeah that's really ridiculous and so now you just ping the system the system says this person should be a large in your in your stock in your clothing uh and your your brand so that's the idea what do you think of this so i think it's amazing let me let me one thing look up zozo's suit z-o-z-o suit i've seen this before the this is it's the motion detector thing it's like they send you this black suit right well how does this work it's a rich guy right doesn't this billionaire create this yeah so i'm i'm going off memory i think it was four or five or six years ago and it was a guy in japan he was a successful entrepreneur i think in the clothing space i think he owned some type of like fast casual japanese clothing company right and he created this suit and it was either free or like five dollars and basically it's a body suit so if you've ever seen like behind the scenes of uh of like loiter rings when they're filming on the green screen or have you ever seen like a bob like a bobsledder or something like how they have the suits that go over their head it looks like that but it's all black and has polka dots all over it and you put it on and then you hold it up your camera up to it your phone and it's supposed to like figure out the dimensions of your body and he was gonna mail one of these to like everyone in japan or something like that and it failed i don't know why it failed i just don't think it worked that great yeah however that are you looking it up when was that now was it like five years ago yeah i don't know where the time frame is or this but i remember you told me about this multiple years ago because you were like dude i thought it was amazing crazy and so i thought this was such a good idea and there was people uh so i used to go to uh great.com i think it's still going october 29th 2020 so last year one year ago they launched the zozo suit two um so you know they're still going with this i think it's great and i remember going on reddit and i would like on reddit there was these subreddits where you could buy and sell like fancy clothing and i would buy and sell clothing on there and there was these guys that would kind of bootleg it where they would download the app and then use the the suit to just like get their own measurements and then they would just like write that down and then they would like use that as like their way to do sizing and i actually think that the suit would i don't know the technology behind it i think you could do a better job though than what you're describing and it's freaking amazing if it works right um but it i i don't know if it worked well but if it does work the idea of this is awesome and people were also using it athletes were using it for their like body measurements and you could like use it to see if your muscles are growing or not growing additionally there's this one scale that never really took off but they had a kickstarter and when i saw it it was amazing but it was a little too expensive for me to try before it got built and basically it was a scale that looked like a normal bathroom scale you stand on it but then this arm came out and it does it like there's arm that comes out the bottom and it does a loop around your body and like wraps around your body and it would use a camera to scan your body and they would tell you all about if your measurements are going up or down i thought that was amazing i love those things um and i thought that that would do do you remember that scale yeah i know what you're talking about it's called like naked or something something like that um didn't didn't seem to catch on but uh i think there's something here yeah it's called naked nakedlabs.com and i think yeah i think i think it's harder to do as a startup i actually think that this is better to do if you're amazon or or your bolt like this might be my free idea for bolt hey hey guys here's what you should do uh you've raised hundreds of millions of dollars you should you know you might have to pour 40 50 million dollars into developing this network of stores that has this technology that basically all day is just measuring customers but it's also in this case it would be driving people to put in their information so now they can just check out bolt anywhere and um you know you're on file but you did not just have their payment info on file but you'd have their size info on file so now i would buy so much more stuff bolt becomes more valuable to every merchant because it not only stores payments but it has their customer fit information and i also think that this is not the easiest thing so it's not just about scanning the body because you actually kind of need to see how the clothes fit on somebody so you'd almost want if you're gonna do this perfectly and i don't know if it's a good idea or not but you'd almost want like 10 shirts that are like the stock shirt fits and it's like okay try these five on yeah that looks good on you do you like how this fits yes okay you are um you are a size medium specifically this many centimeters uh you know all your or your measurements are here and you prefer the fit of x so we know how to translate that now to any brand how any brand can use that against our standardized measurement system and so um so i feel like this is kind of an impractical idea but i just wish it worked because it would reduce friction so much in shopping it would make people way more willing to shop so way less returns we asked mark lori mark lori was the guy sir jud.com sold it to walmart for some many billions and we asked him what's an idea that you would work on right now if you wanted to sell it a hundred million dollars and two or three this is it right this is what he said and this was it he said he goes the the number one problem the number one um cost that our company has at wal you know walmart.com the third or fourth or second most popular econ website in the world the number one thing is returns due to bad sizes so if you figure out a way just to help us save that just a little bit we would pay a whole lot of money for that right and you know you actually could do this where you could if you weren't techy you 100 could just open up small shops that were like two or three thousand dollars a month in rent have two tailors there and um and then go out to some of the bigger retailer brands and be like hey will you put our our uh our logo on your site and help us and there's scrappy ways to do this you might be able to partner with existing stores and you just have it you just have like a booth and you have an agent there who can do it uh so you may not even need the space but all right this is one that's one idea okay let me give you another idea uh future of shopping continued so um i don't remember where i heard this but i heard somebody's talking about this and i just it was like a no-brainer moment for me okay so we all know that like you know software keeps getting better robots keep getting better and it's sort of like uh what's gonna happen to all these trucking jobs if they're self-driving trucks what's gonna happen all these retail like check cashier jobs if uh you know like the amazon go store where you just walk in you pick up an item and you walk out and it just knows from what you picked up off the shelf how much to charge your amazon account right like kind of amazing and i think those are two of the most popular jobs in america as truck driver and um like retail cashier and so uh okay what what what is like even further down this so here's the easy one that i thought was kind of cool um restaurant drive-throughs so restaurant drive-throughs you know you go you pull up you roll down your window and they say oh yeah welcome to mcdonald's what can i get for you today and you're like um you know and let me get the number three they're like you know what do you want to drink blah blah blah so why do you know what a number three at mcdonald's is a number three at mcdonald's i'm gonna go with a double cheeseburger what is it i think it's a double cheeseburger or a quarter pounder number one's a bigger neck it's probably quarter pounder number two is the two cheeseburgers that was my that was my order number three is quarter pounder i'm more of a chicken sandwich kind of guy so that's what i get that's like a separate thing yeah yeah there's like the shitty fried one that's like the eight and then there's like the kind of like less fried one artisanal one yeah there's one with like a tomato on top now you're healthy um so so the the idea here is like why does that person have to be in the store like they don't they don't right like we have zoom we're doing this podcast in two different cities you know 100 miles apart um why can't why does that per why isn't that person just at home on zoom just taking orders from me in every location so there's no down time all right we talked about this before there's these things that look like segways but with like an ipad screen on it and there's like a woman who you could like talk to and she's like rolling around the store those have never taken off they've never taken off they've never taken off i know why by the way we had one in our office uh so we had like one of those programs it's called the double it's called double robotics it's the name of the company and at first it's like oh wow this is cool like you could be working remotely but you're like you're the remote manager and you're just wheeling up behind people's desks and you're like hey hey how's it going and then they turn your faces on the ipad and like for for for real simple reasons it doesn't work which is like hey it can't go upstairs so if you have like any stair in any of any part of your office they just can't get there i can't like open doors um you know so if you have like a meeting room it can't get in uh like the ipad would die and it's like ah [ __ ] ipad's dead right now okay we're gonna have to go charge this never mind just just call me and like that happens three times and then you just start skipping the robotics thing because you're like just call me dude like we always end up on the call anyways for one of these five reasons and uh so just skip that whole step so it never really took off but it was too complicated it was too fancy the drive-through thing you you don't even see the person anyways they're literally just a speaker no there's a speaker in the wall when you give them money you do yeah because that's a separate person right that's that's like that's their other job you know that's like they do this other thing you know and while they're trying to give you their change of talking to the next person in line this should just be like imagine the downtime so like you know one of the reasons that like uber is expensive is because there's a whole bunch of time that a human is driving around without a passenger right because they're driving from one trip to the next same thing happens in drive-throughs there's like there's like time in between cars in between orders but if i was remotely i could be working at five locations at once and anytime somebody has a person there i just hop i just connect to that screen i talk to them i connect to the next stream there's no down time there's this crazy stat where i think it's like one in 16 americans have worked at a mcdonald's have you ever heard that no but i believe it it's something like 1 in 16. you know mcdonald's is one of the largest employers in the world and it's basically like they call it like like internally or even externally like when you're applying for a job there they call it like the world's greatest first job and so like the whole shtick is like we're really good for just we know you don't want to be here forever yeah and they embrace it and i think that's smart and when i think about my my aunt i um i have an aunt who's been a cashier at a grocery store for uh 40 years that's just was her job she still is and when i think about this stuff about the self-checkouts and not having someone there uh at drive-through and how like i i'm almost positive it's one in 16 americans it's something shockingly high i have worked at mcdonald's do you think that you have an obligation as an employer to continue doing some of these minimum wage jobs just so you exist to like further society along otherwise if that isn't the case then you got you're gonna have to do some type of universal income or something like that yeah it's gonna be creative destruction and it's gonna be rocky before it gets good and i think you have to let the progress happen so you know here's how this is going to go today in california they're paying you know like if you go look at any mcdonald's or chipotle or whatever it's like now hiring please please [ __ ] come work here 24 an hour and it's like wow 24 an hour for this like this is not a minimum wage job that's like three times the minimum wage so and they're still having trouble with getting people to come work there california is like 15 california's higher now but it's still double it's like double the minimum wage and so uh and that's for mcdonald's so what does that mean you know that's just going to cause prices to go up or it's going to cause some stores to close because they're just not economical when you have crazy labor costs and so um so what's going to happen is that's going to go to first they're going to do the remote thing that i talked about which is instead of paying somebody 24 in california they're gonna find somebody in nebraska who can zoom in and say can i take your order um as long as they can say can i take your order and push a button then and they're willing to do it for twelve dollars from at home that's gonna happen and then that's gonna get replaced because they're gonna be like i'm tired of paying the schmuck twelve dollars what uh oh amazon just released its alexa product for all brands and i can just uh i can just have it be like an alexa where it just asks a question and then just auto like figures out what i want um cool like just like at airports you know people checking at kiosks now instead of at the front desk like the companies are going to go this way they're going to go towards automation because it just makes too much financial sense i don't think you should get in the way of progress but are you are you bored with remote work no dude i'm so [ __ ] bored i'm so bored i like you i miss people i miss hanging out like i miss it so much i feel like i have way less friends right now um i miss it so much i am so bored and like i find myself going to target like three days a week just to walk around and like see stuff i go to whole foods like all the time like i purposely won't go like once every two weeks or once every 10 days for a big trip i'll do lots of small errands i go to the corner store all the time i find myself just like going i'm like let's go shop i just need to get out and i need to be around people and if the people went away from that i would also be pretty bummed um that i would be pretty bummed out well i think it would just shift right like okay so now with all this free time what do you go do you go do something else and so you go do something else that gives you that people hit uh you'll you'll unbundle the socializing part from the like cashier part you know like okay the cashier can become a robot so i'm gonna get my people my people hit from something else and i actually think there's gonna be a whole new job that is just basically like software supervisor like i just think that's gonna be a job like software is going to replace what a lot of people do but then it's going to get stuck and it's not going to know how to solve some problem or it's not going to understand somebody's accent at the drive-thru and then you as the supervisor are going to step in and say hey human here yeah i can help you out sorry about that sorry this stupid software doesn't work well and uh i don't want this to exist i hate i hate that i hate it i hate it but i i i agree it's inevitable inevitable for sure and i think there's a whole set of jobs called software supervisor or like robot repair or like robot manager you're just gonna manage robots it's like what is my job i used to have to walk around and pick up these things now this machine in this warehouse goes and picks up everything i just have to watch the machine to make sure it doesn't hit something else and if it gets stuck or it needs you know some grease i go grease it because i'm a robot manager that's what i do and that's going to become the normal job yeah i agree with you i think it's going to happen um can i show you something cool really quick yeah what else you got all right ben hit it [Music] a million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars [Music] all right we got an interesting segment you like that this is billy of the week we're gonna i'm gonna talk to you sean about this guy named brian johnson um i showed you this guy um let me give you a little bit of background about who about who this is and i'm not actually going to talk about his business so brian johnson started a company called braintree if you are an entrepreneur or you work in like ecom or anything that takes payment braintree's you probably know what it is it's a payment gateway it's basically stripe but different uh he bootstrapped the company for a long time raised a little bit of money once it was already quite successful and then sold it for a huge amount of money and this was like five years ago i believe they also bought venmo braintree but yeah solid to paypal and if i had to guess at this point he's probably worth at least a billion um that's how much money he made i think he sold it for like six or seven or even yeah it was 300 he sold it for 300 a few hundred million yeah so something like 300 more like 300 i think oh got it okay so he's in the range maybe he's very wealthy so this guy is incredibly interesting and because he just launched something called blueprint so if you go to blueprint.brianjohnson.com his name is brian b-r-y-a-n brian johnson he's doing something pretty amazing basically he's spending all of his time right now trying to lower his biological age so his chronological age his real age i think is 45 his biological age is 35 and he's measuring all 70 plus of his organs he's measuring nobody knows what this is what what the heck is a crime so chronological age is the number of years you're alive right that's that's what that is yeah and then what biological age is what yeah so frankly i don't i'm not entirely aware of how they measure it but i know that i have one using i use this site that huberman who was on our podcast promote it it's called inside tracker and it tracks your blood and different parts of your body and it tells you what your biological age is and i think they do that by looking at the averages so but frankly i'm not sure but they basically like you can be 50 years old but have the body of a 40 year old and this biological age thing it's like a standard way of measuring but i don't know what all goes into it and so you're right 800 million is what he sold it for okay so i'm on 800. so you were right about that so let's go to this guy's thing which is by the way this guy's doing something else too he's basically creating um like a neural link which is like the same thing elon musk's trying to do it's like a brilliant it looks like a helmet and you could like think something and it happens exactly so you can think like it can just read your brain waves and it can cause something they can type out a text message off of a thought that'd be that'd be the dream or the idea and this new thing is this blog where basically he's basically measuring everything in his body and he said lebron james said he spent 1.5 million dollars a year to improve his body i'm spending more than that i've developed all the tests i've got as much money as you could possibly have my whole goal here is to lower my biological age and i test all my organs and when i test them i put all the results here so anyone could do it and he lists his diet his workout everything and he listed his diet let me just read what he had for breakfast breakfast was super veggie he basically had broccoli cauliflower spinach mushrooms garlic and salt and vinegar ugh that was his breakfast lunch lunch leafy greens veggies berries seeds and nuts dinner was nutty pudding i don't know what that is almond milk macadamia nuts chia seeds blueberry raspberries pomegranate juice that's it and then he lists all of his supplements children's hemoglobin uh yeah he's like eating like crazy stuff and he's jacked so he's 165 pounds he's probably only 5 10 6 foot so he's not like huge but he's i think six percent body fat he has his body fat all there and he has like all i don't know how you you know i don't you can click through this and you can see all of the attributes to each organ and things like that um so i don't understand a lot of it but it's incredibly fascinating and i think it's fascinating because a i just think this is interesting but b i think i've been saying this for a little while i think what this guy is doing is going to be very common not in five years but like maybe in 15 or 20 or 30 years and the reason why i've always thought that this is weird and this is like the biggest problem one of the biggest problems we have as humans is basically how often have you heard the story of like a person just found out that they have cancer and it's like stage five stage four or whatever had they known it could have been cured and it's freaking crazy how reactive we are to health and not proactive and so i actually think that what he's doing which is proactive it's going to be the future i don't think it's going to be this extreme because like i've always said this like even though like you know drugs are bad like you still got to get [ __ ] up sometimes so you can't be eating [ __ ] macadamia nuts and chicago mushrooms every goddamn meal like you know what i mean you got to have some cake and like some tequila once in a while so like i'm down to get [ __ ] up once in a while but i do think that like this is pretty cool this is amazing uh i can't believe i haven't seen this before so it's new it's this is like two months old this is one of the most amazing things i've ever seen i'm just clicking through right now and like i don't want to do this podcast i want to go read all of this and i want to see what's amazing right so there's i i totally agree with you that um the future looks more like this than it does like today so uh like it is crazy that we don't know what's going on inside our own body in fact there's a question that you can ask yourself which gets you to think a little bit differently and see the world a little differently which is in 50 years like today all right let's say we look back 100 years ago so 100 years ago was the year 1920 and um how many things in our day how many things that that they did back then would just seem so primitive right so it's like um okay but did you say 50 years ago was 1920 100 years ago so 100 years ago 1920 right so let's say um 100 years ago i don't know what what's i don't know the exact timeline of things but like uh you know 1920 like uh alcohol it just happened yeah so uh smoking was far more common you could advertise cigarettes to people you could smoke you could smoke anywhere you want so that was quite common um like there's a whole bunch of things like so all the things we do like if i look at my day today it's like well no there was no internet there's definitely no cell phone there was definitely no i don't even think there was um like i don't even know like could women vote like i don't i don't know when all these things happen but like it was just happening right around then world looked very different let's put it that way so uh world looked very different and um and you know but it looked it felt completely normal at the time and so and so if you if you think about if you go forward you say okay cool so then you know um you fast forward to today and then you go forward a hundred years so you know when i look back and i see slavery i say wow that's crazy i can't believe that was i was okay or you know the hot when the holocaust was happening i can't believe people just stood by while that happened and it's like what are the holocausts of today and it's like i think so for personally for example i believe that people will look back and be like you just killed animals all the time you just murdered them for food like you murdered them for lunch for that number seven i don't think we're gonna we're gonna do it we're gonna we're not gonna necessarily do it about that but i think what they will say is so you would just like raise these chickens like a million of them under this barn and they would be [ __ ] on each other and like you just like or these cows they're like born into this pen and straight from the pen they go straight to the butcher where they're killed as a veal like you treated them that way so the mom never like i think that we're going to be like i can't believe you i think that's how people people are starting to feel that now right that's like where you know like a lot of the kind of vegan plant-based stuff comes from is you see what's going on in a farm you're like this is horrible um the horrible from like a moral ethical level you know like i like for example my wife's vegan and i was like yeah okay you know like i get it killing animals to eat them is probably not good right that is killing a live thing and like i love my dog and if i spend time with like a horse i kind of like love that horse too like cows you know like they're not that far they're not that different right like um yeah i guess i could see how if i had to if i had to like think about it emotionally that would be feel really wrong okay but what about you know just like having milk and eggs it can't be that bad right like what's wrong with milk and i love cheese what's wrong with cheese and then they showed that like uh you know like you know earmuffs if you if you're sensitive you can't handle the stuff but basically the way that the way that the videos i was watching that were like how how they get milk it's like milk basically a cow gives birth to a baby they then separate the baby from the mom they put it like nearby enough where the where the mom can hear the baby crying for milk but it can't reach it so the milk gets produced like at this like much higher rate or whatever and first of all to even get them pregnant they like artificially inseminate them they like basically like rape them with their arm with a plastic bag over it and uh they just keep them pregnant year round so they're just constantly pregnant in order to constantly be producing milk and then they're constantly taking the babies away to cry and then they go kill the baby for food and then they let the mom just keep milking so it's like yeah it's a pretty messed up thing you know like if once you know it's pretty hard to uh i'm down i'm down to kill him to eat him i just i would like to treat him a little nicer before we kill him what i'm saying is that's going to be like that's going to be like you know i that's going to be seen like i i like my house slave like i treat them well like i feed them i think that's how it's going to be seen 100 years ago i think the way we treat animals today dude we've been eating animals since the beginning of time i don't think it's going to change it's going to change you're on drugs i think we're going to feed them nicer it's going to change because we're going to have a good substitute which is lab grown meat so people are going to be able to make make the make the same steak you want without killing the animal and then in that case killing the animal is going to look absolutely barbaric it's going to be only a hobby sport it is not going to be the way you feed feed the population so god i think you are so wrong about this okay fair enough but there is a thought experiment that i believe that in hundreds but i i think we are going to treat it i think we're going to treat them better i totally think that that's why i remember trying to buy yes before we murder them yeah dude i'm i'm higher up in the in the food chain i'm going to eat you i think um i've been trying to buy a cow here have you ever you know you could buy like a whole cow like i you can drive to the farm here in austin and like see like the farm and then you pay like ten dollars or eight dollars yeah and you could like buy the cow i've been trying to do that because i i think that's a good way to do it but it's i have so okay anyways so my point is there's you can think of a whole bunch of things one what else is going to seem barbaric i think the health thing that you're talking about right now which is that you can't you don't know what's going on in your body at any given time like it's [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] crazy they're gonna be like so you just you were just winging it it's like yeah you know we go to the doctor like once a year and we just say hey is everything all right once i said you've been to the doctor bro dude don't go to the doctor dude then don't go to the doctor i've been a doctor in like five years i've made an appointment and i missed it because i was late you know i'm late to everything i'm late to this podcast i was late to the doctor and he could yeah like i haven't seen a dentist in like 20 years for sure a dentist you can miss me with that so there's basically like you know there's no point but but i'm down to have like some chip in my body or some blood sensor that's like i want to at all times know what's going on my body i just don't want to go to the doctor so um that's going to be seen as crazy that we it's like people who it's like if you go drive around without a map or something it's like whoa where you renegade we're going to be seen as the ultimate renegades for having just like lived life not knowing when there's cancers and blood diseases that are just floating around in our body and like hope we caught it in time you know oh we didn't that's too bad you know it's crazy to me so have you heard of the um the the mayo executive health clinic or the health check i've been thinking about doing it it's like i'm gonna do it i'll do it with you explain it it's like five grand let's use our uh let's use our and our nft money and do it so basically yeah yeah let's do that it's five or six thousand dollars and it's posted by the mayo clinic and they have locations in probably where's mayo indiana i think notre dame is that notre dame and i think they have another one arizona arizona is the closest one is it arizona but describe what it is because i didn't know about this until buddy told me and i was like oh [ __ ] yeah we should do that yeah i've been thinking about doing it but i wasn't sure if it'd be beneficial to me at my age i thought maybe it would be more beneficial a little bit older but basically you spend five to eight grand and you go to this mayo clinic a hospital ultimately uh in arizona and you stay there for two nights three days and they just do a ton of tests on you so you get mri done you get all your blood work done you get i don't even know i mean you just they have a list if you type in mayo executive health checkup or something they have it and basically in order to get so when we sold the company i had to get this thing called um and even before we sold it i had to get it because we were big enough to where like if sam if me if i got sued it could be bad for the company and so we would get this thing called uh board of directors insurance have you heard of that yep yep and so it's cheap it's like a thousand dollars or five i forget how much it costs and if you're a little bit older um or you're unhealthy it's what i think sometimes you have to get one of these cl one of these things done in order to qualify for that health insurance or to get a discount on it and uh basically you go to this place and they do a ton of different [ __ ] on you just to see like what your health how healthy you are and you're supposed to go once a year right and so you do uh does it say what the scans are so there's a bunch of preventatives what they are yeah like cardiovascular okay whatever this is not gonna tell us anything uh but they test for like you know like metals in your body or like other [ __ ] that like you don't get at the normal doctor and it sounds like you know over the top like i really wouldn't really think about it but the person who recommended it they were like hey um like you know we're now like all like 30 plus and um like you know [ __ ] happens like hopefully not in your 30s sometimes in your 40s getting to your 50s 60s 70s it becomes like a probably type of thing and they're like you know we've been fortunate to make some money like the best use we can do of our money is health and so like let's just do this thing let's just do it every year we'll make a fun trip out of it and uh let's go get this screen done and like let's just stay yeah he's trying to get he's been trying to get ramon to do it i'll do it i'll i'm gonna do it yeah so so we should uh we should book this thing so let's go back to this brian johnson thing okay so he is basically monitoring his body at an extreme level and it looks like he's basically measuring the health and age of his organs of his individual organs and then he's looking at if i take this you know 30 micrograms of melatonin before bed how does that affect x it's like you know the quantified self nerd stuff but on steroids on you know on like this is like the most extreme example i've seen of it it's the most extreme example i don't think it's a good way to live because like it it's it's uh you have you probably don't have that much joy no no this isn't for the normal person this is for the like the human population needs like point one percent of the beginning yeah to be this weird and do these tests and push the boundaries and like live in the future like there's that phrase um i forgot what it is i have a simplified version of it the simplified ver the complicated version is like the futures future is already here it's just not evenly distributed um but i just say the future is really it's just not everywhere which is like the simple way of saying that right like it's like this guy's living in the future we're just not all living in the future right now like the thing he's doing we will all know this level of detail about our bodies i've heard uh a phrase it's like basically what rich nerds do on the weekend everyone will be doing in 10 years right yeah and that's exactly what this is uh this is amazing have you seen a picture of him look look at look at his like look at him without by the way this is like yeah he's insane so he's six feet tall he's 40 something years old and he's 3.5 percent body fat he's insanely ripped but he's always good and he said that he said that wasn't optimal he goes that was too low so i went back up to like 6.8 yeah yeah it's pretty sick click that video i found six point eight low so i went to 26. look there's a picture of him there's a video of him dunking or like jumping up there heavy like he looks great man this guy looks super good he is to me like you know like elon musk gets a ton of worship because it's like wow you're the genius billionaire inventor and you like say dick jokes like you're my hero um and it's not that this guy's like better than elon or elon's worse than this guy nothing really like that but man i love finding these guys that are like they're not like they're they're no different like this guy is just as smart has been super successful he is absolutely ripped which like you know something like elon has not been prioritizing that you could tell so it's like this guy lives a different lifestyle but it's like this guy will have one one millionth the fame of elon musk right now you know what i mean like if i go look this elon musk i think he's got 2 000 followers on twitter let's i'm going to dm him yeah like we should have him on because i think this guy's fascinating and like we've actually talked about it before by the way we did him as billy the week before this because he told the story about door-to-door sales and i went on this long rant about door-to-door sales and how i thought that was like an amazing hack for hiring anybody who's done well with door-to-door sales so elon musk 63 million followers brian johnson i think he's like two three four five thousand yeah like uh let's see he's okay he's at twenty seven thousand so he's not nothing but in twenty seven thousand sixty three million is uh like uh i think he got a bunch because he went on the lex freeman podcast and that like really boosted him but yeah he's basically like you know one one thousand uh more than one thousand times less famous but i think these types of people are like way more accessible way more interesting to learn from and just more fun to be a fan of than just being a fan of you know the yankees type of thing yeah all right let's get them on it's this guy's fascinating um he he's very interesting and uh ben by the way he's a mormon right so uh so ben you're basically related to him ask your cousin if he'll come on then yeah don't you know him um all i can say is i'll see what i can do yeah like you definitely you definitely have a cousin isn't there like a group chat basketball camp with him or something 15 million of us one group chat yeah yeah like your social network or something you you surely have you have something just for this we do have a social network actually no one uses it but we do have one what is it what's it called i don't even know just tabernacles it's a it's a it's an app that was made by the church by the church called nature yeah i'll look that can be uh next episode i'll tell you all about the yeah just the church app just column sounds like a business opportunity if the mormon social network exists but nobody's really using it i feel like all you got to do is you know airdrop some tokens and uh and all of a sudden people will be using this thing like yeah by the way did you get either guys you guys don't own uh by the way just ask mitt romney for an intro he knows him she is yeah there's definitely a group chat for like the successful super successful mormons they all took the blood out oath do you know what an airdrop is no i see everyone talking about it and i'm too afraid to ask okay so basically an airdrop is this amazing thing in crypto where you just wake up and then there's thousands of dollars in your wallet that you didn't have the day before and so that's what happened yesterday is anybody who owned uh what's called a dot ens the ethereum name service which is basically like a you know you could have dot com dot org dot io there's a dot ens now and so like when i did my crypto week i was like oh i want to have my like my name space in the in the on the blockchain like the ethereum world so i created a a e s like how much money did you get so i got like four grand yesterday just for having i only have one i have friends that have like hundreds of these names they they made like fifty thousand hundred thousand dollars yesterday uh just you know you you bought this thing like you know i paid a hundred dollar gas fee or two hundred dollars of gas fees to get my name and uh you know that thing paid off with like a 4 000 airdrop so basically the the organization that's behind this they created their own token yesterday for that will be used to like vote on how this thing works so like in the domain world there's like i can you know what i mean like it's this this is committee called i can and i can gets to decide when there's a new domain which is [ __ ] like dot photo or dot business sub dot dot is such [ __ ] so that's the governing body right and so with with the crypto world it's decentralized so the way it works is everybody who owns a name gets to vote so if you're if you're a user you get to vote and so how do you vote you vote with your tokens and so they dropped they airdropped a bunch of tokens to to everybody and so everybody made a bunch of money nobody's going to care about the vote it's like reading the privacy policy of a website you're just like yeah yeah agree agree agree sure i'll i'll vote with the majority no problem just give me my give me my free money please uh but this happens all the time in the in the crypto world is if you own an asset the group that made that can airdrop more tokens to you and those have some market value uh associated with them like that happened with board apes if you had a board ape they airdropped you this potion that you could give your ape and turn it into a mutant and that potion and the mutants basically it just like doubled the value of whatever you own so you owned a thing that was worth i think the cheapest one right now is like 150 000 it's at the time they were like 50 000 and you be people were basically getting a free 10 to 20 dollar item air dropped to them by the organization it's kind of insane now that bitcoin's 67 grand what um how much your net worth is in crypto i don't even calculate it anymore like i don't know i don't care over 50 percent uh probably yeah probably because you know i basically started it my goal was to put in 25 i think put i put 20 in and then i started going up so much i just i stopped at 20. and uh you know i should have just gone all in i should have gone all in like i believed and i should have gone to 80 what about what do you think what do you think pomp has how much crypto do you think he has he says he was 90 crypto but i don't think he had a ton of money at the time and the question i have is like he then started making easily a few million dollars a year over the last let's say three years i wouldn't say easily i would say i would say two to three million a year if i had to guess right right so that's a few million dollars a year for the last couple years so that's like let's say after taxes and all that good stuff let's say he got another four or five million bucks out of um you know all of his content sponsorships and all that good stuff courses that sort of thing the question is did he convert all that into bitcoin as he was going or did he hedge uh if he converted it all you know that means he's got i would if i was gonna place a guess i would say that if he when he was earning that bitcoin's gone up about 5x since then so if you had four million dollars gone 5x that's about a 20 million dollar stake at that part not not including whatever you had before that so i would guess the guy's net worth is probably i'd set the line at 30 million dollars the liquid net worth um not including good not not only the ownership of the startup studies startup investments that he made that are you know speculative and illiquid at the moment yeah i mean that'd be a home run but that could be awesome what do you think would you guess that i'd probably say lower if i had a guess i've got no information if i had to guess i would say 15 15. um and i think when he started the like um the like before he was pumped the brand name you know like a lot of it depends on what was your base right so like well he said in his art he wrote this amazing article about how he's quitting um yeah that was fun it was a great article you shared it as like uh just great writing and i agree with you i think you shared it yeah um and it was really good and so basically pomp's came on our pod a couple times we should have him on again um and he is this personality who has a sub stack has a podcast has a a fund where he raised i think a hundred million dollars and he basically it was with 100 i don't know if it was 100 but yeah go ahead something well tens of millions let's say he wrote a letter to his investors saying i'm shutting this down because i want more free time and i want to spend more time doing what i want so here's your money back he goes i don't want to be a billionaire i want to be a time billionaire and i love that i completely agree with that move that's totally the right move he basically said without saying that i was unhappy because i was addicted to screens and i don't want to be like on this dopamine game anymore which is so common we've been hearing that constantly we're hearing that a lot not surprising the pendulum is swinging right we all got addicted to this substance and now you know some of us are coming off of it publicly uh i read it a little bit differently here's how i read it i read it like this which is it doesn't really make sense for me to invest y'all's money now because i kind of got enough money on my own that i'm just going to invest my own money and not have to deal with any of you guys and i don't need to like play this game of fees and carry when um which will just make me want to like i have to raise this bigger and bigger fund deal with more of you guys have to like deploy more and more capital which takes more time like if i just invest my own money at this point i'm going to do much better i'll make more money because i'll own 100 of my upside and secondly i don't have to keep i don't have to deal with any people i don't have to deal with anybody i don't have to go fundraise i don't have to write updates i don't have to do any of this stuff um so i kind of read it which was just like that made when i was famous but not rich it was great to raise a fund and that was the only way i could invest a bunch of money but now i'm rich and famous and so i don't need your money anymore because it comes with problems right like it comes with has your has your mini fame exhausted you no not at all but i don't even really i don't even feel that famous uh at all so i don't like it you're like all the time to do [ __ ] yeah but i just say no i just say no all the time so like i me too but i find it to be tiring like it keeps me up it like for example this young guy i lived next to a university this kid knocked on my door last week and he goes hey i was wondering do you have a dog like i want to make some extra money uh i would walk your dog for you and i said [ __ ] egg good hustle i appreciate that i'm not just going to give my dog to you though write up a letter tell me all about yourself and put it in here and i'll determine if i think you're a good fit and he did it and i've been losing sleep each because i'm like i don't need someone to walk my dog but like i want to give this guy a little bit of money how should i say i've been like keeping up at night like it's been keeping me up at night for like five or seven days on how i'm gonna like reply to this guy and i get messages in email and i'm like and sometimes i get it from people i love and they want me to do stuff and i'm like i don't want to do this how do i say no you should just say look uh you know i would just be you should just say completely exactly what you're saying which is i think your hustle was awesome which made me want to say yes but i also realized i don't i actually like walking my dog i don't need somebody to walk my dog so let's do this um i'm gonna pay you for a week of walking my dog you don't have to walk my dog um because i want you to be rewarded for what you're doing because i think it's really great and i remember when i was you um so you know here's this money uh i need to sleep easy at night and i also want to walk my own dog and uh hey if you ever want to like do something else uh you know like maybe if i ever have like a job for somebody who's who i need a hustler to do something i got your number and uh just some of that you'll make his day and then you'll be able to like chill out and not have to think about it yeah that's awesome i was gonna just i'm just gonna venmo him like 50 bucks and be like uh i want to reward you make it a magic moment for him so like uh this is a game i've been playing and i think you should do this as much as you can i'm really just giving myself this advice which is let's say there's a situation like this and like you could give him you could just say no you could be nice and give him 50 bucks but what would make it feel amazing is like probably just like a little bit more than 50 bucks and some message like the thing i just said which will make him feel like oh [ __ ] this guy's awesome and like he re he saw me for being awesome like i got validated for this hustle that i was doing um like there's tony robbins tells the story of like he was in this restaurant and uh the waiter was great he was like had a big big group it was like a big family dinner and everybody needed a different thing and the waiter was so kind and he was just hustling and he was making everybody laugh and he did this magic trick for my daughter and like he was this young kid 21 years old or something like that and he tells the story he's like at the end of the dinner i already knew like hey this waiter was great and i'm gonna leave him a nice tip but he said who would you say who did you say did this tony robbins and uh and his kid is like uh somebody suggests something or he realizes he's like you know what i'm not just gonna leave him a tip what would make this a magic moment for this kid all right how can i do this he goes all right guys when this guy comes out with our with our to-go boxes or whatever like the final thing we're gonna this guy's been amazing right we all agree this waiter's been amazing we were gonna give him a standing ovation in this restaurant oh my god and he's like gets the whole table to stand up they just start cheering for this guy as he's coming forward he's like what is everything okay he's like and then he just says he goes i need to talk to your manager he's like what i it brings the manager over he says look uh you know i've been coming to this restaurant for a long time this is the best experience i've had this waiter was amazing and he really just made the night for our family and i just want to thank you for that thank you for hiring this kid he just kind of like made the kid feel like a star and i think the story goes on which is like i think his daughter ended up marrying this guy or something like that like it ended up being some crazy story but just he he kind of left that nugget he goes just think about what's the little extra 10 20 you could do like it didn't take that much more effort to just like stand up and clap for the guy like a little bit embarrassing i guess but a little bit unorthodox but it is it didn't like require more money or more time it was just a little creativity of how to make this guy feel like a little extra and uh and so i've been doing that from time to time where i'll just see a situation i'll go okay dude you cheered you stood up and cheered or you're like not in a restaurant i haven't done anything i didn't want to do the exact same thing but i use this this idea of make it a magic moment for the person um and it's like you know i could just do this that would be like the normal good thing but what would make this like really pop off and what would make this something that they will remember tonight they'll go tell somebody that this happened for them um and then i do that thing and i never regret it it's always like you know if my intention is good like you know even if the even if the execution is slightly awkward i'd rather be the guy that does that than uh is in the is in his shell you know i think i agree all right fine uh lucky lucky kid i'll have to send him this podcast uh all right we should wrap it up and uh yeah we're good all right that's the episode yeah i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

we probably shouldn't box i i boxed i had my boxing card and boxed pretty consistently uh various times i'm not very good you don't get a nose like this do yoga i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i andrew hueberman was just on the podcast if you don't know who he is i'm going to try and describe him very simply he's this guy who works at stanford i believe he's a neuroscience dr hubermann is his name and he's got this youtube video uh series and a podcast called huberman labs where basically he picks one topic like sleep stress building muscle um depression addiction and he'll do like an hour to two hours of just talking into the camera and talking to his mic and explains very easy ways to understand what it means and how you can overcome or like what supplements or what exercises you can do to address he's only been around for 10 months and he's already one of the top 10 most popular podcasts he's everywhere on youtube this guy is a badass we just had him on the podcast i would i'm kind of like starstruck a little bit because i'm such a fan of his um i think you're really gonna dig this it's a little bit health focused towards the end we get into a little bit more business stuff but if you're into business you have to be healthy otherwise you're not gonna be able to perform well and so we talk a lot about that we talk a lot about morning routines and these aren't just like well i write my journal it's like well no if you do this uh based off of science based off peer review research if you do this you're going to feel this way and that's going to help with x y and z so it's like kind of a evidence research based podcast that we've just done it's pretty freaking cool so enjoy it ben what do you think um he just sean uses the term shortcuts he's really good for giving little hacks i just feel like i took away like six to ten little hacks i can use in my life that is gonna make it better mostly biologically like it's going to actually improve my sleep or uh improve my ability to focus and things like that so i think there's a lot of great little nuggets for people in it so check it out and by the way we are giving a thousand dollars to six people what you have to do is you go to rate this podcast dot com slash mfm so that's mfm as in my first million so rate this podcast dot com slash mfm and leave us a review all you gotta do is leave leave us a review i don't even care it's a negative review tell us how you think about anything one star five star i don't care do whatever you want and uh at the end of the month we're gonna pick like i think six of them and give a thousand dollars away so rate this podcast.com mfm write something cool write something funny maybe if you stick out we'll uh we'll pick you um let us know what you think about the podcast enjoy the episode do you check notifications on youtube uh i do not okay so let me tell you something really quick so about two weeks ago so i'm a big uh bay area punk rock fan so i listened to like i used to live in san francisco for years i listened to like old rancid old green day and i was looking at an old interview with tim armstrong from rancid and it has like very little views and i was loving this interview and i was going to comment how much i love it and i scrolled down and you were the first comment on there and i replied to you uh and so i thought that was funny we have similar interests i did not expect to see you there on an old tim armstrong from yeah i'm a huge uh rancid and tim armstrong fan i mean without taking up too much of our time on this i've never i've never met tim personally um but uh yeah growing up i was a operation ivy fan big fan of a band called crimp shrine this whole east bay punk scene and then um rancid came out and actually tim and matt freeman had a band called downfall in between you can find some of those tracks and i love those tracks i just love it um they cover such a huge range of styles and they've just done amazing things and yeah so if there's any content out there that's you know rancid acoustic or downfall rare rancid tracks i scour the internet for them if i don't know about them send them to me and as i devour that stuff and we'll have sean kind of do like an intro on you but really quick this is one of the reasons why i think people like you and why your podcast has taken off because you're this intellectual powerhouse but you look like an athlete yet you kind of have this like punk rock side to you like you gotta tell that you have that to you and i think that you're just like a really like eclectic interesting person and i think that's why so basically sean you can do the intro but you've had this podcast that just launched like a year ago you're already the biggest guy there is uh or top ten top five it's pretty amazing um and i think that's one of the reasons why why you're you're kicking ass is because you are quite eclectic and very different from what we're used to no go ahead i guess to say we can kind of like set the scene so uh so we have uh andrew huberman here dr hooverman and uh known known for huberman lab and you're a neuroscientist uh professor at stanford and you have a whole bunch of you have an interesting podcast and i've seen you everywhere recently so i don't know if this is like i don't know if you have hired an amazing pr person i don't know if i'm just late to the party but you went from i've never heard of you before like three months ago let's say to i only hear about you my youtube feed is basically just giving me more and more of your content every day so is that is that a new thing or or am i just like discovering it now oh it's a it's a very new thing i mean to just give you the quick arc um you know leaving out all the pre-academia stuff you know i did my training in neuroscience and in physiology things like temperature regulation and things of that sort and over the years i worked on a number of different problems um formally meaning in laboratories as a phd student postdoc a junior professor and tenured professor things like stress and regeneration and what happened was right around 2015 i started getting curious about how scientific information is making it out into the general public um but there really wasn't a a cause or a venue for doing that there were these meetings like big summit meetings and things like that that weren't really my flavor to be honest they're perfectly fine but um they would typically go something like you know yoga class group of meditation one talk buy my product by my book and then people go and so what happened was in 2019 i have a good friend his name is pat dossett he's a wharton grad a former navy seal operator um did nine years in the seal teams he's a good friend of mine we swim together um he much further ahead than i of course um you know those guys definitely have extra gears um i've you know seen that and and pat uh also has a company called made for which is a behavioral health company who started with blake mykoski who's a founder of tom's shoes so what happened was that in 2019 pat asked me a question we were literally getting out of the water we've done an early morning cold water swim and he said you know what are you going to do in 2019 to make the world a better place and i was like well you know i'm trying to figure out neural regeneration stress and how to sleep better in my lab i said yeah what are you really gonna do he was kind of poking at me and i said well you know i think um it'd be fun to just teach science on the internet and just put quality information out there because i don't see that so i started doing that in 2019 little short posts pretty nerdy stuff mostly on instagram and people seem to like it and then in 20 and i got a book deal um in 20 end of 2019 i thought i would do what most academics do write a book sell a book and then 2020 hit and a couple things happen one is i realized there was a tremendous need for people to have the tools for managing stress and circadian rhythms and sleep and managing mental workload and etc because everyone was locked down and stressed out and confused as was i frankly um but i had access to these tools so i started disseminating the tools by going on podcasts and on instagram and then eventually the podcast led to a you know the rogan appearance certainly had a lot to do with it a rich role appearance um that did uh well also in lex friedman at the end of 2020 great podcaster and also a great friend of mine now said you should start a podcast so january of 2021 bought the mics set it up i uh looked to my skateboarding punk rock past i have a friend named mike blayback known as playback photo in the skateboard in action sports community shoots all the stuff of ginkana and ken park driving rally cars of danny way tony hawk all the um they're only a few superstars of skateboarding and action sports photography mike happens to be one of them and he said let's build an aesthetic that kind of represents you i always wear the same black shirt i own 26 of these that's not for the podcast you know i i always keep my hair short and just you know this is me on any day it's just that the kind of camera showed up and i started sitting down and saying well what would i do in a classroom if someone was interested in stress and how to manage stress well i would give four lectures on that and so a big feature of the podcast that's a little different is that than most podcast is that i try and stay on theme and i try and keep it like i would in a classroom but then offer a lot of tools which is a little different so that's really how it happened and uh no no pr firm no um uh you know big no no contract signed everything we've got with my team how did you get on roads to one stage yeah how'd you get on rogan because that was a big obviously inflection point and then that leads to tim ferriss that leads to more and more so how'd you get on rogan yeah and that was all this year so then um well two things about that um i'll just want to make sure i close the hatch on so i haven't written this book um i haven't released it for two reasons one is that in 2020 i didn't want to sell anything i was coming to the table as an academic with a tenured position and a salary frankly we don't make big salaries even at stanford um yes if my dean is listening the salaries at stanford are not in keeping with the cost of living in the bay area which is why most people sit on company boards and things of that sort so um you do science for the love of it um but i didn't want to talk about my work um and be self-promotional i really love learning and teaching and i have one mission in my professional life and that's to share the magic and the utility of biology i i mean that's for me just fills me up and talking about my work is fun we can do that if you want but there's so much terrific work out there so what happened was the second rogan appearance is you know joe said you know huberman's doing this podcast thing and people seem interested in it let's get them back on to share some of this information and but how did it happen in the first place well i have a good friend and business partner at my podcast um his name is rob moore and no he's not taking new clients um so because he no longer does what i'm about to describe which is that rob uh came from the world of of pr but then he got really interested in podcasts he's in his mid-thirties and he started a podcast called the fight with teddy atlas he loves boxing he really likes it oh yeah yeah yeah i listen to that every week yeah okay you work you work with that guy yeah he's got like a thick boston accent right uh that's ken rideout who's a friend who i met through rob rob you're not going to see you're not going to find he sits behind an email wall and he's a a close friend of mine um that you know october this time last year october november of 2020 we went for lunch and i said let's start a podcast lex thinks that we've got traction with a podcast and i think he's right and he said great let's do it let's buy the mics let's you know we built the studio with our own hands mike showed up got the dc team in there because they're friends with of mine um dc shoes dc skateboarding and they helped me you know create an aesthetic that we thought would would work for make people feel like they were in a classroom um and you know rob uh was the one who connected me to the person who connected me to joe uh there's a little bit of i since this is a public venue there's a little bit of a of a wall there just because they get flooded with requests and i'll be honest you know i don't know what their process is um i think that they have a process and and if i'm not privy to it i think that what's beautiful about the rogan podcast having been a guest on there and obviously a big fan is that they i think what you see is the real deal uh you know joe sits down with people that he'd like to have a meal with and or conversation with and has a conversation and um and the human appetite for that is obviously huge uh people seem to really resonate with that and of course joe is a tremendous reason um so he's been tremendously helpful tim ferriss uh rich roll and lex friedman and i will say that lex has been my uh kind of guiding light in this whole process about bringing certain elements of my own person and personality to things you know yeah i am i mean this is going to sound weird to anyone who's looking to this for science information but and it might not even make sense but sam you'll get it and i don't know other people will too which is like yeah i'm a died in the wool punk rocker i grew up in that and if this that scene i think people think of as like loud music loud clothes loud everything that scene at its at is essence the reason i gravitated towards it early is that it's very varied it's about showing up like heartful strong it's not a it's never a victim stance but it's not an aggressive stance but it's not a weak stance either and for me it just resonated and so it's like let's you know the opening track of my um podcast for instance is a song i don't um want to get the copyright people on me so uh that's familiar from the punk rock culture and i just wanted to bring all that forward and i think lex was the one who really said pick two or three things that you really feel represent your relationship to science and that give you energy for that lexus is a genius i have to say what you see there with the jacket and tie and all the interviews lex works so hard he thinks so hard about where he's going with all this and he just interviewed the director of the national institutes of health francis collins that is not an easy grab um so in any case that's a long-winded i don't tend to be succinct so i'll stop yeah i want to ask you about i'll ask you about lex in a second but for those who who are listening and don't know who you are basically i i have your channel up right now so your first video was launched 10 months ago your video is basically you and you're this is weird to say to you but you're you're like a good-looking dude you've got like a goatee you look kind of like a football player you're you're wearing you're wearing a black shirt with a black background you're pretty serious um and you're just sitting for like 60 minutes to almost two hours sometimes and you're explaining things that sound complicated like how your nervous system works and changes master your sleep um using failures movements and balance to learn faster so these are like things that are somewhat complicated but you sit down and you look at the camera for one to two hours and you tell you you you explain what what it all means and then you do something that's interesting where it says like all right so how do you take advantage of this and apply this and use this um and you're long-winded on purpose because you said you're like i'm not gonna i need you to know exactly how this works so you can decide what you want to do versus me just telling you exactly what to do yeah there's like a balance of uh you can simplify something so people can understand it without dumb remove their own agency to to to to dive in yeah yeah thanks for that description you know my um like i said that the goal and and really my purpose in life i know mission statements and purpose sound kind of they're kind of cliche and but it is really is i get i so i have this process that i've used for a long time which is i like to just pay attention to what puts energy into my body um the music like i'll hear a song you're familiar with this you hear a song like yes you know it just fills you with energy whether or not that's dopamine or adrenaline or we could dissect that but that's not the point but that energy is a is a neural energy it doesn't have to do with calories it doesn't but that energy is your source right like in the eastern philosophies they would call it chi or whatever it is so i've always sensed what i really enjoy and for me learning cool information and sharing it is what i want to do so what i try and do is paint a a tapestry at the beginning of here's a topic like stress or sleep or dopamine or adhd or eating disorders or whatever and arm people with the language and make them realize that the nomenclature is just words we can replace some of those words and let's get a functional definition of things going and then once they understand how things work a little bit some of the the algorithms so to speak then let's talk about what you can do with this and how you can use light to change your circadian rhythms or particular patterns of breathing that are grounded in physiology to de-stress rapidly etc and so yeah and can you explain this first video so your first video is only sean was saying that like you're you came everywhere you're everywhere very quickly your first one was only 10 months ago that first video has 652 000 views it's a slick looking thumbnail can you walk me through how much did you spend to build that studio and like how did the first traction do you think come to this video your very first video 650 000. the very next one looks like a month later a million views the next one 630 i mean you hit right away you were you were hitting right away how did that happen yeah that's a good question so a big part of that was i don't think it was the thumbnails because actually we were told by youtube that our thumbnails weren't legible i had these fancy anatomical drawings you know that uh now we've changed them a bit um we've learned some things you know faces do better than images etc but if you thumbnails that are really clickbaity are thumbnails where someone's going like where they said the wider the eyes the more people click and kind of crazy stuff um we didn't do that because i want people to know that i'm here with a serious you know serious information because i'm serious about them it's sort of like why always the black shirt these are actually the blacks i am literally on 26 of these that i like these particular shirts um i'm not trying to get picked up by the by the maker so i won't mention it but i've always worn them i like like them but also me and sean always wear black typically because it's easy to hide if you're fat or wrinkles right or tattoos not that i'm confessing that i have any tattoos but the uh if i was neck to knuckles tattoos i would just do it but i'm not but the um and kids uh yes you should be able to dress however you want do whatever you want but that's not the way the world works people are always evaluating so you decide it's your gamble i always say authenticity is not the same as over sharing these days i think there's a big tendency to think oh because you can deadlift 500 pounds that you should put that on the internet um one so this is part of my answer which is that by the end of 2020 the instagram channel had grown to several hundred thousand but that mind you took two years and a 50 5-0 podcast appearances as a guest so um we announced that we were going to launch a youtube channel to get over there and subscribe and then we just started pushing out content frequency is a big deal um you know we do one a week we may advance to one and a shorter one um each week next time but you know free consistency you know not surprisingly counts and there's consistency of aesthetic too uh you know this the building the studio was fairly straightforward um thank you mike playback my good friend and dc i mean the one thing about skateboarders that they really really know how to do well is to create original content in a diy format okay so actually mike is out on a shoot right now uh with spike jones right so i grew up with i don't know spike but i grew up with a lot of the guys who ride for girl mike spike jones owns girls a portion of girl skateboards so i grew up around people that took video of us playing around on the streets on skateboards and made videos that became these iconic things and so well skateboarders were kind of like the first youtubers uh you know if you look at old transworld or 411 videos or old dc or like the like like what bam was doing with jackass you know it was the cky videos we were the skaters were the first youtubers that's right though they really were and um you mentioned 4-1-1 so you definitely you know 4-1-1 is like no i still skate i i was just hanging out with mikey mikey taylor this weekend professional skateboarder skateboarding yeah yeah yeah and to be clear because i want to maintain my um integrity with that community i wasn't a great skateboarder i was okay uh thunder trucks put me on out of sympathy spitfire put me on out of sympathy um but i wasn't gonna be one of the big guys it was just a community i really felt a part of and when i went off to college because my high school girlfriend went to college i tripped and fell into biology i thought i'd be a skateboarder or a firefighter or something was more physical but i fell in love with biology and and just that's what i've been doing ever since but i think the aesthetic keeping a fairly narrow messaging too you know we've turned down every option to make a little bit of extra money doing affiliate codes i mean we do have advertising and affiliate codes but to just pepper things with you know advertising everywhere we just i want people to have a zero-cost trusted source for science health and fitness information of course we're not going to get everything exactly right but to know that if they come to the hubermann lab channel that they're going to get information that's vetted that i've i always consult with at least two or three colleagues professional in a given area before i do a podcast of just me because i don't work on adhd i know the a fair amount about it but i consult with experts and so i have a kind of advisory board so i use the scientific community and it's a kind of a beautiful um ecosystem where our advertisers are happy we're happy our but the main thing is the consumers get it at zero cost to consumer and i think that's very different than a book and that's very different than a behind paywall strategy i've seen a lot of health and science uh podcasters who are quite good move their stuff behind a paywall because you can make much more money charging you know 10 30 a month or something and i like to think that people would be willing to do that for our content however i feel best about the fact that for some kid sitting in halfway across the world who wants to understand weight training or adhd or dopamine or sleep they just as long as they have an internet connection they have to tolerate a few ads but the information is free to them what why don't you just bail as a million dollars a year uh well i i'm i'm i guess academically masochistic because um well it's it's interesting i'm happy to announce this now i actually took um i i love doing research uh we have a big project on human stress we've been working on human fear i love doing research and actually a fairly sizable portion of the huberman lab podcast income is going to be donated to research and to scholarships for students um i i'm not i'd be very honest i'm not i i'm not extremely wealthy nor do i um suffer you know i and i i it's money is important i always say money but can't buy happiness but it absolutely can buffer stress no question about that um anyone who's ever had significant funds throughout their lifetime don't truly understand that statement people who haven't will understand exactly what i mean and i i think money is very important but so is the ecosystem between academia public health and science communication and the private sector and for the time being it just makes sense for me to continue to teach at stanford i teach medical students in the winter on neuroanatomy i direct the neuroanatomy course and i really enjoy academic conversations um they're slow it's like leading through steel one thin layer at a time but what you get too often is a kind of granularity where it's a process it's it's not so much you get to answers it's you get to a process of getting to answers um and i don't think i'd be happy without doing that actually a couple people fans of the pod and they are i knew they would be excited to have you on because we we mostly this is a business oriented podcast that's why kind of we're asking you some things about the business of how you you became a content creator how you got your audience you know why do you sean we've not even we've not even told them what we do i guess i i i didn't well i i did i did a little bit of research um and i i was delighted when you guys asked i mean i'm new to twitter uh frankly i didn't like twitter when i first got on i was like wow people are really combative compared to instagram um and i think it's because you don't have to show your face and i'm a very like i'm not an aggressive person but if somebody goes wants to go toe-to-toe i still have that in me i'm not suggesting anyone get violent out there but people would come at me and on instagram and start well show yourself let's go you know like let's have a conversation and um you know so i don't get into back and forth in comments i found twitter to be an incredibly combative neighborhood and then you guys showed up i was like oh wow i guess there's some nice people in the neighborhood so sort of like finding the other punk rockers and skateboarders it's like you and me we got the same thing and we're good so that's that was the feeling i had and then it turns out that's actually the case twitter you get rewarded every network rewards you for a different wit which is like the plus side so you know being witty in 140 characters but then on the other side it's basically uh you know if you have the sharpest insult at somebody you also get rewarded and you don't have to show your face and there's all these other benefits and so so it brings out a different side it's actually youtube used to be this way too the youtube comments i don't know if people remember this but youtube comments used to be the running joke as like what is the most cesspool of the toxic commentary that exists it was called the youtube comments and now youtube comments are extremely i don't know what they changed in the algorithm or the the flagging or what what not but youtube comments are on the whole you know either funny or supportive or whatnot they really change that tic toc is doing it um but anyways one thing about comments uh before i forget started interrupt but vis-a-vis business because i know that's your your main audience is one thing that i did on instagram early on and then i do on youtube is comment sections are great but better to make them interactive so i actively request and we read every single comment i say tell me but give me give us feedback but also give us suggestions and give us ideas about future podcasts and then i've devoted entire episodes we haven't done one in a while but to what we call office hours which is where i go through the most frequently asked questions and address those so now there's an incentive to ask to put stuff in the comments and i think that's a really good non-combative use of the comments section and we of course still get some uh crazy stuff in the comments and people being combative but um they should just know that we don't actually read those no i'm kidding we read them all yeah for sure um so i wanted to talk about a couple things one was what we talked about now how how did you where how did you break out what and i think it's great you know i teach science on the internet it's such a simple a simple like sort of philosophy a simple you know business statement of what do i do what am i here to do and then the mission i enjoyed that as well but i wanna actually go through some of those greatest hits so some of the reasons that you've grown in popularity is that you put out nuggets that are interesting to people and when i was talking to friends saying you were coming on they said you know we ask a lot of the kind of like oh you know we have a billionaire on the podcast hey you're super successful what's your morning routine and they tell us oh you know here's what i do in the morning you know and people sort of equate that to if i do this i i too will become a billionaire which is obviously not not the right way to think about it but i think if i ask you about your morning routine which i'm guessing is centered around health mental health uh fitness um and sort of regulating your body that that actually will be applicable to more people so take us through what is the uh what is the morning routine i know you've talked about this on some other pods but i i bet the majority of our audience has not listened to all your stuff so you know these are the greatest hits let's let's do them sure yes so uh i wake up uh for me that's usually somewhere around somewhere between 5 30 and 6 30 depending on how early i went to sleep uh i wake up and i do an assessment of whether or not i feel rested or not most days the answer is no just because of uh life staying up too late uh stress etc so i do a 10 to 30 minute yoga nidra session first thing in the morning uh yoga nidra is a passive listening you can find these yoga nidra links uh on youtube there's one which is 10 minute yoga nidra um there's one that actually made four put out for free called um nsdr non-sleep deep breaths that's a 30 minute one it's a script where you just listen it brings your brain into a state that's like that's pseudo sleep after that 10 or 30 minute yoga nidra i feel like i've slept as much as i need to sleep it's a really remarkable reset and it it avoids your brain going into this state of planning and organization what we call duration path and outcome in the neural circuitry uh world and keeps it in that kind of liminal state of adjusting and there are some interesting data published showing that these yoganidra meditations if you will are uh can upregulate some of the neurotransmitters in the brain including dopamine that make you prepared for action and so uh they're very restorative especially in the absence of complete sleep if i feel great i might just get out of bed the first thing is always and i have to be careful because to list every step because sometimes people say wait he doesn't even go to the bathroom in the morning i mean obviously i go right foot left foot to the bathroom then i use the restroom then i go downstairs i drink water i hydrate and i go outside and i get some sunlight in my eyes for 10 to 30 minutes foundational absolutely critical practice when i don't do it for more than two days in a row i start messing up all sorts of aspects of my life and most people are not doing this even on cloudy days do it don't wear sunglasses unless you have a medical reason why you need to it's fine to wear corrective lenses or contacts you don't need to stare directly at the sun or see the sun rise and these are the questions i most often get this is why i'm hitting these as bullet points and if you wake up before the sun rises flip on as many lights as you can in your space if you want to be awake in your artificial light environment and then once the sun is out go outside i don't care if you're in the depths of scandinavian winter the sun comes out at some point some people might need a daylight simulator but the discussion about daylight simulators is usually an excuse to avoid having to just go outside and get sunlight in your eyes for 10 to 30 minutes you can check your phone if you want or bring the newspaper if people still read those or a book i usually bring a journal and i write down some things that i want to do that day and try and make sure that i'm clearing away some of the clutter um if you have a dog you could do this while walking etc and then i sometimes will combine this with a walk optic flow when you're just walking through space not looking at anything like your phone or anything in particular that optic flow is known to suppress a circuit in the limbic system that involves the threat detection centers it is very calming to walk through space and it reduces your overall levels of anxiety many people just being indoors not getting sunlight uh not getting enough sleep life is stressful they're not doing this so basically all of that can be accomplished in one hour it's wake up yoga ninja for 10 to 30 minutes use the bathroom drink some water of course all the basic biological functions what about um thianine and coffee okay so i don't ingest theanine during the day i ingest it as part of a sleep cocktail before sleep some people will take l-theanine with coffee it's now in many energy drinks because it uh takes away some of the jitters that it's a mild sedative and it takes away some of the jitters that caffeine can induce i don't drink any caffeine until 90 minutes or ideally 120 minutes after i've woken up for the following reason uh during sleep you well during wakefulness you and the longer you're awake adenosine builds up in your system caffeine is an adenosine antagonist functionally i realize it's a competitive agonist for you aficionados but it it basically blocks the adenosine receptor functionality so to speak but when that caffeine wears off you're gonna get a big crash because there's gonna be a surplus of adenosine by waiting 90 minutes to two hours to ingest caffeine 90 minutes or two hours after waking to ingest caffeine it's a little bit of a struggle to learn how to do this but your natural adenosine system that adenosine tapers down very very low as a consequence and you don't get that rebound in the afternoon i drink mate a yerba mate tea i love it um there's a great br i don't like that the uh really smoky ones i have no business relationship to any yerba mate company by the way but the one i love is by i don't know who this person is or if it's even a person's anna park it's a really delicious one it comes loose leaf and um it's very high caffeine content so you don't need very much of it and it also has a lot of what's called glp-1 glucagon like peptide 1 which is actually being used now as an anti-diabetes and obesity drug there's all sorts of great things about glp1 upregulates dopamine receptors etc so i'll drink mate starting about 90 minutes after i'm awake and then that's kind of my morning but after the walk i go inside i i do try to avoid social media at that point maybe a quick check of 10 minutes i said i'll even set an alarm um and then on a phone or computer typically on a phone i'd like to move more to the computer but i've been transit a lot these days and um you have to uh be thoughtful obviously but i think maybe 10 minutes on social media but i want social media to continue to be a pleasure and because of the dopamine system and we can talk about that i don't want to get i don't want to go down the rabbit hole of someone else's um psychology or neurology i want to stay in my own frame the orientation i have in the early part of the day with that notebook is i want to be in my own mental frame i've just slept during sleep is when we have neuroplasticity the actual rewiring of neural connections occurs during sleep i'm a big believer in the subconscious and you're when you wake up you are now in a position to extract whatever it is that these new neural circuits have have figured out about the previous day and days events and so if i immediately bombard myself with sensory experience or input or distractions i'm not able to do that so this morning for instance i'll just give an example i'm preparing an episode of the podcast on time perception i've been reading a lot about this and i woke up this morning went outside with the notebook and just sat there and then realized that there's a way to organize this episode that has to do with frame rates and sort of slow motion versus fast motion cognition or hopefully it'll be clear by time the podcast happens it's not fully formed but that can be so i wrote that down thought great and then um i'll move into some more typical type work uh it's great if you can avoid email until after 12 noon but that's very hard for a lot of businesses so i will usually do a brief check in on email critical items but then i like to write so i will i'm working i am working on a book finally i will work on scientific papers on grants on reviewing papers i try and make that pretty heavy intellectual lifting um and take that until about noon and then i'll i'll look into and then we can talk about you know food and other things at this point i haven't eaten anything do you ever so you have not eaten till noon but one thing that you met did not bring up and i'm wondering do you have a family uh no i have a relationship and i had a dog until recently he passed away so i i do understand people have different things yeah i have different constraints he was a big part of my morning routine i had this big 90-pound bulldog mastiff named costello and we would slowly do our walk we'd get the sun together animals are perfectly happy to do these because these are very innate behaviors but no kids no children you know who are children in my life i'll say that but but i don't have any children yeah you remind me of henry rollins except his except his jaw goes to about here right you know like henry's head is like this big right sean do you know who henry rollins is no one time i shot okay shawn doesn't know who dolly parton is he didn't know who jimmy buffett was sean doesn't know like white people [ __ ] um and so we're gonna put this in the category of white people [ __ ] henry rollins was he was it black flag that he was the lead singer of yeah so well all right i have to be careful not to go down this path too i mean i'm a big ian mackay fan so minor threat right then minor threat and then there was black flag so and yes but rollins was part of black flag um and uh he was early in the punk rock scene to get into lifting weights a lot ian and those guys were straight edge straight edge means different things in different eras but at that time it meant no alcohol no drugs it's pretty firm stance in the 80s compared to uh the rest of the culture yeah um i don't know henry i don't know ian um but i listen to minor threat all the time but sean so henry is like this guy he's like this punk rocker he's like he might be in his 60s now but probably he basically like was singing punk rock but he would didn't drink or anything and he started lifting weights so he was like uh kind of like a meathead a little bit and not a bad way but he was like jacked and now at this point in his life he's completely single he doesn't have kids or anything and he's a poet and he's an actor and he's just look kind of like a renaissance man where and if you google him you'll recognize him did you google him he's uh he's like you'll definitely recognize him he was um in he was he's sometimes in movies sons of anarchy things like that and anyway just this like really really interesting guy and he'll go in like a ted talk or something like that and he'll just talk about his philosophy on anything he's kind of like mike tyson a little bit he just kind of like every time he talks it's just like wisdom um anyway uh huberman has this like uh just like henry rollins vibe a little bit and that's why i was asking about kids because you're this interesting guy who's kind of like i s in my head i picture you as this like guy who's alone intensely studying and trying to figure out like crack a problem and i think that that's really in that's just like an interesting part of you at least yeah in my head that's what i'm making you up as sure i mean i i in the spirit of um authenticity but not over sharing uh what i can say about this is um i mean i'm blessed with great friendships i've always i think because of that skateboarding punk rock era because it was mostly guys back then i have a community a lot of friends who you know swim who work out who uh play music i'm really good friends with a guy named michael muller who's a photographer who does all the marvel stuff and um i'll train with him i train i'm sometimes up at uh laird hamilton and gabby reese's pool i like those workouts they're good friends of mine when i'm down there but yes i at this point in my life um i live in a somewhat remote area uh i have a gym and a sauna and a cold dunk i spend a lot of time with the books i i'm dying to get another dog and i do live that kind of monastic lifestyle um i do have a relationship and that's great and uh you know the children thing is interesting because i started off studying brain development and neuroplasticity and brain development and so let's just say that if i do something i do it a hundred percent so i have no children now but if i do have kids i i genuinely want five of them i want a big family or none at all so that's uh so that's a plan we should talk because you're you're kind of your specialty is around the eye right and i've heard you say this before and i'm gonna i is essentially part of the brain that exists outside of the the sort of the cranium where the rest of the brain is stored it's actually like you know that's right it is the same is it what the same tissue or it's like developmentally that it like kind of segregated at some point but it's basically it's the only part of your brain that's like facing the world out that's right uh you got you got several points there right and none of them wrong these two bits are two pieces of your central nervous system they got extruded out of the skull or we should say out of the cranial vault because technically they're still in the skull um extruded out of the cranial vault during development and they are the way that your brain figures out where it is in space and time right um by the rising and setting of the sun and the changing of the of the amount of light throughout the year regardless of where you live and uh they are responsible for delivering 40 percent of the inf uh let's just say 40 of the brains real estate is devoted to vision in some way or another we are incredibly visual animals uh especially even in blind people that real estate for vision that's in the back of the head the so-called occipital cortex is overtaken by areas that respond to touch and hearing that's why they're so good at tactile and hearing but incited individuals vision is the predominant way not just that we represent and see objects around us oh blue car um tall good looking woman or man whatever it is it's also the way that we orient ourselves in space and time and that we set our frame rate um and we can talk about this but essentially you when as you move through life you're either batching time in big chunks or in small chunks and that has to do with how you're viewing the visual world so you're either thinking in slow motion or thinking it fast depending on your visual environment that's probably a little abstract but yes these two bits are brain outside your cranial vault why you say kind of in the morning you want to go uh you know one of the key things of your morning routine was get outside let the sun hit your eyes it's basically alerting the body that hey the sun is up kickstart all your start your engines because it's daytime is regulating that way and i think there's different things throughout the day that you've talked about anxiety maybe help you go to sleep and um i'll give you kind of two questions that came from the audience that when i tweeted out that you were coming on they're both in the same vein and so one question is um we talk a lot on this podcast about the 80 20 right we are fans of the shortcut uh shortcuts get a bad rap around the world uh you know it's sort of seen as the the lazy i don't care thing to do but in many ways a shortcut is great a shortcut is basically saying how do i identify the highest leverage points that if i did those i would get maybe the biggest impact or how do i get the results i want faster instead of slower and so what would be the 80 20 meaning if you could change for all the people who are listening to this right so imagine a hundred thousand people listening to this right now if you could implant sort of one or two behavior changes that they could do in the day so maximum of two which two would you pick that you think have the highest roi the highest return uh for the investment of what it takes to do them what do you think would make people happier it doesn't matter anything that's anything to make you feel better have a yeah whether it's improve your health or improve the way you feel throughout the day uh what would be the one or two that you would point to as like you're kind of yeah so you know it's a great question i think we need to think about foundational practices um and the two things that set the foundation for optimal mental and physical functioning are going to be really good sleep and really good mental frame and mental frame is going to be the ability to toggle between different states of mind and so let me give you the practices first so that i don't get accused of being an intellectual to the point of um you know curing insomnia right during this podcast the first one is that morning sunlight in your eyes should be a non-negotiable thing 360 days out of the year if it's raining stand under an overhang i'm very unsympathetic to that well i wake up and it's early and then i gotta drive to work stand outside for five minutes i i don't you know i i got plenty of rest last night so i'm not ornery about this but i've grown a little bit exhausted of that well you know i can't do that because i've got kids right take them outside with you they need this too that sets a cortisol increase in the morning which is a healthy cortisol increase that provides wakefulness triggers your metabolism in the proper direction if that cortisol spike happens too late because you didn't view light then you step out during noon too often remember one day is no big deal but step out in the sunlight too late off too often late in the day you have a delayed cortisol spike which is associated with insomnia depression there are good data on this so get that morning sunlight 360 days out of the year you will thank me i promise um everything gets better now it's a slow subtle shift it's not like popping you know 1000 milligrams of l-tyrosine and drinking a double espresso and going to the gym it's not a it's not um it's a foundational practice so i like to think of it as it raises the tide so that your boat can leave harbor that's how i think of it rather than oh this is like putting another outboard motor on on my vessel okay so that's the first one and the second one is a little bit of a broader category but it gets sleep right you have if you're until you're sleeping well 80 of the time or more get your sleep right and for this i can just defer people we do have a newsletter it's completely free but we have our privacy policy we don't share your email it's at hubermanlab.com just go to newsletter all the prior newsletters are listed there's the key tips for sleep you can watch the master your sleep episode or you can just download that 12 steps for optimal sleep yes there is a segment on supplementation with some of the considerations and warnings there's also sections on non-sleep deep breast protocols links to those so get your sleep right and get that light er in your eyes early in the day if you're a blind person there's another protocol i've done some work with blind people to try and help them with this many blind people still maintain the cells in their eyes that can reset the can set these mechanisms what's the mental framework yeah so mental frame is something that i don't think has been formalized in the kind of health and fitness uh optimization sean's really good at that by the way like sean shawn is very good at that where he he does a really good job at deciding what what frame he's going to be in uh i put it differently my my the number one priority my number one mission the thing i work on is not even my bit being able to being able to be in the state of mind i want so which is basically being able to experience the experiences i want the way i want to beautiful i just made it my top priority in life so then i started to get good at it because i realized oh [ __ ] this is the cheat code this is like you know you've got stressed out uh billionaire over there and then you've got you know joyful uh single mom over here and like what's which quality of life do i actually want well i want the one where my state of mind uh is in these states that i enjoy and not fear anxiety stress depression not these other states that i'm trying to uh not have as that's my quick quick rant on yeah no it's great mental frame is is is so key and um most i will say uh and i want to be very respectful of everything all the work that's preceded when i showed up um but you know a lot of the stuff that's out there in the self-help and business literature um it frankly is kind of nipping at the margins of some of this stuff like um and look i don't want to throw out names because it becomes disparaging i think the one person who really deserves a nod who's truly a pi they're two people who are incredible pioneers in this space and one is cal newport right so so good they can't ignore you is incredible book everyone should be required to read that book um deep work is this i'm essentially paraphrasing some of the protocols from deep work but cal who i don't know have never met but have great respect for um it's a computer science professor uh back east um uh it's about setting mental frame and context switching is dangerous which book which which book are you saying so he has a book so good they can't ignore you which was written some years ago and that was more towards like not trying to find your passion but getting really good at skills um but deep work is an excellent book um he has he's not on social media but he has given some ted talks um and that book is about uh getting in the right frame it's sort of like it's a lot about flow right it's about not succumbing to distractions so you can do work that actually moves the needle but that's not what you're talking about is it i thought that you were talking no so yeah then there's another one which is a world without email that he wrote recently here's the key essence of the cal newport work okay the the key essence of it as it relates to mental frame is that the brain is extremely good at end the body at context switching like i could be doing this podcast right now and if a fire alarm goes off or someone comes knocking on the door i can switch up my context and respond to that but 90 of the work that we are that moves the needle meaning that we are rewarded for or that enriches professional life and relationships it we used to talk about this about mindfulness and presence but it's really about getting the brain to start doing certain operations more uh in a more facile way and this is why habits are important but because going to the gym is different than reviewing a paper or writing a scientific paper is different than podcasting or being a guest on a podcast for that matter so what happens is early in the day when you get the download from sleep you identify a few things that are key you've already you're starting to funnel your neural networks toward what i'm calling frame setting and what you're not doing is allowing something that came in from the external environment to adjust your frame so you get a depth of connection with the work a depth like i knew i was doing this podcast today at noon and i wasn't walking and thinking about it but i set that as a as a goal post and because i wrote it down my brain is orienting toward what i need to do so that when we clip on we're ready to go and so mental frames are very important context switching is deadly i'm stealing cal's word so forgive me cal um some people will put freedom the the computer program so that they are not able to engage with the internet um this device which i've turned off or i guess it is on but it's on airplane mode for the podcast i try and keep away from me for the first half of the day very hard very hard especially when you need to post on social media but i try and i want to have here's the goal in the morning to make this simple i want to have one 90-minute block that i completely conquer that i that is where i experience immense resistance to do something other than what i'm doing but that i stay in in noodling away or gnawing away would be the better word at writing something or reading something or trying to comprehend something and you have to be very careful the moment you walk to the restroom and then maybe like wash your hands and look yourself in the mirror and then you're like oh you know i got this weird hair growing on my cheek or something you're starting to switch mental frame and so 90 minutes seems like nothing but it is remarkable what you can accomplish with this but the more important aspect is that in that exercise of getting good at what we call no-go operations in the brain you have go and no-go operations in pushing aside things and enforcing those blinders you're able to bring that same mental frame to other things later in the day and in life and you're able to engage it much quicker it's sort of like if you're a car you drive a car and you've never been up to 110 miles an hour you don't really know how to get around a a semi in front of you that's breaking fast and you're on a downhill but when you have to do it you can do it you're comfortable at speed and you're comfortable breaking and so that this mental frame thing is not just about the work you're able to do in that 90 minutes it's about getting better at doing deep work even for shorter bouts because as the day goes on we all have this experience right things start coming in we start getting bombarded and we're starting to get that that kind of fragmentation of our of our goals and we're kind of getting pulled off and some people that the the peak time is in the afternoon some people it's in the morning some people play at night but you're getting yanked off center and so you have to be able to recognize just how delicious and effective that state is and then you can apply it later and i'll let people use their imagination but this comes into into use in many aspects of life that have nothing to do with work okay like being able to stay at that at that groove with somebody or in some interaction or on a run i mean you know use your imagination this is the the important thing is it's all the same circuit it's this engagement of the prefrontal cortex which is saying duration path outcome meaning what how long is this gonna how long should i do this what path should i take what outcomes am i getting in real time and not getting pulled off center by someone else's dpo as i call them dpos in incidentally or not so incidentally i've been fortunate enough to do some work with the special operations community in the canada and the u.s in addition to those guys being really good at shoot move and communicate the really exceptional ones know how to flip this switch on we think of it as like grit resilience and mental toughness and yes they're all gritty but they're a lot of gritty people out there the difference is the ability to take your environment narrow that environment and be effective and cut a fine slice through something and then stop and move to something else that's a mental operation that involves multiple circuits multiple neurotransmitters we couldn't say just dopamine just epinephrine or something like that it's gonna be that but a bunch of other things too and so 90 minutes like learn that 90 minute battle and it takes time and then you get very very good at so i'll podcast for two hours i drop into that that's the state i'm in when i podcast two quick questions one what do you suck at because when i talk to you i'm incredibly intimidated because uh when it comes to mental health and physical health and emotional health i'm like i'm so inadequate because well i like i i read your watch your youtube to see like you know i stink at this therefore i want to learn what you're saying so i can be better and then and when i hang out with you now i'm like this guy's got it together i know that's not the case you're a human you've got issues just like me that's not the case so i want to know what do you struggle with and also do you just have loads of people dropping in your dms hitting on you because i hear you talking i'm like this guy he's probably or is it all just dudes is it all just a bunch of dudes like instead of you pictures of like a mole on their back asking what they what you think it is um how do you know i don't find moles on backs incredibly fast i'm just kidding every doctor has that they just all my doctor friends it's all just half of us say like hey what do you think this lump is exactly um so okay so um just to make sure i close the hatch on that so you asked for two tools i gave three morning sunlight master your sleep you can see that newsletter uh for that the tools and then this 90 minute bat and look some days it goes better than others but remember it's not just about what you accomplish it's about getting into those frames and you're controlling it this is i guess i wish i had said this before is that you are setting the beginning middle and end of that frame that's what's key it's not happening because someone else said game time noon on sunday and you're showing up anyone can do that with some practice what you're learning how to do is is flip the switch you're learning how to engage that but you have to be very judicious in your use of this circuitry you can't do it for 12 hours a day so that's when i do email and all the other stuff okay like 290 minute bouts baby um one last point about that and then i'll tell you what i suck at um but there isn't time in the universe to get all of it um there's a second newsletter there which is about optimizing learning and plasticity that touches into some of the details and some free links and protocols related to that also at the newsletter it's the october newsletter okay so um what do i suck at oh goodness like what's your struggles i mean i imagine now that you're famous your instagram probably and your twitter are like blowing up so maybe you're it's hard to keep track of your email and stay on top of that i don't know i'm projecting yeah so um three things um that have been helpful for uh this but okay i'm dreadfully poor at communica at um follow-up communications i'm really bad i i really like comments i try and respond especially on instagram i like to give people if you ask a professor a question they're going to give you an attempt at an answer whether or not it's accurate or not they're going to try they're going to try and get it right um so i have to control my impulse to respond to everything just for sake of time so i can do the big important things um i'm a terrible cook i'm an absolutely terrible cook i mean i um i'm fortunate that i have someone in my life who's an exceptional cook but i am an absolutely dreadful cook i mean i can i could destroy toast i just don't get it right i don't have the patience or do you eat really no so my diet's pretty pretty clean it's basically um i do low carb i'll eat some nuts and stuff in the morning if i'm hungry i don't make a big deal i put salt in my water which kills your hunger a lot of the time a lot of people get shaky they think they need sugar your your electrolytes are low just put some sea salt or a little pinch of salt and water drink it like oh and go another two hours and your brain functions great blood volume goes up um so well you know i think we're gonna i think 2022 is going gonna be the year that salt comes back uh science magazine has done a lot about the hypertension stuff if you have hypertension check with your doctor but you know um i eat a low carb throughout the day um so meat and salad maybe i might have a little bit of rice or something if i train i do exercise i train in the morning at some point usually i prefer to do it early but i find some time where i do one hour of exercise every it's weight train run like one day weight training one day run one day weight train one day run i take one full day off each week i never train for longer than an hour after warming up i hit it as hard as i can because i can't seem to come off the gas pedal and uh that's my my thing i've been doing that for 35 years so i'm 46 now so 32 years sorry what is um but i was going to ask you one one related question which is you talked about health and kind of like you kind of mentioned you intermittent fast basically you don't eat till noon yeah about that and you train a certain way and when it comes to health there's like you know there's a high carb diet there's a low carb diet there's there's meat is good meat is evil there's this is you know uh weight training is good weight training is horrible cardio is good cardio is bad uh so there's sort of this like bombardment of different side info and i think you know what you're trying to do is get to the source of it get to the truth of things what is one piece of conventional wisdom that you disagree with or maybe it's hipster wisdom something that's a fad or a trend right now that you you say hey pump the brakes on that that might be able to help some people out so what's something that's you hear a lot but you don't you don't buy it or you don't agree with her you think it actually might be harmful sure um i hate to always back pain a little bit but i have this thing about thoroughness of answers so forgive me i've got a little bit of a ocd on this um uh i i'm terrible at cooking so i suck at cooking um and i'm not a good writer i'm not a bad writer but verbal in exchange is how i do best so i i solve this problem i write into i i dictate into voice uh voice memos and then i uh put it on what's at rev.com they have a lot of my personal income and then i i sculpt from there and um because i'm not a very good writer so and i'm a terrible musician i love music i'm i can't play a chord to save my life um and i that's okay i'll live with that so i'm terrible at a lot of things sam um and um and if you talk to any of my ex-girlfriends that they you know they'll give you their take on what i'm good at and what i'm not good at you know um but trust me there are plenty of things i'm like world-class failure at and um i don't try and hide those but i think i'm glad you asked the question because um look i don't have it all figured out um i've been greatly inspired i just want to give a nod to tim ferriss who have know only through the podcast interaction that podcast four hour four hour work week four hour body um especially um had a tremendous impact in accelerating my career in science because i was able to focus on things that really matter maybe not for just four hours but just the principles in those books i think we should all be rereading those books they're so damn good and um yeah so okay um the diet thing i do low carb during the day and then i eat carbohydrates at night i like starch i like pasta and salad i try and limit my protein at night because it makes me so sleepy and i get into really great sleep uh by eating my starches later in the day usually around 8 8 or so i eat dinner and then i go to sleep around 10 30 or so i'll have a snack sometimes if i want one but generally i don't want one um and that's really really key because if i've trained early in the day and i'm running around like crazy i'm also burning up a lot of glycogen i want to repack my glycogen so i can train in the morning so i tend to like to train uh early in the day okay so what's out there well first of all the um the nutrition space is a disaster it's an absolute disaster so much so that i'm already preparing for the attack about what i'm about to say which is a well accepted truth in science uh there's a paper from chris garner um slab at stanford showing that as long as people ingest fewer calories than they burn you're going to lose weight regardless of whether or not those calories are in a low carb regimen or vegan regimen or pure meat regimen etc so calories in calories out is a foundational principle uh i've been accused of saying different but the fact of the matter is it's true now the calories outportion is going to be regulated by a number of things basal metabolism how much you exercise are you hormone augmented are you well what's what's the controversial thing that you you've just said though i don't even know well so so in the nutrition space there's this other idea the other idea it's grounded in some uh rationale which is like for instance when you eat uh animal protein like chicken or beef or fish there's a metabolic cost there's a there's a calories out equation from the digestion and utilization and protein and use of that yeah but that seems like a rounding error no it's not huge but it's very different than if you were talking about um equivalent number of calories from from starch um so it now there but there are hormonal effects of of biased what i call bias diet so i eat a macronutrient complete diet includes fats and proteins and and carbohydrates carbohydrates are sort of on an as-need basis so if i'm training a little less i might eat a few fewer of them etc but the the nutrition space is a mess because everyone has to eat and people have different preferences and so a lot of the stuff that you see out there really just geared toward finding a match with an audience that prefers plants or prefers meat or prefers to fast you know having explored the fasting science and literature there's nothing wholly about fasting that provides autophagy the cleaning up of dead cells i mean low-calorie diets will do that also even if you're not so-called fasting but there are it appears some benefits to having periods of each 24-hour cycle where you're not ingesting calories um independent of the total number of calories so the biggest issue i have that the mess that i see out there that i hope will get resolved is that people are using social media and uh a certain type of uh he said she said they said we said to amplify controversies that don't really exist right i'm willing to bet for instance i'll just state my stance on this that eating more plants and less meat forgive me paul saladino he's a friend of mine and you know he's the carnivore md he's got great data to support what he's got but i like plants i'm gonna eat a salad am i gonna die maybe but i'm eating my salad but i'm also gonna eat a steak and so it's almost like crazy when we start talking about this like are we really talking about this here's what i'd like to see the carnivore md it's this guy on instagram so my name do you know who uh you know the perfect keto guys andrew i know of them yeah so anthony is lives across the street from me and then justin has been on this podcast a bunch okay um and then there anthony and this other guy went to somewhere in africa i forget to see how this tribe lives eating mostly just meat and some honey and that other guy his name is paul he's got this instagram handle shown called carnivore md and basically he pretty much only eats meat organs and like butter just animals yeah he'll do honey and some some berries and stuff look very smart guy and um and people will come the battles on the internet like does dietary cholesterol it impacts serum cholesterol is syrian cholesterol um impacting testosterone or not i mean it's it's so crazy but the reason it's crazy is not because it isn't a valid conversation i mean we all have to eat and people want to live a long time and feel vital it's crazy because there's really no field it's not like vision science or stress science or sleep science or um you know cognitive psychology there's no field it's bringing together people with very diverse frameworks trying to resolve the same problem and so it's sort of like if i were to be in uh a discussion or agreement with someone who's a philosopher i don't do philosophy i don't know the principles of philosophy so i think that the issue on the internet right now is a big one who are the experts i mean we've seen this with everything related to kovid right who are the real experts are they the people with government jobs are they the people who who are you know mds is it phds i think what i would like to see more of what i know i'd like to see more of are more panel discussions this is one thing that isn't happening on podcast as much as it could panel discussions where people can get to the heart of the matter by combining physicians scientists and practitioners i do understand the frustration and the angst of people who've devoted a career to being in the trenches of doing stuff and then someone who has an md or uh writes a book and comes along and says hey i've solved weight loss or i've solved it by way of eliminating one macronutrient which by the way is not what paul saladino is saying i just want to be clear that i um that's i'm not pointing anything at him directly when i say that so i think that um it's a kind of a free-for-all right now nutrition is the worst um but in terms of the battles but there are some shining uh bright lights in that space um for instance dr andy galpin is an exercise physiologist who's done work with a lot of athletes he's the professor cal state fullerton in terms of training regiments he's just for endurance and for strength for female athletes and for male athletes for the everyday person he's got his content is just so damn solid um and grounded in mechanism all the way from muscle sarcomeres to this is how long you should rest between sets if this is your goal um and then in the nutrition space i've found what works for me which is this low carb starting around noon and then gradually transitioning into uh higher carbohydrates because i eat for health but i mainly eat for mental and physical functioning i'm paying attention to how i feel and i want to be able to do my work and so i think that's very important too and it's a missing piece of the equation which is it you know i wouldn't survive a day doing uh you know six small meals of you know each macronutrient i'd be i'd have to cook uh you know you can break the population up into kind of these six or ten you may this might be the ideal diet or optimal diet for you or do you think it is hey the solution you have actually might work for everybody i like do you think that i know it's not not to the t of like you know exactly what you eat but in terms of on one side you got completely plant-based on the other side you got completely carnivore another side is just sort of no carb or low carb or slow carb right there's all these different varieties do you think the do you think when it comes to humans knowing what is the optimal is it that there are completely different configurations for different groups of people or that actually for humans there actually would be one sort of optimal diet and then i have to assume that there's going to be some genetic bias towards certain things working so for instance i lucked out but i also suffer because i don't like alcohol it just makes me go to sleep so i don't care if there's alcohol or not some people really like a drink um that's probably genetic um it just doesn't it makes me feel bad it's not just that it doesn't make me feel good it makes me feel bad do you like to get [ __ ] up at all what do you do you have like drugs do you like anything i don't really no i drugs no i i mean you don't even smoke weed no i i don't smoke weed i never liked i never liked marijuana or alcohol very much i'm my drug is learning and adrenaline i do i've had to work on the adrenaline part i've uh there's stories for another time i've i put myself into some um unhealthy situations and dangerous situations but i i come alive with dopamine and adrenaline in my so you don't know so you don't do any drugs you don't you really don't drink i don't drink and do drugs either but my advice is i'll eat like a whole box of twinkies when i want to party that's like i'm like yeah like i'm playing it like two weeks out i'm like let's go eat a whole burger party you know i would say about 85 of the time i eat clean but um but i'll eat bread i love bread and i love butter on it you know basically bread is a vehicle for butter in my case you know um and i now watch the plant people are gonna come out they there's a video they already came after me like hubert says butter is look if you increase your fats your saturated fats a bit do the blood work you'll watch your your serum testosterone go up and we could talk about testosterone if you want um but it's not necessarily good for your heart i didn't say it was good for your heart i said it's good for your vitality which is different in the short run than in the long run but in terms of vices i like caffeine i do use certain stimulants over-the-counter stimulants like i'll take l-tyrosine these days i take 300 milligrams of alpha gpc if i really want to laser in i don't do it any more than two three days a week maximum and that's also in that second toolkit uh newsletter um that and phenylethylamine or phenylalanine um those two combined and you're you're in a you're in a focused tunnel um but i don't touch modafinil i don't touch stimulants i don't do recreational drugs um when i was in college sure i mean i i partied a bit but also you know i don't need any chemical to say exactly what's on my mind um or to withhold uh some of the things that are on my mind so i i'm i just not been my thing and uh but also i'm generally training in the morning and i generally want to get work done and you know look i always admired people that could have a couple beers and relax because it's such a big part of our culture um but that just didn't that's not the way i went um you asked about uh in terms of diets and genetic differences well you know this is the same thing with sleep and chronotypes we have people that prefer to stay up late and wake up late and people that prefer to wake up early and then it's a fairly normally distributed population uh what should we do about this well for instance um some people probably feel better eating more starches and less protein and maybe more plants and some people look it looks to me like joe rogan's doing just fine on his elk meat and whatever else he's eating diet i don't know i don't trap he seems like he's thriving i will say um in full disclosure that the people that i know who are hormone augmented i'm not talking about big bodybuilders i'm talking about people that are taking low dose of of testosterone whether or not to replace something or not they tend to crave or at least eat more proteins um because it increases protein synthesis and um you know that's me yeah yeah so yeah i'm on it i'm on it now and prior to being on it i i worked on it for i did it i tried doing it naturally for like two years to increase it was like 200 it was so low and that's slow yeah it was [ __ ] and it was so low and i was running a company at the time i was so stressed out so i like took time off i ate me i squatted and then i started taking trt and my life changed oh yeah it was so crazy that i started eating more meat and i didn't do it for body reasons i did it for emotional reasons but my body changed i feel like a professional athlete at 32. it's pretty crazy how much that changed but what you said on one of your podcasts is it seems true is that means i'll likely live there's a likelihood that i will not live as long because there was like some i i don't know if you said someone else sean they did these studies basically for some reason there was this group where they would castrate you in china um i don't know if it was like done out of like being like a monk or something like that yeah yeah and these guys didn't have dicks anymore and they castrated them and balls they they sorry yeah they didn't have balls anymore yeah and they i mean i didn't do the experiment nor did i check the data but i was like they lived longer like they they consistently lived longer it's and and like and so like now that i'm on this i'm like probably maybe i'll i'll live to be 90 instead of 95 i don't know who knows what it's going to be but it's a pretty sick life so that's kind of the sacrifice that i'm making yeah well basically the the idea is that um that your story speaks to is a true one which is that um vitality and longevity are on uh they're sort of orthogonal to one another they're not counteracting one another but they're kind of orthogonal to one another and puberty is the most rapid stage of aging in our entire life and it's accelerated aging right i mean puberty is aging it's just that you're not it's across the you know you think about it in the context of a portion of the entire life arc so introducing hormones of the sort that were robust during puberty um will accelerate that process you just said that vitality and longevity are orthogonal basically meaning the better and more optimized i want to feel the less i'm going to live not necessarily that if they're they're sort of off-center to one another but the they're not counteracting one they're not antagonistic so here let me explain and um how this would work in the real world so um if you will let's use the user's example you decided to go on testosterone replacement um your your total testosterone you said it was in the somewhere in the 200 nanogram per deciliter range which is uh below the normal reference range so you go on and you you're saying uh and quite aptly that maybe that's going to shorten your life because of the way that it can negatively affect lipid profiles and things the way it affects the liver there's a lot of biochemistry there we don't have time to go into but that's true however testosterone will also whether or not it's coming from endogenous sources or from replacement will also increase your energy level and your ability to lean into friction you're going to be running more you're going to be able to exercise more so i have done a number of episodes on hormones but one thing that's really important to understand because i get a lot of questions about this is that well the main effect of testosterone is it makes effort feel good because of the way that it you you it makes you there's a readiness for challenge of all kinds intellectual challenges the way that i describe to people is i'm like i want to fight all the time and not necessarily fist fight but i just want to be in a battle whether it's a battle myself sure yeah yeah i want i want fight i want to go fight friction feels good and so um and robert sapolsky the great robert sapolsky was on my podcast he said you they've done these experiments also um with in uh ultra with altruistic acts of of friction where people donating money for instance it's not just beating people up and this kind of thing so um but and i'm not suggesting people run out and get on out onto get on trt i want to touch on that but basically so you could say well my blood lipid profiles are perhaps a bit worse but with that extra energy you can now start exercising four times a week plus you know cardio plus four times a week of weight training and recover with no problem provided you're doing the other things that you need to do whereas if you weren't you would probably be depleted there's a depression component uh and you know your finances would probably suffer these kinds of things now some people do not need testosterone in place i'm gonna just because i think i'm i'm kind of walking around the margins and people are probably wondering all you know is hubermann on trt um is that what this is about i'm 46 years old i didn't i didn't touch it until 45 um i went 45 years i've talked about some of the supplements that can naturally increase testosterone you're on trt oh so from i'm 46 now i started on my uh at 40 after 45. but let me um so but but let me explain because i'm actually coming off so that um that so what i did is i'm i'm researching a book so i did 45 years of training and sleep and all the normal things found some supplements that will increase testosterone um that's the fedoja and tonga ali you can see it on that joe rogan episode i talk a lot about this on the episode with tim ferriss a number of women are taking tonga ali as a way to increase their free testosterone and getting quite good results i don't have any relationship whatsoever to tonga ali or fadoja company i don't care if you take it definitely check with your doctor there are some kind of spooky reports out there about fadogia and toxicity of the cells in the in the testes but those seem to be limited to rat studies anyway do your research i'm not telling you what to do um and you're responsible for your health not me but those supplements done properly from the right sources can increase testosterone by about 200 nanograms per deciliter the most dramatic i've ever seen is a is a shift from about 300 to or high twos to like you know eights and nines but when i went but i decided to try trt in this in a small dose spread throughout the week um my testosterone at that time was already sitting in the high eights so i was doing fine and you i did as an experiment for part of this book and it changes your mental frame it makes you more self-directed more willing to lean into challenge and counter to the popular belief it makes you calmer this is the thing that people don't realize it gives you more energy but it makes you calmer the in primates non-human primates and in humans stressed angry people are the ones that are in the kind of low-to-mid range of testosterone typically typically these are averages from a few studies and i always thought i always thought well it just makes me more confident and confident men don't get upset easily you know like if someone's like yelling at me or like there's like i i'm my masculinity is not being challenged right now i'm not i'm not that's why people are like oh so you want to fight all the time like well actually no the opposite if someone gets in my face i'm i'm confident enough that i could i can i can walk away you know what i mean you're in your own you maintain your own frame you're not gonna get um pulled off by projection or nowadays the the the buzzword is gaslighting everyone's gaslighting everybody without really under i i'm very interested in psychoanalysis i've been fascinated by this for years and this whole concept of projection is very interesting how do you actually shift someone's nervous system this is not a good thing but how does one shift their nervous system to change the mental frame of another nervous system it's very interesting and kind of spooky stuff when you start to think about how your nervous system will frame shift your frame someone else's frame now this is vital too when your child or your partner comes to you and says i really i'm really stressed about something it requires a an adaptive frame shift and you need to do that people who are autistic who have asperger's don't frame shift very well they're very much in their own frame and they're very good at certain kinds of things and less good at others people who are highly empathic are susceptible empaths will know to getting yanked down different frame shift pathways such that they can oh my god i haven't done anything with my life because i've been so consumed with so-and-so's thinking or feelings around things so testosterone makes effort feel good i talk about the effects on the brain let's leave aside all the effects on the body and yes it might change blood lipid profiles but in general the energy is the component it comprises a neural energy and an activation stance where then it's a question of what you do with that so if you use that as an excuse to eat a little less well train a little less then you're no better off and you might be worse off if you use that as an opportunity to lean into life that's wonderful i i work with a number of professionals and athletes in a kind of consulting um role to assist with some of this of course with an endocrinologist as well new parents for instance who decide they don't want any more kids and they're dealing with lack of sleep and all these things oftentimes benefit from that and the relationship can often benefit um for a number of reasons so this is probably a whole other discussion i'd be happy to come on sometime and just talk all about the hormones because it's all estrogen is key a lot of people in particular men are blocking estrogen when they take trt which is a terrible idea estrogen promotes brain longevity estrogen is good for connective tissues it's good for libido blocking estrogen is a bad idea in most cases but of course some people are worried about water retention or breast development in males and so they're blocking estrogen you have to work with an endocrinologist so it's not testosterone is good estrogen is bad that is absolutely um uh that's very sophomore thinking you know it's it's it's more complex than that sean did you get your did you get your no but i hit a bunch of people with that uh that's how i'm going to combat people you're going to gas light on their sophomore thinking yeah yeah the gas lighting thing is funny because you know gas gaslighting is but basically people are saying that they're triggering them right gas lighting is something very different and uh having um experience with borderline people that's a very it's a challenge both for the borderlines and for the peoples in their lives that's a real psychiatric challenge so anytime i see these these uh valid psychiatric terms being kind of bastardized on the internet i get i get a little bit um uh well that's one of the challenges right like pop science pop you know this sort of like popifying of everything it'll be more viral right like you know it's easy to make something viral when you take away this causes that blank statement you know blanket state to actually get yeah hearing that um it depends is not an answer that goes very far but and here's where i'm hoping there's a tide change or um which is that if people can understand mechanism they can start to understand a little bit of you know we have this stress system and we hear that stress is bad but you know a brief i just did a podcast episode with duncan french from the ufc performance institute duncan's work has shown in peer-reviewed studies that short-term stress raises testosterone stress that lasts more than a day or two or training sessions that go more than 90 minutes that depletes testosterone so is stress bad for for reproduction depends so but if people can understand mechanism then they can start to understand hey an ice bath is stress but it will protect you against illness because in the short term adrenaline buffers you against infection because adrenaline is the signal by which your immune system says oh my goodness i need to combat something so if people can understand mechanism then it doesn't matter if you're talking about acupuncture cold bath sauna lifting weight sprinting you know bikram yoga people can i believe that people are smart and that if you extend a hand of that lend some respect to their intelligence that they'll come along for the discussion about mechanism and that even if i were to get hit by a bus tomorrow that then they could digest the next wave of information coming to them in a much more nuanced way of course people still need protocol they need a jumping off point and so that's why my podcast has been mainly about that but i think science and health information on the internet is changing very quickly um thanks i here again i just have to say it was seeing lex friedman's podcast i don't know what the equivalent is in the in the finance and entrepreneurial area maybe it's you guys but in the kind of general landscape of podcasting i saw lex's podcast for the first time and i thought this guy is having really intense intellectual conversation yeah he's so good he's so weird in a cool way he's so interesting he's unique he is he's kind of punk rock i mean lex is very punk rock i mean he's his lifestyle if you think my lifestyle is unique i mean lex well maybe just get him on the podcast he's a really i'll let him do the speaking uh for himself but i think that once someone's out there doing that it's very hard for people to follow suit with um the kind of low-level version of that so what i love and i have listened to your podcast so i love about your podcast what i love about ferris and rogan and lex and rich roll and i'm missing a few all right i'm going to regret it later though i'm not remembering these names but um because there are others of course is that if if sagar and jetty's news channel for instance remarkable is that if we all push each other to constantly try and increase the quality and the value per unit time of a podcast even if it's not just protocols but it's a style of discourse like we've done today that to me is going to elevate the medium as something that is a serious thing instead of just the you know chatter do you uh how big is your audience right on youtube you've had 10 months so you're that's north of a million what about on uh on podcast uh yeah so well on instagram i think we're sitting somewhere around like 730 000 followers or something like that um uh but that's just really i do put out unique content there that separate from the podcast from time to time but um you're gonna laugh but actually and i'm not cloaking anything i actually don't tell know i don't know i don't know so that's rob so rob and we have a web a web guy i mean you gotta if i had a guess like five to ten million a month that sounds about right i think it's on the higher end of that um i think i know that's right because if it's about two million per episode in the first couple weeks is that something i don't know i'm yeah two million you're at two million an episode i i don't know i should ask rob otherwise you're killing sorry do you realize surely tim or whoever has talked to you and joe has talked to you with two million downloads an episode dude you you're rich you're very you could be very wealthy i'm shocked that you're still uh teaching i'm still wearing the same shirt every day yeah i looked up before the podcast average salary before the podcast i was like this guy could easily be banking a few million dollars a year and doing the exact same thing you're doing now it's not like you'd have to go shift to doing something else um and i looked at it i thought what do professors make here's what i looked up stanford professor this is what's on the internet no idea if this is true or not stanford professor will uh the average professor will make somewhere between 200 to 225 thousand dollars uh per year which is obviously a great living but i thought that's high for an academic um it doesn't for a non-md academic oh the pay is is it's not just stanford it's ever it's abysmal um in in the bay area and i want to be respectful people have different needs and costs and um but that's uh in the bay area that that's a tough tough life for someone with kids uh you know depends um not tough life but anyway i'm gonna get some haters for this but you know what um come hang out come hang out you know and have you have you enjoyed being famous well okay so a couple of things one about the the um the views i really do need to check with rob on the numbers i don't know i don't track that um i know we're doing well one thing in the business side since you have this audience that um yeah i only advertise products i actually use i've been using athletic greens for over a decade right so i love that stuff i don't we stay with a limited number of advertisers insight trackers i bought this tracker i use i use my code huberman huberman yes we work with thornton thank you uh we work with um athletic greens is is a re for me was a really good supplement it's the only one i set aside money for as a student in postdoc or as a postdoc and professor because it covered a lot of things so expensive though yeah it i feel better when i take it so that's why i take it but i get it no it's it is it's like 150 200 a month i think there's a cost there it it yeah so obviously it has to be within the scope of someone's decisions of around finances but the um sleep cocktail so we work with thorn um because the great thing about thorn is the quality of their supplements is so good that you can actually take less of thorn supplements in my experience and get away with it but there are other great supplement companies out there i'm not here to plug the our sponsors but i do um obviously that's the way podcasts make money and i pay my staff um which is rob and mike and ian and we have a few others as well i should mention one thing about the the medium and as a business model so i've never talked about this but the hubermann lab podcast is but one of several podcasts um under a company that i founded um with rob so david sinclair from harvard genetics um yeah professor jones at harvard lifespan right lifespan so he's launching the lifespan podcast with davidson and you're owning this yeah i own that brilliant podcast network yeah so um and so we're working on the front end and back end materials of that me and mike blayback are the creatives on that with that aesthetic and the and it'll be very different than mine right because david um i mean he's you know i wouldn't we're different david you're beating you're building this media business all sitting around longevity and healthy longevity mental and and physical health i don't know we'll call it mental fitness that's a word that we've used mental fitness you're going to crush this this is going to be here thanks well the goal is really that um for instance many professors have excellent information they can share on gut microbiome on addiction on adhd that goes well beyond the depth that i can provide in one of my episodes and so they need to do six or seven episodes but they probably don't need to do an a podcast in perpetuity and so the idea is to have a set of podcasts that you can come to mine if you like david's if you like maybe you god forbid you have a relative dealing with parkinson's and hear from somebody what you can really do about that or alzheimer's or you have a kid and you want to know what are the science-based practices for getting a kid to sleep and for neuroplasticity in a child well let's talk to a world expert in that um and and so the the the idea is to have an umbrella for multiple podcasts the huberman lab podcast is but one of those that i plan to continue david's is going to be the second and we've got a third and a fourth that are revving up now and who knows maybe we should do one on um i don't know some something related to crypto or something i don't i only know what i know and i know academics i know science and i know medicine and so that's what i'm going to bring to the table this is awesome this is awesome i had this thank you while back which was i remember thinking about my favorite science uh he was great but he would and i just thought about like his kind of like sphere of impact like he could you know each class had about 20 kids he would teach five classes a day so we teach about 100 kids a day and so you know his reach as like my best teacher growing up was a hundred students a day a hundred students a year essentially and then with the internet i just thought wow this is going to change the best teachers in the world are going to have millions of students and they're going to make millions of dollars as they should um for being amazing teachers and i've always been looking out for and i've been investing and every platform i can get my hands on anywhere i can see that teachers are able to do that where they're able to scale and have millions of students and have because you know if i'm going to learn math or i'm going to learn about nutrition i can either learn locally like that's the way the world always worked i just learned from my best local teacher that was available to me or now i can learn globally so i can find actually who is the best at not only being an expert but packaging it and conveying it in a way that's entertaining that's relatable that's that fits me right and so you know that's what you're doing you're the perfect example of something i've been thinking why isn't the world moving this way and actually it is it's just it wasn't through online school it was through things like podcasting and and it's more popular in other countries you know china and does a really good job of this they've got a we've done some chinese teachers who've who make tens of millions of dollars a year superstar they're like musicians and athletes yeah same with india you know sean we have that you sent that you shared with me that really cool photo of a guy in india teaching math and it looked like he was a comedian because there was like uh andre this guy his name is biju no he's a guy in india i'll have to check it out teacher he would teach in like local villages and people love learning math from them so he would go to other cities and they would come find him because it had spread through word of mouth eventually he was filling up stadiums free free you know free to attend he was just teaching math on a projector in a 20 000 person stadium and now he created he created an app it's like a 10 billion dollar education app in india but you know like that was his origin story and i thought that was i love it you know and and i love the model around podcasting because yes you have to tolerate some ads but advertisers are happy consumers are happy and it's zero cost to consumer that to me is like if ever there was order in in a universe not the universe but in a universe that's that's it yes but it it it sucks so do you know what do you know my company at all or did you know my company i'm afraid i don't know it's all good so it's all good so we owned this and then we owned this thing called i started this company called the hustle which was a daily email that reached about 2 million people a day for business news we just sold it to hubspot for many tens of millions of dollars and um we are making you know 20 million dollars on ads so we made a lot of money and the problem with ads is it's cool when you're doing it now because you can pick and choose thorn athletic greens you can pick and choose cool [ __ ] and that's exactly how we started but then you get staff and you're like all right we're gonna try and triple every year and so in order to triple every year like there's not that many thorns and athletic greens then you gotta go look at like some other [ __ ] and you're like well we gotta hit these growth numbers and so it's so it kind of you i don't think he worships at the altar of your over your well maybe you know no but you always think about it for example what if i talked [ __ ] about athletic greens and let's say they did something kind of wrong and you you you don't happen well that's my point that's exactly my point you will say well i don't know you know i mean wait it's even the most honest people and good people you are everyone we're all incentivized something and so maybe like he would be willing to defend them a little bit more because they're giving them money which is a natural thing you know what i mean yeah yeah so that is an issue i mean i think that um and we do care about growth um but and the reason we built out a philanthropic arm of this company is because i really i empathize with the struggle that academic scientists live in day to day which is that they don't have time to do their own research let alone work for the world which is what they're really hired to do their grants come mainly from public sources so we're trying to think about ways that we can start to pump some money back into science through the podcast so money coming into the podcast actually represents some of it money going back into the scientific community to do better work we're starting to explore nfts and some of how that might be incorporated um twitter's a great place to learn about that i just want to say that the nft landscape and crypto landscape people are so kind it's like they're trying to come one it's kind of all in it kind of reminds me of the early punk rock movement it's like you they know i'm paying attention to their energy i don't understand a darn thing about it is punk rock it is very punk rock everybody would love to sell you their token and their currency and why it's yeah just wait everybody says let me tell you about it because they are we're all you know selling our own holdings basically interesting wait until you say something bad about them though okay well i i tend yeah i i hope not to do that at least not by accident but i i just noticed that um there's a there's i love the diy spirit look i'm a patriot too i'm sure you have an international audience but look my dad's a first generation immigrant this this country is amazing from argentina so he's not you know he wasn't from some place where he was stricken but he came here on a navy scholarship he's a physicist um you know this is a country where you can make lateral moves it's hard to ascend all right and we we should acknowledge that not everyone starts in the same place and and the the slope is different for different people no question but you can make lateral moves here and the you know think about this the nobel prize is given each year for instance um the world is big the world of science is big most nobel prizes include or are given to people in the u.s and we have one of the most difficult funding schemes for getting money to do research in this country now compared to third world countries we're very wealthy in the research realm but compared to other countries where they basically stock the laboratories with money it's it's incredible here we have these individual labs like doing little like startup style workshop stuff it's that grind it's that leaning into friction that i really believe is is the hallmark of future development and so science doesn't have that we didn't have a podcast platform or information platform and i'm hoping that my podcast and the others like david's and the other ones that come out through our company will will soon populate i'd love to see more of this done out there there's you know there's some smart guy or gal that is out there thinking like hmm like i'm gonna i'm gonna do the podcast on amphibians because i love frogs and i'm gonna like tell people which terrarium to get and like it's gonna be the terrarium the podcast and you never know what's gonna what's gonna work but i love that spirit the entrepreneurial spirit so it's what we're trying to bring well dude thanks for coming on this is badass we um we haven't done a podcast this long in a long time by the way we had i'll tell you really quick we had rob dierdick on recently oh yeah and uh he is uh i forget what we were talking about skateboarding and like wealth or something but he's like the wealthiest yeah rob wouldn't know me but he's tight with mike blayback because rob and big big unfortunately passed away um and mike did all the photos for that um and uh yeah look skateboarders if you want to know what's really cool and how to do the real diy spirit you just skateboarders they just i'm gonna go i'm gonna brat i'm gonna brag after this i'm gonna send you a video of my latest three oh and yeah i can't i ca i've got no tre flip but the um i rat a pool but i'm i'm not i'm not that good dude you're you're a badass man i'm i'm so excited to talk to you i feel inspired after having a conversation with you you're very you're you're very interested much bigger deal oh well we got to speak oh well i want to say genuine thanks for having me on i felt immediate resonance i'm very much like a can sense that so i i think it'd be great to get together in person sometimes do people still do that i don't know are you in california you're in northern california i split my time now between the bay area and southern california so where are you guys yeah we both we both lived there i lived in san francisco for eight or nine years i just bought a house in texas and so i'm in austin as of now but i'm a little bit nomadic so i'm but well i'm gonna be in austin a bunch because i hang out with lex there he's going to take me to jiu jitsu again last time he lives in austin i've never done it before he's a black belt so i don't know he lives but dude i have a i have a gym here at my house like a really nice gym and i have people come over and we can lift heavy i lift heavy and also uh we could box i beat people up all the time so if you want to [ __ ] fight right do that we could we could probably i just this is not this is not a uh we probably shouldn't box i i boxed i had my boxing card and boxed pretty consistently uh various times i'm not very good you don't get a nose like this do a yoga um so let's not box come on man i got a rower we can do anything you want i'm fit this this is the this is the trt speaking folks um it would be great fun i'll pass you guys my number by email just let's text we're in the room

like yeah if you want us if you want to pre-buy southern sam's sticky icky you need to just uh i don't know dm me on twitter by my twitter is seanviewfeed dmv and say i'm in on southern stan sticky icky all right before we get in the episode we got to say something really quick sean i sent you that thing to share so if you go to sean or i's twitter profile you'll see it or you go to ratethispodcast.com mfm it stands for my first million ratethispodcast.com mfm if you leave a review for us on apple podcast we're going to select one person or we slept in one person oh no we're selecting six people and we're going to give a grand to six different people and we'll announce that winner in a couple weeks we're doing this because if we get more reviews in a very particular amount of time and you get more momentum you go up the charts and if you go up the charts you get more listeners or at least that's the hypothesis so we're incentivizing listeners we get more excited we our egos grow and i know that's what everybody wants so let's do it yeah i just went to a conference today um cody sanchez has gone for us to talk and uh dude everyone listens it's pretty fun how was uh how was the conference she has uh her brand is like contrarian contrarian capital i think it is um and so this was the contrarian conference or something like that yeah and i love her and i love the conference but i it was kind of silly like in my head i was making a joke because they had contrarian um merch and they had like hundreds of the same ones and i was like well if we all bought this like that's you know it didn't really work that you know what i mean like uh so anyway it was great though no she was cool i asked i think there was probably 300 people i asked who listened i feel like everyone all their hands went up people were talking about us they always confuse our voices but we get that all the time all right i love it and i was supposed to go to that i didn't go you went um there's like a bunch of different motivations people have for going to these things what was your motivation because some people would say oh going to these conferences is kind of a waste of time and other people say no i love it i network i learn things i just want you because she's she's my friend and it's near my house and then in general because you've gone to some of some of some other ones like this like the podcast one you went to recently or stuff in new york what uh i guess give give people how you think about this stuff uh because i think it's good to have like a frame of like okay this is why i go to these this is how i go to them and this is what's come out of it for me um i like meeting people who i know on the internet that makes me feel good and i also like going you know i've paid money to go to some events i've paid five thousand ten thousand dollars to go to some events um because i can meet one person and become a lifelong friend with them and that pays for itself but makes me happy so yeah i don't mind going yeah i do the same thing i kind of have in my head um i'm here to learn one thing like i want to have one great idea like a truly great idea maybe it's a tactic a marketing idea a realization of something i need to change or a new business idea a new whatever so one great idea is my like bar and then one great person if i do that it's worth it that's like such a low bar but um yeah but what's better what like the the good part about that is then you go hunting you you're saying i'm here to make me one great person who's a great person and if you're talking to somebody who's not that great you're like all right peace out i'm gonna go bump around and see who else is here right and same thing with one great idea you can listen to a talk and you might otherwise kind of zone out or say oh this doesn't apply to me but if you're just on the hunt for that golden nugget the one great idea and it's like dude in the eight hours of this event there's gonna be at least one great idea um it changes the way for me at least it changes the way i i attend these things yeah i agree i'm the same way and speaking of great ideas do we i want to talk to me about let's go to these three news stories that you want to go over because i actually yeah i think you selected all three and they're awesome they're awesome all three are pretty good so um all right so i have three you have one let's start with yours you have one that's about elon tweeting about the uh elon tweeted something about giving away six billion world hunger what i heard was you tell me if this is correct my wife told me this story she goes do you hear you know somebody tweeted out or there's a news story that said you know these billionaires the elon's the richest man in the world now if he you know with six billion dollars he could end world hunger and then he replied to it he was like if you could show me that six billion dollars would end world hunger i'll write the check now like i'll i will happily do it just show me that that's the case and um so that's all i know about this what did you oh you don't know what happened after that okay so uh someone i forget who maybe cnn said if the billionaires would donate six billion dollars we'd cure or end world hunger elon like you said replied and goes and his language was great he goes show me how that will happen and i will sell tesla stock right now to pay for six billion dollars of this stuff and i forget the exact title but something like the head of you united was it uh world hunger or united nations some like official international body the head said you know better yet you know elon just come and we'll show you our processes and how we work and elon said no sunshine is great uh tell me in tweet form how this is gonna help and where the money will go and i will send you the money right now and he goes you know this is just too complicated to say over twitter and um i think and i'm not like the biggest elon nut hugger i think that this totally made elon look great these types of things should be done in a very simple way where you can explain what's happening you don't have to say like um you know exactly but you could say like you know 30 of the budget is going to go to hire around 10 000 people who we think can give out this much you know whatever that is a good enough answer and uh the guy didn't do it total miss and when we were talking to big clown guy uh natter a few days ago he was explaining what he does and then you go no no no this is what you do and you explained it so much better and he goes oh that's how i should always explain it everyone should have that skill that you have and you could actually develop that skill it is a skill it's not just a talent and anyway this guy blew it and i thought it was an awesome tweet thread you know so two things one is on that skill so how do you develop that i'll give you two kind of unorthodox ways that you develop it the first is you gotta have [ __ ] callers around you so like you know the way i was like no no dude that's way too complicated uh most people just won't say that to somebody and uh there's this great clip i know you like uh you watch some joe rogan as well as i do and this is a great clip of brian callan who's one of the kind of friends and the crew of joe rogan and they're they're doing their fight companion podcast which is where they just watch the fight and they're just shooting the [ __ ] uh drinking and eating cheese and you know drinking wine eating cheese and they watch the fight and like i don't know a hundred thousand or more people will tune in to like hang out with them while they watch the fight even though the fight's not visible on the screen that's just how fun it is for them to hang out and during this thing brian callan who's a lifelong you know like comedian he's kind of like a scrawny guy and joe's kind of like a former martial artist he's sort of like a meathead and the other guy on there is an ex-pro fighter so it's a bunch of kind of like bros and um and brian is saying something he goes brian's like oh man if somebody ever tried that on me bro you know i would you know what i would do and they were like and they just kind of moved on for a second and then he's like and the guy said it again like nobody really addressed it and he's like he's like he's like i would never let somebody it would be it would be on and then joe's like right what are you talking about he's like why are you saying [ __ ] like this he's like you know you don't you're not gonna do anything first of all and he's like he's like the problem brian is that you hang out with people that will let you say [ __ ] like this and he's like you need to stop hanging out with whatever type of people let you let you get away with just saying things like this and just you know letting it fly and after that i just thought that was hilarious and then i started noticing oh there's some people in my life and i call them you know the people who will tell you there's food in your teeth it's like there's two types of people there's people who will see it and not say anything and then you know four hours later you get home and you're like bro what the hell i had spinach in my teeth the whole time why didn't someone tell me and then there's the person who will cut you off about here you go you got a little something in your teeth here and you're like oh [ __ ] i'm embarrassed but like the embarrassment was localized to the moment and then you like saved yourself from there that's a true friend and so you want people around you that will tell you when you're saying something that just makes no sense or is confusing or is like delusional or whatever and they're just like what are you talking about why are you saying that you say stuff like this all the time this doesn't make any sense or you say stuff like this and honestly i think you think that's really awesome but no when other people hear that they don't hear really awesome like we asked people like that abreu who used to work for us and we love he was explaining to sean and i what his new business does and he wrote this long paragraph and i think sean goes uh i don't know what any of those words you just said mean and then he was like i buy con i buy land but before paying for it i hurry up and resell it to someone else and make a profit it's like okay great now i understand what that means right yeah well actually the first thing he said was bro i just wrote you two paragraphs and i didn't even have to address it because he knows if you wrote two paragraphs and i don't know what you're what i don't know what you do still that's on you that's not on b and so uh you know the the burden's on the owner so one thing is having people like that around you the other thing is hanging out with somebody who's good at it and maybe you know hopefully for some people listen as this podcast helps them because i think we both do a good job of explaining stuff without too much jargon no you try at least and so the more you hang out with people like that you'll just naturally through osmosis like you know this it'll just pick up it'll be like a sponge it'll just come right into you you'll just start getting better at it because you've heard our voices in your head all the time and so hang out with people who do it like i have a buddy uh suli who's great at this you're really great at this ramone's really great at this so like our best friends all are really good at just saying things for what they are in a way that's simple and easy and fun to understand and like so then you by nate you know you'll naturally get good at it speaking of friends what uh what did so i was out to dinner with moyes the other day and he made this comment about casper he ends up tweeting it pretty brilliant you want to talk about that i do it can i say one thing about the elon so so the guy from world hunger who's like oh it's not that simple i can't really break it down all right so that's obviously a loss on their end but there is a great example of a charity who does this well so um have you seen what charity water does for their like accountability because uh what elon said was the whole thing i'll donate the money my only thing is it has to be kind of like open source and transparently accountable where the money is going and what's the effect of it jack dorsey did that as well and he just jack dorsey did it with a [ __ ] google spreadsheet right yeah he said here's the here's all the money here's where it's going here's the schedule and here's it's a google doc it's a google doc that anybody can go view and you can't edit it but you can go view it at any given time and see how the money thing is amazing so so the founder of cherry water he uh his story's amazing but like i'll give you kind of the the fast forwarded version of it so fast forwarded version of his stories a guy named scott harrison he um he grows up and when he's a kid his mom got this like um terrible illness she basically she was a stay-at-home mom so the dad goes to work kids go to school she stayed home and the new house they had moved into it had like a gas leak or something like that and so it like silently killed her autoimmune system so she got so uh her immune system was so compromised that she could not like go outside she could not like touch objects that had not been sanitized she couldn't do the laundry because like the the cleaner the bleach has chemicals in it and it would just like kill her if you know they had to like do everything by hand using baking soda six times or like if she wanted to read a book scott would go put it in the oven first and they would have to sort of like kill all the bacteria like by sanitizing it with heat and then hand it to her and she'd wear gloves and they would like slowly turn pages and stuff like that like it was insane and so he um but even that whole time they didn't sue the company that had that was responsible for the leak because they were like very religious family and they were like you know this is god's plan and so scott who like grows up with this really unusual childhood he's having to like in many ways be the caretaker of the household because his mom wasn't able to do it he sees his mom's suffering he's like dude you know effortless religion [ __ ] i'm uh i'm gonna go live now so he gets he turns 18 and he like goes to college but i think i think he might have dropped out not 100 sure but he he starts partying like crazy he moves to new york and he becomes like a guy in the party scene and scott if you've ever seen him he's a good-looking guy he's sort of like a george clooney-looking [ __ ] like he's like very like it's like guy gets gray hair and he looks even him more handsome than he did before and so super great storyteller really funny just he's a great hang like i've hung out with him and you're just like charmed you know the whole time and so anyways he's he hits the party scene and he eventually he's like all right i gotta make some money so he becomes a party like promoter so his job was and he says this like my job was to convince rich guys that they needed to pay me like five thousand dollars six thousand dollars to get to go buy this hundred dollar bottle of alcohol and he's like they knew what they were doing and i knew what i was doing and it worked anyways and so he starts making a killing as a party promoter and he's got the fancy watch he's got the model girlfriends he's got the nice penthouse in new york and he's getting paid you know whatever some vodka company will pay him 2500 a night just to be drinking their liquor instead of somebody else's liquor and somebody will pay him to wear this watch instead of somebody else's watch and so he's kind of the man in this scene but a few years go by and he's like starts to feel you know as you do when you kind of get in this party lifestyle he starts to feel a little empty inside like the the high is no longer doing it for you anymore and i think he was the story is he was on this guy's boat this guy his name is what is the name guy the guy who created cirque du soleil like guy canadian guy some name like that i can't remember off top my head billionaire canadian yeah he's on his yacht or boat or whatever party boat and scott's just in the boat like in the room where he was in there's a bible and he kind of sees it and he grew up in a super religious household and then has you know become basically like a sinner um and he just sort of picks up the book and you know he's hungover one day and he starts reading it he's reading the bible and he starts to like kind of like get emotional and he sort of has this literal like come to jesus moment where he's like what am i doing with my life like you know like i'm not a good person i'm not doing good for anyone in the world and like you know i'm just like partying and drinking it's all a very shallow lifestyle it's like you know uh these these hot girls and then these rich guys and this like lifestyle that's not great drugs alcohol that sort of thing so he's like okay and i think also he literally woke up that day and he was like numb in his hand he's like this is like a metaphor i'm not just numbing my arm like i'm numb in life right now so he's like okay here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna take the next six months i'm just gonna take a six month break from this lifestyle and i'm just gonna what's like the most servant like servant thing i can go do how can i just serve people you know how can i go do a very christian thing here and um and so he applies to all these non-profits and they reject him they're like you're a party promoter like we don't he's like dude i'll work for free and they're like no we don't need you you're kind here he's like are you sure like i'm good with people i'm good with like events i'm good with all this stuff and they're like no no like where you come from that's not that's not what we're looking for here so he gets rejected after one after another and finally he gets this one group to agree to let him work there if he pays so he had to pay to go work there so he basically made a large contribution to um mercy ships i think is what it's called it's basically a thing where hotshot doctors in the u.s like for one week out of the year they go on this boat and it goes to africa and then they they spend all week there doing like uh pro bono surgeries on people who need surgeries and then they come back and he's like he kind of his background is photography so he's like oh dude i'll i'll take photos of this trip uh that'll be my contribution and so he goes there and he's got the photos still he'll show it to you and when he gives us talk he shows them it's like what they were doing was there was kids with like uh massive like tumor growth so like you know they would have like a huge lump on the side of their head like the size of a volleyball or like in their jaw their jaw would be protruding out like six inches because they had this growth and like all they needed was just for it to be removed like they're having trouble eating breathing it's like not even a cancerous thing it's just a benign tumor but this needed it removed and he's like dude the line was like a mile long and he's like the saddest part is we um you know we couldn't do all the shirt though the one week was up and there's still people in the end of the line that didn't get their surgeries or whatever so he's like okay um i'm not just gonna do this i i'm just gonna like i'm gonna go back i'm gonna dedicate my life to like you know uh helping people because i can't believe what i've been doing and this was so meaningful to me and whatever so he's like for he does two things he goes to on the ground in africa and he says what is the like root cause what are some of the root causes of this problem so he does kind of what elon calls first principles thinking which is why does this person have this crazy tumor in the first place it's like well they might have this tumor because um you know they are are they don't have clean drinking water and sanitation and so there's like highly infested things so you found that on all these different axes like why are these women uh why why are women um you know falling so far behind in society and not getting high paying jobs well because they actually have to spend five hours a day just walking to the nearest waterhole and walking back carrying this 40 pound 50 pound jug of water and that takes five hours in a day and then then they have to use that water quickly um and like do all the laundry cooking washing of their kids and then like they don't work and then because of that they're like you know stuck and economically stuck so anyways he identifies waters the root cause he's like okay and he asked himself a very important question he goes why have i not been giving to charity like i kind of knew they're suffering all around the world kids in africa are starving and need water and all this why didn't i give and it's a this is the connection to the elon thing he's like because i always kind of felt and heard like you never know where the money goes or if you give if you get even if you do give money um you have this worry like i don't know if this is even making an impact and they never closed the loop so you never knew where the money went and you never saw the impact of your dollars it was just like thank you goodbye here's your tax here's your tax deduction goodbye and so he's like all right i'm gonna do it differently he's like he's like he didn't know anything about the non-profit space but he's like all right let's just do the basics he's like what if 100 of the money went to the cause and he's like that would like clear up that question mark he's like and then he's like also i'm a photographer like why don't we just take photos of the place where we do the project and send it to the person who gave us the money like if you contributed we know where the project is why don't we just send you a photo when we do the project and say hey here's what you what you did and he so he's like i'm going to use gps trackers and photos to make people feel the effect of their giving and that's what he does now that's what he does now so he goes back to new york he throws a party because he's like uh that's kind of the only thing i know how to do if he's like i'm throwing a party it's my 30th 30th birthday or something like that he's like throw a birthday party but instead of giving me a gift at the door charge i just want you to give 30 to the cause i'm 30 years old give 30 bucks to the cause and so people come they have this party because he's got a great social network in new york and uh you know they forget about it three months later he sent them all photos of the project that they contributed to he's like hey that that all added up we drilled these two water wells they used to have to walk this far now here's how far they walk look at the map and um you know we turned a four-hour walk into a you know into a 10-minute walk and then he's like um here's what the women have to say there's videos of them thanking you and here's like the kids you know here's the water like fresh clean this is the water they used to drink it's like dirty here's the clean clear water that's what you did and people were blown away and that became the name they raised a ton of money like 400 500 million dollars yeah well the story gets a little crazier so he he's he's like i'm going to stick to this 100 model 100 of money goes to the college and people were like well bro there's a reason people don't do that like how are you going to pay for your own salary or the salary of anybody working on the charity he's like we'll do a separate bank account literally two bank accounts one that's public donations that go to the cause and one that'll be private donations for people that want to fund our charity to do this and he's like and of course people are pretty interested in doing the 100 thing unless people were into the private thing and that's where like kind of full circle uh uh i guess like i don't know how long i want to go on this but i'll give you the kind of the cool the cool last bit so he's basically running out of money um for the private side for the actual for himself and he's just sleeping on couches and he's like you know i got a backpack to my name and like i'm the only employee so it's fine and but even still he starts running out of money his friends are kind of kicking him off couches he's running out of friends houses to go sleep in and he's like all right um he's like let me just do what like this whole thing may end but i want to do as much good as i can in the meantime so he's like you know this birthday idea of giving up your birthday like we're all pretty privileged we don't need birthday gifts i gave up my birthday that's how i started this charity like instead of giving to me give to them um he's like dude there's these social networks now facebook myspace bibo that they all have like millions of people and they all have this birthday feature people go right on each other's wall he's like so he wrote a letter to mark zuckerberg to like tom from myspace and to michael burch from bibo and he wrote a letter to all of them he said hey you have millions and millions of members on your platforms they all have birthdays log registered in the platform and people looking for a way to wish each other um it would be amazing if you added a charity button a way for you to give up your birthday and let people donate for your birthday to the cause um he gets no reply from facebook he gets no reply from myspace and he gets no reply from bebo so he's like uh whatever didn't work now a month later michael burch from bebo says hey scott sorry i missed this uh we actually just sold the company so he just sold the company for 850 million dollars and he said uh you know so i can't really implement this here but you know what i'm in new york uh let's just meet up for an hour and so he goes and he meets with him scott gives him the full pitch michael's like a british guy he's pretty reserved you know in person he's he's you know british people have like a dry sense of humor too so they're not like the most like emotive when you're talking to them and so scott basically said feels like oh i told this guy what we're doing he basically didn't flinch and he moved on like whatever and um he had six weeks of runway left in the bank he's like ah that was my last that was my hail mary i have six months six weeks of runway left and then this whole thing ends but you know what we did some good work and then michael wrote him an email right after the meeting like the next day and he just said hey scott loved her chat um send me your wire instructions i'll send you a million dollars use it however you wish keep rocking and the million dollars kept them going for one more year and then since then they've now raised hundreds of millions of dollars for the charity they're like one of the biggest privately backed charities because they have this 100 model and michael got them in with other kind of wealthy tech people and they all like this idea of like accountability transparency and closing the loop on on giving and feeling the impact like that just feels right to the kind of the new new wave of rich people and so it's like taking off since then that's the crazy story of charity water that you just gave them a 30 minute infomercial yeah uh i don't feel bad i've been with them to africa and literally it's like uh it's not only like changing lives but when when he goes there people literally he's the most humble dude but i went to the village and people literally feel like he's jesus hey because it's like a white man who comes to this village he's like the only white person ever like in the village and b because he like whatever he's doing when he leaves here somehow results in fresh water being like given to our village and they're like thank you whatever you're doing out there is is you know god's work that's badass i should i should give to him i have not but after that pitch i will um can i let me tell you about someone interesting have you heard of a guy named aj patel i bet you haven't never heard of him what is it you have not heard of him and you're going to be surprised that you've not heard of him so this guy's way low-key and i got interested in the space because i've been a lot really interested in low sugar products uh whenever like whenever i'm in new york or particularly new york because i go to like corner stores all the time you see like moms with their kids and they buy like hawaiian punch or like [ __ ] gatorade like a sugar factory a corner store and a grocery store are sugar factories it's sad and i feel horrible dispensaries maybe yeah it's horrible and it's because maybe that's just more convenient but and people just i don't think know better so i've been doing research and i found this guy named aj patel so listen to what this guy's done so he started a this he's only 32. so he started this thing called smooth viking which was a men's grooming business that he sold then he started in insta naturals which is a natural base skin care uh business it did 55 million dollars in 2018 um and it's been uh i mean it it crushes it um and then he started zen wise which was plant-powered vitamins and supplements and it was doing okay like five to eight million dollars in revenue but then he was like the thing about vitamins like people are a lot a lot of people are asking me for vitamins for my pet for their dogs for their cats and he was like that's cool and it's even cooler because you have no idea if it works right that's the funny thing about pet stuff and and i give my uh pet vitamins and i'm like does it work i have no [ __ ] idea right but i'm doing it and so he starts this thing called zesty paul's and zesty paul's is kind of amazing and so he kind of creates a strategy where he does two things the first thing that he does is he spends a lot of money up front on making the brand really good you know a lot of guys a lot of times guys like you or me will just kind of throw something up there yeah like an mvp right the minimum viable product kind of looks shitty and crappy at the beginning yeah so he hires a a a agency or a branding agency and they help him make zesty paul's like look really great and then he his whole goal is to first dominate amazon then go to retail and i was doing some research and i used uh jungle scout and i also watched a bunch of videos so zesty paul's recently sold for 610 million dollars it's estimated on amazon they are doing around 800 sorry 8 million dollars a month on amazon only and then probably another seven million uh through their retail outlets it costs around eight dollars to wholesale and it sells for twenty six dollars so it they could have been doing around forty million dollars in profit when they sold and they sold for six hundred and four uh ten million dollars now the reason i'm bringing this up his new thing it's called high key cookie it's and i've noticed that when you look up high key co-founder they'll want they don't mention his name he's trying to hide it for some reason i don't know why he's trying to hide i don't know what his deal is he just prefers being low-key um but he doesn't talk about it too much i think he just prefers being low-key but uh high key is basically low sugar cookies and he's doing the exact same thing where he's getting on amazon and he's ranking and he's got 60 000 reviews and it's a pretty new product already it's pretty amazing what this guy's doing he's doing the same strategy over and over and over again um are you looking at uh high key cookies on i'm on his uh his linkedin right now so he's listed as the co-ceo and uh he looks like he's in florida how did you hear about this person um i two different ways i was researching um low-carb cookies because i'm fascinated by that i'm right now some current obsessions are low sugar cookies and low sugar ketchup and other sauces right um and i was researching and i saw high key and i remember a friend our mutual friend told me about this guy who had this thing called zesty paws and his whole strategy was to dominate amazon and then go to retail wow very impressive uh very few people have done what this person has done so i think he's 32 years old or 31. yeah that's pretty impressive um have you tried fat snacks it's like um so i'm i have a list of lists here of companies that are interesting and i did try fat snacks and i thought that they were fine i thought they were okay but the problem that i have there so i eat quest all the time are you familiar with quest bars yeah i like the quest chips because i'm a chip guy i don't have a sweet tooth but the quest they basically have like a version of doritos and honestly they're like the only keto snack that i actually like i'm like it like actually replaces the craving you know yeah so i eat a ton of quests now but there's like a big background here so uh how do you say his last name tom bilyeu he spoke at our event hustle county pretty cool guy this was actually one of the first d2c kind of home runs so basically they bootstrapped this company and within five years sold it for a billion dollars and they were making it i think tom's mom or someone in his family was really overweight and he wanted to create a low light glycogen food you know lower carb food for his overweight family member and he's like i just need it to taste good so we can replace candy and so he creates this thing and revenue is doubling like every month and eventually they sell it for a billion dollars when they get to 100 million in revenue but there's a it's quite controversial so i eat them but a lot of people don't like it because it has sucralose or is that how you pronounce it sucralose yeah that's right and it's basically like a sugar alcohol and they also put a lot of fiber in it and so their protein a lot of people don't like it because it's like not the best protein it also has palm oil a lot of people don't like palm oil so a lot of like health nuts including justin mares who i talked to about this they don't like it because it just kind of got some [ __ ] in there but frankly i love it but um the reason why quest bars are amazing is because they are in every [ __ ] store if you go to a 7-eleven or a gas station they're gonna have quest bars right whereas a lot of the other stuff the reason why i don't consume as much as they're not they're just not convenient right and so anyway i'm getting incredibly fascinated with these low sugar products that are in every store well i like the idea of the low sugar sauces i think low sugar ketchup is a great one to go after who's doing that is that is that a business that's like saturated or no it's not a vessel that's a great idea i think it's fantastic and the reason why it's fantastic is when you're trying to eat lower carb and eat healthy mustard has no calories and no sugar in it barbecue sauce is [ __ ] uh ketchup very high sugar you know if heinz uh heinz has a 45 billion dollar market cap they make something like seven billion dollars a year just in sauces and condiments most of it is basically ketchup and ketchup is crazy high sugar their ketchup the reason why it's that bright red is there's a ton of um a ton of sugar in it and there's a company called primal kitchen which sold for 300 million dollars in 2018 it was started by this guy who kind of looks like an old version of me his name's mark uh what's his name mark sisson i think his name you have to look up mark sisson s-i-s-s-o-n i believe that's his name um and he had a whole line dude just does look like an older version of you that's hilarious yeah he looks like an amazing he's ripped this guy i don't know how old he is he looks like he thinks he's like 70s 60s yeah and he is like absolutely shredded which is impressive well i meant his face we kind of like similar faces but older dude this guy is this is you man this is going to be amazing wow you're going to look like this so he's 68 years old wow crazy and so he had this this business where he he had a blog he's been a blogger forever a health blogger and he created primal kitchen which is a uh uh they make dressings dude the dressings and ketchup are the worst dressings have some like an italian dressing so much [ __ ] sugar oh i'm eating a salad it's like how's the salad like 1200 calories because the dressing so i've been like super curious about this and tell me what you think about this the problem with a lot of d2c companies is that the cost to acquire a customer is stupidly high right now it's i think it's the highest it's ever been uh everywhere the highest it's ever been yeah correct but particularly with the facebook change and competition it's just getting high so our friend andrew created this thing where basically he he this was illegal what he did but like whatever it happened he he created a menu and put it on ubereats and was just like making low glycemic muffins so i guess like almond flour muffins at home and putting it on ubereats and he just like made the branding really cute could you just create like one of these high key or these low carb cookies or something like that and just put it on the local ubereats start getting customers put like a coupon code in there i mean i feel like that's an interesting way to kind of hack customer acquisition for a lot of these d2c things yeah i think that is kind of interesting although i don't know how many people are gonna like order just uh like even a bakery it's like okay yeah you're getting like you know a dozen muffins or cookies or whatever like i don't know if people would just go order um like a sauce or something right like this no but the cookies yeah i don't think they would do cookies but have you heard of some insomnia by the way it's only illegal because he just didn't have a commercial commercial kitchen and a license right but like you could easily do that right you could do the same exact thing if you're just if you're not doing it out of a you know like a home kitchen or whatever you just need a permit right that's the only problem with it yes correct have you heard of insomnia cookies yeah they're insane yeah they're insane they're amazing i'm just thinking like i think you could do that from a cloud kitchen and then start selling them online i totally think you do that crumble is also like growing like crazy right now i think it's one of the fastest growing franchises is crumble cookies um but let's get back to this ketchup idea how do i convince you to start this company because you would crush it uh it's in your area of expertise it's a beautiful market because huge like huge demand um and it's a consumable so you run out and you have to keep re re-buying um and people use a lot of sauce and you could turn this into a whole you can extend into other sauces but if you'd start with you know ranch or you start with ketchup you'd get like a huge number of people barbecue sauce like just two three skus you could do this and then with your marketing prowess like you could build you could literally build like a 500 million dollar company for this in like four years uh i think it's amazing to me i i should the other day i went to the store and i bought ketchup i the other day i went to the store and i bought ketchup and it was it was like a hot i didn't realize it was near halloween and they called it blood tomato and i thought that meant like oh like it's like it's a weird category where it's only the tomatoes and no sugar and i bought it and it was just normal hinds and i've been eating this [ __ ] all week because i don't want to throw it away and it's horrible the sugar in heinz is is it makes it taste good so sam sauce what are we calling uh what do we call the the the brand here [ __ ] southern sticky icky yeah yeah there we go dude yes there we go oh my god dude southern sam is such a good i'm not joking like okay i'm just gonna use you as the face of this i'll build the bread i'll do all the work maybe and actually we'll watch this thing dude this is an incredible you're like sticky icky like yeah if you want to if you want to pre-buy southern sam's sticky icky you need to just uh i don't know dm me on twitter by my twitter is seanviewfeeddmv and say i'm in on southern sticky icky which is this first sauce that's coming out and it's gonna be a i mean you're a fitness influencer so you gotta have that balance you're gonna have the health aspect we know that we've seen the body we've seen the videos what we need now is that flavor but southern sam he's been this is what you needed back when you had your hot dog stand you just needed the condiments you just needed a it's a full circle oh my god i love it have you heard of um sir kensington ketchup yes my buddy our buddy invested in it who um oh okay great it sold for uh 140 million dollars yeah and i think it undersold it sold pretty you know sold early on yeah but i think at that time also like i think selling helped them get into retail in a big way and uh you know that's one of the good things about selling these companies is like if you could do the branding you could do the cult online following you can do the d2c online marketing side you actually almost want to leave some dry powder for the acquirer you want to go to the acquirer and say yeah we're doing amazing and we have we don't even know how to do retail you guys know that right you guys know you got you got a buddy you play golf with who does target who does uh safeways nationwide on the you know you have the the guy in the rocky mountain region for whole foods he's your ex frat buddy oh fantastic like you should just buy this and then boom you already have your growth story baked in of how you're going to improve this and so that actually helps you sell the companies to have that dry powder of sure what can the acquirer do they don't want to see a lemon that's just been squeezed all the way all the juice is out because then it's all priced in dude maybe i'll go to the store like right for this just go buy a bunch of organic and low sugar ketchups and see what's out there like i'll be the first to admit the sugar in there makes it taste so good i mean i'll just eat ketchup with a spoon that's just so good this is the idea okay okay okay i got full last episode it was like uh what can we do with this marketing budget that will uh like make for a good story beyond just you know direct response ads this is what we should do with the marketing budget we should be launched showing we'll do case studies basically do a fully open business basically we should show how we would build this business from scratch and southern sam's southern sam's secret sauce is gonna be the first place that we start we just we take we take 10 grand we take 10 15 grand and we put that instead of going and saying hey listen to our podcast we actually just tell the story of how we're building this on the podcast and that will make people want to tune in they'll see the growth and they'll see the success story which is ultimately what this podcast is about brainstorming great ideas and then talking about how you bring how you would bring them to life it's definitely interesting i think it'd be fun i got to go to the store though and buy a bunch of them and see what they're about and see if they taste good but uh this primal kitchen one seems incredibly interesting i and i would imagine that these i bet the multiples for selling these i would imagine they'd be all right right they'd be pretty good because the repeat purchase rate on ketchup is crazy high i'd have to imagine yeah i think you can safely sell for you know somewhere between 2 and 4x revenue depending on what your story is so how fast you're growing how big that market is you know et cetera et cetera but i think two even up to five times uh revenue is possible for a brand like this but yeah well then i'm only going off a couple of data points maybe those were outliers that i know about i'm not sure yeah i'll go do some research i'm gonna figure out i'm gonna i'm going after the big ketchup yeah exactly we're going after big red we're gonna have to we're going after big sugar but i also think uh maybe maybe a gum line how about gum do you like gum sugar most gum is sugar-free you know it's like the best sugar-free gum it's better than scripting we have to go to the next level we have to be like xylitol free or due to trident remember remember how trident is like dentist recommended that's been sugar free yeah well we are all recommended we're selling choose gum if anything you're gonna do gum with caffeine in it there's this guy named there's this guy named nick simmons he's got this business called run gum and it's gum with caffeine in it lucy doing is that what that is yeah so i invested in a nicotine uh gum company i think it's only doing okay gotcha dude i love nicotine though i i i here let me show you what i have in my pocket right now can you see this uh i see it's a little fuzzy but i see like a vial of some kind what is that it's nicotine lozenges and it's just it's just like a cough drop you just put it in your lip and you just kind of suck on it i love nicotine man is that the same thing as a pouch no there's no tobacco there's no tobacco it's just it's literally just like a mint it's like a mint that has negative that does what why do you do that to stop to quit smoking or to give you a bun yeah so like i like cigars and so if i could i would smoke cigars all day and so now i can go like two three weeks without a cigar and i just like sucking on these things i feel like nicotine does have a lot of interesting advantages and i don't i don't know if nicotine is inherently bad for you in itself i know that the tobacco is so i bumped into this guy on twitter and go to um go to it's oklahoma or just just google oklahoma smokes have you heard of this brand no but i love it so oklahoma smokes almost like a sister brand to southern sam sticky icky but uh oklahoma so so this guy was like oh yeah i have this uh like agency and we were doing kind of like branding for other products and then we launched our own product uh oklahoma smokes and it's basically it's an alternative uh thing you could smoke it's like an alternative cigarette and it's got no nicotine and no tobacco but it's got the form factor of a cigarette so you light it up you smoke it you puff it out whatever and um and it's doing really well so he's got like a good amount of traction and i was like wow uh that's great like you know what's uh and so i looked him up in the kind of like ad library and i was like dude i don't see any ads he goes oh yeah you can't advertise for this on uh facebook or like pretty much any ad network because they don't want you advertising cigarettes even though this is like a nicotine free tobacco-free and um he's like so it's all just organic like tick-tock basically people just post about it on tik-tok and it goes like kind of viral on tick tock and that's where all the growth comes from it's just people organically talking about it on tick tock and they have a slick website the website is very nice the branding is great um the whole thing is really well done um and i i like it a lot so you know oklahoma smokes maybe we work with their agency for our uh for our brand all right we got who they use it's all coming together they are the agency that's what they were doing are they based in oklahoma no i think it's just a brand like the dude was like just like some indian dude although i'm an indie dude i was born in oklahoma so i guess i guess maybe they do have some oklahoma roots i'm not sure but i think it's a lot more like where do they live isn't this just like isn't that an amazing brand name oklahoma this is amazing oklahoma just sounds like a band i want to wear this like everything i want to be a part of yes oklahoma smokes oh that's phenomenal that's a brilliant name right like if that was my nickname you know i'd be a happy man so and they're doing here's their dude look at this company they're doing no nick november so no nicotine november uh and they're giving you discounts um september baby this is good i like these guys where do they live do you know uh i have no idea i don't even know if he wanted me to shout it out i mean he probably is happy with it but uh i've never tried it i don't smoke so it's like not a product i would use i just thought the branding was extremely well done and so i kind of added it to my swipe file of like oh this is this is a great name and a great brand here and uh really cool product idea and challenging you know it's it's doing well but it's not huge because very hard to grow very hard to market something like this um through traditional channels so i don't know what they're going to do you know hopefully this gives them a little spike or whatever but uh you know i think that's the hard part about a business like that you want to do one more um yeah let's do one more do you have one or you want me to to pick one here you we didn't do our news thing i kind of hijacked it let's long ass chris harrison pick one of those pick one of the two uh let's do the zillow thing so so the funny story about this zillow thing so zillow came out and they said hey we are shutting down our ibuyer business which is basically where they would just uh you want to sell your home boom we'll give you an instant offer our algorithm will do a calculation and spit out a price you don't have to go through a broker you don't have to stage your house you don't have to do like three months of showings like we'll just give you an offer today you can sell your home today and the idea was this was you know sort of an idea they stole from open door so open door was a startup that was built to do just exactly this instantaneous uh like instant sales of houses and um zillow saw open door growing and value and now open doors public and they created a couple years ago their own in house like competitor they copied that feature but it didn't work so they got stuck they just came out and announced hey we lost 500 million dollars this quarter oops uh we're going to lay off 25 of our staff and we have 7 000 homes that we need to unload because we're getting out of this business and they're getting 1.8 billion they're getting out of it because they also are getting criticized constantly because zillow is what everyone uses to get comps for homes and if the person also buys them you could easily manipulate the price of things so if you they can buy a home in one neighborhood knowing that it's going to increase the the a lot of different things so and it's competitive with their core business so they're which i give them credit for because most companies they wouldn't do it for all these reasons we're mentioning right now they would just stay out and they would get disrupted zillow tried to not get disrupted decided to add this feature but like their core business is basically selling to agents right for consumers they give you price information and you're supposed to be a trusted source so that's one challenge the other conflict was the main business is agents buying leads from from zillow and if zillow is the buyer then they don't need the agents they are their own agent and so they were competing with themselves in many ways so anyways you're getting out of this business uh you know big kind of uh uh what do you call it like a scar from like you know a bruise from from going after this the stock price is just in the [ __ ] which is ironic because we're in this group chat where for months like the last year basically these guys have been our friends have been like pimping out oh dude zillow zillow's brazil is a great boss yeah and i was like 25 000 worth exactly same i bought i don't know like 50 or 100 dollars worth of it and i'm down big everybody everybody in the group is gonna be for something yeah we're all down like somewhere between 30 and 40 or something on this and i agreed with it i thought so i think zillow's the greatest thing ever because to me like what do you do when you're in a fancy neighborhood even if you're not buying a home you just go into zillow you know it's a category owner they own it right yeah so so you know zillow the stock is down big right now uh the funny thing is open door stock also took a beating so they're down like 12 just on the news that zillow failed at this people are like maybe opendoor's also gonna fail with this and then they came out with this god-awful did you see this tweet that they did um that that open door did it's the worst it's the absolute tone-deaf idiot just you know what the best thing to do is make fun of them so listen you know what do you remember what biden did when uh he was running for president which part forgetting he shut the [ __ ] up because when you have the basement yeah when you have a guy like trump who does all the talking and like is his own worth sending me you shut up you hide and you don't say a word that's what open door should have done they should have locked themselves in the basement and said everyone is forgetting to mention us even though we do this exact same thing you just shut up um and that's what they should have done yeah or they should have come out cocky they should have come out and posted a chart of how much ass they were kicking and just be like uh you know this is you know this does this is a hard business or it's not for everybody and then just post their chart of themselves kicking ass at the same time zillow's dying on the same business but instead i'm going to read this word for word you tell me if you understand one percent of this open door just randomly tweets yesterday we're in the midst first don't say midst we're in the midst of a generational shift towards a fully digital experience comma with large comma unmet need for seamless experience in real estate period what a circle jerk said nothing then they reply to their own tweet with our track record of executional excellence and many years of investment and consumer experience technology pricing there's they're just saying words comma technology comma pricing comma and operations comma we are well hyphen positioned to me consumer demand with a best comma in class product and service open door is open for business we have demonstrated strong growth unit economics we are energized to help homeowners nationwide with simplicity certainty and speed i saw this and i was like what the [ __ ] the funny part the ironic part is this is done by somebody who's like they're calms their job is coms corporate comms they're a communication professional this is their their actual job you want to know they forgot the number one most important rule for about copywriting you know what that number one rule is no one cares about you they only care about themselves exactly that's the number one rule if you remember that you're gonna be you're gonna be 90 of the way there no one cares about you they only care about themselves it's like when you go to a website and they go we've been in business since 1994. our pure our passion is to serve you our dear customers we've been serving customers for a long time and we know that we're going to have a lot of high integrity when we handle you it's like i don't care no one cares no one cares yeah exactly they violated all the rules so what's another rule um don't use words like that yeah exactly you just talk like you speak talk like you speak uh write write like you speak and then use like you know eighth grade reading level you know this is like you know 20th grade reading level and i said none of it none of it makes sense to the average person uh they also didn't say anything of interest like what did this mean this all this meant was please don't sell our stock please don't sell our stock please please please please don't sell our stock we didn't make the mistake they did and there were so many better ways to do this so that was i thought so i think there's this idea so like when i um was running the show basically at the hustle um my staff would be like we need to change the landing page or we need to change the footer and i'm like well why and they go well because it's been the same forever and my analogy was always yeah but you're thinking about it this kind of poorly for example our office was on a corner and there was a billboard right there and i would say how many people do you think are going to see that billboard for many many times in a row and they would say well most people are probably just passing by and i go yeah i would agree with that now of course you and i we've been sitting here for a month now and we see that same billboard every single day so we're kind of sick of it but nine out of 10 people are just passing by and they're seeing it for the first time every time what you need to remember is that most people are not just sitting there they're just a parade you know walking by and that's what like open door kind of like realize they're like oh well yeah most people like so they're probably in the thick of this and they're seeing zillow flip out and they're like everyone is everyone's talking about this everyone's thinking about us it's like no no no no you are but most people don't give a [ __ ] just shut up just be quiet hi now's the time to hide yeah so yeah i saw that and our friend did something pretty funny yeah so moyes uh mois ali he um he tweeted he tweeted out i love this tweet by the way this is just he's very he's a very good writer a great cocky tweet so he goes dear zillow and rich barton the ceo zillow who by the way is badass um i'm sure today is a tough day i'd like to purchase all the homes you have on your balance sheet in one transaction is that something you'd consider i will pay cash and closes in 30 days no contingencies are financing delays best comma m signing off with the initial is the power move by the way i will never ever write my full name again because the initial is so good and uh this is great obviously he's not gonna buy 2.8 billion dollars uh worth of stuff himself but but maybe maybe uh maybe maybe he's got some strategy here maybe he's got some money he could tap into i'm not sure but yeah it also just like hilarious tweet and a way to kind of be out there on twitter and ride the ride the wave of something happening yeah i thought this tweet was brilliant he's a troll and i love when he trolls because he trolls in a very smart way yeah um he's a cocky troll and you know the the weird thing is how did they lose money doing this so like the from what i can tell they're like single family homes which is what they were buying seeing a family home market is like at an all-time high like people from covid are you know there was the great reassessment which is what happened during cove but everybody reassessed their job their you know can i work from home oh wow i didn't need to travel for business i could just do a zoom meeting and actually it works do i need a gym membership i could work out at home i could do i like this job or actually maybe now that i have this break i can i can think about what i really want to do and i pick up this hobby and you know maybe when i'm at home in this marriage this marriage sucks you know maybe i should reassess that it was the great reassessment and during that a lot of people move they move for different reasons if your job is remote you could leave high priced places like california and new york you could relocate to other places um if you're at home all the time maybe you need more space and you want to buy you want to buy a bigger bigger place with a bigger yard and bigger office space or whatever so people were buying more than ever and they were buying single-family homes so people were leaving the cities and so condos were down in inside san francisco and new york um like 15 and single-family homes were up 15-20 so i don't fully understand i'm sure there's a totally logical explanation but you know it's like how did you how did you lose money doing the one thing that everybody wanted you were buying and selling single-family homes like and i think what they said was you know the price was too unpredictable um so we you know we weren't able to do this well and the other thing they said was there's a labor shortage they couldn't get people to come flip the home so like do the repairs you needed to to flip the homes um so yeah i'm sure like that's really hard but that's crazy they weren't able to do it in like a bull market yeah i think it's nuts it doesn't make me like them anymore and i and i i'm a shareholder i'm bummed i guess i guess they should have just stuck to what they did you can hold your stock are you gonna sell i don't sell so yeah i'm gonna hold okay cool me too um all right anything else you wanted to do or we can wrap it up here we'll wrap it up here um don't forget to go to what was the url uh rate thispodcast.com mfm as in my first million so rate this podcast go leave us a review if you if you get enjoyment on the show that's kind of all we ask helps us move up the charts helps us get more downloads i think we're going to do one more thing i believe what we're gonna do i'll kind of like i'll say briefly um i think we wanna do something where you get we're gonna have a budget of like up to 20 grand a month and the people who create clips for us sean and get the most views we'll give them a little bit of money ah okay i like it yeah banner jonathan came up with that okay i like it yeah i paid to listen so it's a good deal well you paid to chop up clips and and to be creative so kind of a good idea all right all right that's the pod

you see all the best people are crazy you can't be not crazy and be the best when there's crazy people out there who want to be the best i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days yeah i'm gonna actually start by asking you a question i was just talking to uh ben about this would you send your kids to a school and let them get hit or like not hit but like it's not the right word but like if you're acting like an [ __ ] they can grab you by the collar and kind of push you against the wall are you okay with that no you're not okay with that i'm not okay with that and it's not because i don't want my kid to get hit it's that i wouldn't trust the person who would be doing the hitting to know the the right way and the wrong way and the right where the line is because i just think about it this way if you're the type of teacher who signs up for that like if you're the type of teacher who goes to this specialty discipline school the specialty abuse school uh to teach like i just don't want that person have a screw loose and i'm not there to see it so i would rather err on the side of no you can't hit uh my kid or like rough them up in any way um unless i'm kind of like i know this person i trust this person i'm there or whatever like like for example i think if it was a coach of some kind and the coach was really tough on my kid i don't know about hitting but like you know kind of punking my kid totally cool with that as long as the coach is legit but i've seen a whole bunch of people and actually grown up now and look back at some of the teachers and coaches i had who kind of did weird stuff and now that i'm an adult i'm like oh this was just a totally flawed person at the time i really like i thought they were the authority i thought that they must know things that we don't know and then now i see them on facebook and they're posting like crazy anti-vac stuff and they're like you know like preppers and stuff like that i'm like oh you know you kind of always just had a screw loose and at the time i thought i was the i was in the wrong for not not you know not uh playing by your rules or whatever i went at my i went to all boys high school and i was a you know i was a jerk at the time and there was times where like the guy the disciplinarian like you're supposed to have your shirt tucked in and i would if i didn't have it untucked and i got yelled at a bunch of times they would come up and like give you like a horrible wedgie like they would grab you by the underwear and lift you up and like what if i told you someone about this and or like if i like you know i was disrespectful a couple times and they just would grab me by the shirt and push me against the lager and they're like if i hear from this again you're over you know what i mean and i loved it was it a military school it's just a boys school no it was just an all-boys catholic college prep school in st louis where i'm from that was your house yeah you went to all boys high school and what about like before that i went to in st louis the way it works is most people in my area go to private school and like so i went to a catholic k-8 and then uh eight to twelve all-boys college prep catholic school at the time it was like 900 a year uh st ambrose my grade school so it's like that's just what everyone did all right what do we uh what do you want to talk about today can we talk about uh your tweet that went viral that was pretty cool your boy's done it again another hit how many how many people did it reach uh 5 million something like that wow so what you wrote honestly just wasn't even that interesting so i i'm very surprised pretty cool i would say it was pretty cool i think the reason i only thought it was pretty cool was like because i already know you and i know how you think the cooler there was two cool parts about it this the the the one it was okay it was good it was like a 8.5 out of 10 in sight number two the thing that's a 10 out of 10 was the fact that you just thought of it like that that you just it was a pretty original thought i think and uh like you broke it down that was a 10 out of 10. and one of the other thing that was a 10 out of 10 was that you reached amazing people so bill backman bill ackman if you don't know five or ten billion dollar person uh kind of a little bit like a god in the hedge fund world he actually retweeted it and he said incredible incredibly interesting insight or something like that yes and i thought that was amazing i thought that was so cool and i think that for the listener the takeaway here is like i know you and you're kind of a big deal now but like three years ago you weren't a big deal and now you're basically like one you're like if you dm'd bill ackman or loads of other people or you call their email you have access to them and that's pretty amazing about the internet it's it's true it is amazing how these things go i'll tell you some cool things that happened um i don't know why i want to tell you this i like i i guess i would never really say if if i would just think of this like a podcast i would never say this on the podcast because it sounds like why you bragging but like if i just think about this like i'm just talking to sam i'd be like dude you won't believe what happened and so i tweet this thing out it um and i i guess for people who don't know what it is i guess i tweeted a thing that was like um the uh it was about the metaverse which is like the dorkiest term you know ever so you know already i feel lame even talking about my it's lame to talk about a tweet it's lame to talk about the metaverse i'm multiplying two lames together um but basically what happened is uh facebook rebranded or renamed the company to meta and so it was kind of top of mind for a lot of people and i've been hearing a bunch of people talk about the metaverse kind of in the investor circle like i remember when we had um who was it that we had on here mike maples i think it was and he was like he was talking about big trends that he had kind of bet on in the past and we said what trends are you betting on now and he said like you know the shift to remote work this other thing and he goes and the metaverse and like we didn't even really talk about it on the episode but i remember stashing that away as like huh this pretty legit guy said he's betting on the metaverse and like i i don't even i don't know what a metaverse company is and so i just kind of stash it away as like something i should probably go look into at some point and um so i basically wrote a thread that was like hey i think the way that people think about this is uh is wrong so i thought about it originally i thought about it the way i think most people do which is the metaverse is a place if you've ever read or watched the movie ready player one it's kind of like oh there's a virtual world like second life or like you know whatever there's this virtual world we're all gonna go live in a video game it's like a video game life basically and that's what people i think it's just the sims with with the with the headset yeah like you're plugged in it's some some version of the matrix already player one or people have these different mental models from like books or movies that they've seen and i said i don't i actually i don't think it's a place i don't think that the metaverse is just like one giant minecraft world that we're all gonna go live in and hang out in and play in and work in and all that stuff i don't think it's like one company creates this this game and we all go live in it um i said instead i said what if it's not a plot what if we're wrong about that what if it's not a place what if it's um a time i was like what does that mean well a time i basically described this like parallel so in in the ai world um for artificial intelligence this idea of the singularity and it's this moment where like kind of like technological progress just sort of escapes us it just it's uh it starts accelerating faster than you know uh we can imagine and in rough speaking terms this is where the doomsday people think you know it's after this that basically the robots you know the artificial intelligence takes over and humans are done and then other people think it's utopia where artificial intelligence can just invent things it can create cures for cancer and whatever else and humans will be saved and like we will all have to just we all just will have hobbies we don't have to work because ai just takes care of everything but there's this idea of the singularity and it's this moment in time where ai basically surpasses this threshold so i was basically arguing with my my idea was i think the metaverse is actually a time it's a moment in time where we care more about the things in our digital life than in our physical life and care more doesn't mean like oh i don't care if my body gets hurt or dies right that's not really what i meant but like if you spend all your time working online and then you communicate with people who are also online and you don't even really know them in real life you're not talking to your neighbor you're talking to this person on twitter or this person in a discord this person on reddit and then your watch all of your entertainment is streamed to you online and all of your assets are digital assets like cryptocurrencies and things like that so you know your money is digital like once everything goes digital and more and more things go digital at some point there's a tipping point where you basically your identity your assets your social life it's all online and i said that to me is the metaverse and it won't be one company it'll be a combination of companies that are all doing that and i kind of gave some examples like you know uh a filter and instagram is basically like a a better superior replacement to cause you know getting plastic surgery or um wearing heavy makeup right like the digital filter matters more is cheaper more accessible to more people because ultimately you care how you're seen online almost more than you care how you're seeing in person right like i know plenty of people that would never they would never post a photo of them with their hair messy and their sweats and their oversized t-shirt they would never post that on instagram but they'll go to the grocery store like that because who cares i don't care what these people think but i really care what those people think so what i was describing was that this is already happening there's this long-running shift that's happening where you're caring more about your digital reputation your digital identity your digital assets than your real world stuff and i said to some people this is going to be like sound like the worst thing ever some people think i think this is the best thing ever and not my argument it's not even it's neither the best nor the worst it's just the way that things are going and you'll make of it what whatever you choose so anyways you tweet this on like friday or thursday and yeah what happened at first nothing really happened uh it kind of did how i thought it would do initially so initially i was like oh it's kind of an interesting idea but pretty like nerdy and in the weeds and i don't think anyone's gonna care and it kind of didn't do much at the beginning and then something happened and it just started picking up steam like it's it's getting more like yesterday it had even more mentions because uh this you know fred wilson is uh the vc yeah the vc from union square ventures he's had this blog that like for a long time i think it's like freddie gracie or something like that he's been blogging for like 15 years i've read his ideas for so long and he made a post his post today was the metaverse he goes i read this really insightful thing and he just embedded my tweet he's like it made me think blah blah blah and something against a new spike of people or whatever and so yeah so i didn't expect it i want to know what happened so okay so the first thing is after how many people followed you because of it let's see i started at 178 178 000 followers and i now have 193 and a half thousand so 193.5 we don't do public math but we can add this up 15 000 new followers the post itself has about 20 000 plus likes but i'll tell you what was that that's that's okay that's the that's the cool part that's numbers but here's what was fun i get a call from uh uh we'll have to bleep this out but i get a call right after i post it about 15 minutes later i get a call from uh and you know basically i'll bleep that out but basically a uh a famous person who has stuff on netflix and they go dude i'm tripping out over here i i go what and they've never called me before friends he had after i so i did that clubhouse threat a while back and this person had dm me saying hey that's like that's so on point blah blah blah and they said hey if i ever come to san francisco you know for for you know uh you know some of my profess my my hollywood work then um then i'll i'd love to you know hang out or something and i just i was like yeah right and but i gave him my number and so i get a phone call from the person and then they say dude i'm tripping out over here you know like it made me a little bit anxious uh like this this is like what's gonna happen like i think you're right but i don't know what it means if you're right so anyways we have this like little conversation that was kind of fun and then it starts going into um a bunch of nfl players started following and i'm like why would they care and so a bunch of pro athletes followed and um and so then i'm you know sliding into their dms or they're sliding into my dms i'm just basically it's like clear the calendar all day i'm just going to be answering direct messages because really so i don't know who's in here but i know a lot of values in here so uh uh professional athletes yeah a bunch of people from the tech industry which you would expect and then anyone intriguing uh from the tech world um yeah yeah i think for i mean fred wilson i felt pretty good about uh like a bunch of the andrewson guys who had blocked me from the clubhouse thread some of their partners well the people who blocked me probably didn't didn't didn't reply they didn't unblock me for this but some of the other partners messaged and said hey this is you know this is great and i said okay i'm glad i'm not just permanently banned from uh from from your office servers that's awesome i think that's great so this is cool stuff happens and then uh you know the other thing is that a bunch of people and i realized this later which is i thought kind of like you know even if you you have one of these twitter threads that goes viral who cares like ultimately what does it lead to it's fun but you know who gives a [ __ ] but i've seen now months later there was a lot of people who are like let's say i want to go invest in a company they're like dude i remember that thread that was epic and they're just like you're cool right you just get this stamp because in a world where it's so noisy there's so many people if you do one memorable thing that people respect and like it's like that's the shortcut in their brain that says okay i like this person yeah i trust this person yeah they're cool it's like just from that that's not like i wouldn't have ever predicted that so anyways i call these like my little serendipity engines it's like i put it out there in the world and i could never predict what's gonna happen but then all these like kind of second and third order consequences end up happening where you end up meeting somebody going to dinner doing a deal like it's just all this weird stuff that you can't predict so fun day uh when this happens but also such a weird thing dude like i couldn't imagine even if you told me five years ago 10 years ago like this would be a thing in my life that i would care about i'd be like what are you talking about why would i care about that yeah i think it is pretty unique and i think that i met this guy named blake uh i don't know what his name is blake b but i went to oklahoma city when i was driving through and i had like a mfm meetup or like a sampar meetup i don't know what it was and i hosted like 20 people for breakfast and this guy came and they're like what would you tell us if you if we want to i forget what the even question was i go man get on twitter it's where it's happening and he's on it now and he signed up whenever i did this thing a year ago now he's got like 50 85 000 followers 50 70 i forget what's his name blake bird you probably see him in like the little circle jerk and uh he was at the meetup he didn't even have twitter i go dude sign up right now and start posting this [ __ ] you can you meet people it's pretty amazing um you know what's crazy also somebody i'm pretty sure somebody sent it to zuck because uh somebody who's very close to him like respects like was like yeah this is awesome um and so i'm pretty sure that person was going to share it with with him which is kind of crazy right like i literally i watched the keynote of him talking uh you know he gave basically a 30 minute presentation and i actually want to talk about this so he gave a 30 minute presentation saying we rebranded to meta here's why here's what it's going to be like not just like here's not just like here's new products we're going to build but here's what the world is going to look like here's what life is going to look like it gave this cool presentation i don't know did you see this presentation a little bit it bored the [ __ ] out of me oh really i thought it was amazing you got bored from that a little bit it's literally like somebody opened the door and it's like hey you want to see what life's going to look like in 20 years yeah i just find him to be incredibly unlikable well yeah he's kind of robotic but like uh so it's still a little bit hard to watch i i definitely yeah there's definitely some cringe factor for for sure but um but the the funny thing is i saw that and then i was supposed to have this call with ben and ben's like oh i gotta like you know i gotta take care of the baby real quick uh like just you know i'll be online in like 25 minutes i was like okay cool i was like all right i got 25 minutes to kill and i just watched this thing and i just tweeted it out and i like to me it was like a throwaway thing it wasn't like a planned drafted edited thing and so anyways crazy how that works but i want to talk about this um this meta thing so not even what um what he predicted or what kind of zuck laid out but what do you think about facebook changing the name of the company in general and like uh i have kind of a theory on why but but i'd love to hear what you think i think that if i was facebook and i wanted to recruit the best people on earth i would do like what i've learned running a business and this is something that every business says is they say like an entrepreneur of a 20-person company you even tweeted about ben levy um like i just call ben like blank but what should i call him so this is something that everyone says is true but it's not which is that titles titles matter people will be like oh titles don't matter um just call yourself anything no they're actually really important and they matter a ton even if you're a 10 person company if i was zuck and i wanted to create a company where people wanted to work which i think they're struggling to right now i would change the name of the company and i would have a ceo of facebook i would have a ceo of this a ceo of that which means there's like a vp there's like a president and that's and then i would give all these people their own kingdoms and that's how i would continue to grow so that's what i would do is i would if that's exactly what facebook did or google so there's a ceo of google there's a ceo of youtube a ceo of this of that of that of that and then which each ceo there's like a hierarchy for people to climb and you got to give these people these ladders that's why i think it's a great idea that's that's on point so so basically i've heard i will call it maybe three or four different theories so one theory is what you made this up is is this real so that's what i know that i i do in in kind of nerd circles you know i've just heard a couple people talk about this and i was kind of like here's what i think it is but let's start with let's lay out the theory so 31 is it's a recruiting why would you do this right they said it's a recruiting thing um and it's basically a mix of what you said which is when you create a parent company now you have like more you created basically another level at the exact level you created one you it's like your neck was compressed and now it's stretched out and it's like ah you just created this breathing room so that person who's otherwise vp can now become ceo and it's like that might be the difference between them like i know uh for example the person who who you know was head of or vp of i don't look at her ceo ben look up fiji fiji sumo's title so she was she was in charge of big blue which is the facebook app and um and then and there was chris cox before her and they and they ran kind of like multiple products they were kind of like in charge of like the suite of products um but their titles weren't ceo it was something else and she left and now she's the ceo of instacart so she like left the big ship you know the the trillion dollar company to go be the ceo of a maybe 10 or 20 billion dollar company i don't know what's inside it's valued at something like that and um and so now you lose that key talent and maybe it's because she looked up and said this exact guy's never gonna leave this guy was super young he loves this [ __ ] you know where where do i go how do i go up i can't go up anymore um and even the stock price we're already at a trillion dollars what am i betting on we go to 10 trillion like i need some upside and i need some some resume growth here so that's one theory i like that theory i think that's true but i wouldn't say it's the number one reason okay so let's go to the other theories then there's the the skeptical theory which is dude facebook's brand is trash it's the philip morris of uh you know facebook equals cigarettes and they're just trying to run away from all the bad news and all the bad branding and so they're kind of pretty good theory so a lot of people think that and there's a there's a there's a subset on that which is if if mark hires a ceo of facebook the app then the person who get called into senate is that person to go sit in front of senate and talk all this stuff and they can get sort of like hammered out there but zuck as you know chairman or whatever of of meta it's like you know when the google guys did this they sundar now or whatever has to go um go in front of congress and larry page can just go and and he just you know could be ceo of alphabet and not have to worry about that stuff by the way did you know that did you know that one of the google founders i don't know i don't i think it's larry do you know he can't speak he's got like a voice problem sir sergey he's gonna know he's larry it is larry yeah i think it's larry so over over the years if if you go and go to his name type in like his name on youtube and you'll see a video of him 10 years ago and you could hear it progressing and then like maybe five years ago you're like oh this is really bad i'm pretty sure at this point he can't talk at all but if going this is so interesting google his name and watch a video of him and you in any video that's online it's probably recent enough that you can start hearing his voice he you know i'm not making fun of him but he sounds like kermit the frog like it's a really weird voice for how he looks it's definitely been that way for a few years i think he can still speak but it's basically it's uh his vocal cords are like partially paralyzed if i remember correctly yeah that's crazy man so if i was him i wouldn't want to go speak either i mean it seems really embarrassing i mean he shouldn't be embarrassed but i understand you know so by the way i'm just reading it right now it says 14 years ago he had a cold and then he got like a horse a horse voice from the cold and he just never recovered he went to a doctor and they said his left vocal cord was paralyzed and it's a nerve problem um that's causing your left vocal cord not to move properly anymore yeah like when i first heard him talk i was like the video is broken right because he's super soft spoken right so you're like wow is this good it sounds like he's speaking it sounds like the video since yeah it almost sounded like the video was in slow motion or something it was really uh you know it's sad it sucks yeah it's crazy and so i think it has happened on his right vocal cord too now hashimoto's thyroiditis that's wild yeah it's it's [ __ ] anyway but yeah so if i was him i wouldn't want to speak in front of the senate either and ben looked it up fiji's title was head of the facebook app so so the that's that's one theory which is it's such bad news as a rebrand i think one of the cigarette companies rebranded to like altria or altea or something like that so it's like it's like reminiscent of that so okay so that's like another theory and then there's the third theory which is actually the theory that i subscribe to uh which is this is actually just a mission shift um and so i remember when i worked at twitch and this was the second year i was right before i left so i was kind of like you know basically i was on paternity leave i wasn't even really working at twitch at that time i was on paternity leave and i was thinking okay i think it's time for my next thing um but i got a phone call from emmett who's the ceo and emmett's great and uh you know i got a ton of respect for him and he basically said hey i want to uh i see he said he'd messaged me something and said like hey do you have time to talk today like i uh want to bounce something off you and he called me and he basically said you know this funny thing has happened which is that like i think eight to ten years ago very early days of twitch we had we set out like this big north star mission which was a million creators getting paid to create on on the platform um and so it was like 1 million he's like and at that time we might have had like you know we were in the thousands or tens of thousands or something like that like a million just seemed a million people getting paid like earning money doing this it just seemed like wild and so um he's like you know so so the million was like super far away he's like and then you know last year like we hit the million and he's like it's this really weird feeling like you you hit this 10-year goal and there's like this amazing part of it which is holy [ __ ] we did it and then there's this numb part of it which is like wait it's like now what what do you do when you hit the thing that you thought was like you know if it's like when elon takes a man to mars okay what's the what's the next step right it's like if you get to the moon where you got to start thinking what do i do now and so he said you know one of the most danger he told me on the phone he goes one of the most dangerous things for a company is achieving your mission because you have to reinvent your mission you have to reinvent yourself and think bigger he's like and so he was like i want to brainstorm with you some ideas on what that could be what could be the mission for the company next 10 years and so we had a good good brainstorm or whatever and um and so i think that's what this is i think facebook is now used by like everybody with a cell phone uh you know facebook or one of the facebook apps they they the mission was connect you know like uh connect the world or whatever they literally did it they connected the world everybody is using like not only one but multiple products so many people use facebook that when sarah worked there i think they were sending satellites to india because they just literally needed more people on the web in order to yeah they ran out of ran out of people with with internet and so they're like dude you know it's that moment where you're tam your total addressable market becomes your actual market share it's insane and so um to the point where i remember once we were having lunch with uh alex the founder of calm and he just started cracking up and i was like what he goes i just realized he's like dude think about how many facebook accounts shut down to churn just due to death he's like every day there's probably like a million people who just die and stop using the service and he was just like tackling he's like that's insane to me he's like that if you're at that scale that's how many people yeah that's pretty well literally just die and stop using your service that's like more people than ever have used our product will die today on facebook um so anyways i think that this is a mission shift basically i think they achieved the mission one and it's like what's the point of the company now is it just to make money and um and i think a lot of people think zuckerberg is pretty evil i i actually don't think he's evil uh i do think he likes power um as evidenced by like you go read those early like text messages that got leaked of him talking to his buddy at college and he's like dude he's like you know these dumb [ __ ] are just giving me all their information whatever like it sounds really evil but i think he just liked being kind of like the puppet master a little bit um but fundamentally i don't think he's money hungry i don't think he's driven by money um and early on i remember when facebook ipod he put something in their prospectus that i really liked and i think other people kind of roll their eyes if you just hate everything facebook does but i thought it was pretty cool he goes we don't build great services to make money we make money to build great services um and he's like there's a big import there's an important difference between the two yes we care about money but we care about money so that we have the profits to invest in building great services to hire the best people who can build the greatest services and the greatest products in the world and i think that's what they're doing now he said they're investing 10 billion dollars this year in their virtual reality augmented reality stuff for for like you know kind of the metaverse which is an absurd amount of money to be investing into this you know that's like that's what some people think like you know this stuff is going to be worth someday if you started a company in vr you'd be hoping it'd be worth 10 billion someday he's investing that as one year's r d which is insane i want to talk to you about a bunch of different things but but i want and i want to ask you after your real estate guy your real estate buddy but someone said they like when we rambled about normal stuff and i want to get we can make this really quick but did you watch ufc on saturday i did oh i watched okay part of it yeah i watched hamza okay so i want fort lee it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you're into ufc or not i want you all to do this so a few weeks ago a few months ago we talked about this woman named rose nama eunis nami gunas her name is thug rose she's this little white-haired lady with like a shaved head really cool and she was muttering to herself like i'm the best i'm the best before the before the fight and it was inspirational it was and then she knocked out this woman and it was like inspirational because she's very endearing she's very cute like there's everything to like about this woman there's this guy who's kind of the same thing but the opposite so there's this guy that is about to be the best but he's not the best first not the best yet his name is komzat okay and he's this um there's for some reason there's a huge chechen uh group of ufc fighters chechnya if you don't know i don't want to sound like a fool i'm not incredibly well researched it's like a subsidiary of russia it's a region of russia they're mostly i think so they're they're they're white and they look white but they're um devout muslims and they're russian i don't know how like if they consider them russia or not but we americans would say oh you're just a russian muslim that's what they look like and they're known to russell a lot of them are from this area called dagestan where if you imagine your head what afghanistan looks like that's kind of what this area looks like and it's in russia and they basically have gone through just a ton of war lately or in the last like 20 years 30 years so there's this guy named kamzat and he had a cleft lip or something like that so his lip is all crooked and he is so scary looking and he comes in and he he knows how to speak english now but his attitude and what he says he says the same thing who do you want to fight next and he goes oh brother i'll smash everyone i'm going to kill everyone i'm going to take their soul and he's been saying that this whole time and he's been in four fights in the ufc and he's been punched in the face one time this weekend which is absurd this weekend he fought the best chinese guy uh i forget his last name with lee he's just he's a little bit older but he's considered the best out of china and he picked him up and he walked over to the side of the cage where dana was and he yells to dana get off your phone watch this and he gets on top of the guy and chokes him unconscious and did so and in the interview afterwards in the ring and outside the ring he goes brother i'm just here to smash everyone and kill people everyone brother i kill everyone i'm here to kill everyone i love this i'll kill everyone that's all he was saying and they go what are you gonna are you gonna fight the number one person he goes well they're going to have to give me the number one person because i'm going to kill everyone no one will be alive and then he said something he goes he goes uh they go you know where did you get this mentality or something he goes i'm crazy man he goes he goes i just you go he goes you don't you say all the best people are crazy you can't be not crazy and be the best when there's crazy people out there who want to be the best and i just thought that's not true it's absolutely true i'm a gangster he goes i'm a gangster i'm crazy and i think there's two there's a few things to learn here the first is i think a lot of that is born i think a lot of that is just an act that you've turned on because in his case i imagine he's seen a lot of tragedy and like [ __ ] war and he like created this tough guy persona in order just to survive you know he and the second thing is i think you could tell yourself that consistently and you kind of can become it and the third thing is this these guys these zagastani guys and also for some reason this weekend all russians won peter yan won he's russian all these russians they're crushing it they've got something in them i don't know what this russian attitude is that i've noticed about these guys but it's this it's this very quiet although comes out even though he talks a lot of [ __ ] he's still really quiet it's this quiet subtle confidence and i love it if i watch them their videos over and over again fedor had it they've got this quiet confidence and i'm in love with that i'm in love with it yeah they have a tenacity that's pretty crazy the um i was watching uh i was going through i was just browsing on tiktok and this clip came up related that um like in the nba most of the nba is not like that uh like hey there's not many russians in the nba but b um kind of silly ufc is one of the only sports where people go and say i want to kill everybody in any other sport they don't really say that on in the press conference right they might say it trash talk on the field when there's no microphone to pick it up but in the ufc they just literally say it to the reporter the reporter writes it down and publishes the post or whatever and it's one of the only sports it's one of the only sports you can't play right yeah yeah you can't like play it you know it's like if it's like something but something that's going to two cool little nuggets here so early on the the founding story of the ufc is pretty pretty wild but it was started by some somebody else and then dana white who's currently the president of the ufc pretty famous guy he's like a part of the show basically um he goes to every single event he sits cage side he's he's every like and they do like an event in a different place every weekend and so this guy's he's now a billionaire um and he uh so and he's he's a very outspoken guy like uh imagine the commissioner of your favorite sport you know they're usually a pretty buttoned up guy usually ex-lawyer you know they they just say you know we as the nfl are committed to upholding integrity and dana white will post like oh this fight's going to be awesome and some somebody in an instagram comment will be like this fight sucks or that's too expensive for the pay-per-view and then he's a [ __ ] clown yeah he'll literally be like you [ __ ] clown like shut up you [ __ ] clown and then that's like he says that it's like what ceo of what company is able to just say that to their potential customers it's insane the whole sports savage but he said something early on because the bet that he made the investment that they made they bought the ufc for about two million dollars and it wasn't his money he convinced his two kind of childhood friends the fertittas who own casinos that's their background that's how they made their wealth convince them let's buy the ufc and then they ended up pouring in like 50 or 60 million dollars at a loss to keep it alive to promote the thing and he kept believing kept believing kept believing they kept pouring millions and millions of dollars in and it looked like it was not gonna work and then it has now since turned around as a public company and it's you know it's all working now they sold it for for you know over four billion dollars yeah i think it and i was and i was looking at it it's a great company it makes like three or four hundred million a year in profit and they asked them dana what gave you the faith that this business would work when all the evidence just said the guy who tried the guy who did this before me failed um nobody else has done this in america and um and you guys are bleeding like 40 50 60 million dollars why did you continue he goes because i get people and he goes i understand humans he goes let's say we're out on a playground and there's a football game going on over there there's a soccer game over here there's a basketball court over there people shooting hoops and i said oh my god that russian guy's fighting that chinese guy guess where everybody's attention goes he goes everybody looks and then everybody runs over to watch the fight he goes that's how humans are wired you can't help but turning and looking when a fight breaks out and that was the whole like thesis that was the the underlying psychological nugget i loved that uh you know that that that is how simple he was thinking and he goes he goes and he goes and by the way this is a sport that transcends every country yeah football is huge in america go to the uk nobody cares we have fighters who are like the pride of the uk it's a huge we're huge in in the uk we're huge in australia we're huge in africa we're huge in china like this can get bigger than any one of those sports because we can tap into the global population because fighting one person punching another is a universally known sport you don't need to even know the rules it's not like basketball or football or baseball like it's like if i try to watch cricket i don't know what's going on i don't know the rules but with two people are fighting i understand the premise i get what's going on and uh and it's like you know this historic barbaric thing so anyways i love that business side of the ufc as well so if you're a ufc person that you know i'm talking about if you're not that was pretty cool and this weekend there's a couple things there's i'll say it real quick that the main thing is this guy kamar oozeman african immigrant comes to america during college kicks ass the american dream he's fighting against a a devout maga trump supporter so that story is very fun the second fight is rose now younes who i like she's fighting uh the best one from china she's they're both amazing and then the third one is like these both midwestern hard-working guys who are just going to stand there and bash you they're just like bangers they just stand there and bash each other's brains and so that's the cool fight this weekend um all right what do you got uh let's do something else let's switch topics here you have a couple things on here let's do a quick idea actually so um so ben had this idea that i liked he goes he goes you know my brother is a real estate agent and he goes real estate agents are really competitive with each other you know in any given city they're they're fighting for kind of like the pie is this big you know it's either my client or yours there's not a whole lot of uh you know there's not a whole lot of ways for real estate agents to collaborate with each other some like to do deals together like if i'm the buy side and you're the sell side great we can i'm confident we can get our clients to hammer out a deal but for the most part it's a very kind of doggy dog world all agents are like the sports agents whatever but he goes with real estate agencies like there's something interesting that might be a niche little business and he goes uh and so i called it real estate buddy which is basically when you're let's say you're a real estate agent in florida or right now california real estate agent california and a bunch of people are moving to texas that agent in california is not going to help you find a home in texas but maybe i helped you buy your your california home and you don't know any agents in texas so what if i had basically a buddy in every state that if my client is moving there i can pass you to them and and basically i get a share of the commission and they get a free referral free trusted client basically that somebody else has put the time and energy in to build up trust and so you could create this network of leads basically and uh and partnerships across borders where there actually is a big incentive to collaborate because otherwise both sides benefit from this whereas normally it's extremely competitive world so i thought that's a little interesting of a niche business maybe something like that exists i'm not super deep in that world have you ever you used bigger pockets like to learn you mean yeah do you know bigger pockets pocket sizes it's like a real estate kind of like media company forum plus podcasts buying real estate i think that could be potentially a huge business i don't think it is huge but i bet it could be so if you look at the reason i see them all the time is when we look at our podcast rankings we're like on a good week we'll be like 10 11 12 13 14 15 in the bid business categories on a bad week will be 40 50. and bigger pockets is like always number three and then they have another one that's like number six and they got another one that's like number 11. like they're always in the top 10 most listed podcast bigger pockets has three or four of them and then they got this forum that costs well it's free but you could sign up and get extra stuff i'm a 300 a year paying member and i think what these guys are doing is they're like built this business and media arm or whatever and then they just use all their cash flow to go and buy more real estate um it's it's an amazing company i love bigger pockets i think if you want to build a community um this is the company like make money from it this style and you want to do it like with a style where you get a lot of people these guys are 100 this is the model this is the perfect model on how to do it yeah that's actually a great point because bigger pockets has existed for a while and it's always been important the main guy i think joshua josh dorkan or sometimes his name he sold it at some point so i think i don't know who owns it now let me see if i can find out um so basically he sold the thing not for a ton if i remember correctly um mccarthy not a good thing to sell and this is such a valuable property so it was just like a forum yeah and um i don't know the full story i mean he could he could raise this is like angelus he could raise like a massive fund yeah exactly and so i think he had like a med there was some story like he had like a medical emergency for his kid or something so he had to take time off and then he ended up selling it i don't know how it all went down but i think you could compete with this i think you could build a better bigger pockets um it would be hard i'm not saying it's not easy but i think that they would be extremely valuable and if you're gonna if you're gonna build a community or a media company in any niche this is one that i would i would bet on because um you know if you're not gonna go for something new and sexy like crypto or whatever you know this is where a lot of money is to be made and there's always a new batch of people that want to learn about making money in real estate how to buy real estate there's always a new group of people who are looking to like you know learn connect blah blah blah and um and maybe bigger pockets is pretty like established with its crew but you know who's number two if i just said who's number two behind bigger pockets certainly there is somebody but i don't think it's as household of a name right now and i wonder if you could take some other angle and do it by the way can you talk dude wait let me look let me tell you about something that i let me talk about something real quick something that you've never uh maybe you're about to say what i'm gonna say a house something that's not a household name and is huge in our little world there's this group it's a guy or a group of guys called angels this is exactly what i was gonna ask you about okay i've gotta tell you i'm getting dinner with these guys tonight okay so angels like no offense angels i think you guys are wonderful i've met you it's a really weird name at first so i guess it's not spelled this way i guess it just means gay angel um okay so it's this i think it's one person who started it lorenzo i think his name is he's gay i guess based off of uh doing some research on him and i think he was a successful entrepreneur i'm meeting him tonight i don't know his whole background but he started this group called angels and i believe it was an email list of gay give the headline first why is this interesting and then didn't give the back yeah you're right so it's this group of people it's this guy who's got this it's not a fun but it's like a gr investment group and this year alone the rumor is that they're gonna invest around four to five hundred million dollars and previously they've invested collectively over the past few years like 300 million dollars so like next year two years their total investment is gonna be like a billion dollars which is basically like a three billion dollar fund kind of like that you invest if you have a three billion dollar fund i would imagine you invested over five years so like that's like the numbers we're talking here and basically it would be like a very large this is startup investing so this is like a very large technology fund that i haven't ever heard one of the bigger and it seems like a niche fringe thing it's like oh that's cool like a lgbtq fund what do you have like a two million dollar fund and you're you're investing in you know some cool companies it's like no how are they deploying how are they getting 400 million dollars in a year to deploy and then how are they i don't think they get any money if you google it's it's spelled angels like gain like g-a-i-n and then joel's angels and if you look at their portfolio and if you just google angels and click news you'll see all these tech crunch articles that it says you know and this company raises money from addressing this this this and angels this this this and angels will say for every article and if you go to their port do you see their portfolio pages yeah it's legit yeah dude they're in everything gadgels isn't everything they're in everything and what they do is they find companies and they write a page about it and then they um send it out to an email list and people invest and they get a 20 carry in it and they um take also a fee of like eight or ten thousand dollars per deal that they take out of that money and they use that to as their like finders fee so they could pay their lawyers and things like that and that's the whole business model and they've got like this web of like five or six or seven people who will also send the deals that angels gets access to to their audience and those people who send it to their audience also get a stake in the of the carry um and that's a very simple business model are most of the investors gay or that's just the most of the people who started are gay what's the stick can i do it if i don't yeah so here's the yeah so here's the thing why it's kind of crazy is it must have started like they like mostly invested into gay and lesbian and transsexual or uh you know what whatever uh lgbt uh you know whatever the the uh what is it sorry i'm not me l b l i'm just struggling l g b t q yes is that it that's the new i thought that there was a really fun intro music i think maybe you just stumbling over lgbtq is perfect no i'm just whatever lgdb i just can't say it properly that so it started with that that was their thing but then like they invested like they've invested yeah they invested in hone which is the company you and i invested for testosterone yeah and that's like a pretty masculine male i guess you could say like well maybe if you're transitioning you would want to take testosterone but um they invest in like lift so like i don't know where like how the the lg d whatever i'm just like just skip it lg lgbtq thing lines up with the with the whole with like other companies but that was definitely their angle and it's not anymore but it's a great angle because you know there's not a lot of gay and lesbian investors and then they're like hey look that's our whole stick like let us in i understand it totally works do you remember uh do you remember when you stopped using gay as a uh as a term for like uh you know just meaning like whatever like something is lame or something is stupid oh yeah in high school and do you remember what got you to stop or what when you realize like oh wait that's not cool just like when i had like gay friends i was like oh that's not very nice is it and uh and then like i talked to my nephews and they're like in there sarah's in there sarah's nephews and they're like 14 15 and 13. and i was just curious and i was like hey do you guys ever insult someone or does anyone ever insult someone for being gay and they're like what do you mean i'm like you know like do you ever say like yeah yeah like you know you say like hey man that's really gay you're gay and they go but like why is it bad to be gay and i was like it's not you just answered you just answered my question thank you and they just it's just not part you know what i mean when you're kids when we were younger that's and it was crazy yeah it's i don't think young people like insult people for being gay i think it's pretty crazy yeah i think that means like in 20 years because probably when i was 10 that's like what everybody in my school was you know that was like a common thing to say and so i think that means in 20 years it went from just common and people did it without even thinking to like it would now be kind of disgusting it would be like it's not even like a it's not even an argument it's like wait why would we do that like what i would do you know like why would i why would i try to use that as an insult that doesn't make any sense i like in my head there's like the n word and then there's like the f word like you know what i mean like i would never you know what i mean if i heard someone say that i would be like flabbergasted i'd be like what yeah it'd be like when i was a kid it was like the word like you know if you said the word if it was like this that was like the c word now like i wouldn't say uh australian people they say yes but like it's yeah it is kind of crazy how that how it's changed i mean obviously it's good but yeah i remember as a kid we just got to give a shout out and then the person who first told me like hey by the way you know that's not cool right um i was uh it was this guy who who actually just just i think yesterday or two days ago or something the news came out that he's in gay he's gay and he's engaged to uh to this guy that's been dating for 11 years so the actor cal pen he um uh when i was a kid i was in a movie and he was my older brother in the movie and so we like would hang out on the set all the time and i remember saying it when whatever i was just calling so i was trying to say something was stupid or lame or whatever weird i don't know what i was trying to say i was just a little kid it's probably like in sixth grade or something and he was just like um he was the first person that i'd ever even brought my attention to he goes you know that's not uh like you shouldn't say that when you just mean something's like weird or not cool uh like you shouldn't say gay and you should say something else and he wasn't out that time i don't know if he even knew at the time but he brought that to my attention and i felt i remember feeling so dumb because i looked up to this guy i thought he was so cool and i was so nervous yeah he was totally nice he kind of like he was hanging like big brother do you yeah he big brother he was just like yo like by the way like you know you shouldn't do that like think about it blah blah blah and i was like oh that makes total sense like i never even thought about this like and then in that time and even in my my world where i lived houston texas it's not like even like i went back it's not like i was the last one to know nobody even really thought about it but he was like in hollywood and i think it was like you know people on the west coast were people on the coast tend to be like a little more like kind of forward and liberal and progressive with that type of stuff so um so i remember hearing that and being like oh man i just made a fool of myself and like yeah that's silly i don't know why i do that and i just stopped after that and so it came full circle uh yesterday but anyways we can do another another topic what else you got all right let's do one more um all right i'm gonna tell you about um actually do you have one you want to do you want me to go let's do this one that's about uh companies so i had this idea i i don't even know what it is but i was reading that tech uh tesla was doing something called gigafest do you know what gigafest is yes so basically if i remember correctly they and a lot of people like liberal media got angry because they're like tesla's throwing a a festival and during a pandemic but basically they rented out a town in germany and they're doing like a conference or a festival and like what's happening at is it like drinking in music or is it like car technical stuff do you know i have no idea so okay honestly it doesn't even matter what it was i just saw the name and i thought ah man tesla's doing another smart thing like they basically took oktoberfest and they just rebranded it for their thing and it's gonna i assumed it's gonna be some combination of like fun as well like you know between music and food and drinks and all that as well as like you know things that are relevant to you know building cool cars and then recruiting talent and just building the brand and having people have a great experience at the brand and i started thinking why don't more companies do this and at first i thought well certainly they're not the only ones and i started thinking about other examples of this so there's like the macy's day parade which i don't even know like how that got invented i don't know i don't know the back story but since i was like i was a kid i remember that there's always the macy's day parade on tv and it's like why did macy's get in on that or we've talked about michelin star restaurants right michelin tires uh the tire company basically inventing a a food restaurant ranking system so that you would have a reason to go drive you know far out places to go try these amazing restaurants they created demand for for driving long distances through the michelin star and they just got their name and and all that and um and you know there's the forbes 30 under 30 list and then there's like in san francisco every year if you live in san francisco you know dream force it's this like full like kind of it shuts down half the city and there's sort of like a parade and there's like big bands like you two come and perform but it's like for the most boring thing it's like a sales crm dude do you want to know why people most people more people don't do this yeah i think a lot of people actually try and it just doesn't work all right so um the fortune 500 fortune 500 is that basically just means the top 500 companies in the world at this point do you even think fortune 500 means fortune magazine all right sometimes it does over overtake the brand like michelin michelin star means more to me than michelin tires do you when you think have you ever shopped at a macy's of course i've shopped at a bases before yeah have you been at a macy's in 20 years not 10 yeah 10 years probably cut off so a lot of so there's one i think a lot of times people do this i always work with like creative people and maybe i'm just sometimes a pessimist around this stuff a lot of times they give me these ideas and i'm like this is just [ __ ] stupid and i don't think this is going to increase sales i'm just trying to survive at the moment and and it doesn't work i agree it's not for when you're in survival mode which is where i spent most of my career in startups is like you're you're not in survival mode or you're in survival mode if you don't turn if you don't make this work it's going to just die so you don't have time to plan a parade with a music festival and like all the stuff that wouldn't make any sense and here's the other reason why this isn't a good idea though well this isn't a good idea a lot of times because most companies they're just [ __ ] lame like imagine like um i'm trying to think like just like this window blind company hunter douglas like they're gonna have like what a blind fest like i don't know i mean i guess i think there's some cool [ __ ] like you know blendtec the blender have you heard of blendtec the blender and they had will it blend that was awesome i loved willow blend remember that youtube channel yeah yeah of course i love will it blend but a lot of stuff is just lame and i don't want to celebrate it now a few boring things that i think could work is um uh what's that vacuum company everyone loves dyson dyson yeah dude i'm i'm about to i'm like been staying up at night i wonder if i'm gonna buy one of these 700 vacuums have you ever used one of them the handheld one yeah it's like this amazing one yeah i have that one amazing everyone you you have one did you pay 700 bucks for it i feel so satisfied dude i feel like i get 700 bucks of value every time i use it so like dyson has like is like boring and and i dig i would do that um i can't i have to think of like what else is like boring and awesome but dude any any company can do this all you have to do is attach your boring name to awesomeness and it does work it does work to an extent now it's not going to turn a bad company into a good company but it does take a boring company and make them slightly less boring it makes them more relevant and in general i just feel like those same dollars just go further so like i see so many dumb billboards or uh just like useless events or useless like ads um you know on the all over the internet and i just sort of think man you know for like two hundred thousand dollars you can throw like a whole music festival you could you could do like some amazing things with 200 000 and that's what they'll spend yeah but i don't want to go to like flora or clorox bleach and imagine dragons like i just don't give a [ __ ] you know what i mean you might did you want to go to a tiger restaurants reviewed entire entire company's restaurant review reviews no you didn't maybe but like when i think of like like clorox and like the killers like i don't think like i'm gonna buy more bleach dude mr brightside although maybe maybe i don't know oh that's a good point walk right into that one i don't know i'm not sure if it could work maybe um but i think and i also think a lot of those things i don't think they're as successful often like whenever i was thinking of like fortune 500 or michelin i'm like i don't [ __ ] that don't associate that with the magazine the magazine's still going to go bankrupt anytime um so anyway i don't know like i think the victoria's secret fashion show is a good example also of like going overboard on these kind of events and like just put your you're not directly trying to sell your thing you're creating a spectacle you're attracting the type of people you want like for example we have an ad budget for this podcast where they're like dude hubspot is great they're generous they're like you guys are in our our hubs podcast network we want to help you grow so they gave us a little bit of a little bit of cash a lot of money and i can't think of a thing to do with it exactly because and what's the plan right now the plan is to go spend a [ __ ] ton of it on spotify ads right and that might work and uh and other podcasts and other podcast platforms and it might work i don't know we'll see i might still work very poorly so i'm saying with that same amount of money can i say how much money or no uh hundreds of thousands of dollars a quarter so hundreds of thousands of dollars maybe maybe we could say like uh in the range of a million dollars a year right so i don't know like let's take our audience our audience is kind of this hustler type mindset our audience is this person who likes to they like investing they like building [ __ ] they want to make money um they they like hearing about billion dollars companies and billionaires and things like that like what could we do that would just get i don't know like if we got 50 000 people to pay attention to something i think that would be a huge win right so what would be a either an event or a stunt or something that's of service to people the equivalent of what red bull did right like red bull was like dude we're we're an energy drink we're all about sort of like you know this is kind of badass lifestyle all right we're going to put a guy in a wing suit we're going to take a guy like what can we do though well this is thinking about this i don't know like i just um okay let me think of one i think that we could do um what are people who are in startups what are people who are into building businesses what are they what are they super into that that's true i've gone through this mental exercise and i'm it's okay i have a dumbbell for me i have a dumb simple one i remember these people set up a um a headshots uh by the way your computer screen is like covering your face or something oh there you go um i remember this uh like a fitness company did this they they parked their van outside of the uh salesforce tower and everybody who's coming in they're like do you want to get your body scanned real quick or do like this bmi test to do this test i'll tell you what i loved hired two people to stand outside the [ __ ] like tower and they just got a bunch of people in and they like while they were there they said what is this all about who's doing this why do i get this free thing and uh they got to learn about their learn about their body while then being so upsold into like signing up for these scans and personal training and a gym membership after that and um i saw somebody else do this with headshots they're like you know what like your picture online just like looks like [ __ ] sean but what do you do what's that so what do you want to do for us yeah so i'm saying we could come up with something where let's say we had i don't know if you've ever seen those like 360 degree cameras uh you can rent these things for like a thousand dollars we could have a pop-up in a city in in in new york and all you got to do is if you show that you're subscribed to the pod you can get a free epic headshot done for you and we just pop them up you know near downtown where a bunch of people live and that thing would cost us you know i don't know three grand total for the day but might have like a thousand people have like a unique experience or two thousand people have a unique experience or maybe we could have like a blimp going over you know going over miami and the blimp is going to you know airdrop you know some like cash or the blimp is going to display some qr code or something like that and there's a giveaway inside i don't know like something to drop million dollar bills yeah some kind of stunt or whatever like let's say um something that's like on i hear you i'm on board i've just been going through this and i'm like what is worth pulling off like these are bad ideas i gotta admit the ideas i had just now are basically okay but i feel like if i brainstorm for an hour which i'm gonna do i feel like we come up with a great idea and it's a better use i'll do the same than the ads i'll do the same i think i think it requires both to be honest and i'll do the same i think and this is like a good example of whenever i talk to people and they're like well i'll start this company once i get funding i'm like if you had the money you wouldn't even know what to do trust me the money's not the issue right and that's how i feel right now i'm like the marketing budget is not the issue yeah i'm like we got the money we got the people i just don't know which is kind of [ __ ] up ramit talks to people about this all the time he's like once you're rich what are you gonna do and people actually struggle with this all the time right i struggle with it i had this uh phrase i used to say at our startup which is uh you can always run out of money but you can never declare creative bankruptcy and that was that was always my rule was like i cannot have a conversation with somebody who says i i can't think of an idea i don't know what else we could do it's like you've declared creative bankruptcy and like now you must go out that door and never return again and and and that's just my rule so even if those guys i don't declare bankruptcy those guys at outside magazine asked us if we wanted to do the adventure i don't think you replied yet by the way not yet i sent you do you see it okay and they're like well what else they're like what else do you want to do and i'm like oh i i have no idea i i i feel like such a punk i can't think when like they're like well we can go anywhere as long as you're there and back in three days i can't think of a thing it's [ __ ] up like maybe okay who does our audience look up to warren buffett like he auctions off his like lunch thing every year for like 100 grand or whatever it's like dude something there's no way it's only a hundred grand i think it is it might even be less but like i know uh like andrew wilkinson did his i think it was like it was like i don't know two grand or something to get lunch with him you know how many people would want to do that like we could just host these we could get people to like come and be able to hang out have a lunch with chamoth or something like that we could do a giveaway that is we spend the money here but then we dangle that in front of people in order to get them interested and excited about what we're doing now those are kind of disconnected to what we're doing but i refuse to declare creative bankruptcy is my my answer we just got to think about it because this it's been bothering me as well where i'm like what what should we do because if you if you're listening imagine this we have hundreds of thousands of dollars of budget and we we want a whole bunch more people to uh subscribe to the podcast and just get down with the mission like realize that there's a cool podcast out there that they might like the reason you like it there's a whole bunch of other people that would like it for that same exact reason they just don't listen to it yet they've never heard it they don't know that they should try it and so how would you turn hundreds of thousands of dollars into hundreds of thousands of subscribers is the question and um and so you know if you have ideas obviously my ideas kind of suck sam refusing to have an idea right now so we need we need ideas uh ben what do you think we should do like the teacher calls on you and the worst part no no no no this is good because i was actually talking about this this morning with uh darren and jonathan but um it's hard here's one idea that we had was we had this uh tick tock go not viral but it did well on tick-tock did you see that sean what was it it was a rob durdeck thing um what's his name jacob like texted me on saturday night and he was like hey made this and posted on tick tock got like 100 000 views yeah which is like good so what we were saying is what if we just put up 10 or 20 000 and just said hey we're gonna put out the video files from my first million anyone can access the raw video files and uh if you want to make content for us great and at the end of the month we'll give 10 or 20 000 to whoever gets the most views on tick tock or instagram reels like a 99 designs contest that's not a bad idea that's actually a really good idea 20 grand to it and in order to be submitted to the contest you have to um you have to post it on twitter or instagram yeah and uh that's a great idea actually so a consistent 20 grand a month contest for the best clip yeah you can produce it you can just put it out there because you have a big audience but like whatever yeah do whatever you want that's actually brilliant right i've seen i think that's the greatest idea yet right right he almost went greatest idea ever he threw yet in there just to save himself i was so close yeah let's do that all right i'm going to publicly brainstorm the ideas on twitter that's how that's how we're going to do this no i'm going to add that one to it though i'm going to create a thread i'm gonna add these ideas to it and then i'm just gonna continue until we have a winning idea it's just it's a rolling twenty thousand dollars and every single month one person gets twenty thousand dollars and the criteria is the people who are posting the best most interesting most viewed mfm video content my other idea is i guess i'm just into contests but it's like hey if you want to join this contest show up to downtown um preferably somewhere where not a lot of people are from so like st louis cleveland austin whatever and uh austin actually austin's a bad idea but um okay we're gonna give you a category so it might be food it might be exercise and fitness but you have 24 hours and whoever can make the most money wins this contest and will give you an extra 20 000 essentially an entrepreneurship contest i got a better idea [ __ ] your idea here's a better idea [Laughter] all right here's a great idea okay so uh sam how much does it cost to um to sponsor like an open bar at a bar uh like set up a bar chat let's actually let's say let's do this there's we pick 10 cities around the country and we say hey in these ten cities if you're one of us there is a place where you can go and you can hang out with other people who are like that like like us at the ball uh uh like you know like you have heard you could we could have basically say hey we do a lot of for three grand yeah exactly we're gonna put up fifteen hundred dollars and we're gonna do this in ten cities and we're gonna do this every friday for the next uh you know let's call it three months or whatever it's like you know the winter the winterfest and we say great we're going to do that so we're going to do that 12 times that's 180 grand but basically you've created a and all you have to do to get to redeem your free drinks to redeem a drink is you just got to show you're subscribed to the pod show bartender boom you get it we just called we have cool bars so like whatever's like your favorite bar in austin your favorite bar in new york your favorite bar in san francisco whatever and we just make that our little watering hole and people who are into our [ __ ] can go and hang out there and it's not that it's like the biggest mass idea but the spark that would come from a bunch of people a bunch of our fans getting to know each other hanging out having drinks bringing their friends i think a lot of good would come of that a lot of goodwill would i don't think that's not that expensive i think that's worth doing i would say that the uh video bounty is to me the most interesting i think that's like wildly interesting yeah bars that's not a bad idea i've done that for years and years on all types of stuff it worked really well for product hunt it worked well for us yeah it works what have you done in that um well like for the hustle we've done meetups forever and then when i started my roommate business we had meetups every single week for like two years and so it's basically anyone who's ever looking for a roommate you come that day and we'll have a party with like 150 people who are also looking for housing right and in order to come you got to download our app and um another one that does this by the way it's like it's like physically hard i remember being like i was like exhausted all the time yeah for sure i remember um this agency reached out and they had emailed us before being like hey we're a creative ad agency it's like uh yep into the into the trash pile like i don't i don't know you i don't this is just some outbound sales thing whatever i don't care and one reach down they go they they sent um they sent a package with invites like they sent us like a physical mail to our office there's a bunch of flyers inside cheap flyers you know just flyers whatever they said hey uh these are these are ticket entries so this gets you entry to this party tonight um as well as a free drink um we rented out butter this bar in san francisco that's like pretty famous and um and they go we're having a meme battle tonight it's like a rap battle but for memes and we're like what and basically um they got like they and then they would email the office manager and they say hey did you get our package we sent over a bunch of invites make sure that people know that's for you guys you guys can come and get you know free drink and it's great you know send five or six people to have a great time and happy hour today and so they all did was an email and a flyer they sent that and then i went there and it's basically like they've rented out the bar it was a tuesday night so like bar was like yeah sure you know it's all yours go ahead um and they basically had a projector on the screen and they had a guy dressed up as a cat and a person dressed up as a dog and um and they would go it was the battle was it was a five-round battle and basically one would show a funny video clip like a tic toc length thing and then the other person would show it and then the crowd had like that's awesome little handles where they could vote for the dog or the cat like who's who's was funnier and it would it would go five rounds and then the winner would win at the end and that was it was just silly and then the whole shtick was the guy would come on at the end he'd be like hey by the way that one that third one that was actually a viral video we made we're rubber republic we make amazing viral videos um eight out of ten videos we do get over a million views like we're good at this [ __ ] we've done it for these companies uh enjoy yourselves tonight and if any of you guys ever want to have a video go viral come find me or the guy dressed up as the cat and i was like and we worked with them we did a video with them it got over a million views and it was not the one where you talked about drawing dicks all over bebo yeah yeah exactly that was bro so they made that video for us and so we um and so they were so good and i was like oh this little sales funnel they did was actually genius um that's pretty good you know because one client to them is worth tens of thousands of dollars so you know renting out this bar and inviting people from these 20 companies and just hoping one of them ends up with you as a as a client is a great way to go all right well let's do ben let's let's can we please make one of them happen [Laughter] yeah down let's do it all right [Music]

we just retrace this story right so you do basis you you have this idea for a stable coin you end up giving back the money when you decide it's not going to work you um this new new idea for for a decentralized social network you raise some money from legit hitters other people pile in like you're saying it's all pretty quote unquote fair which is that we're all owning the same thing and um and then you get to the point of the launch you're you decide to be anonymous you try to go the satoshi route um but it doesn't work why didn't that why'd you want to do that and why didn't that work too many people yeah well so yeah so basically you know been working on this blockchain the diesel blockchain for almost two years and uh we were like hey you know we should really launch kind of a prototype app to start testing it like in the in the field so to speak and that was bitcloud um and we wanted to you know not really like have it go mainstream until at least like the middle of this year like the middle of 2021 um and so but you know we obviously launching earlier is better and so we kind of accelerated said okay in march we're going to start sharing these like password protected links with some people just get a few hundred users kind of see how the blockchain is holding up with like this kind of activity uh and so um yeah so so what ended up happening was uh it it you know kind of went out of control and the links got like way over shared um and to the point where i kind of had to go out there uh you know i had to start you know saying hey like this is what this is and and this is like you know what's going on uh but um for me personally you know i've always been really i think i've always admired how like satoshi kind of like launched bitcoin um without creating kind of like a centralized person that everyone kind of relies on or like this is our you know our guy um so it was really i wanted to kind of do the same thing there uh and so i launched with you know uh pseudonym diamond hands um and immediately you know it was kind of very hard to get press it was hard to get people to kind of listen to the story that that is the real story versus making up their own uh and so we had a lot of uh press saying hey like this is a scam and by the way because it was just a prototype there were a lot of things were missing so you couldn't cash out your money you and i was like wait a minute so you're telling me that there's a website that you invest money in you don't know who made it it doesn't work a lot of the times and you can't get the money out right and he's like yeah i was like oh okay got it just making sure we're on the same page here yeah right rightfully so uh any any other time i would say that's a complete scam also none of the code was open so even though it's a blockchain and it was running on a few dozen nodes like no one could actually audit it or be like hey this is a real thing uh so we were just not prepared at all let me let me tell you something there was a whole bunch of criticisms like what you're talking about right the code is not open source you can't cash out oh they scraped our twitter profiles um oh there's you know there's a big pre-buy people got in super cheap uh you know all this stuff there was all these criticisms of it we don't know who the founders are you know they're kind of anonymous but my theory and you tell i want to know what you think about this so i have this phrase which is i think emotion commits the crime and then logic does the cover-up so all these logical complaints i don't think are the real reason why people were so like up in arms about this new project that actually is like a really net like it would if something like this existed it would be a huge net positive in the world and those same people hate facebook well this is the antidote if something like this could actually get off the ground and work and so um i was surprised that the emotion was there and i think i at least this is my theory i think that people don't like when someone gets rich without quote unquote earning it and i think what people saw is that the insiders so the people who created it or maybe the early buyers they bought so early on the bonding curve they got so early on and wow 100 million dollars has come into this thing these coins have run up in price or the profiles of going up in price and there was this feeling like like i don't know i don't know how well you did but here's my guess i think you've made tens of millions of dollars already liquid without at the minimum and your project is like under 10 000 dau or something like that right so uh or under 50 000 let's say so like in already in the tech world this tech gets backlash because people will raise at like 100 million dollar evaluation and people are like oh i've been running this restaurant and laundromat for years and how does this little app with you know with with no business model be worth 100 million dollars right there's already people who get upset about that but but the one saving grace is that they're not liquid so it's not like the founders running around in a lambo living in a mansion in l.a but in crypto you're liquid too so you you get the early hype and you get the liquidity of the lambo and the mansion and i think that that is actually what triggers people about crypto in general bitcoin in general you know people who buy an nft and they get rich you know they make a million dollars off this random image um to i think to other people that feels inherently unfair and so do you what do you think is my theory what do you think of my theory and then what's your kind of response to the people who do feel that way i think there must be some like validity to your theory because if you read there's a great book called the infinite machine about ethereum and it catalogs like what happened ethereum how it launched all this stuff they got major backlash from bitcoin people because of the way they raised money where they were like hey like you know projects aren't supposed to like take bitcoin for you know another coin like you know this is like bad i mean i read that book right after you know kind of everything that was happening with bitcloud and i was like this is eerily similar um so so i think part of part of what you're saying has to be part like like a factor um you know dude look that said you know since then diesel is listed on exchanges you can trade it on blockchain.com ascendex and a really big one you know a couple big ones are coming soon and you know like the code is all open and people have gotten really passionate about it um you know contributing to it the last couple people we've hired are like open source like they were just contributing to and we hired them so i think that um you know if i saw someone who's very clearly a scammer making lots of money i would be upset in a way that i would be i wouldn't be as upset if i felt like there was a shred of them not being a scammer which we didn't have because i was anonymous you couldn't cash out the app was going down a lot um so uh whatever whatever theory there is is probably exacerbated [Music] you

uh and so you know someone like saying basically i i know sam i say this guy and i see his videos i'm like oh these these are great videos he's only getting you know a couple thousand views let's say right now but basically what what this world would let me do is as an early believer i can bet on sam i could say i like this guy's content i think this guy's gonna blow up and i can kind of vote for his success i can give him some so i can buy his coin which gives him money to like make better content it gives him a little boost of morale to keep going um but it also lets me go on the ride with him because i think we've all been there before we discover a band early or a brand early or an influencer early and then you're you're you believe in them and you're so you're so right they actually do take off they never knew you they never had a real relationship with you and you didn't benefit from the fact that you know kim carter if you knew kim kardashian back when she was just paris hilton's closet organizer uh and you thought she was great you missed out on the ride and and so this lets your true fans go on the ride with you and it turns your fans into sort of shareholders with you and so oh bro i study this stuff you know kim kardashian where did this come from i have to know i must know and uh and sure enough there's a story and so you know sam let's say i would bet on sam sam would get that cash so sam could use that to make a cooler video and when sam makes that video and he gets more followers they have to buy in at a higher price point than i did because now sam's more established so my stock is going up i'm earning instead of just following right i own instead of just following which is the way the world works today with twitter and instagram you just follow you don't earn and then the you know furthermore sam could say hey you know what how do i make my coin really valuable to hold what if i kind of only fans it and i said i'm going to do some exclusive stuff with only my coin holders who hold over 100 of my coin so it's up to him to decide if he wants to make his coin more juicy more more enticing to hold which again will make my stock go up if i know sam's the kind of guy he connects with his fans he's going to put in the effort that's going to make these coins more valuable and so it takes this idea that's been around for a long time the thousand true fans the thing that any artist knows that they need those real believers and it turns them into people who actually benefit from your rise and so that's what i think that's the good thing that i think will come of this aside from you know destroying facebook and all that good stuff i think the good thing that will come of this it'll make being a taste maker and a curator like a job pretty much you can actually get paid for having good taste for following for believing in somebody early on which is the way that things should be i think yeah sean how are you better at explaining this than me also i i i'm kind of uh i'm not offended but uh that's awesome well dude when i first shouted out big cloud yeah i got a lot of okay i got to come up with a reason that i like this besides i think this is going to make a lot of money for me uh so i started thinking about what what is the appeal here and i hate to defend myself and in doing something why does this yeah that's true i did i i remember it uh but yeah sean just to add which is really interesting uh like you said there's actually never been a way to actually invest in someone when they're small and make money on their rise like in like this easily this efficiently uh and what's really interesting is there's actually yet another interesting kind of like layer on it which is once you invest in someone your bias is to be supportive your bias is actually to be hey i want this guy to succeed i want this person to to be something and you can align in a way that you can't really on like you know without that mechanism like being able to buy into someone you know uh uh creates kind of an incentive that doesn't exist and what's crazy is that um even bitcoin you know bitcloud diamond all these apps uh they're actually very positive discourse a lot of it um even though you know there's not really any kind of you know there's not like there's less moderation than traditional social media right um and the reason i think is basically you're investing in people right you're going long uh and and when you give people the ability to to like move money around right people naturally go long and when they go long they actually uh uh get aligned and want to support you um and so weirdly enough like i love like when people say like money is like the root of all evil you know like money is bad and and i think that's part of why people reacted weirdly to bitcloud because like oh money prices whatever but like if you just look past that for two seconds you'll see that it's actually being used as an alignment tool that's making a lot of positive things happen that haven't happened [Music] you

yeah i'm gonna it's like i'm asking you stock tips i'm on big cloud uh i'm on the site now what uh and i could see this i mean i could just go and find it but what what creators do you own and what what uh which one are you gonna be making any purchases anytime soon what do you like yeah definitely i own active creators so if a creator is active and like posting and like doing fun stuff or interesting stuff i buy them um but really the thing that i uh you know like the hedge fund side of me really likes is nft artists because for nft artists uh even today not theoretical um all of them set royalties that go to their coins um and so there's real cash flows there that are often like totally disparate like you know like their coins are not like correctly priced for like how much money is gonna actually flow to their coins um and so i've been yeah i bought like spookies and um uh clout punk you know early illuminati is like another one um and those like just the cash flows are like above what it was when i like you know those have made up for what it was when i invested in it so uh so that's kind of like i think that's a strategy that like just traditional like i do like i get it um and then as we create more cash flows going to the coins there'll be even more um but aside from that because i know that you know creators who could get big are going to have ways that cash flows go to the coins the smaller creators who i think are active and are like gonna do cool [ __ ] anyone in particular you know that's who you enjoy that's like the other one um oh there are a bunch um well so darmesh has been crushing it he's not a smaller creator uh but he's just been super active he's doing a lot of stuff yeah yeah yeah he's he's very big on the platform um i'm trying to see like there's like matreshka who's a woman who's very active there and does a lot of stuff tidgeon is this developer who does a lot of awesome stuff um yeah it's a dta you want to know my strategy that that worked on big cloud at least early on this worked pretty well i i i was thinking about okay who do i buy do i buy the famous people that are not on yet there's people building scrapers to try to figure out someone's thinking about it or they tweeted it out and it hasn't gotten verified yet so go front run that i figured out there's a very simple way to win and i said right now with any early project i've built a bunch of social networks and i know anytime you build a social network at first seventy percent of the conversation on that social network is about the social network this happened with the stuff i built it happens if you go to clubhouse eighty percent of the rooms are just end up they will end up talking about how great clubhouse is or what it's gonna be or what's bad about it they're just always talking about the platform itself so i knew okay if people are going to be interested in the platform itself i invested in all of the analysts who could who could go through the on-chain data and report how what prices were working you know how many how many new users there were and all that good stuff and so i bought all the analysts dirt cheap and they went up like crazy because again they were talking about the platform in a way that was differentiated because the normal person didn't know how to go analyze the blockchain and then the other one was basically rich active people so i thought darmesh was just going to buy his own coin and whale shark was just going to buy his own coin craig clemens was going to buy his own coin and so it's like a company that does a share buyback it's like oh okay this person has the they have enough funds where they could like dramatically move their own coin price so all i got to do is just buy them and wait for them to do their buybacks and sure enough they did and darmas even said it publicly it's like i'm going to buy for every follower i get i'm going to buy back my every coin holder i get i'm going to buy back 10x of my own coin or something crazy like that and i was like well that's a ponzi scheme that i love that's perfect great uh like i'll just hitch onto that ride this guy's guaranteeing and i know he's a man of his word he's gonna buy he's gonna buy back his own stuff and i could just front run that so that worked amazingly at the beginning i don't know if that would still work i think the strategy of forecasting what content is going to be popular and then investing in the people who are producing it i mean that's like that's like the name of the game i think um so i think that's pretty awesome there was a guy who would do uh fake designs like mock-ups like oh this is what the client could look like yeah oh if they added in if it's how it could look it's just like kind of like design porn yeah design porn i was like oh that's gonna work people are again it's talking about the platform and in a differentiated way because this guy's a designer and he's going to just design mockups all the time this is going to go viral great yeah buy this no that's genius honestly um yeah and it'll be interesting to see how it works at scale um especially because diamond app is like so mainstream and i think can actually get like some bigger people to like join and start using it um yeah i honestly i wonder how it's gonna play out um by the way another fun thing we didn't talk about is there's actually an algorithmic feed that's like open source now built into the blockchain so that would probably play into your strategy where you can look at how the feed works and then try and figure out what what's gonna get to the top it's pretty hard to game i think but uh but that's that's another like interesting have you talked [Music] you

people uh people dm us a lot of interesting ideas my reply to all of them they go what do you think about this i always reply with two things i always say it's an amazing idea and then i say when are you launching i feel like i can rule the world i know uh let's start the episode here um all right what um i've got actually two interesting things to tell you the first this company reached out it's a famous publication that you know of and i don't want to say it out loud yet but they want us to go to baja mexico to ride motorcycles and film a series on like a weekend adventures are you interested in that uh what for like they yeah what's what's the catch you want me to come out here and surf and ride motorcycles what's in it for you they just have uh i guess i could talk about it i haven't asked if i could talk about it's just like it's a without giving too much weight they have a just a web series that goes in like on tv it's for web and tv they have a tv channel and they have this whole series where they it's all about like nine to five workers like normal yuppy jobs and you have adventures friday to sunday so like what all can you do on a weekend uh okay all right uh that seems super up you know and kind of a while too but you know uh that's that's their suggestion do you have a better idea on like a weekend adventure it's an adventure publication yeah i don't do motorcycles that's my only thing i don't do motorcycles and after kobe i also don't do helicopters but uh i love surfing surfing is a cool thing i suck at it but it's fun so i would do that well if you come up with a better idea then then pitch it but they like it's all paid for and everything oh okay great yeah let's do that why not ah look at your fitness influencer life is already coming in handy so you the what i wanted to talk about was you're getting really fit too do you and i think it's pretty inspiring coming from an influencer like you in the fitness world that means a lot to me hardly but do you so do you think it's do you have you has your body or i know your body has changed has your brain changed do you think in your attitude of course that changes first right yeah the attitude changes first the brain changes first the body changes you know slowly over time but yeah for sure but i um like okay if people if i took off my shirt you know nobody's gonna be super impressed with me just yet but i'm pretty impressed with me and that's kind of my own opinion i held in higher regard than anyone else's so yeah i basically i went from like kind of like i don't know was i would you be like he's fat would fat was i fat i might have been fat i didn't think of myself like a fat guy and i'd be like what the hell i look fat here i'm like every photo i look fat maybe i'm just fat that's kind of what i reached the conclusion of at that time you were getting overweight i think that like i think that you know there's like a like a like a definition of obese like you know it's a body fat percentage and i guess if we use obese and fat yeah i would say you're overweight but i don't think you're overweight now yeah so and and so now i've been training hard for like a year i started off doing two days a week three days a week and i just cranked it up to five days a week now with the trainer um it was always supposed to be five days a week but the days i was supposed to be doing on my own i was you know really half-assing it or no asking it so so i would say on average i was doing like three or four days a week before and now i'm doing five or six days a week pretty intense and i gotta say um i don't know why you're bringing it up so i don't know where you're going with this but it's amazing and i can talk about it all day because it's like the best thing i've done all year so you know if you're if you're if you're listening to this and whatever investment you're making right now in your health i guarantee you that if you upped that investment you would only thank yourself and uh that's kind of where i'm coming from here is like yeah i'm i'm super happy with making this shift and it's totally great i have this the reason i was bringing this up is i had this friend who is incredibly wealthy like i would have to imagine like 30 million dollars wealthy and um he he was like i want to get in shape uh what routine are you using and i'm like that's a bad question who cares about the routine if i was you i would just hire a coach it'll be like 400 a month and he was like wow that's expensive and i'm like dude you've got one body in one life like i for me my fear is when i see someone who's my age or 40 50 60 and their body hurts and they can't walk and they can they like struggle to sit down on the floor or something like that i'm like that's hell right like you're just you're in this you're in this shitty home that's falling apart and you can't get out and i was like what you know you just bought this fancy house why not also buy a fancy body and not to like look good naked but but like feel good and so i was just thinking about it and i think we talk about investing and i'm like i think that's that's got to be the best investment for sure we have we have a mutual friend i can't say the name on here because what they said is funny but i'll share what they said uh so they're wealthy they're probably like i think they have like you know 100 million dollars you know in the bank and um and they said this thing they were they're like always doing kind of like fitnessy stuff they're not like you wouldn't look at them and say oh yeah this person's clearly like you know ripped out of their mind or they're not just like super jacked it's not that but they live a very healthy lifestyle and whatever wherever they go like in their day their workout is like a key part of their day and they don't sacrifice it they don't get they don't get too busy for it and so i asked him about that and i said you know um man it seems like you're really taking this seriously he goes uh yeah you know the way i look at it is if you're rich you have no excuse to be fat you know what he goes look if you don't have the money and you're all you're just you're trying to support your family you got to work two jobs you got to shop at certain stores you know mcdonald's you know you got to eat what you can afford sometimes okay fine like still you know not great and you know i i want you to not be in that situation but like i definitely understand he goes if you're rich and you're fat that's on you bro and uh and that's how i feel now it's like when he said it i was like you know that's actually so true which is if you had all the resources but you didn't make the investment that matters uh that's sort of silly right and so uh that kind of trick that kind of was one little seed that i got planned in my head i'll tell you something else that's been funny my trainer recently um so your app you're absolutely right what you said which is it's not the workout routine it's not the it's not what you do it's not the workout program right it's not like somebody has some secret formula for most people it really doesn't matter like for most people even if you just walked 15 000 steps a day and you ate uh only maybe 2 300 calories you're gonna like look pretty good and you're gonna feel probably pretty good if you're not working out five days a week that's your problem it has nothing to do with the routine it doesn't matter what you did in the routine like just start with doing any workout and then make it better over time and like yeah when you're when you're sam status then the actual routine does matter because you know you're already at the kind of 99th percentile you're just trying to optimize at the end and try to get certain details to pop so yeah then your routine matters but for most people it doesn't matter but i'll tell you something my trainer told me that was counterintuitive he goes um we were talking about like my body has really changed my arms have changed my chest has changed but my stomach still looks like the stomach of a guy who's not super in shape like i don't have like a six-pack that's not in the kitchen bro so that's what i said i was telling him i was like oh yeah but that's all diet right and he goes he goes you know everybody says that he goes um they say you can't out train your diet all the stuff he goes and i get what they mean he goes but i'll tell you what intensity over diet all day and i go what he goes intensity over diet watch he goes don't even touch your diet right now don't worry about your diet uh don't be feel guilty when you eat something don't like count every calorie don't go way out your chicken breast like don't do any of that [ __ ] all i want you to do is commit to cranking up the intensity when we're here in this this part of the gym so he's like if you're like let's say zero to ten what's the intensity of your workout today like on average i say uh you know it's like an eight he's like great all we're gonna do is we're gonna take that to a nine we're just gonna make every workout at least a nine on the intensity level and some days we're gonna be hitting nine and a half and some days we're gonna even hit a ten but right now i just want you to focus on a nine and he goes watch what happens and he's been so right which is that it was really hard to just change my diet but it was that much easier to just crank up the intensity in working out and it's not that the intensity will all of a sudden shed my fat it's that when i put the intensity in here diet becomes a much easier decision because i really like laid it all out during the workout part and so the desire to like throw it all away for you know this like pleasure these chips or this whatever like it's just not there and now i at first i thought he's full of [ __ ] i did not believe him but now that now that i'm actually trying it i just said hey let me let me follow what you say you're my coach i understand what he's saying and this is now applied to many other things in my life so now even in business we were i was talking to to ben about one of our business plans and it's like oh should we do this or this or this it was all about the plan the how the route you know what is the strategy and i basically said [ __ ] the strategy let's just take our intensity up you say what i said whatever strategy we're doing let's just agree that like right now we're probably executing any of our strategies at a seven or eight let's just execute any of these [ __ ] strategies at a nine and a half let's just see what happens and this is just working in all areas of my life now because now when you put a nine nine or a nine and a half intensity you kind of like want to figure out the right plan right it's like if i'm going to put in this intensity it better be on the right thing and your brain will solve the which path should i choose problem in a different way because of the intensity i don't know if that makes sense but it's a little no it does the this weekend i went to f1 formula one racing in austin it was like the hot thing to do and i went with this guy have you heard of uh what's it called jungle scout you know jungle scout yeah yeah we've talked about it it's the tool that basically if you go on amazon and you want to see what products are selling how much how much of this insta pot gets sold every week jungle scouts this little extension you can click on it'll tell you what how much sales the products on amazon have it's kind of expensive but it's a cool product so it's a big business like um you know if you just google it like i you you'd have to if you could put the pieces together that they're not far from 100 million in recurring revenue big business yeah and started as a google chrome plugin which is interesting this guy greg he's neville's good buddy my buddy's neville so that's how i got brought into this thing i went with him and he's very nice very kind easy to talk to but incredibly intense and here's just a tiny example of when i see this and i'm like i i like i always see like whenever i'm around certain people i always notice this uh when intense people do things like this so for example the race that just ended some people i don't know how they got onto it but they got onto the track i guess they just went on and took photos and he's like let's go and he just starts walking over and i'm like well there's no like gate and like everything imagine like huge stands and then you walk down the stands and there's like a fence that's quite tall and he goes he's like well let's go i'm like there's no there's no gate and he goes no no we're just gonna jump the fence everyone was staring at us he just walks up without hesitation puts his hands up there climbs up on this fence and just hops he goes come on let's go and i when i'm i'm i don't like confrontation that much i don't like doing a lot of things that like people stare at me and i was like what you just did like you didn't even think twice and i've been with people who are like really successful entrepreneurs and they'll be like a line and of course this is like jackass just like a jackass move and they're like no no we're not waiting in line we're just gonna we're gonna walk in and we're just gonna we're gonna do this and uh that's like an example of that intensity have you ever noticed like we probably have friends that do like dude you're like this you're an intense dude i've noticed this from you and the line example's perfect when we were going to do our live show remember in miami and the airport was just packed i don't know why it was like six in the morning the airport was so packed we got there early and we were still gonna miss our flight like the security line was like two miles long and we waited we waited we waited and then you were like you just like some switch flipped inside you that was just like okay we have all the reasons to like do do like just to miss this flight basically it's like all right we got here early look it's just a long line there's nothing we could do uh you know the airport is packed it covered just it's all that circumstance and then i literally we didn't even you didn't even say anything you were just like okay i'm gonna go and then you just left the line so you gave up your spot which was like a risk because we had waited for like an hour and a half you gave up your snuck into the the pre you go to tsa pre-check you're not tsa pre-check you just hand the guy your ticket and he's like bro there's no pre-check on this and you're like oh yeah my my wife pre-checked it was she we it didn't print or you're like you're like i'm preaching he's like look at it he's like there's no pre-check you're like i'm pre-checked it just didn't print right and then he's like your will just dominated his and then you just got through the line and we were like come on sean i'm still standing there i'm like [ __ ] if i go and say the exact same thing that may work and so i i was like i need to crank my intensity up so i went and i bought clear at that moment i just i went and spent 200 bucks buying clear and then i like the clear will they'll escort you to the front of the line and like take you through tsa and then it was like you called me and you're like dude you got a sprint because you were at the gate you're like you gotta so i didn't have my shoes on because the security line or whatever so i'm holding my shoes didn't have time to put it back on i'm in my socks and i sprinted to the gate like i've never spent it before and i hate running so i i hate ran my way all the way there but it was your contagious intensity another example we wanted to build our podcast studio and i was like we had kind of been talking about it and it got to that dangerous point that happens where you have an idea a thing you want to do and then you've talked about it but you're not closing you're just somewhere in the middle and this is where dreams go to die and i think most people it would just sort of like it would either fade and you just don't do it or you kind of half-ass it and i remember like in a 24-hour period you just blew up my phone you were like dming me like pictures of every other podcaster you're like how about this this this just tell me of these three which one do you want i like number two number two and i'm like yeah sure number two you're like great number two okay i found the chair on amazon actually let's drive to these three places and like let's go pick it up today what time are you free are you free in 10 minutes i'll be at your house and you came he picked me up we drove to ikea then we drove to another furniture spot that we drove to this bootleg spot in oakland and then while we're at the bootleg spot in oakland it was like not really happening and then and we went to another spot and then literally the sales lady recognized your intensity she came up to us it was a big furniture store she comes up she goes you guys look like you're you guys look like you're ready to buy i don't know what you said she said something like you guys look like you know what you want and you were like yes i'm looking for this red chair because i have a show and i want it to pop in the thumbnail and it's gotta look like this and she like ran into the back and tried to find us one and then you like got the whole thing done and somebody meanwhile somebody was painting the whole wall you were like we need to paint the wall so you like hired some guy to go paint the wall over the weekend and by monday that was a friday by monday the studio was done and i share this because that's a level of intensity that you i know you have that i've observed in all of my successful friends they have this this trait are not all i shouldn't say some people are doing style but very common that people who are success have this level of intensity when they do something massive action and um it is contagious it's contagious to the people around you and like the lady in the store um there's a there's this principle that's kind of like this so i'm reading this book sorry to go into tanzania here but i'm reading this book you everybody's heard of it you've heard of it think and grow rich by napoleon hill have you read love have you actually read the book years ago but it's one of those books that you should reread every five years probably i should probably read it it's pretty amazing i've had the book for like 10 years i never even opened it because i was kind of like i think i get the idea um and so i actually started reading it two nights ago and he tells a story of this guy who wanted to work with thomas edison he's like this guy had a clear idea he's like i want to work with thomas edison he goes to notice two things he said he knew exactly what he wanted not just like i want a job and a lab it's like no i want to work with thomas edison this guy is an amazing inventor because the second thing is i don't want to work for him i want to work with him as a business partner and so he's like you know problem is i have no qualifications and i'm literally not even the same city and i've never met the guy i have no access to him i don't know anyone who knows him but he didn't let any of those limitations those limitations were sort of irrelevant to the guy so uh sure enough he buys a train ticket he goes to where thomas edison is he barges through the door and he says you know mr edison uh i'm here to work with you like i think you're great and i think uh you know we'll do great work together i'm here to work with you and edison's like what the [ __ ] like you know we're not even hiring but uh like and he said something edison has a quote in the book which is like even though this man had no qualifications and i had never seen this person he's a complete stranger there was something about the intensity of his presence that told me this person has their mind set on something and they're gonna make it happen and that sort of reminded me of this like common thing that's i've seen in a lot of people and in myself in situations which is once you get to that level of absolute certainty and you carry yourself people will literally just start to respond to you differently because they just see this person is like on a mission they are a man on a mission and like i may i either need to get out of the way or i need to get behind them and help them do this um and that has like served me i have one crazy story that served me well but has that ever happened to you or have you ever seen that yourself or others yeah i call it being an animal and like paul graham or he's the one who said he goes basically he's like a lot of people talk about who you should hire in your early stage startups he goes basically the one word you want to use to describe them is are they an animal right and do they just get [ __ ] done and i remember like uh i remember talking to my friend jake who went and worked at this company called teespring which grew very very quickly and i was like what's it like to work for walker the guy who runs it and he goes he's an animal like for example we wanted to do this partnership and we had been working for weeks and weeks i'm getting in touch with these folks and he just googled like their customer service number and then just right there in the meeting he goes guys watch this and he just calls them and goes hey can i talk to this one person uh hey this is walker i want to make this happen what do we got to do any like and that's an that's a very easy example dude i have almost the same story when i was in college i had i've talked a little bit about this before but my very first business idea was was to create the chipotle for sushi so the same kind of fast casual model but for sushi he done it for sandwiches for burritos for chinese food but nobody ever done it for sushi that was the idea problem was i know nothing about sushi i know nothing about the food industry i had in fact only tried sushi for the first time like a week before that and that's why i even had this idea i was like oh sushi's [ __ ] amazing how do i do more sushi in my life and um and so one day i skipped class and me and my buddy trevor we were sitting around at our apartment and i was like you know and trevor loves to watch food shows like chopped iron chef he just loved watching this food [ __ ] i never understood it because again i'm not a foodie i was like why do you want to watch other people eat food that seems like crazy to me um but you know i got hooked because the shows are great obviously and we're watching a throw down with bobby flay and there's a sushi chef that comes on and he's like he know obviously he knows his [ __ ] about sushi otherwise he wouldn't be on the food network he says his qualifications were like you know i'm in la i got my restaurant but i also run the largest sushi academy for training chefs so we were like oh this guy runs the largest chef training thing for sushi chefs and he had like this swag to him and we had interviewed three chefs locally and they were all like you know think about like a traditional japanese sushi chef like zero kind of outward personality very traditional conservative and they just looked at us like you're like kind of like besmirching the name of sushi like how dare you even suggest this fast sushi no no thank you and so we i saw this guy and he had he had a big personality which is why he was on tv and i said we need a guy like this i go and he's and trevor is like yeah we're going to find him i go he's right in front of us we need this guy and he's like okay and so he's quiet for a second and trevor just googles his number he's like she turns his laptop at me he goes here's his number and that's like you know challenge accepted like if your friend shows you that it's like or you know it's like hey that girl over there you gotta go now you gotta go approach that girl so i pick up the phone and i call and i don't know why i said this i didn't i didn't have this planned but it's exactly what you just said the guy walker said uh he picks somebody picks up the phone and i'm so used to getting the run around that i didn't expect it to be him so i go i need to talk to philip yee how do i make that happen and then he goes so i didn't say may i please speak to the truth which by the way that's the right way to ask which is how do i make this happen it's just exactly because there's always it just came out and it came out because i had already worked myself into a state of intensity and i was kind of nervous and so like i was just in this heightened state and so that's just what came out and he goes this philip talk to me and i hadn't planned what the [ __ ] i would say after that and i was like oh i said phillip um you've never met me but uh i'd like to start a business with you and i know that sounds crazy but if you give me 10 minutes um to hear me out here out my plans i think you'll find it really interesting it might be something that will will extend what you're doing in la it seems like you have a great thing going i think this will really uh take that and and really blow it up and he goes he goes what's the plan how old am i at this time yeah i was a senior in college so 2021 wow and he goes what's the plan and now i didn't have a plan so i go i go you know what it's going to be easier for me to email this to you what's your email address and i bought myself two days to like create a plan and send it to him and later on you know so he a bunch of stuff happens he flies out to meet us uh we're going to school in north carolina he flies to our college dorm basically and meets us we fly to his i live on his couch in he's he like vets us but he basically puts us through the grinder to see are we the type of we want which i have i don't know how the story is going to end but at that point to me that's a success already it's a success already we turned this joke of an idea into like well it might be a funny idea to you when i say i'm starting a sushi restaurant but uh you know this food network chef's on board or he's like kind of on board he's talking to me at least uh he's flying out here next week so we got to prepare for that i'm not going to class right now i got to prepare for my chef and so later months later when we we finally struck a deal with him we closed it down he's like dude you don't know how many people he's like because celebrities eat at my restaurant he's like you don't know how many rich celebrities come to me they say oh this restaurant's so small you don't even have a liquor license you need to expand i'll put up the money you need to expand he goes and i never did business with any of them and here i am with three [ __ ] in college and i decided to go into business with you and everyone thinks i'm crazy but you know why i go why he goes you remember what you first said to me and i was like no and he goes he goes you called and you said i need to talk to philippe how do i make that happen he goes that he's like there was something in the way you said it that just told me this guy's gonna do something this guy's gonna make something happen and he goes he goes if you literally had not said that phrase i don't think i would have even ever heard you out because this is just another one of these people who say i want to start a restaurant with you i'd like to partner with you blah blah and i was like wow i didn't realize these things make that big of a difference and i don't think it's the words i think it's the intensity that will bring you to do the right thing and say the right thing at the right time that's great i like that how did it end we partnered with him we go live on his couch we train in this restaurant in l.a and uh so you know first first day i go there he shows me um the process for making sushi so i don't know if have you ever seen how a sushi chef rolls a roll of sushi just like the yeah i guess so like they use that like a piece of wood a little bamboo there's a bamboo roller basically but before you do any of that right so the seaweed lays down and you got to put the rice on it now the rice is sticky rice uh if you've ever had asian food you paint in these sticky rice so how do you use your hands how do you grab the sticky rice how do so there's a little problem i i didn't even realize there's a problem right i'm sitting there watching him for an hour so first he says just shatter me sit here and watch me i say okay i'm watching him and he's just making sushi and i'm kind of getting it but i don't even know what i'm looking for right like any amateur when you look at something you don't even know what you're looking for you don't know what the details are that matter until you try something and this is why he was a genius teacher one hour in he goes the next customer walked in and i'll tell you who it was in a second he go he goes all right sean you're up and he moves out of the way and i get to go stand in that spot wearing my stupid chef coat and i don't know anything about anything i've just been watching this guy i thought it would be a long time because traditionally in sushi if you've ever watched like what's that giro dreams of super hero yeah it's like five decades the tradition is like you spend five years just mopping the floor you then you get to touch the veggies then you get to touch the fish and the last thing you ever touch is the rice because actually sushi means vinegar rice it's sushi is really about the rice not about the fish so um so i didn't expect to be doing it and so one hour and he throws me the fire and not only does he throw me in the fire he throws me the fire with this guy who sits down and i look up and it's daryl from the office if you ever watch the office it's daryl and daryl's a regular there so he kind of knew like wait wait wait wait wait wait wait daryl daryl from the office he's the warehouse guy he's the black warehouse oh black dude ben robinson i think his name is uh i don't know that's his name maybe that's his name something like that but daryl i know daryl of course so so it's daryl so i'm like oh [ __ ] i gotta make sushi and i make it for daryl and sushi it's like the guy's staring at you you're two feet away from each other like there's no hiding in the back of the kitchen to make it i'm making it in this guy's face and uh and so here daryl philbin sorry and so i so i first i just freeze i'm just standing there and i'm looking down at the [ __ ] bamboo i have seaweed bamboo and rice and i'm like okay how did he do this and then i'm freezing and then he walks away i'm like [ __ ] okay i gotta figure this out before he comes back he comes back up to me he hands me a shot of uh of sake and he goes drink the [ __ ] shot and roll the [ __ ] roll sean and i so i take a shot and then i'm like okay um i grabbed the rice cause i'm like i gotta spread the rice on the on the seaweed i grabbed the rice and immediately i know i've done something wrong because the rice is so [ __ ] sticky in my hand that as i try to rub it onto the seaweed to place it on the seaweed it's like not gonna leave my hand i just rip the seaweed and my hand is like a rice glove and he goes he's laughing and he's he goes you know every time before i roll the roll i dip my hand in this water and i clap he goes that clap is not for show that clap is you wet your hand and you clap and that removes all the moisture that like kind of like splashes the moisture off your hands so you just just enough so that when you touch the right it's not going to stick to your hand and so i was like oh [ __ ] and then he kind of showed me how to do the first one or whatever and so that was kind of like my first experience was feeding him and like that same day if you ever watch lost the guy hugo from lost uh came in and he ordered food or whatever it's crazy anyway so that's that's part of how that story ended have you heard of um i want to talk about intensity and billy of the week because i came across this guy that is incredibly fascinating and one of the most intense people i've ever read about have you ever heard of michael rubin michael rubin is that the fanatics guy yes so he's interesting because he's a young guy he's probably not yet 50 but if he is 50 he's early 50s and his name's michael rubin he's been a baller for years and years and years and so this guy is incredibly fascinating but not a lot of people know who he is i think he's worth like 10 billion dollars like you know he's worth a ton of money you know like jack dorsey money and yet he's like pretty under talked about and so this guy listen to his story so i was reading reading about him so basically he's in the news now but i'm going to explain his background so at the age of 12 he started uh a ski tuning bit shop in his in his parents basement and then two years later at 14 he got uh 2 500 in bar mitzvah gifts and he leased a uh an office or a shop near his parents house and by age 16 he was already in 120 000 in debt and had to settle with creditors and his dad had a uh pay him give him bail him out for thirty seven thousand dollars and he was basically said like i'll bail you out but you have to go to college and you gotta stop this nonsense so he goes to college but then after a couple of semester he drops out and he already has five new ski shops and it kind of kicks ass and he eventually sells it and then at the age of 21 he starts his business called kpr sports it's an equi an equipment closeout company by age 21 it has a million dollars in sales two years later age 23 50 million dollars in sales at the age of 20 uh at 23 in 1995 he purged it purchased 40 of the uh women's shoe company reika javier de breca who was around in like the 90s and early 2000s and then eventually he started this company called gsi commerce he kind of pivoted into this thing where it was called gsa gsi commerce and they would buy brands and they would kind of be the logistics and back end that make these brands amazing and he sold that at uh age like 28 for 2.4 billion dollars netting him 150 million dollars personally then a few years later he bought the business back and he formed three different companies the first was shoprunner have you heard of shoprunner no shoprunner basically was kind of like amazon prime but for all non-amazon stores so you could spend 100 and get free shipping on loads of different stores he started rue la la which you probably wouldn't have heard of but i bet your wife has and then he has and then he started fanatics he sold shoprunner recently for 228 million dollars fanatics ends up becoming this massive business and so basically if you buy like a rams jersey um it's made by fanatics and they basically work with the nfl they're like the official merchandiser basically of like all major sports but here's where [ __ ] gets really really wild so fanatics turns it now at this point i believe it's three different large businesses so there's the main fanatics business which is they basically have licenses with nfl mba mlb they make shirts and stuff like that and and just normal merchandise i think i believe if it's not publicly traded it's nearly publicly traded and worth 18 billion dollars the second thing that he did was he spun out this trading card division have you seen that there's just no news it's called fanatics trading cards and so basically he raised 350 million dollars at a 10.4 billion billion valuation and so basically there's companies like tops everyone knows tops they make cards i think they also make a bunch of other stuff like gum and random things but tops plus the other three big dogs in the space i forget what they are but if you're listening into the baseball cards huge so collectively those make like two billion dollars a year in ebitda like so it's a fairly big business and so you're like 10 billion dollar trading card company it is pretty frothy but like it could if it you know can be a billion dollar a year in profit business totally and so he raised money for that and then he has the second thing called candy digital which is making nfts for sports and they just raised 100 million dollars at 1.5 billion evaluation and so he spun all of these off and now he's also the owner of the 76ers and the new jersey devils the sports team pretty freaking wild and if you follow him on instagram which i just started following him he's homies with meek mill uh and he like helped get him out of prison and he's uh spends a lot of his time michael rubin spends a lot of his time with prison reform incredib incredibly prolific very very very confident very fast moving very intense incredibly interesting guy seems like a good guy um for for him to come on the pod this guy this guy's cool i've seen a lot of his interviews and uh and i like him a lot and i think what he did with fanatics is like i always view doing things in sports it's like if you want to do sports and music it's like actually so hard to win because it's like oh yeah i'm passionate about sports great you and you know 2.2 billion other people and so it's really really hard to do what i'll call obvious ideas in sports like yeah selling the merch selling jerseys selling shirts so for him to build such a large business in what would be such a competitive space is really impressive to me it's very impressive and what i when i was watching interviews with them so gary vee is a partner on this um on a couple of his things like i don't know if he's an investor or if he gets a small stake i don't know what how the how the thing is but he's he's mentioned a lot of the articles as like either a co-founder or a founding team member something like that and basically i've hung out with gary maybe only three or four times including the time we had him on the podcast i've hung out with him in person and he has the same energy that i've noticed michael rubin has where there's basically like this thing that i have and i think every human being even these guys they just don't have a lot of it where it's like a self-limiting belief where it's like well you know i can't do this because of this this and this and i've noticed with gary he's talk like one time he told me he's like i wanna my next thing he's like i'm going to create all these restaurants and they're actually going to be completely free and the way they're going to make money is amex or whoever is going to sponsor it um like he was just brainstorming he's like but i'm going to do that and in my head i'm like well that's really dumb i mean a free restaurant that's the stupidest thing i've ever heard of um but i feel like nine out of 10 things he does i would say that's a really dumb idea and they work and you know he said he's gonna come out with these what's his nft thing it's uh v friends like if he told me i'm like gary this is really dumb or uh you know like that's not gonna work and it's been incredibly lucrative and very successful and they don't have this limiting belief where it's like this won't work for this reason or this reason it was just like well why not like it logically it makes sense i think this can work anyways this is very uh timely so let me tell you why by the way i've noticed a lot of these coincidences happening in my life where i'm thinking about something where i'm doing something and then somebody who's like uh like-minded they're almost experiencing the same thing just in a different way we trade these stories so same exact thing all right so i told you i'm reading think and grow rich there's a section in there that i remember you know it's just like stuck in my head and he goes he goes to be successful one needs to be success conscious and i was like i don't even know what that means i don't think most people know that means but the interesting part is the second line that's what he says after that he goes he goes and people who fail all fail for the same reason they take their current limitations as real limitations right they take the perceived limitations that are that they're pursuing they're feeling now and they treat them as real and what you're saying is exactly that which is that everybody yeah oh i need to do this but i don't have the time but i don't have the money but i don't have the experience but this person said they would get back to me and they haven't gone back to me yet uh but this but you know the port is closed right now and so the shipment's going to be delayed it's like there's always these limitations that feel very real in the moment and what what successful people do really really well is they sort of just ignore all those limitations they ignore all the limitations about themselves and even the thing when somebody says no to them they're like okay cool like what does your boss think about that how about i talk to them let me see what they have to say how about i go to your competitor let me see what they have to say how about i ask you again but this time i'm gonna ask more playfully and later on at night out over a glass of wine now you're gonna have a different answer and like they don't take no for an answer on any front uh you know on their own limitations from they don't take no from themselves and they also don't take no from the world and um so i noticed that so i yesterday we were finishing up our workout and uh and we have a kind of like you know like it's we trained the body but we trained the mind at the same at the same time and so we were talking about this i said man i read this great thing and i know i could share it with him because he's he's the type too that like to eat this stuff up and he goes oh that's great and i go but you know what i don't want to just sit here and say that's great because what what it really means when i say this and we're like yeah yeah yeah that that's true is we kind of do this thing where we're like yeah that's true uh other people [ __ ] that up but you know not me yeah um there's like this inherent like yeah other people really need to get this but they don't get it i get it so i said no no screw that just like we just did reps in the gym on our you know shoulders and and lats and whatever else i said let's get a rep right here i say what's a let's get a rep right now what's something that you want that you just have some random limitations that you it's not even like you haven't been able to overcome it honestly you're just not even aware of it you're not even like saying it out loud once you say it out loud you'd probably find a solution to it but you don't really do it i said i'll go first i said man ever since i went worked out at sam's gym i want my garage gym to feel like that i already had the weights i'm already doing the workout but it doesn't feel the same his gym feels amazing to be in he's got the floor finished properly he's got this he's got the fan on the wall he's got the music system it just feels great i want my gym to feel like that and i said i want that and what's my limitation i hired this one contractor he's been really slow getting back to me with a quote it's like well i could think of 10 ways to solve that problem right now but like i just kind of hadn't put my awareness on what was what was a random limitation that was standing in the way of me and something i wanted and i told my trainer so you got to do one now what's what's something you want that you have a limitation i said let's get a rep and this is a very powerful way of thinking which is when you get advice don't just be like yeah advice let me write that quote down let me tweet that quote out it's like no no apply it in the moment get a get a rep doing the thing and so uh so let me ask you let's do it live what's the thing you want in your life and then what's the thing you want that you're not kind of like it's not being realized fully right now it could be anything could be something your relationship work-wise money-wise fitness-wise whatever something small something in your house whatever um what's the thing you want and then try to shine that light on what's the limiting what's something you've just let limit you for no reason that gary vee wouldn't that michael rubin wouldn't um okay this sounds silly it should sound silly it's perfect because it's usually the silly things i've had a fear of camping for a long time and i want to spend more time in the wilderness because i like the idea of it but like i'm kind of afraid of like being out at night time in the woods by myself or with like a small group okay great so you you want to camp and then you're afraid and then so if you shine the light what's the what's the limited what's the thought that goes into your head is it i don't have x or i'm afraid of why what is it i've just not i've just i've not bought like uh camping equipment i've not looked at where to go i've not told a buddy or two that i want to go do it and and i've not take i've just not planned anything make it more personal why haven't you planned anything uh what's called fear fear of what fear of being out at night in the wilderness by myself and that's the perfect stopping point because whenever you say the fear out loud it sounds really [ __ ] stupid it's like i'm afraid of being outside at night by myself like first of all i'm not scared i'm not gonna be by myself i'm gonna be with somebody because more fun with friends secondly like whatever it's not that scary i could do it uh right so like that's the best part of like when you finally find the thing and you say it out loud it just sort of dissolves because it's like well that sounds silly like it doesn't have it doesn't have as much power once i say it out loud once i shine the light on it's like scurries away well you got to get your gym set up then it's not that hard i sent you the link i know yeah i have everything the the limiting thing was i don't know how to do home improvement projects like i'm not handy dude do you know how to cut like a slice of bread that's all you have to do when you lay down floor you just kind of look even easier than that i was like i could pay this guy to do it okay that'll solve my problem oh that guy's not responding okay and then i just let it fizzle there it's like what no i want this i want this why would i why would i just let this wait and we we all agreed that the one common demand in most of the things you want is you've come up with an excuse to wait um like i'll give you another example i hope he doesn't mind me saying this but i had this guy who kind of was like an apprentice for me for a few months and i basically was like he was like hey i want to learn about content and stuff like that i said cool you come help me research and write stuff and i'll teach you some things and after a few months uh he went on his way and was like cool go out there in the world and since then he i think i could say his name so this guy is this guy chris i don't even know how you say his last name chris has look i don't know it's crazy last name redhead guy who works at goldman red hat guy exactly so he was a college student at the time so when i was talking i was a student at yale and uh it's nice guys i've talked to him super nice guy after he did the apprenticeship he grew his twitter following from i think like 2 000 followers he just hit a hundred thousand followers yesterday or two days ago and he texted me he's like dude i hit a hundred thousand like thank you you know i learned a bunch of stuff you showed me kind of like what good writing looks like and i was like dude that's honestly it's [ __ ] amazing like you're a college kid and you did that like that's that's super impressive um and he's like you know but i'm thinking about like where do i go from here i said well it's real simple like what do you want like i'm not i'm not going to tell you what to do next like what do you want to do next and then go do that thing it's really that simple and he's like oh you know i want to start a company and i said okay cool so did you take that banking job that i was telling you not to take he's like yeah you know i've been here for a little bit i don't think that might that might not be the long thing long-term thing for me i think i want to start a company someday i said oh you're waiting he's like yeah i've just you know like i said okay why don't you just quit your job and go do that he's like well you know and he gave me another reason for waiting i said okay so why don't you just go do it and he goes well i you know if i did do it i'd want to do it with my friend he's really really smart super smart guy but he has to wait a year because he's graduating he's not graduated yet so you know i thought i'd just wait you know a year i said wait a year huh 10 of your 20s you're just gonna give away wow with precious asset just pissing it away huh uh just waiting huh wait wow and i was just like and he's like yeah you know and then also you know i wanna i'm making good money right now i wanna save up so i have enough runway you know money money is always like you know it it does matter at the end of the day i said how about this how about instead of telling me a bunch of reasons why you're not going to do the thing you want to do you just start telling me some reasons you are going to do the thing you're going to you want to do try that it works much better trust me and i was like kind of a dick about it but it's really that [ __ ] simple and i notice and it's not just him ever i know this because i do this i'm guilty of waiting for [ __ ] or coming up with reasons to wait and so whoever's listening to this that needs to hear this don't wait my trainer says wait wait wait is a weight on your back and stop waiting so uh i had a friend who and and we could move on after this but i don't know if people i think people will like this but i had a friend who on i do this all the time so if i have friends or people who i care about in on april 5th i'm at the point where i've saved enough money to move forward with the prototyping process i feel like i found the right engineer to partner with it's a decent amount of money but i think i could do it i want to know what your thoughts are on how to launch this i text it back i go uh if i was you i would do this this and this right this morning i s i texted him this was april 5th i texted him today how'd the idea turn out he said too expensive for me to commit my life savings the cost and manufacturing and marketing of a physical product were way big and much bigger compared to starting a software or internet company oh wow so you started a software company lol no i love it i was about to say i'm figuring out what to do and what i'm going to stop being a worker be and then i'll probably um i can't say i'll probably quit after blank ipos right don't even know what city i'll be in next year and it's never gonna happen it's never gonna it will never happen no no it will never let's imagine lovingly for this guy it is gonna happen it's gonna happen once he stops thinking that way right once he stops being that way once he changes that'll change and so i or she i don't know i don't know what it is but basically yeah there's a um there's a funny thing with that and you know i i i always wonder like do you be a dick or do you kind of like empathize if you care you be a dick and why is that if you care well like look it's like look do you want this or not and and often times i say to people i'm like do you really want this i don't know if you actually want this and i think that you just think it's cool to want this and i don't think it's cool to want to you want to either do or you don't right you want to talk about like if you just want to talk about it just tell me you just want to brainstorm right or you just want to shoot the [ __ ] but if you're telling me that you want this then i'll i'll hold you accountable actually i'll i'll say why haven't you done this right my trainer he goes uh he goes you know i treat people the way they told me they want to be so you want to be fit right so then if you're going to complain about doing these sets well the guy who's fit does this so i'm going to treat you from the place you told me you want to be and hey you at any given time you can come and say i don't want it anymore i change my mind i want this instead cool i'm happy to change my tree i'm happy to treat you differently when you tell me that you have changed your

i always say it's an amazing idea uh and then i say when are you launching yeah it's always great amazing like you're just asking for permit you're just asking for permission so i'm gonna give you permission amazing there's no reason why this can't work oftentimes there's a lot of reasons it doesn't matter when are you launching right and uh i do this mine says sounds cool right they say i have this idea what do you think i would love to hear your feedback your thoughts happen to jump on a call i don't even reply to any of that i just say sounds cool let me know when you launch it so i can check it out i always say the same thing and sometimes i i'll reply months later like i'll save certain conversations and i reply do you want to talk about one more interesting thing on the list i have one thing from this de beers thing i've just yeah i've been dying to hear it okay so okay so let me tell you this story this kind of blew my mind i got to open up my notes for this because i i did you know proper proper research for this um so why don't you put your notes in this document so i can see that it's just really long it's like two pages of notes so i didn't want to blow it up for this but uh let me just tell you this story i got your full and undivided attention you can't even read the thing you gotta listen to me say it all right so somebody in my family is uh was thinking about getting engaged soon so the whole like engagement ring process was going on and they were asking like you know all the questions you have because you don't usually you don't most people don't buy a ton of diamond rings or something like that so they're kind of like you know what's the budget uh you know that i see there's these four c's cut clarity you know which one should i care more about uh blah blah blah so and and then they did this thing they went to a jewelry shop and they tried some i said just go try some on see what you see what you what you like and uh so you're not gonna buy it from there but go to a nice shop to try things on so you can see what shape you like what color you like what different prices will get you that sort of thing and they go and they came back they said hey you ever heard about this lab grown diamond thing and uh have you heard of this uh yeah yeah yeah yeah basically they're i mean that's all it is it's diamonds grown in the lab right so just the way that like now you have um you know for many different types of products for meat they're trying lab-grown meats so what if instead of farming animals and killing them and you know contributing to a lot of you know global warming you could just take a stem cell from a cow shoulder and grow a filet mignon right that's the promise and there's a company called memphis meats that's doing it and it takes it looks identical to the meat to a steak it tastes identical because it is identical cellularly molecularly it is identical to a normal steak now the problem right now for meat is that it costs like ten thousand dollars a pound or something crazy so you know it's not economically feasible yet and um and then there's this company i was looking at potentially investing it's called vitro labs and they're doing this with leather they're saying hey instead of killing animals for leather what if we could have a cruelty-free leather let's just grow the skin in a lab and they're signing deals with you know big name luxury brands you know they're the sort of who's who luxury brands that they want to offer a vegan product but they don't want to sacrifice the quality of the material so they said hey let's get you an identical material molecularly matching material for that okay so i've been interested in this lab-grown trend and diamonds was the latest one so i said oh interesting diamond it's not the new it's not new it's actually much more commercially forward it's like out there and people buy this stuff it's growing in popularity compared to meats and leather which are kind of like still in development so um so i started looking into it i was like i was like is this kind of like [ __ ] or what's going on and here's what i found the diamond industry itself is mostly [ __ ] and a lot of people know this but i dug into some of the history here's what here's what i found that kind of interests me so before 1870 like diamonds uh weren't even like they were not even a a a considered rare so i'm sorry plentiful sorry before 1870 they were rare because we didn't know where to find them so like you know the maharaja in india would would have it in his crown or you know some egyptian person would have it in their in their garment but it was it was so rare that you didn't even see it around it wasn't even a thing it wasn't even businesses around it but then in 1870 they find this huge deposit in um i think south africa and so now diamonds become this like they realize oh diamonds are actually not in short supply there's tons of diamonds they found this huge thing and so all these miners go in like a gold rush basically and they start mine they start establishing diamond mines in south africa and then like six months later a year later they all realize like [ __ ] there's now too much supply we're flooding the market with this stuff and it's we're all going out of business nobody can afford um nobody can afford to to run the mine because we're we're flooding so much supply so the miners but no so the miner's like damn it if everybody else just stopped i could make a bunch of money but it's like the prisoner's dilemma nobody wants to be the one that stops so they all keep going and they all put each other out of business and so there's this guy cecil rhodes that comes around and cecil rhodes starts buying up the mines he's like i need to aggregate all this supply in south africa so he starts aggregating it all and basically buys mines from one of the farms is called something something that the brothers were called de beers that was their last name so it becomes the de beers like mining and exploration group or something like that some name like that so that's where de beers the diamond company comes from and so de beers became this over the next hundred years de beers becomes this monopoly they control ninety percent of the supply and the reason diamonds are considered rare is because de beers owns all the supply and they just limit how much they produce from the mines they could produce 10 times more but instead they intentionally restrict supply at the mining level then they this is so monopolistic as crazy so then they created this group of 200 people only 200 people were allowed to buy from them called site holders and they said oh you were invited so so we control all the supply so we decide who we sell to and we only are going to sell these 200 and then you can go sell to merchants now we're going to so they could kind of hold these 200 people accountable and say hey why is this person over here selling at this low price cut them off and like just cut you off and if a new mine popped up they would go like the mafia and they'll go into sort of like through violence intimidation or like even just like market tactics they would basically like put the mine out of business and take it over so like let's say you discovered a mine that had a bunch of yellow diamonds they would flood the market with yellow diamond supply crush your economics you'd go out of business and they'd take over your mind and so they would just find whatever you produce and they would just flood you and so um so all the way up until about the year 2000 they owned 90 of this thing but i was like i was like why is this so if it's not rare where does the value come from and so the story is basically diamond mining wasn't big business right away it was looking at okay business good business and then it started to like kind of like plateau and p it wasn't really growing that fast so in 1936 they say we got to do something we got all this diamond production but where there's not enough demand now for the diamond production so they go down madison avenue and they find this ad agency and they find this one guy so everybody who loves diamonds today and every girl is demanding a diamond engagement ring it's because of this guy george locke back in the day and they hire this guy and they say look we need you to create demand for diamonds and at that time before 1936 people were not even giving diamonds as an engagement ring it wasn't even like rings weren't even an engagement process it was like very rare that people would do that most people just kind of did an engagement as sort of a different sort of agreement and so he does a big study and he says okay look um what we need to do is this we need to get men to buy the diamonds for women and we need the women to believe that diamonds are the way that your man can show you so for women it's like if you want the man to say he loves you we need diamond to represent love diamond equals love that's like one side of the board they said on the other side men the bigger the better the more expensive the diamond the more of a man you are so it became diamonds and they came out worth it and it was it was like some like ridiculously obvious statement that they came out with right so they had a bunch so they've done like um uh diamonds are forever is was named i think one of the most uh i think was named the marketing slogan of the century or something like that of the last hundred years it was voted that diamonds are forever was the best marketing hook created because it created this like demand for diamonds so why is that so so there's a bunch of like aspects to this so first how did they build demand well it was basically in old school influencer marketing so they decided all right we're gonna make diamonds look like the gift of love and so they went to hollywood and they went to all the producers and they said we will give you producers here's a beautiful diamond for you to give your wife here's a diamond for you for your for you on your bracelet or your necklace your earrings or whatever and they basically said hey um we will give you these diamonds for free producer but you need to have a scene in your movie the climax of your movie where the man professes his love for the woman he needs to open up a box with a diamond ring inside and then she needs to have an amazing reaction like she needs to be won over because the guy did that and so they went to all these movie producers and the movies now all have these scenes and you could go back and watch this montage of before this nobody was doing this in movies all of a sudden every movie this was the key scene the guy pronounces his love for his w for the woman and gives her a diamond and she says oh my god i love you too it kisses him back and so they like used that kind of inception then they went to fashion designers and i said hey wouldn't it be a shame if um if if if you didn't say that the trend next year the big trend is that diamonds are in would let's call it the trend to diamonds so they created this thing called the trend to diamonds and they just got all these fashion designers to ambiguously say there's a trend to diamonds so now you have the the high art people saying this and then you have hollywood showing it and that was like the main sort of brainwashing mechanism of of the world at the time no social media no nothing and so then they said so then you know the ad agency starts getting uh you know clever they're like all right um how do we make the diamond proportionate to the man's success what if it was you have to spend one month's salary on this and they went with one month salary and then they upped it to two months salary and then they had an advertising campaign that said um how do you make two months of salary last forever buy a dime oh man amazing right and then and then they were like okay look but hey we all know that diamonds are actually not that rare right so we can't have people reselling these so they said oh uh first of all if you make it the the the ultimate gift of love the woman won't want to sell it the guy won't want to sell it and then even if they do here's what we'll do dealers the you the merchants who sell this you cannot take diamonds back because diamonds even though they are like seen in the world as like a store of value it's like oh just jewelry it's like you know jewelry is kind of like a safe way to store your wealth it's like a car if you take a diamond out of the shop it's lost 50 of its resale value and the dealer doesn't want you to know that so they won't even make you an offer to buy it back so they banned merchants from like making offers to buy it back because they didn't want the merchant to tell the customer hey once you buy this thing it's worth half uh and so they said don't even make an offer and um and so they kind of like killed the resale market and then they created this diamonds are forever campaign so that you would not want to sell your diamond and they did this country by country so like you can look in any country you can see this chart so it's like the u.s goes to this curve where no one's buying diamonds that like 75 percent of engagements are all through diamonds and then uh 90 it gets to like 90 something percent our engagements are done through diamonds in japan they they're like oh we have no market share in japan they go they do the same marketing playbook there it goes from five percent of brides have a ring to 60 and 20 year in a 20-year period and de beers own 70 of that market share right and then they started creating other marketing gimmicks like the right hand ring it's like if you're an independent woman you know you don't want this ring on your left hand that shows that you're kind of owned by this man wear a right-hand ring you need a diamond on your right hand that says that's the right hand ring the 25th anniversary ring the upgrade ring like you know just show that you're doing better than you were before and so they created all this like they literally [ __ ] created the demand and they restricted the supply it's kind of unbelievable um so that's kind of like the that's amazing the core of it there's some other stuff like you know there's like sort of the blood diamonds thing which is like the bad pr around it which is that these diamond mines were a kind of shitty conditions to be in um but b they were like basically using profits from the mine to fund like war in the area like militia war in the area so that was kind of like you're basically funding conflict in a way and so the diamond industry tried to like after that movie blood diamond came out they tried to like clean up their image but then lab grown diamonds started coming out and um and so the lab grow diamonds come out it's like oh [ __ ] so first they created a marketing campaign that says real is rare and they basically were like if it's real that's what makes it rare which is what makes it valuable so if it's a lab-grown thing that's nothing and they refuse to acknowledge it they refuse to sell it they refuse to care about it but customers were like dude this is it's indistinguishable from a diamond the naked eye cannot tell what's a real diamond like mine from the earth or made in a lab because materially again the composition is the same it's not like a fake it's not like a fake diamond it's the same material it was just grown in a lab rather than growing in the earth and so i always get the the shane co commercials right and they say like you don't want to get them from a lab from a lab it's it's just like every other one right they're all exactly exactly it's not special and so the problem is it's still growing in popularity because they sell for about 30 of the price so you can get like a way bigger ring that looks identical to a diamond ring that is made of a diamond um but it just happened to have been like it's like do i want my coffee sourced from you know canada or from philippines or from africa like it's kind of like where is it sourced so some people care but it's growing in popularity so then de beers and the diamond industry they like did the last kind of like stone cold killer move for years they were like lab grown is fake it's [ __ ] don't buy it and they but it was just growing in popularity anyways so they were like all right [ __ ] we gotta do something else so then they create this up called lightbox and they start producing lab grown diamonds everyone's like oh my god does this mean that lab is legit and they're like no no no no no lab is for people who can't afford diamonds so we're going to sell ours so they undercut the price like crazy so normally a lab grown diamond will cost like 30 or 40 of the cost so it's like a 50 60 discount and but they started pricing theirs at like a 90 discount of a real diamond just to ruin the market value of the brand perception of labrador diamonds and they said this is for they said they came out in a statement they said this is for emotionally shallow events like a sweet 16 or like a quinceanera party buy the buy the lab ground for that don't you know so that this is their latest tactic to try to like keep up this big myth this big lie that diamonds are this rare valuable precious gem and it's like actually just complete [ __ ] this is amazing research this is a good one this is a very good story and what but here's the thing where we are uh maybe it will change is us in our 30s we all do the same thing which is right before we get engaged we say this is [ __ ] i will not stand for this i will not pay this amount of money right my budget i'm going to set it really low i'm going to get a fake one or i'm going to get a lab girl like i will not buy into this and then you get into it and you say [ __ ] it's going to make her gonna make her happy yeah and we all refuse to buy into it and well more and more people are starting to to go the other way um but but yeah it's it's amazing that this is still the majority right given now that lab grown is visibly identical and you can get a way better better looking diamond for cheaper price uh it's amazing that that like the re the utility doesn't overwhelm but like the branding is that embedded it's that strong after so long and actually there's one other part which is that eventually you know the diamonds do um the the beers did lose their monopoly i should say so like in the year 2000 they basically broke up the monopoly because they're getting a lot of public pressure as a monopoly the the buyers were kind of sick of being like constantly threatened uh by de beers and then people found new minds in australia and all these other places where they couldn't like you could kind of just in africa you can kind of like coerce people but in australia it's a lot harder to like go coerce some a minor in public to like just [ __ ] give you their mind and so um and so they've changed their business strategy so and the last factor by the way is there's this guy the family that kind of like created the real monopoly is the oppenheimer family and they've run this thing for years first guy oppenheimer are they they're they're very wealthy so the business i think is like a 10 billion dollar business i think they sold half the stake for four or five billion uh recently and i also think they own like 50 of louis vuitton or something like that they own some other stuff too but um but anyways they couldn't the the in the family there's no one to take it over anymore uh no one wants to run the business nobody another young generation they didn't want they don't want their business there's nobody there's no air and so they're like [ __ ] there's no air business is still good but it's getting harder and we don't have somebody to fight it and so they actually switched strategy so they broke up the monopoly and now they shifted from like 90 market share to 30 uh and then they started rolling out their own retail stores and profits have gone up but they're kind of like their um you know their control has gone down their power has gone down and i would have to if i had to bet you know i'm a i'm a very amateur historian and so i've read a lot of these stories if i had to bet i would bet that once you break up a monopoly for a family-owned business i would argue that the odds that the odds are that the family are now actually going to get richer it seems like it's just what do you mean well so for example standard oil this is the same thing in the 1920s teddy roosevelt said nope standard oil you are the beers of america you own 80 of oil production you can't do it anymore so they broke it up into five or eight different companies and some of those companies are exxon mobil um bp right um conoco and like five or six other companies that you probably know of um and it made rockefeller get significantly richer because he owned a small stake into each one right and they all competed with each other and they boost their revenue boost their profits and they all made and he made significantly more money because of that and that was a the big source of his wealth was when they broke up the company and i would say that if facebook and instagram had to compete with each other um it would actually make zuckerberg richer same with youtube and google if they had to compete it would probably make them better and thus the owner's a little bit more rich exactly i i agree that's why when people talk about breaking up facebook it's like well you know what this is going to do right like they're all going to become more valuable and the services will become better but it does open up more room for competition whereas when they have a absolute stranglehold then you know it may not be as as lucrative and it may not be as good of a product but it's very hard to break break in um yeah that was great that was well there's also like an opportunity here right like as i learned this i was like okay i know this is not new but if i just sample the population it's like on one hand you do two surveys one survey they did was hey did you know about lab grown blah blah blah here's what here's like look you can't tell the difference look it's made of it's actually the same material composite it's the same material as diamond it's just grown from lab rather than mine in the earth and hey you don't have to worry about the like ethics of the mining because it's not not mine from the earth 70 of like millennials are like yeah i'm totally open to that that sounds great but then at the same time the market share hasn't caught up yet and so i think that even though this is not a brand new thing i think that people could create a really valuable brand like i'm curious if somebody listened to this that wants to go and basically take an education based approach to selling this because i think the more you educate people the more they wanna like the more willing they are to buy and if you're the one who educates them you get that first right of refusal to sell them sell them their first lab grown uh diamonds and i think i would bet that millennials won't do this but what's the generation after that z i believe they would and the 18 because you know they're so um politically correct and they're very they they they have a high [ __ ] detector i believe and for me and my friends a lot of us were like this is not the battle i'm going to choose right i'm just gonna i'm just gonna you know buy my way out of this and and we'll fight a different battle right with them i don't i would argue that there's a good chance that something like that could happen i don't think it will happen now but i think in 10 years when the 18 year olds get in their 20s and 30s uh and i would bet money i i would bet my money i think that could work as well so i'm bullish on this too yeah that's great um all right do we want to do it this is a good story that yeah we um that that this has got to be our our youtube click that was a very well researched and very good story good job very much so that's the episode we'll see let's see if this one's a hit i think it was kind of interesting what do you think ben i thought it was great um the de beer stuff is super super interesting um and uh and the intensity stuff uh the the sushi story was great loved it it's good of intensity you dunked on somebody this week you said did you really can you dunk how tall are you he's mormon of course he can dunk so i'm six four apparently it's like the basket isn't isn't it isn't it the basketball love uh of the like whenever all my mormon friends they it seems like they always are playing basketball on sunday all of our churches have uh basketball courts in them and so uh even like non-mormons play basketball in our churches a lot now are we talking about 64. you could do windmills or we're barely scraping the dunk through or whatever uh so you know like when i was younger when i was in high school i could do like tomahawks and and 180s and like pretty good dunks but you know over the pandemic i didn't i didn't play basketball for like almost a year and a half so i didn't know if i still had it and last night i just drove i was going down the lanes actually a buddy of mine jumped with me and i wasn't planning on doing him like that but i was just i was there and i had to do it i dunked on him can you please send me a video of something like this and i would share it i'll tweet the evidence i don't think you're a guy that would lie at all but i would love to see this i don't think that you're a guy that would even exaggerate a little bit yeah i would love to see this i don't have the video of me dunking on the guy but i sure i have video of me dunking so i can yeah can i send it to me i would share that in a heartbeat i would love to brag about that i i are you're 6'4 we've never seen ben in real life by the way you're 6'4 yeah last company i worked for was all remote and uh we had a off-site we all met each other for the first time and everyone was blown away they were like oh i didn't know you were so called one like i if i was one person at the company told me she's like you have short energy i can't believe you're tall wow i know i dude i saw this really hilarious tick tock yesterday where this girl just goes oh i'm i go around on live streams and i just uh give people compliments for i call it i i go uh we love our short kings and she goes to tall guys streams like normal height our taller guy streams and she goes we yeah we stan our short king we love our short king with kissy face and the guys and she clipped together their reaction and they're just they're all like we love our show king and they get excited they're like wait what i'm six i'm six i'm six and a quarter like i don't know who you call a short king and then like and everybody gets like super butt hurt about it right away it like really [ __ ] with their brain and she goes it's hilarious just call them like my short king ben please send me a video of you dunking on fools i would love that that would make that would make my day i'll send it to you right now sean sam how tall are both of you i'm six i'm six ones yeah we're we're both uh we're both uh of similar height and weight i think i mean like when when when people meet both of us they say you guys are much bigger than we thought and i would say that when we're together we look big and tall and sean you look taller than you are i think too oh good i don't know what that means but i'll take it it's better than me called a short king well i think it's because you got big hair that's right that's right you know what i don't get do you do you guys feel tall at six foot and six foot one no i don't know if you feel average height right like to me that's like six foot six but like if you look at global averages or even american average like the american male height is like only five nine right or something yeah yeah it's like it's short you guys are super tall which i don't know there's a disconnect well then you're a giant i guess so yeah by that logic no i don't i don't feel tall i feel uh i feel thicker than the average person that's for sure and you are so ben uh when you dunked on the guy did you like scream what did it feel like i mean i've never dunked on anyone i've only i've dunked a volleyball once that's the closest i ever got it was like actually not even i could see something smaller i mean that's pretty good that's that is pretty good that was like in high school uh so wasn't great the guy was a friend of mine i had we had been playing some pickup at a mormon church actually and i just won like four games in a row and i think people like morale is pretty low so i just played it cool i didn't say anything i just kind of randomly by the way i'm not being prejudiced it's a thing that mormons like it's like i've always known that there was basketball courts at the church and it's like your church is like a community event right you hang out there after church yeah we have weekday events there sometimes especially for like youth and like yeah people play basketball there yeah yep yeah so it's a thing it is a thing sam's it's a mormon thing to go dunk on someone politely as you did like it's such a morning to politely just like and then like to drink a coke [Laughter] i mean i don't too right a lot many latter-day saints many many members of the church do drink a lot of soda because you don't drink coffee or tea um but i don't yeah whenever i go to utah like i'll go to the drive-thru at these like soda places and they've got the best sodas like the weirdest combinations i love it so i'm mormon man i'm an honorary member i hope sam are you a coach or pepsi guy coke die coke zero all the way all day ben coke or pepsi i've i've actually never had either in my entire life what oh amazing that's amazing okay great i saw this great reddit thread that was like brands uh if their slogans were true like it was like truthful brand slogans and the pepsi one was um is pepsi okay it's like the thing at the restaurant you order a coke and then they hit you with is pepsi okay [Laughter] um all right that's the episode let's see uh we gotta cut those into clips we had a bunch of good ones see ya like i can rule the world i know i can be what i want to

and i was like wait a minute sean so you're telling me that there's a website that you invest money in you don't know who made it it doesn't work a lot of the times and you can't get the money out right and he's like yeah i was like oh okay got it just making sure we're on the same page what's up uh sean here we have sam and we got a guest his name is matter i'm said it right because it's not a like ladder but people know you as diamond hands uh if they've been following we did a section on the podcast i don't know how many months ago where i was like hey there's this thing that caught my eye it's called bitcloud and it's this crazy idea of a social network where it's almost like a robin hood meets twitter it's like everybody's got their every profile every person has their own coin and you can like invest in people and you can buy their coin and people's prices can go up or down as they get more famous and um i said you know there was a couple i said i don't know if this is going to work but i do hope that someday there's a like a decentralized social network so a social network that's not you know super top-down controlled the way facebook is the way twitter is and um this is the first credible attempt i had ever seen i had seen some other experiments but this is the first credible one where i said oh they have a growth hack and the growth hack is that when i saw my profile my profile was already created for me it was a clone of my twitter profile and i think it had like sixty thousand dollars sitting in the piggy bank and it just said claim it verify your account like claim it and that money's yours and i said oh that's going to work people are going to respond to that kind of incentive sam did it too sam you had i don't know what 50 000 of your thing sam claimed it and withdrew within a month or something like that he bounced out of there but um so people will remember big cloud you were the creator of big cloud at the time you were an anonymous account only known as diamond hands now big cloud has been renamed to diesel essentially that's you know the new brand and you've come out in the public and now you're doing podcasts so that's where we are welcome to the show big cloud's awesome that's a great name i love that name uh yeah man i mean so just for context sam and sean thanks for that awesome intro man uh yeah i mean so since early 2019 i've been working really on a blockchain that can power social social networks uh you know not just bitcloud but many other apps now they're actually over 100 apps being built on the actual blockchain itself which we call decentralized social or dso uh and so uh big cloud was actually just the first app that really we launched on the blockchain um and so kind of after working on it for almost two years from early 2019 we were like hey you know uh now let's kind of put all the features together that this blockchain can support into some kind of product uh and so that was bitcloud and it was really just a prototype and it was intended to kind of exercise and test uh a lot of the functionality but the biggest one is like the storage and the indexing of posts which is a very hard problem for for blockchains to solve and i don't think anyone other than diesel really has has had a good solution to that um but uh but yeah obviously we launched it so let me give a little let me give a let me give a layman layman explanation of this so sam i don't know if you know this but um there are actually a bunch of different types of of blockchains because the apps that you're building on top of them have different needs so like you know bitcoin has its blockchain and it's all it's trying to do is you know really store value be super secure it doesn't need to be the fastest uh because bitcoin's not about speed it's about security really above all else and then ethereum was like okay we're going to make a blockchain that's more programmable it's going to have maybe less security than bitcoin because it's more programmable but it's going to be able to do all these other things and then like these apps came out like on top of ethereum that were like crypto kitties and top shot which were basically like the first kind of like nft projects that got big and they immediately like overwhelmed the ethereum network and so the guys who built uh nba top shot when they uh you know they were the same crew that built cryptokitties so when they went out to build maybe a top shot they actually made their own blockchain called flow and flow was optimized for the use case of trading nfts and uh it can do higher volumes so they all have different tradeoffs and so what you're saying is you made a blockchain that was good at doing one thing which is social networks are basically about posting photos and videos and containing all that but today if you go try to embed a photo and a video on top of the bitcoin blockchain or ethereum blockchain it would be it's not made for that and so it would be either too big too slow two whatever just to render one like news feed so you guys built your own so is the name of the blockchain diesel and the app is yeah cloud is that idea and bitcoin by the way sean it's really interesting it's actually just one app there's actually over a hundred now uh that are built on top of it so you could like actually see the same data yeah you say that but like does anybody use any of these apps like you know i got 100 items on my desk they're all worthless does anyone care does anyone care about these hundred apps on top of these stuff like that yeah sean what's really interesting is diamonddap.com is actually more popular than bitcloud already now um so i think it just passed it even though it launched like a week ago uh polygram.cc is the app that people go to for nfts so actually when people share dso nfts they actually usually share links to polygram not bitcloud pulse is really good for trading coins and clout feed is actually a mobile app uh by the way cloudfeed i think might already have more users than bitcloud as well which is kind of crazy um okay i use cloudfeed uh because it's because there's no mobile app right so i think that's one of the challenges why isn't there an app because you're almost sort of playing with one hand tied behind your back twitter facebook they can send you push notifications they're a normal app for cloudfeed i had to like save something to my ho i had to safely save a website onto my home screen to make it look like an app and but they still can't do push notifications so is there a rule that's that apple's blocking or google play is blocking no well there are apps so there's cloud feed and flick app is actually another one uh that's actually created by the former ceo of fanduel and it's also very very popular but really like sean you're touching on our strategy which is we actually don't want to build any products at all i didn't even want to launch bitcloud ideally uh i think that with this kind of next wave of social i think what we're going to see is kind of a separation of concerns where you have this blockchain which is the diesel blockchain that powers you know kind of the back end of all these things and then people who are much better than me at building products actually go out there and build them right um and so for example if you look at diamond app or you look at polygram.you know again polygram.cc you go to them and you're like whoa this looks way better than that crappy craigslist like thing that nader built on you know which is bitcloud um and so it's really the strategy for us to not build anything and to let we call it the app layer to be owned by other people to give it away actually so i think we should i think we should do two things i think we should explain why this matters because to most people you're saying like polygram and diamond app and it's like these are things they've never heard of and they should go check it out but like i think i think it's more important to just get have the idea click in their head first which is if i went to facebook let's say i was a bad guy right i go to facebook and i wanted to take the most valuable thing i could take yeah it wouldn't you know it wouldn't be the engineers it wouldn't be the sign out front it wouldn't be mark zuckerberg i couldn't even mark zuckerberg is less valuable than the one most important thing it's basically the database right so facebook would guard with its life access to the database which is basically a whole bunch of rows that says sam parr here's his date of birth here's his his profile picture here's who he's friends with and that information they keep under lock and key and they give out little tidbits like when they created a platform or you could build a facebook app on top of facebook or you can do login with facebook they give you a little bit of access because it's so valuable right if i'm an app i don't want to make you go through a full registration form and upload a photo and then ask you to name all your friends and add them if i could just let you push one button and boom i grab your facebook profile and your facebook friends that was really powerful idea but facebook obviously keeps it under lock and key and what's cool about it this is the same way that like you know what's the most valuable asset that the us government has it's either the the guns or the money it's one of the two but let's just take the guns out for a second the money right the right to to sort of print the money and say we get to collect taxes in this currency therefore we have a monopoly on money and bitcoin kind of broke that monopoly in a way it said hey here's money without the government if you like the money part but you don't want the government you can use bitcoin and what you're kind of doing is the same idea which is you're turning a social network inside out the thing that facebook and twitter would never do they would never just give you account root access to its database what you're saying is here's a social network and the database is fully open and available to all if anybody wants to build any app you can use this database it is fully transparent and accessible that's the main reason it exists and so you're kind of taking a social network and you take the thing they protect at its core and you're turning it inside out you're putting it right at the surface for other people to use that's the big idea for this stuff and what does that mean that means today if you don't people are complaining about the facebook algorithm right fake news or i don't like that facebook censored donald trump or i don't like that facebook did this well your [ __ ] out of luck you can't go use facebook too you can't go use facebook red which has a different algorithm but with with this idea of dso that's what could happen somebody could just make a new app with a new algorithm that says i'm only going to show pictures of hot girls i'm only going to i'm not going to censor anything or i'm gonna highlight things that you you get to decide how your feed is curated and so you could build another app that people could use without starting all over from scratch so it gives people choice i think that's the big idea did i get it i made it i missed it yeah and and maybe just to put like a slightly different different take a way of saying it is today you know facebook twitter uh you know they're really about monopolizing content like you said keeping it under lock and key so that they can show ads on it and if they allow anyone else to build an app like if they allow another company to build an app on that monopolized content they lose those eyeballs and they can't show ads to them and it impacts their bottom line so really the fact that their business model is driven by ads is what kind of forces them to say okay this content's under lock and key we're the only ones who can build apps on it we're the only ones who can curate it and show a feed uh and we can't let anyone else uh aggregate eyeballs other than us we're the only ones so really what deso is about yeah right and there's one other component you just mentioned there which is the users the people creating all the content essentially doing all the work us the dancing monkeys that go sit on twitter all day coming up with interesting ideas giving them the interesting content we get zero right so like if i go check my twitter ad split or my facebook ad split and facebook made i don't know how many tens of billions of dollars on ads this year um but i get zero right and and so that's the other component which is their business model is we got to keep all the eyeballs and then we want to keep as much of the rev share as possible um that's their their natural kind of the game theory would lead them to do that and with something like dso you know i can make a post i can post on there i go post on big clout and people will literally i can make money off of it basically if my post goes viral i will actually benefit from the virality from the value of my content and that's the other if all this [ __ ] works right like forget the blockchain forget about the how it works if it works that's one thing that's going to change that the creators who make all the content will get a much larger share of the revenue what what do you think that share ends up being is it more like 50 is it 90 10 is there is there even a rev share like how much do you as the maker of the diesel blockchain get yeah well that's that's the funny thing is that today the way facebook makes money is with ads and like you said it doesn't share very much of that with the creators because when you have a monopoly on something you know you can be pretty greedy about it um and so deso we're really all about opening up the contents instead of monopolized content it's open content so when you make a post on bitcloud for example it actually shows up in the in diamond app in cloudfeed and all these other apps because again the content is open it's kind of like a utility rather than a monopoly um and the question then if you if you have all the content open is like okay wait but like how does anyone make money if all the contents open like can't like show ads you know on uh you know when all the content is open you know that's why facebook is the way that it is uh but um the interesting thing is uh when you put all of the content on a blockchain uh you actually get two things you get openness you know that you know all the content is open anyone can build on it which we've been talking about but you also get access to kind of a new set of of features that involve money in a very direct way um and so uh you know for example right what you were talking about earlier is the fact that you know someone can have a coin associated with their profile that anyone can buy or sell right that was that was one of the features that uh you know the diesel blockchain supports that feature is very difficult to do in a centralized way uh both because kind of the traditional financial system is very kludgy so to have it for example b that anyone in any country can like throw tens of thousands of dollars around left and right uh you know the traditional financial system isn't really built for that um and then um aside from that right it's all open so people can actually build on it and iterate and create new experiences off of that same that same kind of money feature set that we haven't even thought of before um and so going back to how does anyone make money right the dso blockchain has a native coin called dso right and so by holding it similar to how anyone holds bitcoin right as more usage comes on to that blockchain the you know people the demand for diesel should go up which should cause the price to increase um you know and then everyone who holds diesel does very well um but aside from that you know because that's how you know i and anyone who's bought diesel makes money um you know the creator can basically keep the rest um and so there might be small fees charged by the apps that kind of enable the creator to do like you know for example cloudfeed um or diamond app might charge small fees in order to earn an honest living and to to make good money um and so i think we might see uh you know basically um a splitting of the market by a bunch of different apps that kind of charge small fees to allow the creators to do what they do but that's competitive as opposed to monopolistic and will hopefully result in a lot more of the value accruing to the creator as a result so that's kind of the way to think about it just a couple of kind of quick questions because um sean is deeper in this world than i am and i actually think that there's a few more interesting stories here than just the technology so how how many people work there right now as full-time staff yeah so uh we have about a dozen people how much yeah and yeah and and what's funny is that team we're now focusing mainly on the blockchain and so but if you count all the people who are working on apps you know yeah but they probably got hundreds of they're just using your right and and totally so yeah only 12 people that's crazy so you raised you raised funding to do that yeah i think 100 million dollars right uh yes it's actually 5 000 bitcoin which uh you know has appreciated a bit and um yeah and you raise money so you raise money but besides that money can you tell me how much money has been invested so darmash who we've had on this pod i think i i don't i don't know but if i had a guess i wouldn't be surprised if you spent over a million buying other people's coins uh roughly i i think he said it publicly i think he said it on on big cloud so how much you're investing over a million dollars can you tell me how much has been invested on the platform um yeah well so what's really cool is because it's a blockchain it's open and all of this data is open so you can go for example to prospercloud.com uh or you know i think bitcloudpulse.com stats or like any of these websites and they'll tell you i think right now there's about 80 million dollars invested in people's coins which to me is absolutely awesome i think we actually yeah yeah yeah it is it's awesome um and all that does that count the money you guys invested because when i showed up from day one you guys did a smart growth hack which you sort of pre-bought a bunch of coins from naval and from jamaath and from kim kardashian and whoever so you kind of bought coins at a very low price for all these so that their accounts had some initial value which would attract those people to come claim their accounts so does that 80 million count the money that you just bought i think it does but i don't think it was very much very many coins that we actually put in um it was like maybe tens of thousands of diesel you know that went into it um so i'd have to look at actually how much of it is that appreciation of that but um yeah but there's definitely a piece of work in that for the people wait let me say one more thing people are listening we're looking at you now you're in a dark room you have the shades pulled down we had biology on here um a while ago and he had the same thing it was very dark and he was like you know i don't and he said on the pod he's like i don't really like talking about my my location because because he said i say some crazy i make crazy predictions i'll speak out against powerful people and i'm you know i don't want to like take unnecessary risk and let them know where i am are is this are you in the same boat yeah uh no no um i'm very open i'm in la um you know i have a house here you have security house uh i'm a very open person um well uh i don't know if you're supposed to talk about your security because that you know there's security dude [Laughter] let me ask this last question this is the last time you guys had a question i love it i love it so you you told me you're 29. um i looked at your linkedin you've had some like all your jobs have been like fancy like high-end really great jobs so but like compared to the job that you have now they were normal is working at big clout at all or uh d so is it at all a normal like are you gonna run this like a normal company or are you gonna be um a little uh like if you had to explain to your parents like how your staff works and things like that would it appear as though you do have a normal a normal company or are you doing some eccentric stuff that would be intriguing yeah well that's funny actually so uh just to go into some eccentricities of the project um you know that 5000 bitcoin i mentioned uh all that money actually came in before there was any corporate entities set up uh to do anything um and so uh essentially the way it worked was the blockchain was running and if you sent bitcoin to this treasury wallet uh the blockchain would basically watch that treasury wallet and give you diesel coins when it saw that there was a deposit there to like a corresponding key um and so it was all automatic and so there were over 44 000 purchases and i don't even know 99 of like like them who they are because they could just send bitcoin to that thing and they would get diesel coins on the diesel blockchain uh and yeah we you know we didn't set up a corporate entity um and that was you know kind of two reasons there's a big reason that we don't want people to rely on it to feel like this is a centralized thing that's going to own everything um you know when you have equity holders you know they're they have to kind of fiduciary duty forces them to milk everything and to be like hey like we should close this down at some point and really like make money off of it in like a different way uh so that was that was important um but uh but yeah and then you know just just from a regulatory standpoint you know um i i really you know there was no issue or of anything you know you just kind of threw bitcoin in and got diesel back uh and so what happened recently is and obviously that made it very difficult to hire uh you know that made it very difficult to even talk about who we are um but very recently you know the the platform has you know the blockchain has kind of gotten decentralized enough you know where there are thousands of nodes running running things uh there's like i said like you know over 100 projects a lot of them pretty legit and we felt comfortable setting up a corporate entity and kind of more normalizing how we hire and stuff so now as of a couple weeks ago there's the diesel foundation um and so i'm on the board of it and i'm i'm the only one right now but we're hoping to basically bring on some really legit people to join me and so it can actually be this kind of well-governed thing um and everyone's gonna work for that entity um and so i think going forward it will look very normal uh and it'll kind of just be a you know an organization that's a non-profit where people are paid with cash and diesel like a combination of the two uh and um and we develop the blockchain and uh and fund other people to build apps uh like i said we're giving away the app layer so that's kind of how we're thinking about it so early on i remember the story was uh nobody knows the creator but like i heard kind of through back channels oh we kind of know who it is because because it seemed like you went out fundraising because it was like hey this is should i send my bitcoin to this random ass wallet and get back this coin back that i don't know if i want if and it was no no these are yeah site barely worked it looked like a virus um and then you know and it was like no no there's so i texted some people i said hey do you know what's who's behind this is this legit they said i think it's legit the guy behind it's legit the people behind it have are real builders and they said uh you know andreessen and social capital and like a few tier one vcs have like are backing it and so that gave people a lot of comfort and that's why people like me and others put in money i sent a hundred thousand dollars into into big into into big cloud or whatever to get it wasn't even called diesel at the time i was yeah different names something same kind and um and so uh so are you but you're saying it now like oh i don't know these strangers on the internet started sending us bitcoin like definitely i'm pretty sure you did some kind of road show or somebody was doing something i don't know i don't buy this dentist the bridge there's two gaps no no you're way sharper and uh you're you're you're you're playing us a little no no no no i don't mean to play anyone uh no totally just to give a little more detail i love it i love it uh but yeah just to give a little more detail um yeah so what what's funny is uh you know i worked on this on this blockchain for almost two years since early 2019 and i met a lot of investors through my last company which was called basis you know where i raised 140 million dollars and then it didn't work uh wound up giving you know deciding to kind of do what i think is the right thing give all the money back uh but so what happened with diesel is i kind of worked on it for two years you know alone by myself brought on a couple of good friends uh and then i talked to a bunch of the big names that are now involved so like social capital andreessen sequoia all of them um and so what's funny about that is that uh i you know obviously i i did i talked to those people uh and so of the 44 000 purchases it's probably a few hundred where you know i kind of told them hey this is what it is uh and so um what's interesting about it is but those were the big purchases right so yeah they might be a few hundred but they were yeah millions each i think uh like you know so it might make up eighty percent i think about 30 million dollars worth uh was that um which is i think not not a huge percent and no one has no one owns more than five percent of the supply from that uh so i actually think you know i actually cared a lot about keeping it very well distributed like any good cryptocurrency but um uh but yeah but all of them actually don't own importantly they don't own equity in anything uh all of their interest is in the same asset that you or i hold which is d so um some of them used corporate entities to convert dollars to bitcoin in order to do this weird thing uh but they hold d so like those entities hold d so for them uh and they'll like take delivery like you know whenever they want so so that's cool and i think at the beginning you had a bunch of things sort of like we just retraced this story right so you do basis you you have this idea for a stable coin you end up giving back the money when you decide it's not going to work you um this new new idea for for a decentralized social network you raise some money from legit hitters other people pile in like you're saying it's all pretty quote unquote fair which is that we're all owning the same thing and um and then you get to the point of the launch you're you decide to be anonymous you try to go the satoshi route um but it doesn't work why didn't that why'd you want to do that and why didn't that work too many people yeah well so yeah so basically you know been working on this blockchain the diesel blockchain for almost two years and uh we were like hey you know we should really launch kind of a prototype app to start testing it like in the in the field so to speak and that was bitcloud um and we wanted to you know not really like have it go mainstream until at least like the middle of this year like the middle of 2021 um and so but you know we obviously launching earlier is better and so we kind of accelerated said okay in march we're going to start sharing these like password protected links with some people just get a few hundred users kind of see how the blockchain is holding up with like this kind of activity uh and so um yeah so so what ended up happening was uh it it you know kind of went out of control and the links got like way over shared um and to the point where i kind of had to go out there uh you know i had to start you know saying hey like this is what this is and and this is like you know what's going on uh but um for me personally you know i've always been really i think i've always admired how like satoshi kind of like launched bitcoin um without creating kind of like a centralized person that everyone kind of relies on or like this is our you know our guy um so it was really i wanted to kind of do the same thing there uh and so i launched with you know uh pseudonym diamond hands um and immediately you know it was kind of very hard to get press it was hard to get people to kind of listen to the story that that is the real story versus making up their own uh and so we had a lot of uh press saying hey like this is a scam and by the way because it was just a prototype there were a lot of things were missing so you couldn't cash out your money you couldn't actually convert your money and i was like wait a minute so you're telling me that there's a website that you invest money in you don't know who made it it doesn't work a lot of the times and you can't get the money out right and he's like yeah i was like oh okay got it just making sure we're on the same page here yeah right rightfully so uh any any other time i would say that's a complete scam also none of the code was open so even though it's a blockchain and it was running on a few dozen nodes like no one could actually audit it or be like hey this is a real thing uh so we were just not prepared at all let me let me tell you something there was a whole bunch of criticisms like what you're talking about right the code is not open source you can't cash out oh they scraped our twitter profiles um oh there's you know there's a big pre-buy people got in super cheap uh you know all this stuff there was all these criticisms of it we don't know who the founders are you know they're kind of anonymous but my theory and you tell i wanna know what you think about this so i have this phrase which is i think emotion commits the crime and then logic does the cover-up so all these logical complaints i don't think are the real reason why people were so like up in arms about this new project that actually is like a really net like it would if something like this existed it would be a huge net positive in the world and those same people hate facebook well this is the antidote if something like this could actually get off the ground and work and so um i was surprised that the emotion was there and i think i at least this is my theory i think that people don't like when someone gets rich without quote unquote earning it and i think what people saw is that the insiders so the people who created it or maybe the early buyers they bought so early on the bonding curve they got so early on and wow 100 million dollars has come into this thing these coins have run up in price or the the profiles have gone up in price and there was this feeling like like i don't know i don't know how well you did but here's my guess i think you've made tens of millions of dollars already liquid without uh at the minimum and your project is like under 10 000 dau or something like that right so uh or under 50 000 let's say so like in already in the tech world this tech gets backlash because people will raise at like 100 million valuation and people are like oh i've been running this restaurant and laundromat for years and how does this little app with you know with with no business model be worth 100 million dollars right there's already people who get upset about that but but the one saving grace is that they're not liquid so it's not like the founders running around in a lambo just living in a mansion in l.a but in crypto you're liquid too so you you get the early hype and you get the liquidity of the lambo and the mansion and i think that that is actually what triggers people about crypto in general bitcoin in general you know people who buy an nft and they get rich you know they make a million dollars off this random image um to i think to other people that feels inherently unfair and so do you what do you think is my theory what do you think of my theory and then what's your kind of response to the people who do feel that way i think there must be some like validity to your theory because if you read there's a great book called the infinite machine about ethereum and it catalogs like what happened ethereum how it launched all this stuff they got major backlash from bitcoin people because of the way they raised money where they were like hey like you know projects aren't supposed to like take bitcoin for you know another [ __ ] coin like you know this is like bad i mean i read that book right after you know kind of everything that was happening with bitcloud and i was like this is eerily similar um so so i think part of part of what you're saying has to be part like like a factor um you know dude look that said you know since then diesel is listed on exchanges you can trade it on blockchain.com ascendex and a really big one you know a couple big ones are coming soon and you know like the code is all open and people have gotten really passionate about it um you know contributing to it the last couple people we've hired are like open source like they were just contributing to and we hired them so i think that um you know if i saw someone who's very clearly a scammer making lots of money i would be upset in a way that i would be i wouldn't be as upset if i felt like there was a shred of them not being a scammer which we didn't have because i was anonymous you couldn't cash out the app was going down a lot um so uh whatever whatever theory there is is probably exacerbated can i give you some feedback and it's like it's a compliment i i when you first launched i was like diamond hands like when i think of diamond hands i think of finance bros and um i you know when i think of this anonymous thing i was like i actually i'm not on board with this although i agree i think it was wise for you to launch anonymously i actually think it's wonderful that you're coming out because your personality even though we've only known each other for 45 minutes now your personality guy for some you have a very trusting you you give off trustworthy vibes and i actually think it's it's you've done the right move by coming out and and discussing things um i actually it makes me like big clout more before the way that it looked and the diamond hand's name i was like i don't know if i uh if this if this screams trust but you i i think it's good to have like what what's the uh like i'm a pretty big new but what's the founder of ethereum how do you say yeah so i thought i watched a lot of his interviews screams trustworthy like i i i i like i buy what he's saying i'm like oh you're like he's really young but he's way wise beyond his ears he says a lot of intelligent things that i agree with he seems good-natured you have a very similar quality so i think it's smart that you're doing it and let's not lie sam vitalik looks like a boy genius like uber nerd and we're like oh let's invest in this this guy is probably going to make it matter but that you know you're the perfect mix of like intelligent nerd but you also like look pretty slick you're good-looking yeah you're smooth you you've got a good you've got your personal uh anyway it's so this is a compliment i think it's good that you're doing what you're doing you're too kind man i appreciate it let's do let's do one one like thought exercise because i think most people still aren't going to really fully understand okay if a social network oh decentralized blah blah blah so let's take about let's think about it from the perspective of the user who doesn't care if a database runs on sql or the blockchain and um who you know they're going to use something because it provides some new value to them right so even the idea of like it not being a monopoly like i think most people are inherently fairly lazy and they they're probably gonna just go with a default app anyways uh you know for a social network even if there was more choice so let's just take the actual like fun bit so um on big clout there was this idea that every creator every user had a coin and so i had a coin and i you know you give me a number i want it to go up i'm i'm like a monkey i'll immediately start playing whatever game is required for that number to go up and so my coin started at a certain price i remember it at its peak it was like five thousand dollars a coin my market cap was like half a million dollars i was on top of the world and now i stopped using it it's crashed i'm down 4x and all this good stuff but what is the aside from the you know pure gambling side of speculation and just the joy of seeing money go up whether as a holder or the owner of the coin what is the actual purpose why should individuals on a social network have their own coin what would you do with that why is that a good idea and just walk through like a use case so no theory but like here's jo here's guys here's why sam would want this and why that's good like the idiot of this podcast i'll take it he was like sam so do you know that there's different blockchains yeah go ahead matter i'll let you i'll i'll let you leader of that no i do talk talk to me like i'm fine totally uh well like yeah i mean look it's a great question i mean so um there's a deeper story to uh you know and so by the way the diesel blockchain supports all kinds of money stuff right not just coins but also nfts and diamonds which are like tips uh and people can build other things too but the the coins having a coin associated with your profile is kind of what i think to be kind of you know this this wave was about nfts i think the next wave is going to be about creator coins also known as social tokens um and the reason why i got really excited about them as a as like kind of an asset class uh is actually a cash flow story so essentially um you know with with dso right uh when you use any app right to access diesel uh you can do a lot of the same things you do on a traditional social network like you can post uh and you know all that kind of stuff um but you know you can also do stuff with money and you have new ways to monetize uh that kind of arise and so what's interesting is that um essentially you can have creators making money through these other features and then take a percentage of that cash flow and send it back to that creator's coin holders as a dividend long term um and so just to give an example right today when you sell an nft on any diesel app you know like polygram or diamond um you can actually set a percentage that's like what we call a creator coin a coin holder royalty uh and so every time that nft resells a percentage of that sale goes back to the coin holders um and so i think that essentially the coins if you if you play this out right uh and you have like for example promoted posts where someone can give you you can have an inbox of posts that people pay you to like repost your followers and and a percentage of that can go to the coin holders um you know you kind of have all of these new kind of like money native you know blockchain native business models for creators making money and if you allow a percentage of that to flow to the coins then suddenly it's kind of like you unbundled the equity of a company like facebook into like each creator's coin and therefore the fans or or the holders of that creator and so to me the coins are exciting as a means long term of like democratizing kind of like the cash flows of a social network into the fans of a particular creator and if you play all of that out suddenly it makes it a lot easier for really awesome smaller creators to get discovered right because when you create that that kind of loop of like oh if they become big cash flows will flow to their coin from their monetization on the platform right and those cash flows will be big if they're popular suddenly you want to back the smaller creator who you recognize is awesome but that nobody else really knows about um and so to me kind of democratizing the ownership of a social media platform is like what the coins are about and creating that incentive for smaller creators to get discovered get invested and have people kind of grow with them um is the kind of the long term of it but obviously it's early so a lot of people don't what's it gonna be thinking about that look like in five or ten years how is this going to be what do you think your business will be like yeah i mean so even in a couple of years you know i mean you know let's say we have like you know 10 million daily active users right um there are a lot of ways that we can build monetization for creators into the blockchain nfts are already there and creators have made hundreds of thousands of dollars off of that like tens of thousands i think for one of them they had over a hundred thousand dollars flow to their coin already through the cr crater coin royalties uh but there are other features too you know like for example that like that pay to promote uh or pay to repost kind of mechanism where an advertiser can say hey repost this to your fans i'll give you this amount of money uh and then a percentage of that can flow to the coins so basically any way new ways that we create for creators to monetize on the platform a percentage of that can flow to the coins and suddenly the coins kind of become not just about pure speculation but about hey like what what kind of cash flows is this creator gonna do um and that it's gonna be a lot because not not just because you know the platform is is more efficient you know like i i do think you know things like nfts things like you know paid repost can be more efficient than the traditional model today where we have kind of a centralized company just showing random ads uh but um yeah but but also just because uh there are so many more things that you can do right that could you know earn cash flows that end up going to the coin that we haven't even thought about yet so you did the thing that i was hoping you wouldn't do which is you you did some theory uh so so you know anytime this is the tell in the tech world anytime somebody starts talking about democratizing democratizing it's the new it's just a smart guy way of true i can't stand that word yeah exactly uh you know you want your company to be disruptive and democratizing at the same time right and also if they say there's a new asset class they're probably it's probably a good idea but they're giving you kind of like the grandiose steve jobs vision um actually i shouldn't say steve jobs because steve jobs was great at basically saying a thousand songs in your pocket and like just leading with the killer hook and and i think for for this you know what i was hoping you would say and so i'm going to kind of say it here is i don't know if you know this but sam is an aspiring fitness influencer a rising fitness influencer and so those who are yeah rising i should say not aspiring he's he's aspired um yeah oh perfect i got my two you want to play oh you're over here yeah dude bitcoin might not guy next door your niche could it could be like like love it i'll be like the nerd who you know started really frail and then made his way there's definitely a need and so you know someone like saying basically i i know sam i say this guy and i see his videos i'm like oh these these are great videos he's only getting you know a couple thousand views let's say right now but i i basically what what this world would let me do is as an early believer i can bet on sam i could say i like this guy's content i think this guy's gonna blow up and i can kind of vote for his success i can give him some so i can buy his coin which gives him money to like make better content it gives him a little boost of morale to keep going but it also lets me go on the ride with him because i think we've all been there before we discover a band early or a brand early or an influencer early and then you're you're you believe in them and you're so you're so right they actually do take off they never knew you they never had a real relationship with you and you didn't benefit from the fact that you know kim carter if you knew kim kardashian back when she was just paris hilton's closet organizer uh and you thought she was great you missed out on the ride and and so this lets your true fans go on the ride with you and it turns your fans into sort of shareholders with you and so oh bro i study this stuff you know kim kardashian where did this come from i have to know i must know and uh and sure enough there's a story and so you know sam let's say i would bet on sam sam would get that cash so sam could use that to make a cooler video and when sam makes that video and he gets more followers they have to buy in at a higher price point than i did because now sam's more established so my stock is going up i'm earning instead of just following right i own instead of just following which is the way the world works today with twitter and instagram you just follow you don't earn and then this the you know furthermore sam could say hey you know what how do i make my coin really valuable to hold what if i kind of only fans it and i said i'm going to do some exclusive stuff with only my coin holders who hold over 100 of my coin so it's up to him to decide if he wants to make his coin more juicy more more enticing to hold which again will make my stock go up if i know sam's the kind of guy he connects with his fans he's going to put in the effort that's going to make these coins more valuable and so it takes this idea that's been around for a long time the thousand true fans the thing that any artist knows that they need those real believers and it turns them into people who actually benefit from your rise and so that's what i think that's the good thing that i think will come of this aside from you know destroying facebook and all that good stuff i think the good thing that will come of this it'll make being a taste maker and a curator like a job pretty much you can actually get paid for having good taste for following for believing in somebody early on which is the way that things should be i think yeah sean how are you better at explaining this than me also i i i'm kind of uh i'm not offended but uh that's awesome well dude when i first shouted out big clowns okay i gotta come up with a reason that i like this besides i think this is gonna make a lot of money for me uh so i started thinking about what what is the appeal here and i have to defend myself and in doing something with the case yeah that's true i did i i remember it uh but yeah sean just to add which is really interesting uh like you said there's actually never been a way to actually invest in someone when they're small and make money on their rise like in like this easily this efficiently uh and what's really interesting is there's actually yet another interesting kind of like layer on it which is once you invest in someone your bias is to be supportive your bias is actually to be hey i want this guy to succeed i want this person to to be something and you can align in a way that you can't really on like you know without that mechanism like being able to buy into someone you know uh uh creates kind of an incentive that doesn't exist and what's crazy is that um even bitcloud you know bitcloud diamond all these apps uh they're actually very positive discourse a lot of it um even though you know there's not really any kind of you know there's not like there's less moderation than traditional social media right um and the reason i think is basically you're investing in people right you're going long uh and and when you give people the ability to to like move money around right people naturally go long and when they go long they actually uh uh get aligned and want to support you um and so weirdly enough like i love like when people say like money is like the root of all evil you know like money is bad and and i think that's part of why people reacted weirdly to bitcloud because like oh money prices whatever but like if you just look past that for two seconds you'll see that it's actually being used as an alignment tool that's making a lot of positive things happen that haven't happened what are your um let me let me ask you a couple personal questions real quick what do your parents do for a living yeah so uh my dad is an engineer and my mom is a social worker yeah so my mom was in virginia where i grew up for a long time she actually moved to san francisco uh uh my dad passed away a few years ago but i'm looking at your linkedin you you you've always been a freak you went to princeton you know you you've all you studied computer science and applied math at princeton you work yeah it's a compliment that's a compliment you worked at the famous for uh being high frequency trading but also that's like that's where i think jeff bezos worked and uh the founder i forget his name shaw is it just shaw uh david shaw david shaw he's you know a wizard you work you went to google at uh and you're a software engineer there and then you raised 125 million dollars for a startup which is crazy or 133 million you you you said on this blog post you gave the money back because you know it didn't work out so well what are your what does your mom think about like when you're trying to explain to your mom who's a social worker my mom's a teacher so she doesn't you know and i'm in tech too when you're explaining to your mom what you do for a living or your aunts and uncles or your brother and sister friends who aren't you know like you what do they think about this the fact that a 29 year old although you know you're 25 it looks like when you raise 133 million are they like what do they think of this life that you have yeah i mean so my mom watches every single video that comes out she's gonna watch this and she's gonna call me about it and and tell me all her thoughts uh so so there's that uh but yeah man i mean i just you know i live modest life you know i i don't think anything really has changed for me personally and like look you know to your point and to sean's point earlier you know on like oh someone made so much money without like having produced something right um you know i'm very serious about just mentally i don't think of myself as having any money right until we've really made it like you know i'm talking millions of users people really getting value at a large scale right uh so to me it's very important to not think about oh i'm i've made it when you know like like we have a lot to do like left to do um and so yeah and by the way you know funny funny fact uh with basis uh my last company where i raised 140 million and returned it um i actually had less money after that in in my bank account than when i started it which is basically about three years of runway from my like google analytics no i'm very lucky just because you know i mean i had you know like three years of runway like you know maybe like a few hundred k or whatever uh and um i'm very lucky to have had that uh because if i didn't have that i would have had to go back immediately to working at google which oh my god that's so bad it's the best company in the world i'm very lucky right but um but yeah my like it's funny like i've been through like very high highs and like well the lows aren't very low because i'm very lucky obviously but uh but yeah after basis i was like i'm gonna try and do something else that's really impactful like not in the context of working at a company and if i can find something before i run out of money that's great but if not i'm going to go enjoy my life at google which i love you know i really love being an engineer at google yeah i like to talk about human [ __ ] and you're i have a feeling that this i was not you heard the last podcast i was the i was the hater of the two of of big clout my opinion is likely changed as of now because of how you know sean's like this uh my good friend neville is like this you're incredibly emotionally stable and because of that i actually think that that could make uh this business incredibly successful well i mean i appreciate it man i mean yeah i mean i think that uh yeah i mean i think it's just really important to keep perspective right you know i mean and also like you know sam just to emphasize you know i'm really lucky so it's not like it's a lot easier for me to be emotionally stable i feel than like someone who's actually had it pretty hard you know and i think genetic yeah i think it's genetic and i think it's upbringing i think if you're if you're surrounded by love when you're when you're growing up and for some genetic stuff you're just going to be like pretty stable it's i just like now i understand now i want to buy your coin on big cloud oh nice oh i'm i that is like the biggest compliment you can give me this entire podcast i actually own some sean already but i i don't know sam if i found what's your handle on on uh on diamond or that's uh so i don't know if you made it i haven't logged in i have it like we'll find it after this yeah yeah i think you've converted me now i like i said i i don't think i was completely a complete hater but of the two i was the the more of the hater for sure sean was like i i probably made fun of sean cause he was like this is the greatest thing ever uh and and and we'll see who's right but i i i you convinced me well i i think i i kind of i don't know if i fully said this the first time but basically i think that whoever can can break through and create a decentralized social network no social network will that'll be one of the most important changes in the world over the next 20 years like self-driving cars i think is going to save a bunch of lives i think ai is going to introduce a lot of like productivity gains and like you know kind of cause some labor like changes in the way that labor works and i think that whoever can take social networking and make it an open uh do it the crypto way with the crypto values i think that that person or that group of people is going to have done a lot of great in the world and i think it's going to be a huge project i think it is going to be a multi-trillion dollar project when it whenever it works and i think i said this early on which is i don't i'm not saying that this one will work i think there's still probably a sub five percent chance that this works and i said but if it works the payoff is huge so i that's the type of bet you make in the tech world low probability high payoff and when you when you go at it with an enthusiasm you're gonna learn about it and you're gonna go for that ride with a bunch of early adopters and even if it crashes and it doesn't end up working out we're gonna all have learned a bunch of lessons so that when the right one does come around you say ah that one makes sense this solves the problems of the last one or this feels different and so i know that this is the real one but you never know unless you go in with you know sort of a belief mentality towards these things because it's easy to just say this is not going to work and you'll be right on 99 out of 100 times it's just that the one that 100 matters you'll have also said it's never going to work and you wrote it off and therefore you didn't benefit from it in any way that's like you know optimism pays in the tech world and so even though i got a lot of [ __ ] you got 10 000 times more [ __ ] for for doing the project um i just feel like that's such a misguided way of living and like you know again optimism is in this business so i find skepticism is useful at certain points but you know you want to default to optimism and then go in and find the things that don't smell quite right and uh but but you know even then you'll just have learned a bunch and gotten a bunch of experience and played with all the new things so that you know when the real one is huge and and yeah and i think it's really awesome that you know for me you know i get to do the thing that i love in the world which is to build cool [ __ ] and uh and and that's helpful to people and even though like you said like five percent you know and and you can do that and and it actually is something that uh you know at least the expected value can help but um give us give us the uh the craziest story cause i remember i was on big cloud and it's like oh pamela anderson joins and she's a huge fan and then like i don't know whoever it was all kinds of crazy characters you know that were joining this thing i was like i haven't thought about pamela anderson in like 20 years uh this is amazing and she's like you know good creating all these incentives for her coin holders you on the inside every day you must have just been seeing all the random stuff and getting threats from one side and praise from these random people give us a give us a war story or a crazy story that like is just kind of fun uh that that yeah totally um yeah i mean what's interesting is that it did attract a lot of like pretty famous people to like join or create profiles you know i think like diplo and blau tyga antonio brown are still like posting there and stuff uh but um i think probably the craziest story is uh at some point i went to a dinner uh in l.a and i don't know if i'm like even allowed to say but there were like a lot of famous people there and i got to kind of like tell them about it uh give cat give how do i even uh there were billionaire tech ceos and then also uh the biggest celebrity like someone's name who sean mentioned earlier uh who was a clotted closet organizer okay uh yeah all of them yeah and so i think um yeah just being able to kind of explain our vision to all these people was really awesome uh and uh and yeah and i think what's cool is like you know when you really get to explain it everyone gets excited about it even even in spite of kind of all the initial like oh you can't cash out or like this and that like when you're like hey like this is what it is um it's inspiring and like you said sean uh if we can actually use these features these new kind of like money features like the coins like the nfts like the diamonds all that stuff to decentralize social media it's going to do a lot of good you know um independent of the fact that they make creators more money and align with fans a high schooler in virginia that you'd be a crypto nerd hanging out in l.a at a mansion dinner with kim kardashian i mean what's funny about it is uh i was really into bitcoin in college in like 2013. uh so i built a minor i met mark carpalas as the ceo of mount gox uh my friend and i like went to japan and randomly tweeted him and he was like come by our office i met him so i was really into like bitcoin and crypto uh and you know when bitcoin crashed i was like okay i guess i'm gonna go do my hedge fund thing or whatever uh but it's funny i think if you told like college natter that like this is what he'd be doing i think he'd be like yeah that's awesome you know that's that's cool that's about right the kim kardashian part like you know maybe not no i mean um yeah i'm gonna it's like i'm asking you stock tips i'm on big cloud uh i'm on the site now what uh and i could see this i mean i could just go and find it but what what creators do you own and what what uh what which one are you gonna be making any purchases anytime soon what do you like yeah definitely i own active creators so if a creator is active and like posting and like doing fun stuff or interesting stuff i buy them um but really the thing that i uh you know like the hedge fund side of me really likes is nft artists because for nft artists uh even today not theoretical um all of them set royalties that go to their coins um and so there's real cash flows there that are often like totally disparate like you know like their coins are not like correctly priced for like how much money is gonna actually flow to their coins um and so i've been yeah i bought like spookies and um uh clout punk you know early illuminati is like another one um and those like just the cash flows are like above what it was when i like you know those have made up for what it was when i invested in it so uh so that's kind of like i think that's a strategy that like just traditional like i do like i get it um and then as we create more cash flows going to the coins there'll be even more um but aside from that because i know that you know creators who could get big are going to have ways that cash flows go to the coins the smaller creators who i think are active and are like gonna do cool [ __ ] anyone in particular you know that's who you enjoy that's like the other one um oh there are a bunch um well so darmesh has been crushing it he's not a smaller creator uh but he's just been super active he's been doing a lot of stuff creating time right now yeah yeah yeah he's he's he's very big on the platform um i'm trying to see like there's like matreshka who's a woman who's very active there and does a lot of stuff tidgeon is this developer who does a lot of awesome stuff um yeah it's aditya you want to know my strategy that that worked on big clout at least early on this worked pretty well i i was thinking about okay who do i buy do i buy the famous people that are not on yet there's people building scrapers to try to figure out someone's thinking about it or they tweeted it out and it hasn't gotten verified yet so go front run that i figured out there's a very simple way to win and i said right now with any early project i've built a bunch of social networks and i know anytime you build a social network at first 70 of the conversation on that social network is about the social network this happened with the stuff i built it happens if you go to clubhouse eighty percent of the rooms are just end up they will end up talking about how great clubhouse is or what it's gonna be or what's bad about it they're just always talking about the platform itself so i knew okay if people are gonna be interested in the platform itself i invested in all of the analysts who could who could go through the on-chain data and report how what prices were working you know how many how many new users there were and all that good stuff and so i bought all the analysts dirt cheap and they went up like crazy because again they were talking about the platform in a way that was differentiated because the normal person didn't know how to go analyze the blockchain and then the other one was basically rich active people so i saw darmesh was just gonna buy his own coin and whale shark was just gonna buy his own coin craig clemons was gonna buy his own coin and so it's like a company that does a share buyback it's like oh okay this person has the they have enough funds where they could like dramatically move their own coin price so all i got to do is just buy them and wait for them to do their buybacks and sure enough they did and dartmouth even said it publicly it's like i'm gonna buy for every follower i get i'm gonna buy back my every every coin holder i get i'm gonna buy back 10x of my own coin or something crazy like that and i was like well that's a ponzi scheme that i love that's perfect great uh like i'll just hitch onto that ride this guy's guaranteeing and i know he's a man of his word he's gonna buy he's gonna buy back his own stuff and i could just front run that so that worked amazingly at the beginning i don't know if that would still work now the strategy of forecasting what content is gonna be popular and then investing in the people who are producing it i mean that's like that's like the name of the game i think um so i think that's pretty awesome uh yeah like there was a guy who would do uh fake designs like mock-ups like oh this is what the client could look like yeah oh if they add it in it's how it it's just like kind of like design porn yeah design porn i was like oh that's going to work people are again it's talking about the platform and in a differentiated way because this guy's a designer and he's going to just design mockups all the time this is going to go viral great yeah no that's genius honestly um yeah and it'll be interesting to see how it works at scale um especially because diamond app is like so mainstream and i think can actually get like some bigger people to like join and start using it um yeah i honestly i wonder how it's gonna play out um by the way another fun thing we didn't talk about is there's actually an algorithmic feed that's like open source now built into the blockchain so that would probably play into your strategy where you can look at how the feed works and then try and figure out what what's gonna get to the top it's pretty hard to game i think but uh but that's that's another like interesting have you talked to their master so for the people saying dartmesh is one of the co-founders of hubspot as of today he's probably worth just off hubspot stock it's public you can go and look probably like a billion and a half so very very very successful he was part of big clout very early i mean he was telling us very early on that he was buying a lot and he's he wasn't an angel investor but he was an early investor in coinbase he was an early investor in crypto he obviously has hubspot wildly successful and he's like this is my thing so have you have you hung out with him he that guy is interesting as hell well what's crazy is i think i met darmesh like pretty late in the game i had like a pretty short call with him where i just kind of we just talked about you know life what the thing is and what bitcloud and diesel is and all that stuff um so what's funny is i think darmesh just like really independently kind of saw whoa you know like you know if like you said sean you know in the five percent where it works or whatever like this is huge uh and um so what's funny yeah i i've had a very short conversation with him i'd love to to hang out with him more but uh you know he's busy and uh obviously we have lots of business i honestly think you know he does post a lot i think 99 of people um they'll say they're not doing it for the money and then they totally are he's like the one person i believe that is not actually doing it for the money so i i genuinely believe he's doing it because he's like i want this to win and in order for this to win we need like economic activity we need like positive energy in the system so i'm gonna literally like almost in a philanthropic way put a bunch of money in to just like get kick-start this because it's gonna take some enough people doing that because like i said right now it's small it's really small and like that you know there's the with crypto there's these hype cycles at the beginning but there's a vicious other side which is that if it doesn't just keep magically going up people get disillusioned for a bit and then it has to get another thing that like picks it up and so um i think he was genuinely just trying to you know kickstart activity and enthusiasm totally and i mean another thing to your point sean uh i i have you know good news to you for you like with regard to if we can do like a social media you know decentralized social it's going to be really awesome which is that um i actually think i won't say the word it's inevitable but i think it's actually very asymmetric like in favor of decentralized platforms actually winning um the main reason being that i think when all the content is open and anyone can build on it i think that the speed of iteration that you can have and the like caliber of product is just a lot higher um so you know just like you know on that five percent you know it's like if you know for example just because all the content is open right we can have like all this over 100 teams that like we didn't even hire just go out there and build way better apps than we were capable of building internally but then it's even bigger which is like you get like once you get a little bit bigger you know let's see if like a million users now you have like traditional publishers basically looking at the open content being like hey like with one engineer we could spin up like a sp a feed like espn or something can spin up a sports feed for sports influencers right and be like hey like this is cheap like we should do this and get into the social game and make marginal money um and then you know in other countries this is i think something that darmesh really likes uh you know for example in a country like india or russia or something like that uh today they use twitter a lot they use they use basically apps built predominantly by people in silicon valley uh and the reason is that you know silicon valley has a monopoly on the content and you know they because they have that you have to use their apps but when all the content is open you can actually have people in the native country build the apps that you use and tailor it to their uh to their user base um you can read stories about how facebook was just horrible in japan for a really long time and like nobody you know they had to make all these optimizations that were like kludgy uh to to you know they were just leaving on the ground like no one was doing them because they're centralized kind of centrally planned organization so i think once you have a blockchain that can actually handle posts and data which hasn't really has not existed until do so um i i think it just kind of opens the floodgates for this like number of innovators and an amount of energy that wants to build that is it just has to beat your essential plan model like i just don't you've got to get the power i know that like i i it always works this way you make a big splash um and then there's like either down it goes down or it plateaus and then it needs to go up right now you guys had that massive splash it went away for a minute because as it does everything novelty always goes it goes away and then you got you're gonna have your comeback up and so i hope that you could pull this off and you have to make it so like i want to go there and all of us want to go there on a consistent basis because if you can't pull that off you're not dick and i want you to kick ass totally and i have a funny story for you actually uh so i think on that the crypto side of things helps us a lot uh because crypto it's really hard to kill something that's crypto i've i've learned uh and so just to give you an example uh cryptokitties was this nft project that got really really big and then died or whatever right and what's funny is during the cryptokitties hype i gave a talk about my project different it's like a stable coin uh but the co-founder of openc xander tala was at the talk he came he came up to me after and was like hey man like you know i'm thinking you know i like this like nft thing we're gonna make a marketplace for things like cryptokitties and i was like dude really you know like what are you doing with your life this nfts are dumb that was like that's never gonna you know happen again but you know crypto has a way of like when there's a really interesting concept which i think nfts were right uh it kind of plays dead for a while and then people realize it it comes back it gets down and that's that's happening you know look many things yeah absolutely um and so uh you know so from my standpoint obviously we're doing a lot of fun stuff we have actually just today we rolled out a referral program that any one of the apps can use uh you know where if you someone can share your link they get 25 you get like five dollars or something uh and so you know that's the first money we've invested in growing the user base uh and i think that's gonna do well but i really think a big part of it is you know when you have a really good concept which i think creator coins alone are interesting not to even mention like diamonds and stuff uh sometimes just take some time for the market to figure it out uh but yeah i think the initial hype kind of to me showed me okay this is this is something that you know once people maybe get a little bit bored of nfts they're going to look at the next thing and this is just going to be waiting you know so i don't know obviously not it's all five whatever the five percent like sean said i love that but uh that's my you know that's kind of my view on that's awesome man well listen i appreciate you coming on uh i think you did great and i think that for people who uh who like trying new stuff they should go check it out so what's the best starting point for them now so is it is it big clout still or yeah well in six months it might change but right now diamond app.com is awesome uh it you know the developers basically wanted to make it a 10x of bitcloud and i think they achieved it um so that's great uh and then if you like nfts specifically polygram.cc is a really awesome place to browse the nfts if you if you're into that uh it's just a great great way to look at them but yeah man thanks for having me i mean this is incredible like you guys i like i said i'm i'm a little bit like afraid of how well you explained it and how much better it was than me but um yeah i got to work on that i guess just send people like this like a clip or something we have uh jonathan on the length it's okay when you were in college when you were in college like mining bitcoin i was just uh you know sitting there trying to i have no skill so i'm just sitting there trying to convince people to buy you know like random like objects in my room and so you know you get good at what you get good at you got good at something that was extremely valuable yeah it's something i got good at this other thing like explaining more for you i just i know i know i i know like this man this crazy bet that i'm making on you but something tells me you're gonna be okay all right dude i mean look the the upside of all this is that if diesel works it helps a lot of people man and honestly not even diesel if anyone figures out decentralized social and if we helped in that like really like my my mentality is if we instigated something really good we've done a good thing for the world and i sleep very well at night knowing that no matter what happens like pushing this forward you know uh is has helped you know well let me ask you one one other thing i've always wondered which is you had all these big people invest in buying buying the currency before you guys launched and then you launched and they didn't all use it like where are they what's up with that did you hit them up and you're like hey brother it would be nice if you're the number one or two person on the network you own the coin you invest in this before we launched can you go like you know use the thing like or did you not pull that card what's up with that that must have no no that's actually mostly me uh so we have a lot of people who are like really big names not just in vc but also like in hollywood and all that stuff who who bought diesel um and they asked me like natter like is now the time like to really like bring this in and like do it uh and i just didn't feel like bitcoin was quite there yet uh now uh with diamond and polygram i mean i think now you know i i think it's a bit different but it was mostly me kind of because i don't want them to join bring all their users and then people are kind of like this isn't good enough this looks weird and we lose like half of them right out the gate right so you know like like i said we're playing the long game here um so the longer we wait to really bring in the big people and tell them hey now is the time uh i think the better it's going to be and the more users will have so uh but we're we're there i think with diamond uh so you'll probably start seeing uh some of the bigger people using it and well thanks for uh doing this we're like yeah our schedule got all screwed up sean was late because his house is flooding and we were we were tinkering with the timing and you overstayed with us and we really appreciate that so you've been very generous with your time um this is badass man awesome yeah this was fun good to meet you where should people uh find follow you what's your so are you still under diamond hands are yeah at natter now uh you can follow diamond hands and natter diamond hands is gonna still gonna do some fun stuff but uh natter is where i post from so yeah awesome all right all right thank you so much for coming incredible just incredible [Music] you

[Music] i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on a road less travel never looking the current setup right now with your business what do you think is going to be the biggest revenue driver is sub stack do you think gonna drive you know this paid newsletter business is that going to drive a significant amount do you think it's most going to come from bt sport from youtube ads what how's your your business set up and where's your head at in terms of where the opportunity is right now uh my my biggest revenue driver if if you want to put in those terms is uh is vox media they're they're paying me the most um and that was important to me because the mma hour was a show that i created and put a lot of time and effort and uh you know just i mean everything i poured everything into that show from 2009 all the way to 2018 and it was heartbreaking to see it end even though i was going to my dream job um that show just meant so much to me and i think it meant a lot to a lot of people and so that's the biggest one and that's a do you regard that as a youtube channel or or youtube and the and the the podcast does very well it's on apple it's on spotify it's on google it's on stitcher all those places as well and you own it i do not own it no i don't own it they pay me to do that show uh so that's what's interesting about my situation is like some of the stuff i own some of the stuff i don't own but everyone's playing nicely together in this sandbox and i'm very appreciative it took some time to kind of figure out all the pieces that was the most interesting part of this like it back in in february so when i came to the conclusion that i was gonna go and leave espn and try to do things here and there obviously you have oh i'd like to do this and that like some people call it a chinese menu you know you kind of build your out your own thing but then the actual dance of getting everyone to play nice and be on board with all these little different things that i'm doing was the most interesting part of the whole process and i really lucked out and i found all these people like people who are okay with me having my own youtube channel that's completely mine and the sub stack but also doing something for the ringer spotify and also doing something for vox and b so um it's just it's just been a really interesting um exercise in look i i like my friend uh pat mcafee here i am dropping uh names um he's like oh well you're not totally independent you don't own everything i'm like okay fine if you want to get you know uh into that whole semantics game fine i don't own everything but there's an independent spirit to all of this where at the end of the day i feel like i'm partnering with other people as opposed to being a full-time employee with anyone i'm not i have an llc now and i'm able to pick and choose what i want to do um and so that's that's really important but to answer your question the biggest deal that i have at the moment is my deal with vox media you do you think long term that stays true or do you think cause some things are are some things pay off better immediately and then some things you say okay if i build i don't know the newsletter if i build the the podcast or the ring or stuff if i build that up three years from now this picture might look a little different or do you you said you don't really think too much about business do you not even care about that you just do your thing and see what happens are you trying to get me to reveal my five year plan my business plan right here are you that's exactly what i'm trying to do i'm looking for 20 30 ariel where's 20 30 ariel doing like the the what who's the guy who started the ringer what's his name again bill simmons yeah like you know he was in a similar position as you so the ringer probably netted 150 200 million dollars when he did that i mean is that gonna happen to to you uh that would be nice um i don't know you know right now um obviously i'm i'm very happy with the situation i'm really excited and it's kind of the thing that's flying under the radar at the moment which i'm totally okay with that uh what i'm doing on my own youtube channel is giving me uh as i like to say a lot of nachas nachas is a yiddish word which means kind of like fulfillment and joy in my heart because uh every week for now every thursday i am posting an interview with someone outside of the mma world because i have been itching for a very long time and that was part of the reason why i went to espn um to show people that i'm more than just an mma guy that i can interview other athletes authors musicians comedians anyone it doesn't matter if you're in the sports world if you're an actor if you're a holocaust survivor if you're interesting i want to talk to you because the thing that i derive the most enjoyment from are the interviews i love talking to people i could do a hunt i mean i do a four-hour show twice a week now and uh i i feel like i could do it every day it's just a lot of uh fun for me and so i've i started that around a month and a half or so ago and uh it's just my own little thing it's it's me and two producers an audio guy video guy and we're posting these interviews and i don't honestly care at this moment if a million people watch these interviews or three people watch the interviews for for me now i'm doing them to uh you know fulfill you know this this little you know passion of mine to talk to other people to scratch that itch but also to eventually show people the right kind of people that i could do this that i could be much more than just an mma guy and it's actually the exact same thought process that i had when i got into all this back in 2007 in fact uh this past tuesday october 19th marked the 14-year anniversary of me launching my own site jerrypark.com it's still up i was at spike tv in september of 2007 i got a job working at spike tv and spike tv was the home of the ufc and i was working in tv production i thought okay this is the best place for me tv production ufc uh they're the home of the ufc it's perfect after a week there i walked into my boss's office and uh i quit and i said uh i i don't really think this is the right fit for me i'm not i really like they didn't do anything creative i'm a creative guy i like to think of ideas come up with things and they were just kind of the middlemen the ufc was producing all the content so i walked into his office i said i'm really sorry thank you for the opportunity but i don't think this is the right fit and i'm the kind of guy who um when he's 85 years old i i don't want to wake up and say i could have done this i should have done this i should have zigged when i zagged all that stuff he was very upset he said you're going to regret this for the rest of your life this is unprofessional no one's ever done this blah blah blah and they made me stick around for a month and a half in my cubicle until they found someone to replace me and that was the crossroads of my life in fact our mutual friend john was a part of this process where you know i would we would go for lunch during this process i'm not doing anything and i'm telling him i'm going to start my own website and i'm going to start interviewing fighters because i really want to go into mma journalism i really want to show people that i could be the howard cosell the the max kellerman the whatever of mma and so i started to reach out to fighters via myspace and every morning i would post an interview with a fighter and i didn't care if five people looked at the interviews or 500 people looked at the interviews or 500 000. i just wanted to use that to show people that i could do that 14 years later i'm doing the same thing on my youtube page and now i want to build this and grow it um and and use it as an opportunity to show people but for now it's just like giving me so much joy to go back to those early days and just talk to people about things and then now i'm like last week i interviewed marty fish the former tennis player who's been you know very open with his battles with anxiety and friends of mine who have never listened to my work watched my work ever who don't care about mma are like wow dude you're a really good interviewer i'm like yeah i've been doing this for 14 years at this point but it's it's opening me up to a whole new audience and i'm very excited about that [Music]

i knew he wanted me out he wanted me out from before i even got there like from the moment the news came out that i was signing he was trying to get me to not even have day one at espn and so just being 100 honest i'm a petty guy there was a part of me that almost wanted to stay in spite of him i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back we're live now so we we always hit recording right now oh wow geez so hitting me with the uh the blindsided live i like it well it said that's how the real pros do it i don't know how you guys do it on tv but the real pros just go live abruptly in midtown i love it i love it i'm always ready so we um do we got introduced to a friend my uh our buddy john who's apparently your closest buddy and um i like i don't know what you know about us and we could tell you about it in a minute but basically like we're pretty popular in the business world and let's start with that yeah pretty big deal anthony pettis is a fan i know that yes we're not nearly as big of a deal as you are in your world but like you know we're on the cusp of being pretty big and uh we've talked to a bunch of amazing people we've talked to titans of industry we've talked to billionaires we've talked to people who have tens of thousands employees people who products you use whatever i have never been as starstruck or as nervous to talk to someone else no i swear to god ariel i've been listening to you for for maybe 10 years uh i've never been this nervous okay um and so for the audience at home uh the only reason why sam is saying this right now is because i think you recorded this after the uh the explanation of what happened last time we were supposed to actually do this a month ago and he stood me up so he's trying to butter me up because he still feels bad he was in some villa in hawaii i'm on the east coast freezing my butt off here and he didn't wake up in time and now he's trying to tell me that he uh is star struck in front of me get out of here with this no i i i i i kept as the kids say this is full cap right here all right there's no sam doesn't know he doesn't know cap he doesn't know this sort of modern lingo well i i've been i've been dead honest uh like we've talked to a lot of wonderful amazing people i've never been this nervous because you you're you don't take a lot of [ __ ] you uh you you call people out you know the whole thing with brendan schaub is amazing um the whole giovanni the whole thug knows i know about it all ceo pf that's amazing that is incredible like every one of your guests takes their interviews from the phone while driving i'm shocked you're not doing that i know no every time like they go to me uh you know like it's all right now let's join uh so and so thank you for joining us blah blah and and then they go to the shot and they're in the car i'm like ah for [ __ ] sake you're in the car really why did you tell me that this was a good time if you're in the car i don't know there's just something less intimate about the car maybe for other people it's more intimate but i don't know when you're at home you're comfortable you've got your little water bottle or coffee next to you it just seems like you're going to get better stuff but um all that aside thank you for having me in fact a very good friend of mine not named john beer named kevin wang of montreal give him a shout out he currently lives in new york as well i've known him for quite some time when i think you sent out the initial tweet that i would be on he within seconds sent me the screen grab and said this is my favorite podcast i can't believe you're gonna be on it uh this is incredible tell me more all this stuff and more so a lot of people are apparently excited i appreciate you guys having me no hard feelings it took me a couple days to get over being stood up uh you know i had to rearrange my whole schedule and cancel on some people and things like that but with uh with great pleasure i return to do this for real good and and uh we're gonna do an intro ahead of this so we don't need to tell talk too much about your credentials but basically for the people who aren't listening ariel you've been you've been in this people who for the people who aren't listening i don't know i don't think they care sorry see i told you i'm nervous for the people who who don't follow you you're basically you've been in the game since 06 you worked for vox you worked for espn you worked for a ton of different uh amazing publications but you you started as a reporter at this point i would say you're just as much of a character of the mma scene ufc scene as dana as some of the fighters don't tell dana that well i i you're definitely you're you know you're as much of the story sometimes as a lot of the stuff going on which is awesome and you've built this amazingly large and loyal audience uh we're a business podcast so we could talk a little bit about mma but what's interesting is that you've recently kind of gone uh semi-independent so you work with bt sports you work with spotify you work with sub stack although you don't work with them but you know what i mean you have a sub stack and what you're doing with journalism and an entrepreneur in terms of entrepreneur being an entrepreneur is pretty amazing um so you kind of like have this independent uh business where i think it's kind of interesting and i think if you are a young person wanting to get into business journalism business media what you are doing and also what some of the other guys are doing bisping chael sonnen i think that is the the perfect example of what you can become so that's why we asked you to come on well i appreciate that and i could tell you how i uh arrived to this point in my life if you'd like um i kind of feel like i'm an entrepreneur at heart but i say that with the caveat that i'm a horrible business person when i think of things like finances stocks uh investments like it truly makes my head hurt my older brother mark is uh someone who's very good at this stuff my dad is very good at this stuff my brother works in uh the financial industry and all this i was always more of the sports fan the creative the dreamer that type of person however i consider myself an entrepreneur in the sense that i have always tried to do things solo on my own bet on myself when i went to syracuse university as a youngster i was the only one of my friends who left montreal to go um study in the united states in canada where i'm from in montreal no one leaves they all just go to either mcgill or concordia and so i felt like i was kind of you know building my own thing then when i got there i uh i create you know i i went to the the traditional so syracuse university in case you don't know is the number one school for at least in my opinion to develop sports broadcasters and they've developed the likes of you know the likes of bob costas went there and marv albert and mike tarico i mean the list is just incredible the names of the people who uh you know went to study at syracuse over the years and they all go to this one station waer to hone their craft and develop a voice and all that stuff and i went there and i noticed uh that everyone kind of wanted to be the same person and i never wanted to follow anyone and so i left that station after one semester and i went to like the rinky dink third tier student station um in the student center and i did my own combat sports show every saturday morning over there and so again i was kind of just doing things on my own and trying to build out my own thing fast forward a long time i get to spike tv in 2007 i hate it after a week i start my own website and that's how i get into mma journalism um and i start interviewing fighters and i give myself six months to get noticed i don't get paid for any of this i was just kind of using this as an opportunity to show people what i can do fast forward to now and in february i'm starting to realize that my time at espn is probably coming to an end and i'm starting to think to myself okay what do i want to do what would make me happy what's the future here and what i came uh to realize was i can almost create this menu this puzzle as i called it where i'm doing this here this here this here that here and i call myself independent helwani independent helwani and yes i'm working with other people but i feel very independent because i was able to go out and carve up my duties um some of it's my own my own youtube channel the substance things like that and some of it is i consider partnering with other people and uh it's uh it's been an incredible few months since i was able to leave i was terrified of leaving it initially because espn was my dream i actually had to talk to a therapist about that and we can get into that as well because i didn't feel i felt like a failure if i left after three years because this was my dream this was the mountaintop but i was very unhappy and i realized that i had to go back to that entrepreneurial spirit and start building out my own things and start doing what made me happy and be around people who make me happy and people who support you don't want to stab you in the back and all this stuff and so yeah i'm very very happy now now i'm working with vox my old friends at vox media with the ringer spotify with sub stack with bt sport i did a thing for showtime recently bet mgm and uh it's great i've never been busier but i've never been happier as well and talk about that that move so you're at espn the dream is realized because you're kind of like you're like me i don't know if you remember there was a show back in the day about becoming a sports center anchor do you ever watch this show oh yeah it was like it was like a reality show and it was only on for like two seasons or something like that but it was great i think anybody who grew up kind of with sportscenter on loop uh you know there was something really aspirational about espn you get there and was it that and so this can happen that happens with all kinds of entrepreneurs you'll sell your company and then you'll feel like kind of numb slash board like wait was this it this is the thing i was working for this whole time um so was it that the dream really wasn't a dream or was it that oh it came to an end and i got to figure out where to from here so what was the espn side like did the mountaintop feel like you thought it would feel or what was that like yeah so that's a great question i always wanted to work at espn that was sort of the end goal i remember being a young kid going on vacation to the united states with my family we'd get to the hotel and my brothers and i would watch sportscenter on loop remember in the mornings they would have like one episode that they would tape and they would just repeat it over and over again and i would repeat it and i was just so taken by the magic of sports television and the characters and the highlights and all this stuff and i'll be honest when i got there right off the bat uh i was disappointed the first few months at espn were very hard for me uh because i had this vision in my mind of what it would be like and the resources and the commitment to you know excellent content and coverage and attention to detail and all this stuff and it honestly it just wasn't what i expected now over time we kind of found our groove and i got to do a lot of fun things and i'll be honest in the back of my mind i was like i don't know how long i'm going to last here partly because of the fit but also partly because of the relationship with the ufc and not being able to cover the sport the way i want to cover the sport and i tried to check off as many boxes as possible and so hosting a radio show i wanted to do that i checked that off doing an e60 profile on my good friend daniel cormier i checked that off doing nba sidelines i checked that off otl outside the lines checked it out sportscenter checked it out so i was trying to do as much as possible because i knew at some point this was not i was not going to be a 25-year lifer i came to that conclusion pretty early on one of those guys who stays at espn for all those years and uh you know it was tough you know i'm going from doing a show in a beautiful studio that i helped um design in in a in in new york city to a very small studio uh with not the same resources to then going to bristol connecticut twice a week driving four hours back and forth mondays and wednesdays to bristol's it's a four-hour back and forth so two hours and two hours in the same day twice a week and uh you know sometimes it's you know it's your exhaust i'm doing a show that's three four hours long i'm mentally tired after this show and i have to get back in my car and drive two hours often in the winter it's pitch black like this wasn't very fun um and yet here i am you know it's the dream job it's espn and then on top of that it's all the other drama that you have to deal with behind the scenes so yeah i mean i came to the conclusion around a year ago well not a year ago now like last summer okay you know what do you want to do what would make you happy um would leaving be the right move would that make you happy and you know i there was a part of you know i knew honestly i knew there were people that probably wanted me to leave you know what i'm talking about people in the ufc probably wanted me to leave um if you're not listening basically you've had and you just actually did a wonderful youtube yesterday where you explained the background but basically you've had an issue or dana white the the president of ufc has had an issue with you for a variety of reasons whether he claims you're too negative he says you've you've uh leaked some information there's always been some tension there all of it's wrong uh he couldn't be more wrong but you know he has his uh he has his business and his motives and uh and and it would be it would be great if we could meet in the middle like we once did but you know uh that's neither here nor there at this point um so yes i knew he wanted me out he wanted me out from before i even got there like from the moment the news came out that i was signing he was trying to get me to not even have day one at espn and so just being 100 honest i'm a petty guy there was a part of me that almost wanted to stay in spite of him and i didn't want them to win i didn't want them to win because i knew that they would celebrate if i left in fact when i announced that i was leaving espn i got a text message from an unknown number that's not on my phone saying i told you we'd get you out of espn bye-bye now i don't know who sent me that text message i have my theories but like i so i needed to go talk to someone to figure out how to get over that to not stay at a job in spite of someone which is absolutely ludicrous to do what makes me happy to to have fulfillment in my heart um you know to wake up and be excited to be around people that make you you know happy and support you and all that stuff i had to get over that in my brain and thankfully i did um and so it took it took some time i don't have any regrets do you tell the therapist about petty helwani about helwani do they does the therapist support all these characters that you have in your arsenal sometimes she's like okay what is the end goal here what are you trying to accomplish are you bringing more stress um but she really helped me realize what is important and what makes me happy and not sticking around to you know stick it to people and things like that and as i said on my show on wednesday i don't know if i end up at this point if uh if i don't talk to a therapist and i was always someone who was afraid of talking to a therapist because i thought that it made me weak i thought that it it it would be um a sign of weakness that i was you know um you know needing help and all this stuff and and honestly uh i'm so happy and thankful that i got to that point it was a weird way to get there but you know i'm happy that i was able to talk to someone who helped me figure things out therapy is like exercise i'm like look even if you look skinny you should still exercise you know even if you're like in an okay place you should still go and do stuff and particularly if you're fat you should exercise if you're in a bad mental spot you should definitely go and do therapy so i don't think you exercise my peloton bike helped me a lot i got one of those i mean a lot of things helped me clear my head and i don't have any regrets i don't even have uh one thing that i had to talk out was i didn't want to have ill feelings towards espn i love sports i was just watching my knicks beat the celtics in an incredible double overtime thriller last night on espn i didn't want to be the guy who couldn't watch espn who couldn't go on the app who felt some sort of way about this company that meant so much to me and live with that animosity and i was afraid that that would happen i don't have any of it i don't have any animosity towards them the people there i don't have any animosity towards anyone there to be honest because they they kept their word they paid me till the very end they stayed true to the contract they even offered me a new contract unlike what other people are trying to say about me being fired i was never fired they offered me a contract and i turned it down and i met some legend mike breen doris burke i met absolute legends of the tv business there i will never forget my time and i'm very thankful for the time but three years was enough it was time to move on can i ask you i want to ask you two questions the the second one is actually going to be about dana white and um i want to ask you about what attributes do you think he he has that have made ufc wonderful and and and that's what i've asked people about you i asked john go man ariel's amazing what drives them so it's always fun to ask other people about like the the the people they work with but the first question is the the current setup right now with your business what do you think is going to be the biggest revenue driver is substack do you think gonna drive you know this paid newsletter business is that going to drive a significant amount do you think it's most going to come from bt sport from youtube ads what how's your your business set up and where's your head at in terms of where the opportunity is right now uh my my biggest revenue driver if if you want to put in those terms is uh is vox media they're they're paying me the most um and that was important to me because the mma hour was a show that i created and put a lot of time and effort and uh you know just i mean everything i poured everything into that show from 2009 all the way to 2018 and it was heartbreaking to see it end even though i was going to my dream job um that show just meant so much to me and i think it meant a lot to a lot of people and so that's the biggest one and that's a do you regard that as a youtube channel or or youtube and the and the the podcast does very well it's on apple it's on spotify it's on google it's on stitcher all those places as well and you own it i do not own it no i don't own it they pay me to do that show uh so that's what's interesting about my situation is like some of the stuff i own some of the stuff i don't own but everyone's playing nicely together in this sandbox and i'm very appreciative it took some time to kind of figure out all the pieces that was the most interesting part of this like back in in february so when i came to the conclusion that i was gonna go and uh leave espn and try to do things here and there obviously you have oh i'd like to do this and that like some people call it a chinese menu you know you kind of build your out your own thing but then the actual dance of getting everyone to play nice and be on board with all these little different things that i'm doing was the most interesting part of the whole process and i really lucked out and i found all these people like people who are okay with me having my own youtube channel that's completely mine and the sub stack but also doing something for the ringer spotify and also doing something for vox and b so um it's just it's just been a really interesting um exercise in look i i like my friend uh pat mcafee here i am dropping uh names um he's like oh well you're not totally independent you don't own everything i'm like okay fine if you want to get you know uh into that whole semantics game fine i don't own everything but there's an independent spirit to all of this where at the end of the day i feel like i'm partnering with other people as opposed to being a full-time employee with anyone i'm not i have an llc now and uh i'm able to pick and choose what i want to do um and so that's that's really important but to answer your question the biggest deal that i have at the moment is my deal with vox media do you think long term that stays true or do you think because some things are are some things pay off better immediately and then some things you say okay if i build i don't know the newsletter if i build the the podcast or the ring or stuff if i build that up three years from now this picture might look a little different or do you you said you don't really think too much about business do you not even care about that you just do your thing and see what happens are you trying to get me to reveal my five year plan my business plan right here that's exactly what i'm trying to do i'm looking for 20 30 ariel where's 20 30 ariel doing like what what who's the guy who started the ringer what's his name again bill simmons yeah like you know he was in a similar position as you sold the ringer probably netted 150 200 million dollars when he did that i mean is that going to happen to to you that would be nice um i don't know you know right now um obviously i'm i'm very happy with the situation i'm really excited and it's kind of the thing that's flying under the radar at the moment which i'm totally okay with that uh what i'm doing on my own youtube channel is giving me as i like to say a lot of nachas nachas is a yiddish word which means kind of like fulfillment and joy in my heart because uh every week for now every thursday i am posting an interview with someone outside of the mma world because i've been itching for a very long time and that was part of the reason why i went to espn to show people that i'm more than just an mma guy that i can interview other athletes authors musicians comedians anyone it doesn't matter if you're in the sports world if you're an actor if you're a holocaust survivor if you're interesting i want to talk to you because the thing that i derive the most enjoyment from are the interviews i love talking to people i could do a hunt i mean i do a four-hour show twice a week now and uh i feel like i can do it every day it's just a lot of uh fun for me and so i've i started that around a month and a half or so ago and uh it's just my own little thing it's it's me and two producers an audio guy video guy and we're posting these interviews and i don't honestly care at this moment if a million people watch these interviews or three people watch the interviews for for me now i'm doing them to uh you know fulfill you know this this little you know passion of mine to talk to other people to scratch that itch but also to eventually show people the right kind of people um that i could do this that i could be much more than just an mma guy and it's actually the exact same thought process that i had when i got into all of this back in 2007 in fact uh this past tuesday october 19th marked the 14-year anniversary of me launching my own site jerrypark.com it's still up um i was at spike tv in september of 2007 i got a job working at spike tv and spike tv was the home of the ufc and i was working in tv production i thought okay this is the best place for me tv production ufc uh they're the home of the ufc it's perfect after a week there i walked into my boss's office and uh i quit and i said uh i i don't really think this is the right fit for me i'm not i really like they didn't do anything creative i'm a creative guy i like to think of ideas come up with things and they were just kind of the middle man the ufc was producing all the content so i walked into his office i said i'm really sorry thank you for the opportunity but i don't think this is the right fit and i'm the kind of guy who um when he's 85 years old i i don't want to wake up and say i could have done this i should have done this i should have zigged when i zagged all that stuff he was very upset he said you're going to regret this for the rest of your life this is unprofessional no one's ever done this blah blah blah and they made me stick around for a month and a half in my cubicle until they found someone to replace me and that was the crossroads of my life in fact our mutual friend john was a part of this process where you know i would we would go for lunch during this process i'm not doing anything and i'm telling him i'm going to start my own website and i'm going to start interviewing fighters because i really want to go into mma journalism i really want to show people that i could be the howard cosell the the max kellerman the whatever of mma and so i started to reach out to fighters via myspace and every morning i would post an interview with a fighter and i didn't care if five people looked at the interviews or 500 people looked at the interviews or 500 000. i just wanted to use that to show people that i could do that 14 years later i'm doing the same thing on my youtube page and now i want to build this and grow it um and and use it as an opportunity to show people but for now it's just like giving me so much joy to go back to those early days and just talk to people about things and then now i'm like last week i interviewed marty fish the former tennis player who's been you know very open with his battles with anxiety and friends of mine who have never listened to my work watched my work ever who don't care about mma are like wow dude you're a really good interviewer i'm like yeah i've been doing this for 14 years at this point but it's it's opening me up to a whole new audience and i'm very excited about that we have uh a couple of kind of like just go-to phrases or principles when it comes to business one of them is bet on yourself and uh and i think you so so some people are like you know if some people are listening to this they're not super into mma i think one of the things they could pull out is your bet on yourself mentality especially when it's not easy right like uh betting on yourself sometimes as an entrepreneur it's kind of obvious you don't really have a job you you know by default you better on yourself you had quote unquote good jobs at each of these stops and then you said look this isn't it i'm going to bet on myself and i'm going to go independent i'm going to do my thing so you have a strong dose of bed on yourself even another one that sam sam uh coined which is niches get riches which is that i know you're a basketball fan but you didn't go into the more established field that one that had a career track that you could tell your mom look there's other people who have made it in this field i could be the next whatever uh in basketball you went for mma which is today fringe let alone back in you know 2006 or whatever like nobody was really there was no blueprint or there was no like um success stories doing what you were doing i don't think at that time like you are the kind of the success story of that niche and so i want to hear kind of how you decided to bet on that even though you have other interests you have other sports that you're interested in as well um and then the last one is there's this great phrase which is uh you know you want to do the work that feels like that looks like work to others but it feels like play to you so like if i was going to interview somebody four hours a day i would be exhausted and i think you get your pick up steam by energy by your hour three you're like you're just hitting your groove and it gives you energy so i think that's another example of where you you kind of live one of these principles that we talk about but tell me about the niche thing oh why did you see that that spoke to my heart that spoke to my heart that's a great line uh niches get riches because i couldn't agree with you more um when i got to syracuse for the first time my life like when i went to syracuse i wanted to be the next costas marv albert basketball baseball football traditional guy hello welcome to abc sports i'm maria helwani world series super bowl and for the first time my life i realized wow there's a lot of people in this world who are my age who have the exact same dream as me who are a little more polished who have nicer hair who don't have as big of a nose and maybe don't have such a foreign name their name is john smith and they just kind of fit that bob costas mold and i never i never liked to follow you know the pack and so i remember telling my parents in september of 2001 there's this sport called mixed martial arts there's this organization called the ufc at this point it's not even eight years old and i think it's going to be mainstream and i think in 10 years there's going to be some executive in some office some older guy who's like what is this crazy cage fighting sport i know nothing about it but apparently it's very popular who's the guy who's the voice who's the howard cosell of mma and i want to be that guy and amazingly literally 10 years later august of 2011 i was hired by fox and that was like my first big you know mainstream gig um and so it kind of worked out in that regard but i i say this to young people all the time when they reach out to me and they send me you know oh i want to do this i want to do that i want to be you know stephen a smith and all this stuff in this day and age you don't want to be a generalist you you you you're a fan of the new york knicks you're a fan of the new york knickerbockers i'm not gonna go tune in to the radio espn radio now i'm not gonna go in my car tune in and say oh i hope you guys talk about the nick celtics game last night i'm gonna go on my podcast app and i'm going to go to the new york knicks podcast as niche as it gets to hear an hour breakdown of last night's game if i'm a big pro wrestling fan i'm going to go to my pro wrestling podcast and listen to mma podcasts listen business podcast the days of sitting in your car and hoping that they talk about something or listening to people just talk about god knows what those days are over and so it is actually a lot better in my opinion to go into a niche to be the niche guy as opposed to being the generals yeah there's a couple guys who will make it steven and those guys but for the most part in my world it's way better to be the niche guy and i try to explain that and and within the niche have your own niche as well and so like my thing interviews i tell other people like find your thing there was a young i always bring up mike bond he works for mma junkie and he's a lot younger than i am his niche that he used to get in the door were stats and factoids so he would have all these stats about all the fighters great these days maybe it's bedding betting is super hot right now use that as your niche to get in the door so yes i i couldn't agree more with that mindset um and and i would urge anyone in this day and a this day and age of a la carte you know everything is out of the car right podcast streaming all that the more niche the better you'll have way more success rather than being just some guy like those days 50 years ago when you were a columnist for a newspaper those days are over how um how what what what size or how big is your your audience i mean i know the youtube videos get like thirty thousand a hundred thousand per per clip per video how what do you say the number is of your audience and what advice do you have you could use us for example i mean we're smaller than you um of like of of your tips for getting noticed and being great at building this this empire this is gonna sound uh don't tell me good content no no no no it's gonna sound wack but i really don't know the size i mean i see the numbers on youtube i never asked for the podcast numbers i don't want to know and it's actually one thing that really bothered me at espn like three weeks into my time there we sat down and started like breaking down the numbers and the listening rate and and the completion rate and all this stuff like i don't want to know this like it's hard enough i by the way in in the uh what is it now 12 years of me doing this like hosting this type of weekly show and all this stuff shows i've never had a person book the guest for me i i book every single guest every single name that you see on my show on on wednesday rose and jan behoevic and fedor i book those people myself i do not have a booker what do you just dm them on twitter i mean how do you dm fedor now i have you know i have their numbers uh you know it and i know what everyone likes like i know there's some people who respond quicker to dms there are some people who respond quicker to whatsapp there are some people who run quicker to imessage uh i never email anyone uh i mean you email a fighter that's like throwing you know a toothpick into the ocean there's no chance you're getting a message back but uh you know i'm just i'm kind of relentless like that and i'm obsessive like that and i think that i would drive someone crazy if i said hey i want to get uh rose number eunice on my show and then i would probably ask them a million times did she respond did she respond did she respond so i'd rather just put that on myself now it's probably the worst part of the job and it makes me uh you know very stressed out but it's just the way i like to do things so that brings enough stress now to know you know completion rate and downloads and subs yeah but you must have an idea you have a million followers on twitter i think bt sport has 1.2 million subscribers on youtube ish um your videos ballpark 50 000 to 100 000 views per maybe i don't know what your podcast downloads are but like do you know no one no one has talked to me now okay i'll tell you like at espn uh when my show with dc towards the end we were getting i think on the podcast only now this is one little sticking point that i have so they would sit down and they'd be like okay the podcast with dc is getting around 90 000 downloads uh an episode like all right that's pretty good 90 000 an episode once a week one hour a week but here's the problem they were comparing us to other podcast only shows let's say the low post podcast the basketball podcast hosted by the great zak low but that's an audio only podcast we have the youtube show as well so our audience is splintered so if you want to know about you know our total audience you got to count those numbers as well and in addition you want to get into dude i've never listened i listen to you every single time i've never listened to you on the podcast app so that's yeah so that's the thing like uh and it would always annoy me that we were just focused what about the youtube numbers like to me i'm more of a visual guy and i care more about that like the the the audio podcast is almost like gravy for me if you're in your car or whatever but i'm i'm more inclined to push the video so um i would guess if we're gonna use those numbers that's from a few uh months ago and i don't feel like we've really missed a beat on mma fighting since i returned there from the video you know we're talking like 200 250 but then then there's the breakout stuff right like because then each each interview gets made into its own separate clip so i don't know man what you're trying to stress me out here i'm just trying to live my life and no you're getting confused you gave an answer so you think uh 200 200k ish i'll tell you why i think something like that matters what are we at 50 or i think we're at 60 000 an episode if you add the youtube and the pod so i think that's amazing like like i think i've been studying a bunch of different people from uh you know like there's there's there's you in let's say mma and then there's uh you know i don't know if you follow cryptocurrency with this guy pomp and he's like the bitcoin guy and then there's tim ferriss and he's like you know the four-hour workweek guy there's all these people who build their brands they're what i call you know solopreneurs or solo media people and and you could look at it i did a comparison once of of rogan's show versus you know the the the like the tonight show and on every metric it's like you know not even close you know how many viewers do you get how much money do you bring in how many employees do you have and on every metric rogan just like like beats down the tonight show and uh but people would still sort of from a prestige point of view they think one is a television show where you wear a fancy suit and you have a monologue and a fake audience clapping and the other one is like you know you just got done with a workout you sit down in this little studio and you do a podcast what the heck's a podcast so people haven't really caught up on this model um and then i sort of broke down the businesses of each i said oh okay interesting so what it looks like to me is you get this number that i call your true fans which is basically like the number of people who really trust you and like let's say that's like a quarter million people for you or something like that maybe it's 250 000 people that really trust you i'll follow you i don't really care if you're on espn or mma fighting or you're with bt sport i just know ariel helwani and i'll just kind of follow you wherever you go it's like a fan of lebron james they're not a cleveland cavs fan they're a lebron fan and now they're all lakers fans and so then i sort of studied the model and i said okay it looks like between two to four percent of your audience will sort of buy anything you do like they'll pay for your paid newsletter they'll buy your your your hoodies um you know you tell them hey i'm ariel i've raised a venture capital fund i'm investing in startups now they'll invest in your fund they'll do everything and so now there's all these new models before it used to be you know you get famous and you write a book you spend a couple years you write a book and that's how you that's how you monetize your audience and then people started doing courses and other other different things like that and i've been studying all the different models one of the guys i got friendly with was matthew berry at espn because he has a niche which is fantasy football and he was doing this you know before fantasy was sexy he was like convincing yahoo and others hey go into fantasy i'm telling you like guys are nuts about this and he became the fantasy guy and he's kind of like you he's got a little bit of he's got a cushy gig with espn but he's got a bit of independence he's got his own like text message like list and he's got his own fantasy football thing oh does he do that i didn't know he i didn't know he uh he had he's got a couple carve outs i actually asked espn in our negotiations i was like well what if i do this like if i just do the dc show and the chill show but then i do this other stuff my own and uh i don't know it just uh because it's not easy i think he has a couple of carve outs there for him work for him for him and he got it kind of grandfathered in basically he's like yeah i get to keep deciding i don't make too big a fuss but if you go look at his twitter bio what does he link to it's like i think he links to one of his properties basically as like one of his things so i've been studying this model i would say for you i i i think you're in a great spot and you know if you just sort of think about like the menu of ways that how does somebody who's got a trusted loyal audience they've built over 10 years monetized there's all these creative ways beyond um beyond you know ads or sponsors on my on my show i don't know if you care about that stuff but i know i do care about it you know it's interesting like the sub stack thing is super interesting because i would say of the you know the three main things that i do like obviously there's uh video audio and writing um and there's there's different components all of those but like those are obviously you know audio visual and writing i feel very confident in my abilities as a video host and as an audio host i don't feel as confident in my abilities as a writer now people tell me i'm good i just don't feel like i'm as good and i try to be very genuine when i write i try to be myself not someone else um and i talk to a bunch of people about the writing component of my menu and everyone wanted me to do stuff that i wasn't really down with the guys at sub stack so i i'm part of this like sub stack pro model i don't know if you guys know about this okay yeah and we've talked to those guys uh hamish and all those guys a fair bit we like him yeah yeah so uh there was a guy named dan stone who's a great guy he reached out to me and they basically like pitched me this thing where i could kind of do whatever i want and there's obviously this small component of it that's uh behind a paywall i did not feel comfortable with the paywall i'm just being honest i said the same to him i did not i did not i think most people are in the same boat as you who come from your background i do i don't want to look i i've always been free and uh that that's a weird thing in its own right because like 30 40 years ago you know you're subscribing to sports illustrated you're subscribed like none we've we've all we've programmed the audience to expect everything to be free when in reality like this stuff does you know this stuff is worth something and and it technically shouldn't be free but it's been that way and it's hard to go back it's hard to put the toothpaste back in the the tube and so i didn't feel comfortable doing that and so the conclusion but i really wanted to work with substance and so the conclusion that i came to was uh all the proceeds that i was getting from the subs i'm donating to charity so i want people to know i'm not profiting off of any of this why i mean i don't feel comfortable i don't feel comfortable dude that's crazy so uh my company uh i just so this this podcast was owned by my company called the hustle we we just sold it for a lot of money too this company called hubspot and before we sold it thank you and before we sold it we had a daily email that reached around 2 million people a day and then we owned a subscription business called trends that made many millions of dollars and we charged 300 a year i think we undercharged what is going on like most creators feel exactly how you feel and i'm like you're crazy if you owned a restaurant and you were cooking every single day grinding eight hours a day would you give that food away for free i can't do it i don't know why i could even even stemming from like the shop stuff uh this this company breaking tea who i think are fascinating you guys should have those guys on they basically like react to actually they made this sweatshirt i don't even know what what's their name so breaking tea like breaking news so they're like kind of quick on trends with this exactly so like let's say uh for example off top my head jorge mousevides or nick diaz says don't be scared homie the next day they have a t-shirt out a really cool one and they're selling it but they have deals with mlbpa nhlpa so they're making stuff in real time it's a fascinating business and so one of the guys there was a fan and made a helwani shirt in the midst of like my whole thing i was like oh this is great and we split the cost and all of that i'm donating to charity as well i don't want it i don't know you've got this like this is actually like you know philanthropy that's crazy i i i i love you ariel and i think you're totally wrong i've listened to you enough that i know that you uh you know i'm married into a jewish family you've got this very like stereotypical jewish guilt about you of like your life and um i i think that's weird i i i i think you i think you are totally uh downplay you know it's funny i watch you in the interviews and i can tell you're nervous or you are having issues like realizing that you're the [ __ ] and so as a fan i will say i think you're undervaluing yourself um what uh can i give you can i give you a free idea here for for as a creator uh no charge for you ariel you're a friend of the house so here's a free idea for you okay one of the new little tools in the creator playbook of how to make a bunch of money i don't know if you saw this but mr beast who's one of the biggest youtubers out there launched this pop-up restaurant uh and and celebrities doing restaurants kind of been a thing but like back in the day it was sort of like you know it was like margaritaville or like gordon ramsay's wolfgang puck kitchen or whatever the hell these things are um but mr beast came out with mr beast burger and overnight he had 200 locations across the country and um and you know you think about that has this guy been pouring his you know that did that take years of preparation no what what's happened is there's these companies like breaking tea that exists that will create a virtual restaurant brand and what they do is they partner with like let's say you did yes i don't know i don't know what you're uh maybe it's chinese food i don't know what your thing would be let's just say for a second it's it's pizza balls okay you went niche again like i don't know how big the market is there but let's say let's say it was pizza just for for ease here um there's a whole bunch of mom and pop pizza shops in every city what this company does they go partner with one in phoenix and san francisco and all these different cities and they say hey we're gonna send you some packaging that's custom helwani branded packaging and only on you know saturday nights when there's a ufc pay-per-view does this restaurant go live and the menu is themed for like it'll be like you know you know a mazda pepperoni and like you know a diaz burger and whatever else and you or you know you make up your own names and then basically your fans can kind of order with the pay-per-view now mr beast he did his little pop-up thing so he didn't have to really lift a finger he just kind of said all right when i'll give you some ideas on the branding of what the menu could look like you know and i approve it yeah i'll approve it i'll put it i'll put my name behind it and then when the time comes i'm going to tweet out that hey this is happening and today you can go buy from my thing and i think this thing is done about over somewhere between 50 and 100 million dollars in revenue off this thing i think you know if you just sort of assume a 10 you know kickback royalty that he's getting on this i i'm pretty confident he's doing somewhere between three and six million a year of just recurring passive revenue um from the uh from his little mr beast burger thing now you're not mr beast but you could do something alongside the the pay-per-views and that would just be for fun your fans i'm going to steal that i'm going to steal that but you should i can't really shoot these guys so you've done the boxing thing you know the with the boxing yes which i made no money off of as well i know and i followed that and i bought one oh yeah that was fun i don't think you understand like i'm a super fan i appreciate it and so i would what i would do is the you you went to the new house wearing boxers right now yeah i am i would go to the um hawaii school of journalism i mean i i think that that can you guys be my agent i mean these are all great ideas i love this stuff i mean i just think that you could make like i i would imagine you could profit a million dollars a year selling a 500 000 whole body school of like you've never heard of me you've never heard of me before with this podcast i i did a course on writing how to be a better writer and again i'm nobody and i did i think what did i do 250k last month in this course um and so you know you sort of average that out across the year i mean these are like kind of like million dollar product lines i create the course once and then i just run i just say hey the new batch is open next month and then it runs again and people get great value at the end of the thing i say hey you know you paid whatever 900 how much value do you think you got out of this for you and your business your career right and they're like you know on average it's 10k basically is what they say so they get 10x return on their money uh from self-assessed on what they believe they got out of the course so you know i could send a film crew to you right now and we could film a course on how you know how to break into journalism how to make it as a as a journalist and then screw syracuse uh the people who really want this all you need is you know basically a thousand people who really want this who pay you a thousand dollars for this that's a million dollars a year of basically pure profit because the video production costs are very very small for this wow this is great stuff that who would have thought i'd come on here and get all these ideas i feel like my head is spinning right now thank you can you can you help us now please talk to me about audience building i mean like i you seem like a guy who like you don't have you don't do like a significant amount of like growth tactics you just you're just i think you're talented and i think you're you have tenacity so you've been doing it for forever um but what have have for us and anyone listening who wants to break into to do what you've done what uh what advice do you have on on audience building and and and getting i mean i know you don't you're not you're not a [ __ ] like a view [ __ ] at all but you know it's still you want people to like your stuff and you want a lot of people to like it what do you have for that so my mindset um was always okay the first thing was you know look at the landscape look who's out there doing things um it's okay to derive some kind of inspiration from this person or that person but at the end of the day like you need to develop a unique voice and give people a reason to tune in to you right don't be a copycat don't just try to do something because someone else is doing it and so that was my big thing and that's why the interview lane i was like oh no one is doing this in mma i should you know develop my own voice in this lane and be the guy be the leader here and so that's the first thing the the second thing is like it's it's exhausting you know you have to work your ass off to build the audience to put the content out to make it as good as possible um be consistent you know pick a day if if you're doing a podcast or something like pick a day monday is your day don't miss a monday you know like people who do oh one here two here take a break here it's very hard you have to be consistent you have to be reliable you have to be relentless you have to be professional so my thing was you know reaching out to the fighters and the fighters um who i reached out to i was very you know respectful towards i was very professional towards i didn't keep them for very long i would keep them for like 20 minutes in hopes of getting them to come back the next time right because it's not just about this time it's about the next time and the next time and it's the next time and so i don't want them in the back of their mind to say like oh this guy kept me for an hour what a pain in the ass i'm not gonna you know do this again um and then afterwards very thankful very respectful very professional uh and then over time you know it was like you know developing these relationships um checking in with fighters checking it it's not in my world it's fighters but it can be with anyone else if you're an interviewer and you're interviewing tech people and things like that like one big thing is you know i don't just talk to fighters um when i need something from them i don't just reach out to michael bisping when i want him on my show we talk about things all the time i mean in some respects some of these guys have become friends of mine um and they don't feel like they're being used it's important to be a human being towards your you know your your guests your sources your things like that and so then when it is time to ask for something they are more than happy to help you out because you've asked about their dog who passed away or their wife who had surgery or their son who won a big thing in football or whatever and so these are all kind of things that you develop not with the you know it's to me it's always very genuine i'm not doing that i'm not checking in on the dog because i hope that in three weeks it's gonna pay off and he has you know you know he he's willing to come on my show it's just being a human being about all this and working hard working your ass off trying to be different putting the content out social media is a massive thing now obviously you can't do a show without having a social media presence and i don't care if you have one follower or a million followers you got to put the clips out because it's so funny to me i hear from people all the time like oh that thing that uh rose said on your show was awesome and then in back my mind i'm like oh that's the one clip that we chose from the interview did you watch the interview or did you just watch the clip on my instagram and oftentimes it's just the instagram clip and that's okay it's just about being out there getting the stuff out there making it shareable um and then hopefully it attracts more people to check you out and check you out but like if this doesn't happen you know i started this this particular part of my life in 2007. i graduated in 2004 it took me 14 years just to get to espn and so a lot of people are impatient and they want to see the results right away it's just not going to be that way how many people first of all i want to know how often are you working because ufc fights end on one at 1am midnight in new york and you do a post you do a recap show often but how often are you working and also how many people does it take to run a content your content operation so i feel honestly i feel like i work every day uh i don't know if that's good or bad but it's it's for the most part with pleasure like i i don't ever feel like oh man i need a break i need a vacation this and that now uh part of going back to the therapist i was terrified of leaving espn and then kind of disappearing however i then came to the conclusion hey you know what distance makes the heart grow fonder for me and for them and so june 15th was my last day at espn and i essentially disappeared until august 15th i was still on social media i was still doing stuff here and there but i took a two-month break and it was freaking awesome because i went home to canada to see my parents for the first time in two years because of the pandemic i just i really needed that break um and i think that that's important if you're doing something you know for uh you know for a very long time i think it's important to give yourself you know that type of uh break as well but um for for the most part now i i feel like i'm working every day especially with all these different people and all these different projects and there's travel and stuff like that uh there is no real break and i'm okay with that um you just kind of find your moments i can be a lot better i wish i could put the phone away a lot sooner at night i wish i didn't wake up and check my phone right away i wish i was a little more present um at times i'm working on that but i got to tell you guys like i feel like i'm working every day but i'm also in this state where i've never been happier and uh the the work has been so fulfilling and it puts me in such a good mood to create this stuff and to be there for people like there is no greater compliment that i can get when someone writes me and said i had a horrible day and then i checked out your show and it made me forget about my day or during the pandemic i was so down and you and dc used to make me laugh and uh you know i just got a message from someone who's in australia and it's been horrible there with the lockdowns and you you know i'm so happy your show is four hours again because you give me eight hours a week of stuff to think about outside of the lockdown i can think about mma and i have access to these fighters like there is no greater joy than i get than that um and so i don't mind it but also you know i haven't been to a ufc fight in a year and a half march of 2020 was my last ufc fight and partly because of the pandemic now partly because of my job and you ask me right now big time ufc fight um conor mcgregor's return fight las vegas t-mobile sold out crowd on a saturday night in july the buzz the celebrities the atmosphere nothing better right or you ask me do you want to go to your son soccer game with 10 other parents there at the park nearby i am choosing that soccer game without a a shadow shadow of a doubt in my mind like i get so much enjoyment at being at those games being a parent being with my kids but then also doing the work that fulfills me and makes me happy there was a time where i thought i had to be at every event leave my family travel every weekend because i needed to be omnipresent because woody allen once said 80 of success is just showing up and that served me early in my life and career it doesn't serve me anymore and so now that i'm able to pick and choose what i want to do and work with people who i want to work with and do the kind of content that i want to do but also be there for my family and my kids at this stage of their lives gives me a lot of joy and so i never thought i would get to this point where wow i don't have to go to the events and i could still do great stuff and still be happy and still be followed and still produce amazing and still be there for my kids in a weird world i'm so thankful to the man above because i feel like it all kind of like fell into place at this point in my life someone and send that clip to connor ariel chooses soccer game oh it's a six-year-old soccer game over conor mcgregor's return it's the truth and it hasn't i just used conor cause that's the biggest name possible obviously uh you know he's been very good to me and it's been an absolute honor and i would love to go to events you know of course like one a week or sorry one a year two a year three a year four like i got to go to the jake paul thing that was a great great experience um i was just using the the most you know crazy example possible the biggest name possible the point is uh i used to have fomo i used to feel sad and depressed when i wasn't at the events because uh i felt like i was missing out i was becoming irrelevant and uh i don't feel that way anymore i feel very confident in what i'm doing and before we wrap up the the content team what's your team and process looking at oh right yes um so right now you know it kind of so the dream obviously is to like you know i think i don't know if you guys are fans of pat mcafee but i think that he is doing media in sports at least better than anyone right now um he's just doing an incredible job and he has his group of like i think eight or so guys doing work for him and his social media is brilliant because they're often tweeting out things and he's not even a part of it it's just like this well oil machine and then he's going to do smackdown he has his private plane i mean what a life this guy lives now i am nowhere near that at the moment uh i also didn't play in the nfl but uh right now i have i would say three people who work with me uh one person's social media one person's video one person's audio um and that's just me you know my llc type of thing and then i have people who are working on other projects you know the vox stuff they have people who work with me there ringer people etc but yeah i would love to to grow that out but i think the three most important people to have right now it doesn't have to be i mean like i all those interviews that you saw from me over the years i only had one cameraman i didn't and and i didn't have an audio person i didn't have anything uh i don't think you need a gigantic team of people to do stuff but yes it would be nice over time to have you know maybe two social media people and have this person who's thinking of this and someone who's you know managing like i was laughing because you know you said you had ben who did the scheduling and i was like man i wish i had a ben i wish i had someone doing my scheduling i wish i would i was uh in that position or i could even delegate some of that stuff that's part you know my problem as well i i don't do well at delegating um but it will come it will grow and then eventually it'll be fun to have a store a merch store to do the stuff that you're talking about and uh maybe make money off of it and not feel bad about it i mean there's a lot more i feel like i'm just i'm 39 uh i've never been happier about you know like my age my life um and i remember when i i was a young kid and we went to to boston and my mom turned 40 and i remember she locked herself in the bathroom and she was crying because she was so sad that she turned 40. and i joke about this with her now as i'm about to turn 40. thank god she's still alive and well and i'm like i'm so happy to be 40. i feel i'm way happier at 39 40 than i was at 1920 um and i just can't wait to see how this all plays out last thing i wanted to ask you real quick you mentioned jake paul and you talked about audience building and all the good stuff uh consistency quality hard work but there's also controversy jake paul is the master of controversy conor mcgregor is a master of controversy and you have leaned into the controversy i don't know if you've leaned in i don't know if it's a work i don't know if you if you if no actually back no way but the con you know you are the the number one mma guy and you're banned for life from ufc from ufc events by because the president of the ufc has a feud with you and brendan chubb now has a little bit of feud with you and uh it's highly entertaining i click every single one of them because you know same everybody loves drama everybody loves the fight uh you know we all turn our heads uh and look whenever there's there's a brawl that breaks out i'm i'm i'm at your clip his it's called ask the nose i believe on the nose on the nose sorry and it's been all about lately his fight with other other folks it's great so tell me about that leaning into that is that intentional is that good for business uh are you having fun with it you're actually angry what's going on okay well i'll just say i am not banned for life i was banned for 48 hours but that was back in 2016. over time there's been some revisionist history where people think i'm still banned i'm not banned i've been to a bunch of events since then um but uh yes of course there was that feud there that happened and all this stuff and and that's all well and good and now as i've come you know into this new era and uh this persona helwani thug knows el nadiz whatever you want to call me i've just enjoyed being able to respond to people and i think part of this comes from the fact that when i was at espn they kept telling me take the high road take the high road like a lot of people were taking shots at me and i had to take the high road take the high road muzzle muzzle muzzle muzzle censor yourself and then all of a sudden i become free and uh i think as a byproduct of being told to take the high road for the last three years i just kind of snapped and exploded and uh i think people have enjoyed see look i'm not this wimp that people think i am uh i don't have big muscles i'm not a fighter i'm not this but i'm a crazy fiery middle eastern kid who grew up uh getting into fights all the time while i was playing sports arguing like i'm not the you know i have glasses i look nerdy whatever i'm and at times i've actually leaned into that because that's a good gimmick in this world of you know big strong fighters alpha males i'm the beta but i'm really not that guy and the idea of letting people talk smack about me walk all over me disparage my name lie about me it's just not gonna happen anymore and so i don't care and it was funny like brendan was saying like i wouldn't say this to his face like did you guys forget that i stood in front of rampage jackson when he wanted to like bite my head off did you guys forget that nick diaz wanted to beat me up did you guys forget that you know mayhem miller trashed my studio and i just sat there like i would say anything to anyone's face i'm not the guy who sits in front of a keyboard or a camera and says stuff that wouldn't you know that i wouldn't have the courage to say in front of anyone says and i don't think i'm disrespectful i just you know am not that guy and so uh i think he said a bunch of lies about me and then i just kind of said something and people liked it and then he kept doubling down and so i didn't go into all this saying like oh i'm gonna come out and start wars with people and start all this beef it's just like now i don't have someone telling me to take the high road and i'm a little older and i'm a little more confident and i'm a little wiser and uh people are enjoying you know i i yeah i'll be honest like i've realized over time you know people want to know more about me they want to see me talk about myself it doesn't always have to be about the guests and all that stuff and that takes some time um you know to get used to because it's it's it's taught you know you're you're you're taught very early on in your career like it's not about you you're not the story but um yeah now i'm just having fun with it and yeah i'm a pro wrestling fan and i i like the the drama and all that stuff you could say what you will about all of it but at the end of the day none of it is fake none of it is a work i'm not looking for any of this i'm not trying to get paid off of any of this i'm not trying to do it for the views and all that i'm just tired of people talking [ __ ] about me and me having to eat it and so those days are over and i don't care who you are i'm going to clap back as they say and uh i think i'm pretty damn good at the promos and i may not be able to fight you and have no interest in fighting you but i think i could go toe-to-toe with you in a uh in a verbal war and so yeah and it feels good to stick up for yourself and this is why i was nervous to talk to you is because i i i fully believe that i i i first you uh you're sharp and you're not afraid so we're at the top of the hour um yeah i want to be respectful dude this has been badass i hope hopefully you don't talk too much about yourself like as a guest and i hope you've enjoyed this because i think i have enjoyed it i hope you guys have enjoyed it i hope you felt like this was worth your your while i appreciate all the questions about building the business and betting on yourself and um i'm learning a lot about that as well now you know with all this llc stuff that makes my head heard talking to my accountant but i would urge anyone out there who is passionate about what they do and who believes in what they do i don't have a lot of confidence like if you and i i bet you sam you and i go get a coffee right now nearby you are a much more confident person than i am you will walk up there and have your chest out and you and it's probably because you just sold your company for a few million and you're loving life and and life could be better i'm not i'm actually a very shy person a quiet person i keep to myself i had horrible social anxiety however when it comes to this stuff i believe in myself and i believe that no one can do it better than me and that sounds cocky but it took me a long time to actually be able to say that and so i'm really enjoying getting to do this stuff on my own and getting to do this stuff the way i want to do it without anyone telling me how to do it and i appreciate your interest in in my story and i appreciate you guys it's been a therapy session for all of us maybe a little bit well thursdays is my therapy day so uh i i you know i was gonna have actually my session i canceled it for you guys so i i'm doubling down here because we were supposed to i don't know if you guys know this we were supposed to do this last month and you stood me up and i'm just joking i'm not gonna go back there i hold on to things forever that's part of my home as well yeah i know i know i've listened to you long enough i know this but i love it i do you gotta charge more don't feel guilty about that that's what as your therapist today that's that would be my feedback because if you are the best you you deserve the best thank you i appreciate that in fact i don't know when this is coming out but i'll just say part of you know me trying to tinker with things i'm doing a thing for founding members of my sub stack um this evening i'll do it three more times over the course of the year where it's just the founding members the people who paid 180 to sign up so the sub stack is five dollars a month 50 a year or there's the founding member deal which is 180. um i picked 180 because the number 18 is a special number for jewish people um and i'm doing a super secret vvip one night only no holds barred zoom chat with uh the people who signed up where they can ask me whatever they want for an hour i'm gonna be there are you gonna be there yes well i appreciate you signing up yes but don't record this and take notes and post it to your millions of followers because it's supposed to be vvvp i'm going to spill all the tea release all the dirt on all the bad people out there but it's just for us our little group and there's not i don't honestly i'm kind of nervous that no one's going to show up so the f it might just be me and you sam just for the record i would love that come true as sam calls it yeah well thanks man this is badass hopefully uh you've enjoyed it uh this is awesome you got to come back again i would i would be happy to just don't you know stand me up next time yeah let go bro thanks guys [Music]

and he's like he's like you're afraid of me huh and i was like i was like yeah i'm afraid and he goes that's your truth huh i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like what's going on how was uh wednesday uh it was good man ramon was on so no you know ramon ramon is the best so ramon came on and did his thing he was the best good i'm uh i'm happy for him he's getting a bunch of wins right now and that makes me happy for him yeah uh you where were you so you were doing something interesting that's why let me tell you come back tell us the story yeah let me tell you what i did so i volunteer with this program called the last mile it was started by my friend chris redlitz chris started uh he did a bunch of stuff he was early at reebok so he's 65 years old he was an early employee at reebok when he probably became very financially successful there then he started a company that he took public and then he started a vc fund that i believe was quite successful they were in on wish.com and a few other things and he started this charity or nonprofit called the last mile and the whole vision behind this thing is basically um so i'm not supposed to use the word inmates they've asked me not to use the word inmates but sometimes i'm still going to use that word because that's what most people know what it means but basically prison inmates they are going to get out what do they want you to say well and it's a good it's a good terminology and good way of thinking but basically they're like well look we're trying to get them out of prison and into the mindset of they're going to be working and having a job we don't want to refer to them as offenders as inmates but students but um but that would be confusing in this context okay yeah in this context yes and so i'm gonna kind of go against his rules in this context so there's uh something like a million people in prison right and a lot of guys are there for 10 20 30 years for manslaughter for doing whatever they're going to get out and whether you like the whether you forgive them for their crime or not the fact is is that you they're going to get out and so the last mile is teaching them how to code for about two or three years through a program and then helping them get jobs at like slack i believe ebay things like that and they've graduated i think 800 people out of prison who went through the program and none of them have gone back to prison and i believe the average prison the average person who goes to prison i think it's like a 65 chance that they go back to prison right so the fact is that these guys like for example i was with this one guy who uh basically he caught his wife cheating and they got into an argument according to the news i googled it she like went to fight him with a hammer he grabbed the hammer and killed her and he was in prison for 20 years and i was hanging out with this guy which is weird that's weird you know that's like a mind [ __ ] and he was like yeah i'm gonna get out in three years uh prior to this i was an engineer or sorry i was a sales person at a pharmaceutical company i had a great job and i'm learning how to do javascript and mongodb so i can get a job at a tech company hopefully because no one's going to hire me unless i go through this program and that's crazy right isn't that weird like i'm hanging out and i was with my wife sarah we're walking around this prison just hanging out with these guys and i get to know them and i'm like i would hang i mean you're nice enough you're right you get along fine i had no idea you'd ever done this and they start opening up and telling me what they did and it's pretty amazing and it's amazing for a couple reasons the first reason is that um when you're in this like when you're so some guys are just like habitual criminals like i talked to this one guy i was like what was your job before this he was like oh i was a meth dealer right i stole meth and i killed the guy we went to rob this house and i killed someone and um and i would but and he was like besides killing them i was just like criminal i just did all types of crazy [ __ ] but once i learned how to do coding i actually got more logical where i realized that if i do this then this other thing is going to happen and so i started learning a lot about impulse control and i started learning about myself and so it's like learning how to code but also learning about yourself typing like an if then statement for your life yes and so that's quite fascinating the second thing is you know there's not a lot of black coders but unfortunately there's a lot of black folks in prison and so uh these guys are learning how to code we are with we're in indiana it was mostly white people but i've done this in san quentin but um like for someone who graduates and leaves jail and they go back to an all-black neighborhood a lot of times it's these these kids these young kids it's the first time they're gonna meet a programmer who's black and who looks like them and so not only are we helping these folks stay out of prison but it's kind of cool that like you know you're actually like helping the diversity issue in tech and so how the heck did this guy chris read let's start this that seems so random from like you know your employee at a reebok and then you start a vc fund and where did this come from i i believe the story is 10 years ago he was dating a woman and she volunteered at a prison and she was teaching i think math like she just got pulled into it at san quentin she lived in san francisco and someone was like hey we need like or no sorry uh someone was like chris can you come and talk about entrepreneurship to these inmates right and he was like i guess i'll go and he goes and they're like can you come again can you come again he's like uh i guess and then eventually he was like wow you know this is a major problem uh that i'm passionate and i care about and so him and his wife they started a thing where they go hey um they went to uh sacramento the the capital of california and they basically lobbied for this program they go hey everyone we'll put up the hundred thousand dollars uh you know they're talking to the politicians would it would be okay if we did a cohort for entrepreneurship in san quentin and they like through friends of friends they got in front of the right people and it approved and then they're like well you know entrepreneurship is okay but teaching them how to code is way better right and so he starts doing that and then he goes and convinces apple the i believe the trump the trump administration uh the koch brothers uh rich people to donate money and now they have this like huge program that's kind of amazing they've trained some huge number of people right like there are a lot of people in this program is that right yeah they've got i believe that they only allow like 20 or 30 people per like cohort and they have like 15 prisons doing it by the way if you're listening to this well they graduated i think a thousand people and i was gonna say by the way if you're listening to this i'm getting some of these numbers wrong um i didn't like write all this down so whatever i'm saying divide by two and multiply by two so i think they have like a thousand people but let me tell you something that's interesting so i was in this prison and you want to know what's crazy dude most everyone was really fat and out of shape and yeah as a fitness influencer you just you couldn't you couldn't help yourself well here's why this is interesting to me so i was talking to chris and i was like you know everyone was like fat and like the food that they give these folks it's horrible it was like white bread and bologna and like generic like oreo cookies and you could buy stuff but he was like yeah well you know at some of the longer maximum uh maximum security prisons they're a little bit more fit but yeah it's a huge problem and in china i was like chris like if we gave these guys like look there i understand like the idea of like you committed a crime you sacrifice privileges whatever but i think if we just gave them like some better meat and vegetables for every meal and forced them to exercise like you've got to get up at 7 a.m and as a prison we're gonna do jumping jacks push-ups calisthenics and like you know it's like the military i think they would behave better and ultimately like if your body works better you're gonna maybe behave and act a little bit better and he was like yeah you know i think i agree but even in american prisons you can't force people to do anything it's like against the law or against the rules but i started thinking about this and and i and i think that's kind of interesting and they do this in china and he was like yeah we uh we like got some we like saw chinese prisons and everyone shredded because they make you do this wow uh okay did you know i've done a very similar thing so i got a couple of uh like when you said you were doing this i i like remembered back when i did this so there's a group in the bay area that does this called the inside inside circle i think it's called and um nonprofit they basically go into it's like a men's group so for people who listen to this that don't know what a men's group is uh it's a idea that's been around for a long time there's many different flavors of this there's some that are like kind of business oriented there's some that are uh oriented around just changing your life i forgot what's the what's the famous one of the barrier that people think is a cult that's like a men's group uh i don't know if you know the name of it it's like a weekend it's like a weekend thing you do uh but there's a whole bunch of water or something yeah something like that uh not not that but there's something like that so anyways a men's group is where a bunch of men get together they sit in a circle and they talk about their feelings and they talk about what's going on and they and they have like a whole process that's like basically helps people unpack what's going on inside so that they when you unpack what's going on inside you're not carrying all this baggage around and then you you will act more like the way you want to act because you don't have this sort of suppressed and pent-up stuff inside that's my like layman's version of i'm sure there's a much fancier better way of explaining it so i went to folsom prison did the same same sort of thing two-day program you go in i met this guy gino he was kind of like you know you get a pen pal buddy basically so you know you meet your buddy and he was in there he's been in there since he was 18. and he had murdered somebody when he was 18 and he's like been in there for 20 years now so he's 38 and he was like you know yeah i did this horrible thing when i was 18 and like i'm in here for life basically like my whole life is basically in prison and uh he had a great great attitude about him funny guy and he was you know he was just it was kind of unreal um because i had been you know kind of embarrassed to admit it but i had been kind of uh you know in my head i just sort of wrote this off like i just wrote off people in prison like i think society writes them off and i had sort of just thought like yeah i'm not super interested in going in and meeting people who have murdered people before um but you know it's really not that simple once you meet them it's really not that simple um to sort of like bucket people like that as good and bad and so you know kind of you know it's kind of embarrassing to even say it out loud it sounds obvious but you know it was kind of a i don't know this kind of awakening moment and then we we did these exercises so we did these exercises where you're like you know you sit in your little group and you talk about what's going on and it's so funny because it was basically half successful tech guys and then half people from folsom prison and uh and they would be like you know the tech guy is like oh you know um you know just a stereotype for a second like my kids trying to get into this private school the admissions process my wife is really blah blah and then like the next guy who's like you know um i haven't seen my daughter in 25 years and i just hope she's okay and i heard something heard something happen to her and i'm not able to help and it's just gutting me and then the tech guy is like you know my company we raised our a we're just trying to raise our b like it was like it's so funny like real problems fake problems real problems fake problems and uh but like this is sort of like no judgment right that's the idea is like um actually it's funny the guys who lead you in there they're very like sort of wise people there there's one guy bj who runs the program and then uh i forgot the name of the other guy he's an awesome guy and he's like he's like recognized as a shaman in like seven different civilizations in africa like this guy is just a beast in all ways they in fact they call his nickname is beastmaster because he sort of is able to tame the beasts in the prison um and he's got this like presence about him that he wouldn't believe like imagine ray lewis he does volunteer he was in prison but he was in prison he got out and then he you know devoted his life to this work um and he's like sort of one of the most wise guys ever and he said this early on he's like uh you know let's set some ground rules before we go in here man like okay what are we and one guy was like you know no judgment i want to be going here i don't want to judge the guys in there he goes okay so we're going to lie to ourselves and he's like what what do you mean he's like he's like you're going to make a judgment uh when somebody says something or does something the brain is instantaneously going to make a judgment and you can sit there and say no no i'm not doing it i don't want to do it you can try to resist it but you're going to fail he goes instead let's just agree to this you'll make the judgment but just agree to this the judgment says more about you than it does about them he's like so just use that that reaction to teach you about yourself don't use it to define the other people in there that's something that i still use to this day kind of like in every every walk of life uh because it's it's so true um so anyways i had this like crazy experience in there so i was uh i was talking or i guess like i don't know if i should even tell the story but basically i when i went in there was one guy in there that just looked like the baddest dude in the prison he was wearing his sunglasses nobody else was wearing sunglasses he had like a cane he wasn't the strongest or the biggest but you could tell he had the respect of everybody in there and almost like the fear like a fear version of respect or at least that's what i perceived because you know you go into the situation you sort of quickly scope it out and you're trying to like understand the lay of the land and so instantaneously my brain's judgment was that's the baddest dude in here like don't piss that guy off don't say the wrong thing in front of that person uh he kind of scares me and of course as fate would have it we get into a group of four we get matched up and he's my buddy in the group of four and this guy basically i was you know so then you're supposed to like again talk about your problems and i was kind of conscious to be like okay i'm not gonna talk about these like first world problems so i tried to say some [ __ ] that was like deeper than that but he saw straight through it because these people have a very good you know [ __ ] detector and uh he was like he's like man you're just saying what we want to hear he just cut me off like two minutes in oh that's bad and i was in the middle of my big kind of like heartfelt thing and i'm a good talker i'm a good storyteller i'm a good liar frankly um and he immediately was like man don't come in here and just say what we want to hear and i was like oh [ __ ] and then i'm like my the guy i was already afraid of is now calling me out specifically for basically one of the worst things you could do in these situations which is be inauthentic and be fake it's like you didn't you really didn't have to do anything that was the one thing just don't be fake uh and i was i was being vague and this guy called me out on it he's like what you really thinking and i was like and i just said what was on my mind i go um i go i really just don't want to sound like an idiot in front of you and he starts laughing and he goes he goes you afraid of me i was like yeah i'm afraid hey i'm afraid here he goes so if i get closer you'll be afraid he gets closer closer he gets right up to my face like one inch from my face and he's like he's like you afraid of me huh and i was like i was like yeah i'm afraid and he goes that's your truth huh i go yeah he goes i go yeah i'm like in my head i'm like oh okay i think i did it right i just said well i was thinking of that i think you know and so then the brain the voice in my head that was like judging every word i was saying kind of like relaxed for a second because this guy put him at ease and he was like he's like he's like i can respect that and he's like uh and he's he starts telling a story about like his life when he was afraid and like you know i'm off the hook i go sit down now and uh and at the end the guy like you know basically gave me a hug on the way out and he was like you know uh he's like i hope i see you again sometime and i was like wow that was a just like a little life moment that it doesn't like i'm telling the story now i don't think this even means anything to anybody but i remember this like it like it happened yesterday and there's very few moments in my life that i can remember so vividly but this was one of them and i think it's because it was like a primal moment where i didn't know what was going to happen there was real fear you talk about this a lot like we're very rarely in real danger situations and even though this wasn't actual danger this guy wasn't gonna do anything to me it definitely felt that way and i remember it and the crazy part and we can move on for this but the crazy part is like i think what separates you and me or anyone listening to this podcast which by the way i learned well i'll talk about a second what separates us from someone like these folks like i met a bunch of people who were like habitual criminals they were like yeah you know i just like i was a drug addict or i was just i hated authority and i've changed but i was young and mean and i met a bunch of other people who work i met a guy who worked at abbott i met a guy who worked at ford i met a guy who as engineers like you know they're probably making six figures and they go my marriage went horrible one of us cheated and i got into a fist fight and i killed someone or i hurt someone really badly and i was like i don't think i'm ever gonna like hurt someone but i could like it's not like in a thing of rage like you could flip out or i could get drunk and kill someone and driving you know like you could and it's not that cr we're not that different some of these guys and so that was really crazy and while there so let's get we'll talk about business there's this there's these guys have like ipads they're not apple but they're like a different brand of like i ipad type like tablet okay and um you can be an approved podcast and so if we go through this the process of getting approved we can go in there and there's about and there's about a million incarcerated folks in america and there's not that many podcasts on this on this thing i was like oh i was like dude let's boost our numbers and so i'm working um with the right people there's like a company that makes these like amazing and and we're going to be called microsoft and it's a surface the microsoft manager system shambles as you keep calling it an ipad dude i looked it up on on wikipedia it's this company and they were they sold to a pe company for two billion dollars and they basically make things that the prison gives to right you know incarceration they can buy they can like buy movies and [ __ ] and uh you basically if you have enough money on your accounts you can watch movies your entire stay and so uh anyway it was kind of cool so that's my story i have a related thing do you know the guy mike posner of course the musician so he i know who he is yeah so he's like kind of like rapper singer type dude i i took a pill and ibiza that's like i took a pill at ibiza cooler than me he's got a couple big big big big songs he went to duke right he went to duke so he was there while i was there we were in the same year and uh and i remember meeting him or seeing him and he said this white kid he said he's gonna be a white kid from detroit who said he's gonna be a rapper i was like all right like eminem like you know that's who goes to duke yeah like you went to duke yeah that's not really the path my friend um but he killed it he did amazing and actually like one of the things i remember from that was he released his song on itunes u um because he was in school so he only somebody only a student or professor could put content on itunes u which was like the subsection of itunes and because most of the things that go up there are like extremely academic right this is like a lecture from this random biology class in at duke so now all of a sudden you get this like rap song that goes on itunes u and he hit the top of the charts on itunes u and he would tell so he put out there like yo i'm number one on itunes you know like parentheses yeah yeah and so that's how i think he got booked on at first that's how he got a lot of college it's like a growth hack like a lot of college students heard his song because itunes u had like uh like there was like the rankings it's like show the top 10 itunes songs which is super competitive you got to be like mega famous to do that and then right below it was top 10 itunes u downloads and his was number one and so i think he got a lot of fans that way and then he booked a bunch of early gigs when he had no name to say by saying yeah i'm number one on college campuses on itunes and they were like well okay that sounds decent all right well we'll give you a shot and that's and then he went on a college tour and that's how he built his following so he did a very similar thing to what you're talking about that's badass i i like him a lot so that's a good that's a good story it's like it's like bjork getting famous in iceland or something like it's better to be like have like a local maximum like to be famous on a local on a local level and then you leverage that well one more quick prison one before we switch off that so um so my buddy did my best friend trevor did this thing called a book storm which i think is a great idea in general which is he wanted to write a book and so he's like all right books normally take a long time what if i did it differently he's like so let me um he did like a quick not a draft but like just a quick like kind of concept of the book and then he flew out the five most badass people he knew and he put us all up in a hotel and he said i want you here for basically a day and a half to just help me think through this book and he's like we'll brainstorm it together and he's like i think if i just do this with deep intensity i can make way more progress than if i just kind of like lightly touch this book every day for like two years yeah for two years and it totally works name what's trevor's last name reagan uh r-a-g-a-n so he uh so he and now he has the book it's coming out it did like for what he called like a patio book it's like a podcast of the audi of the book or something like that so um anyways he flew out it was me because i was like his best friend from college and then it was like this person who was like the um the the olympic coach for the women's volleyball team and so the us u.s women's volleyball has just kicked ass internationally which is not expected because volleyball is a much bigger sport in other countries but this guy like turned the program around and like so he was amazing he was there and this one guy was there and he had been in prison for 20 years and he had gotten out and he trevor does a lot of uh pro bono like talking in prisons and so he had met this guy in the process and he was like wow this is this guy's amazing and this guy shared two things so i was like he came out and i was like man this guy's like he is so wise he is so articulate i feel like he's read every [ __ ] book because he keeps referencing really insightful pieces from all these different books and so i was like what's your story man he's like actually i was in prison for 20 years i was like whoa no [ __ ] and he goes you know i said so you read all these books while you're there he goes he goes yeah he goes my first year when i was there i was like i was 20 years old or something like that he's like i decided uh i'm gonna see what i want to see he goes so i i decided like you said they're calling they're called them students there hey that's what he did that's that's what he did for himself and his brain he goes i told myself i'm not in prison i'm in university he's like and every day i woke up i said i have i'm getting a 20-year phd in life he said every day i woke up and i just everybody around me in the line we're getting food out this is this is the student union i'm at the student union i'm getting food from the from the from the mule hall i'm going to the library i am in university right now i am not in prison he just literally like worked himself up into a frenzy where his mind only saw that and he saw everything as as university so he read all these different books and then similarly he said you know i would look around on the on the yard and on the yard you'd see all kinds of bad [ __ ] going on you know the black guys fighting the white guys and the mexican guys and all that and you'd see broken you know just broken down you know our basketball hoop was half crooked all that and he's like i just played a game every day in my mind i would change what i saw so i would see a beautiful green field i would see he's like every day he's like if i saw a broken glass i would see roses and this guy's mindset impressed me so much it's another one that stuck with me which was like create your own reality and like how many times if this guy could do that in prison then when i'm waiting in line at starbucks i'm not waiting in line bored i change it in my head just like the guy changed his university things that was another one that was like that's amazing a huge life thing that i took away from that guy dude i love this prison talk we we should i gotta we got i think we should do like an entire episode on this there's like all these guys who are blowing up on youtube who like are it's all about crime and and and prison talk and and whatnot and i learned so much from those folks do you watch these videos that's basically like a guy these are not insightful and deep but they're just entertaining to me have you seen these ones where guys will go they'll film around a police station and then the cop comes out and he's like hey why are you filming man what are you what are you doing here let me see your license let me see your id he's like nope i'm not going to show you my idea and he's like what he's like let me see your idea watch that [ __ ] all the time and he's like no i know my rights i'm in a public place i'm allowed to film he's like yeah but what are you doing here he's like do you not know the rights and they just like talk back to cops and there's something about this about just talking back to cops it's called justice porn and it's just exactly like it's just this porn that's what i call it it's like and the comments are super polarized half the people are like what an [ __ ] dude you're just making you're just being annoying to the cops they're like you're provoking them and then they take the bait and then you like jump on them with because you you why did you spend your day doing this and then the other half people are sort of like me and they're like god i don't know why i find this so entertaining i just love when somebody's like it's just like knows their [ __ ] accident yeah there's something to it man i can't i can't resist that's my joke that's my new reality tv yeah go to uh reddit.com justiceporn and there's a whole subreddit for that and there's like a million subscribers it's pretty crazy yeah it's not like there'll be a guy gets pulled over and he's like let me see your id and he shows him a password from another country and he's like uh no i need your id he's like no you don't there's a treaty that says if i show you this password blah blah blah and you cannot arrest me and he's like no some random ass like loophole and he's just driving around fast hoping to get pulled over just so he can do this thing on camera and get a bunch of views it's kind of sick but i like it speaking of other countries let me tell you about something interesting have you heard of prosper have you heard of prospero pera sounds very familiar what is it okay so i almost or i'm in the process and i hope i can make it happen of investing in this company called uh mini circle so prospero is this new like private charter city we've talked about private charter cities a bunch right okay and so it was set up in part by peter thiel who's a very controversial weirdo type of guy i like him but a lot of people don't um and so he basically set up this country or the city in honduras and they have their own rules and their own laws and weird things like that so do you know what gene therapy is have you heard of gene therapy yeah is it basically uh like is crit would crispr be part of gene therapy so it's basically the modification of your dna in order to like fight disease is that a good description yeah so it's this very experimental kind of technique kind of like medical procedure where basically you insert and modify genes in order to uh in order to replace surgeries or drugs so for example there was this kid in syria he had some weird disorder where like all this skin started deteriorating he was about to die and they did this gene editing stuff and he was able to regrow back his skin and a lot of people but it's very controversial because you're doing a couple things you're kind of like playing god which uh i don't buy in but that's an argument and also yeah and people don't like it and also it's experimental and so the fda like very closely monitors this stuff and they'll say like yeah and so there's and there's a lot of like weird like biohacker fringe types who are interested in this stuff and so it's all like controversial kind of but nonetheless it's cool so i'm trying to invest in this company called mini circle and they're making this new gene therapy that like increases muscle mass bone density helps you uh with insulin sensitivity and does all this like crazy [ __ ] to you but in order to get it done in america you got to go to the fda and it's like this big process and so they've moved their company to prospero this peter teal city in order to make all this [ __ ] happen and they're doing their existing floating city or just in honduras and so they're doing it like so basically they're like we're working with fully informed and trusted i'm reading off something we're working with fully informed and trusted study participants who are choosing to do this right but it we couldn't get this done in america it would take 40 years to do this we're going to do this on this lane on this weird city type of thing and i'm trying to invest in this company i think it's ridiculous i think it's crazy but kind of cool it is very cool i invested in one charter city called uh praxis and there what they did was pretty smart they were like they first created just a bunch of like um like a group here in america so they invited a bunch of cool people from new york la san francisco and they're just like host events so they'll throw dope parties so these people they're like in a community they get to meet each other at these events and there's like an online component and they keep doing this they keep doing this and meanwhile they're searching they're going around to like all around the world and they're basically negotiating with governments and they're saying hey give us some free land and let us have our own rule of law and rule of financial law um in like our own financial regulations and our own rule of law in this zone we're going to create a new city and we're going to bring all these people like cool people plus like development dollars to your place right so in the u.s you could never say hey us government go give us you know a little piece of wyoming they're not really going to give you that but um you know you go to whatever you know you go just in the mediterranean or the balkans and you find some random piece of land you say oh this is beautiful it's right on the ocean it's undeveloped and you go to the government you say look what if i could get a bunch of uh people from america you know successful people who want to kind of live in a new a new charter city and uh and so it's like really wild moonshot idea i totally fully expect this investment to go to zero i put in a very small check but i had to participate because the founder was so convinced that like yeah of course people will do this and uh and that if you did it it would be very large it'd be like owning the raw land you know you know the land under manhattan where all the buildings are going to get built and you can either do development yourself or you could sell off the pads and make a ton of money so the business is great if you can kick off a new charter city and one of the ways you attract people is this like if you own if you have your own rule of law you can say hey biohackers come here because you're allowed to do you know you're allowed to run your experiments here because we have our own kind of like free zone where we can do our own [ __ ] and so uh i think it's really cool what's happening biology is pretty convinced that in the next 10 years we're going to see charter cities uh you know pop-up startup cities yeah and on one hand to say to explain why this like why the haters exist on this um and why i i definitely hate on them a little bit or you know there's like some negativity which is like it's most likely like fringe libertarian types kind of like how all the bitcoin rich folks are going to puerto rico to avoid taxes you know you could say like the fda exists for a good reason rules exist for a good reason you guys are freaks just trying to like avoid the reality um and there's definitely a truth to that and there are like probably that's a solid argument some parts of that and then on the other side you can say well like that's like what the [ __ ] america started right yeah you know we bailed on we were we were the free experimentation zone right yeah like we rode a ship across like uh you know 3000 miles not knowing what to expect and we just landed and we figured it out so i think even the people who like startup cities would say yeah great there should be the fda there should be all this stuff for most people in most places but if it covers all all land and all people within a country then you stamp out the experiment wild experimentation so i know that google guys have been talking about this before which is that they need a there should be a free space where if you opt in you can go and you can do some of the experimental things that you can't do here and the learnings from that let's say nine out of the ten things don't work out or they have bad consequences okay fine but if one breakthrough innovation or um or discovery is made then that can be exported back to the mainland we can say look let's go let's take this through proper testing and let's roll it out to everybody so like you know people go to germany to go get you know stem cell treatments and things like that because it's not legal here but in other countries they're more liberal about it so like you know i started a company once a biotech company and the technology was made in the u.s the government us government had funded 40 million dollars of r d for this technology but you couldn't go use it in anywhere in the us because the like you would never get the permits the people would say why would we will not let you put these microbes into the ground it was basically these little micro bugs that could eat coal underground so you don't have to mine it and they would basically just like fart or breathe out natural gas so they will just mine the coal themselves and you just collect the natural gas you don't have to frack the earth and you don't have to mine the coal but the us would never let us pump these microbes into the ground because they're like we don't have to we're life is pretty good here we don't have to do that so we went to indonesia and we went to india where they were like yeah hey here's a huge plot of land how much money do you need to go do this we love this right we want economic activity we want innovation and if this works then we want to capture some of the upside of being able to like sell this technology to others and so we got quick permits in indonesia and india where we couldn't you know the company's trying to do the same thing in the us they were bogged down for years and never got approvals have you ever heard of medical tourism yeah i've always been curious about like how how people have the guts to do this but it makes sense you go to mexico and get your teeth fixed or whatever you know have you ever done anything like this no so for those who don't know what this is i learned about this because me and sean's buddy john howard you're friends with john howard yeah yeah he's great we i shared an office with him at this place called founders dojo and they created a company i forget the name of it but it was basically medical tourism so basically um i i think a a use case is typically like dentists or like veneers and teeth stuff although then there's other stuff like breast implants and uh plastic surgery where their premise was basically it's cheaper to get it done in bali or mexico or india somewhere like that where like they're i have no idea if this is true they're like the doctors are just as good but it's a fraction of the cost to fly out there get the surgery done and chill there for a week and recover and fly back the company did not work out and frankly in my opinion it sounds like a [ __ ] pain in the ass i would never do that i'd rather pay twenty thousand dollars in america for veneers but be able to get it done like three blocks from my house then i would want to go to mexico but well yeah it's not for you right it's for somebody who can't afford it here it's it's not if i could do this or that it's i can't do this and my teeth [ __ ] hurt i can't do this and i need this surgery done uh okay if i can't afford it here even with insurance then okay i'll go to mexico and i'll do it because i have no no real other option all right it's so prohibitively expensive it would [ __ ] me financially and i don't want to save my health and [ __ ] my finances so i'm going to do this there's i think it's a hundred billion dollars a year is paid off it's 100 billion of medical tourism per year globally that amazes me i never would have thought that i know i just think because it seems that's what i'm saying in the ass it seems wild right but i think that's the you know when people are pushed into a corner they will find a way you know that that is sort of the the innovation of people um and yeah i'm actually surprised this thing didn't work what he was doing was he was selling leads so he would find customers who were interested in it he would educate them and he would sell those leads to the off medical offices you know in mexico or wherever and say hey this person is interested they want to do a phone call with you would you pay us 100 for that lead and they were like yeah sure you know and i i honestly think that business should have worked and would have worked had he stuck with it it was like a pivot and maybe he didn't have enough time to figure it out yeah i don't i don't know the particulars but i know that it's when he told me about it i was like there's no way this would work but i say that about a lot of stuff yeah exactly all right what else you want to talk about i don't know what do you want to do uh let me look at your list here okay so there's uh julian building of ranch i think that's pretty cool and we should talk about that uh let's do julian building a ranch and then let's do uh let's do that okay i have a good deep dive but i'm gonna save it for the next episode that's a good one about the diamond industry all right lay the background of this so you know julian better than i do right yeah yeah so julian shapiro he's just at julian on twitter a lot of people follow him there i think he's got like you know 200 000 or maybe more followers he's a weirdo total weirdo in the best way possible um yeah he called me the other day and i said i go hello and he goes the love of my life like check my phone who the [ __ ] is calling me and then he's like i have this deal blah blah blah and then he you know just go straight into it doesn't even acknowledge the love of my life part uh it was just hilarious he's just a hilarious character he sends us like the funniest memes like on twitter he's like this really thoughtful intellectual like guy who'll teach you how to write and teach you about all this other stuff teach you how to think frameworks blah blah blah and then in our group chat he's sending you know the the goofiest memes which is uh like that's my favorite type of person who's got both of those sides to him the silly side and the smart side so he tweeted out that he's basically he's been talking about this for a while so it's not just like a [ __ ] thing but he's like he really really wants to build a ranch actually by the way i should share the most interesting thing about him for the last eight months all he has eaten is wag you steak and boiled eggs which i don't believe i believe it because he's crazy and he he kind of needed to i think he had something like his his gut health wasn't right and he just like took control he's like i'm gonna i'm gonna figure out how to fix this the doctor's not helping me i'm gonna fix this myself he had read about the carnivore diet i think jordan peterson had a very similar like kind of like issue and he famously came out so i did carnivor it healed me basically and so he started doing it he started feeling a little better then he committed to it he's like okay so he literally orders wagyu steak from these like farm from this one farm actually in particular and he orders like three thousand dollars a month of steak and he shows me his freezer his freezer is just full of bricks of steak like imagine like you know when you see in a movie piles of cash like just bound up thousands of cash it's that but with wagyu stakes and so he had like he said he said it was miserable for like six or eight weeks he was like i craved carbs i craved sugar and then he got six eight weeks into it and he's like i can't even imagine eating sugar carbs again i i don't crave them at all it sounds horrible but by the way that's a real thing from what i understand that there's basically in your microbiome in your gut there's all these uh you know basically there's bacteria that live there and the bacteria feed the different yeasts and bacterias feed off of uh different like substrate different different food and so the more you eat carbs so imagine if what you're putting in is carbs the bacteria that thrived off of let's call it meat are going to sort of die out and the bacteria that thrive on carbs are going to like proliferate they're going to spread they're going to multiply and they're going to um they're going to make up the majority of your gut and then if you decide to switch and go low carb all of a sudden those bacteria are going to say where the hell's our food and the in the craving you feel those carb cravings is not just like your mind being weak it's literally the gut bacteria that are signaling to your body we need our fix we need our [ __ ] we're gonna die dude what are you are you reading about body stuff now how do you know all this uh no well i heard this once i was fascinated by it and somebody had told me this and i looked into it because i was like is that [ __ ] and like i'll just say half the [ __ ] i read five years later turns out to be [ __ ] so like with health i feel like nobody knows anything but in hearing this i was like oh that makes total sense and that's how you get you know just like you get withdrawal pangs if you stop caffeine the same exact thing happens with carbs and when you know that that's what's happening you're like oh okay i just need to ride you [ __ ] out like i just need to keep i just need to hold you i'll starve you guys out and in seven days you'll be dead and the only bacteria left will be the ones that feed that like the stuff i i want to be eating so it's a total thing well okay so and back to julian and by the way that's always why i wanted to start my startup called hostage where we just like take you and uh throw you in this like like land and uh keep you in a cabin for like three weeks and just like monitor exactly a guaranteed weight loss program would you yes would you be interested in a 10-day program that would guarantee results i will i will pay you a hundred thousand dollars if you don't lose weight it sounds good we just give you 1400 calories a day welcome to hostage and yeah yeah yeah like would you like a glass of water uh like that's all that's all you get one of your top 10 ideas um so anyway so julian basically yeah he buys it and by the way the ranch thought he was a restaurant because he was ordering so much [ __ ] steak they were like well certainly you're a restaurant here's your like wholesale price break and it just turns out he's just a dude anyway so he really wants to build this ranch in the middle of nowhere because he's thinking about where do i want to live and then he tweeted out this thread that i love and just just search his name julian and i'm building a ranch in the middle of nature and basically he's like you know why am i doing this i want to leave san francisco i um you know i just think it would be amazing and he basically tweets out his plans he's like here's where i'm looking here's the land here's how much it cost i'm gonna build this like these like prefab homes i'm gonna build this podcast studio i'm gonna have like my blank you like this i know this is like right up your alley so what did you think about this okay so this is in my opinion very romanticized incredibly not practical and it won't work in most cases have you ever been uh you know you live and you lived in a city for a long time you now live in the burbs but it's still populated with people have you ever been by yourself for a while like in in uh rural areas shoot me yeah horrible it's fun for a minute it's great i was just in hawaii and it was like this is relaxing this is great i can't i think that you basically you want to do it to the point where you're like i felt the benefits and now i want to run back into society and tell everyone how awesome i am for doing this retreat from society yes and so like i'm reading the teddy roosevelt biography and he did the same thing so basically um his wife and mother died on the same day and it was tragic it was horrible and while she the wife died allison while giving birth to his daughter so like the most complicated day ever and he was like the light of my life is gone i cannot live anymore uh just life is done for me and so he went and he bailed and he lived in the badlands which is in the dakotas and he said i feel replenished i feel wonderful but you still gotta get he went eventually back to dc and or new york and became a politician and i think that i think what a lot of people overestimate is or rather underestimate is community so in order to make this work i think a few people can make this work but for nine out of ten folks you need peers you need family you need friends life is i don't give a [ __ ] if i live in the most beautiful place on earth if i don't have people that i can see on a regular basis who i love it's stupid i'd rather live poor and in a shack with people i love than in a mansion on a 50 50 acre 100 acre plot of land that's beautiful 100 agree i think um part of his plan is to basically have a bunch of basically guest house and make it an awesome ranch where he'll just have this rotation of kind of friends and cool people that want to come stay and i think that will i think that will happen uh but he's i think he's single so i don't think you know if i went out there with my wife my kids then i think i could last a lot longer than than if i went out there literally by myself um even just hoping kind of friends would come to visit so i think that is one thing and i think this is a great example of you want to have this dream but then i think you need to test it i think you need to go live i think he should stop right now he should go somewhere for one week and just say okay let me go test or two weeks let me go spend two weeks by myself in this airbnb in the middle of nowhere and let me just see how i feel after two weeks and then let me try that again and i know he's got the discipline because if you can eat steak only for you know steak and eggs only for props but like you don't want it to feel like an endurance contest if you're trying to choose your lifestyle you want it to be one that feels effortlessly awesome not like uh a a test of your mental fortitude i think so i think it's amazing i would love to go visit but i would not want to do this myself so i've actually like done this a bunch of times so there's a bunch of stuff that i wanted in my life and i was able to test it on a very small scale and i'll give you a few examples so for example um i wanted to retire and so i had the opportunity a couple years ago i took six weeks off right and i just took it off completely and by the fifth week i was like i can't retire i have to be around i have to have something to do another example is buying a fancy car you can go and test these cars for right it's a lot of money it's a thousand dollars a day but you could testing a 200 000 car for two days is might you you get into it you're like this ferrari is so small i cannot drive this up and down like a driveway it's just going to smack the ground and it's not fun yeah i'm stressed about this and the fun of having it versus the stress of having it is actually not a good trade now that i feel it i know it another example is having a 5 000 square foot home for the longest time i was like i want a 5 000 square foot house so i went and rented a 5 000 square foot house i spent a lot of money maybe i think i did it in new york i rented a 5 500 square foot house and it was like 13 000 for a month a lot of money no doubt about that but the house was way more expensive than that and i got in this house and i was like i i cannot imagine having to fix all this crap all the time this is exhausting i can't do this i don't want this or i'm i'm only using the living room the bedroom and this huge kitchen which i like i don't need these six other bedrooms and anyway i think that you could actually test a lot of stuff and more people should do that they should they you know 100 dude so i i okay i'm gonna rant for a second think about like in college right so i think there's this crazy thing in society which is like over commitment and over specialization without dabbling so like you're a freshman i remember at the end of my freshman year in college i had to commit to a major like dude i just figured out like where the hell the bathroom is i don't know what a major is i don't know what the other majors could be i know that if i don't commit i'm going to be falling behind and off track and i'm not going to have my credits on time and i'm not going to know what courses to take and i'm basically picking my career without ever even knowing what my career should be so forget what classes i'm going to like these my major sort of dictates what job i'm eligible for at the end and i think it's crazy and the same thing with people's you know like first job they just sort of pick a career track without dabbling and figuring out what they actually might like to do the like the idea of dating is amazing like my parents were arranged marriage so they you know they literally my mom read an ad in the newspaper for my dad which said like you know six feet tall which is a slight lie you know he's 5 10. uh you know indian um what else engineer degree and good family i was basically at the ad and she was like described like every indian american good enough good enough to marry uh let's let's meet and then they the parents met and they're like okay in this one tea we're having together this one coffee meeting we're having all right cool done deal uh see you the next time i see you will be at the wedding um and that's how they got married and like you know really shocker that you know these marriages aren't always the best and so that are they happy uh no most so i would say like indie marriages have like a very low divorce rate because like societally it's like like there's like a taboo against getting divorced so they just like even worse stay together unhappy is what most people do and then obviously some get divorced but like this arranged marriage ideas it's not great now the counterpoint would be you know i think in new york there's a 53 divorce rate also so you know maybe the whole dating thing doesn't work as well so that's that's a fair counterpoint but i would say this idea of dating of basically try before you buy is um is really important in life and like these tests that you've done for yourself are super important and i'm shocked more people don't do them i started doing them and i'm like wow that's way better than this like i'll just have this idea in my head and it'll get so real in my head and then when i finally do it i'm like oh [ __ ] that was underwhelming it's like couldn't i have just sampled this beforehand and known that and not have this idea like um uh what's an example uh like okay i'll give you an example on the plus side so example the plus so i hired a chef so i have a personal chef i wanted a personal chef for a really long time how much does that cost a month so um how much does it cost me a month it's about 3 400 a month uh 3 500 maybe uh 3500 that includes food that does not include the food no the food's on top uh that's just like the service the service of having a private chef in my house and uh by the way worth it amazing like you know uh fortunate to be able to afford it but like to me i don't have a fancy car i don't even have a fancy home but i got a housekeeper who comes you know three days a week and i got a private chef and to me that's like that's my version of luxury that's like you know that's my version of a lambo it's like a lifestyle so does this person tell me everything does this so i had a chef as well for a minute but it was a little bit different it was more like meal prep does this person come and i paid way less a fraction of that right um i'm in the bay area too so you know it's uh yeah but my guy came two days a week and they would meal prep for me and i didn't like it i ended up just not using them and i i made my own food so i tested so to do the sample idea i i first even got the idea because i got to sample it so my previous company monkey furnace you've been there before for lunch i think probably uh the the the investors behind us they were kind of like a billionaire family the the birch family they had a private chef in their home but you know they were out and about all day working or they'd be at the office so their chef would just come to the office and cook for all of us and so you know a company of like 20 people and he would cook this amazing spread and all of a sudden healthy food tasted good so immediately i was like holy [ __ ] this is kind of amazing i don't have to like go out figure out what to eat every day this guy just decides so that's one decision i don't make he cooks healthy food and it tastes like junk food all right that's like you know wow that's amazing if i just ate this for all my meals i'd be way healthier than just my lunch and so um so i got to sample it that told me i want this um and there's other things that i got to try you know when i was at their house or fancy parties that they throw or fancy cars that they have that you know i got to try and i was like i i don't care about this good i can scratch that off the list it's one less thing i want it's one less thing i care about and so that's just hanging out with them got me got me to try some things that i thought i was working for and figure out what i like and don't like so then i tried some meal prep people but what i figured out what i really like is somebody who comes i don't decide what to eat they know my they know my life they know what food i like they know what what health what level of healthiness i care about and they just come make it fresh on the spot because saying fresh food tastes way better than meal prep food and so she comes and she and then i also thought i also realized oh this is not just about my health like one of the most time-consuming parts of being a parent is constantly trying to feed your kid like my kid's like a picky eater and so she uh you know like i'm making like three dishes for her every meal just trying to get her to eat something that she likes and that just takes up more time than even cooking for myself did so the chef cooks for me my wife who's vegan and uh our our baby and so our baby now eats like way better than when we were just you know let's make some mac and cheese let's warm something up and um and it makes it fun to feed five days a week so i was tired so she so right now she's coming three days a week uh so she comes every other day basically and then on the weekends we want to eat out so we'd like to go to restaurants or whatever so we said don't come on the weekends and uh we may move it up to five days at some point but right now it's good basically and it's little things like uh here's a green smoothie she makes every you know so in between meals instead of a snack it's she's like oh you want your smoothie i'm like oh yeah i do want that smoothie thank you have you lost weight uh i think so i don't really weigh myself but in the mirror i look like you lost weight i look better and i don't know if my weight has changed i don't i don't use the scale but i just use the mirror as the scale and so often does your cleaner come three days a week also and how much do you pay for that 160 bucks per visit i think damn dude do you spend a lot of money on these things i mean i spend a lot of money on happiness they make me extremely happy to do it but they make like that the feeling after the cleaners are here is like you know that's like a high for me that's like i did it i don't know what molly is but that's molly for me i feel so good in my own home it's amazing having food having fresh healthy food made i think that's that's a a treat that's an absolute treat for me i uh i'm perfectly happy with we have a cleaner who comes every two weeks and i think we spend 120 or 100 i don't remember but i'm also messy as [ __ ] and i have kids and they're messy as [ __ ] so like you know how the house gets destroyed uh you know my sister cleans i think four times a day in her house she's putting putting toys away every you know every four hours basically so it's crazy uh but i don't know if people care about this but i guess my my the point i'm trying to make is i think samuel this episode is already like totally ranked the world's gonna i think sampling your lifestyle is super important i'll give you one more story here that that helps so um you know that uh i did a podcast from vegas i said i was at somebody's home uh you know 15 000 square feet yeah uh i don't even know how many it's like ten ten to fifteen thousand square feet just it looks like a hotel basically and uh unbelievable they they have a they have a lambo and a ferrari and a monster truck and like all this other cool [ __ ] they have all the toys there's a batting cage in the backyard there's a you know like infinity pool that looks over the city you know you can see the strip there's like everything you would want in a home they got it elevator all the crazy [ __ ] um and uh and so anyways when i was there i had this feeling that i don't like that i've thought i had slayed this feeling but nope it came back and it was like kind of like jealousy it was like i was and the way i knew it was because i was like kind of poo pooing like oh i don't need all this i'm happy without all this and i was kind of like in my head trying to like almost say why i didn't want these things because actually i felt bad that i didn't have all these things like this weird psychology thing but the simple way of explaining it was like i felt these like little hunger pangs of envy of like oh i want that um and i was like oh that's not a good feeling and the shift i made was uh instead of feeling like oh you know these are things that i don't have but they have right like it's nothing wrong with them but just i don't have these things and other people have them um instead i looked at it differently i was like uh by the the third day there i i was like i gotta shift my mindset i'm not trying to have this jealousy feeling in my my day is not a cool feeling for me so i was like all right what am i gonna shift it to and i said oh how about i look at this like like i'm at i'm getting a sample platter here so these are things i can have these are things i can have in the next few years you know things go right in my business i can afford all these things so why don't i feel like what it feels like to wake up in a mansion like this why don't i feel like what it's like to to have a basketball court in a batting cage you know built into the home why don't i feel what it's like to drive this car and oh now i'm all of a sudden feeling excited what do i get to try today that's like you know i get to go try on something that i might have in the future did you did you drive this ferrari yeah so i get to test drive the stuff and feel like what like you know what does it feel like you like it no for me cars are stressful uh like i i don't like fancy cars they're very stressful to me and they're kind of like uncomfortable like i don't really get off on it there's probably a version of a car that i like but not the like supercars basically supercars are not something i want and so i got to figure out what do i not want and then oh actually this feels really good it feels really good to have you know this home gym built into my home so okay you know why don't i do that and you know why don't i why don't i go for that then so i think that sampling is not only just an effective way to figure out what you want it's also a cure for jealousy because when you're in those situations where you're jealous switch it to thinking of it like i'm just getting to try before i buy before i have all these things i get to sample them and figure out what exact flavor of this i'm gonna want and then it becomes yours instead of feeling like it's theirs and you don't have it i have that feeling with um so we had this guy on the podcast a while ago we should have him back on again his name is nick bear b-a-r-e nick bear he runs um bear performance nutrition or some bpm and a big youtube channel right and a huge youtube channel this guy came out with us he came out with this his content production is so freaking good so he's got this supplement business that does like 20 or 30 million in revenue a lot but when we had him on it was like 6 million in revenue or something like that it wasn't like it was good but it wasn't significant and he created this youtube channel he's like good looking like yolk like he's a massive dude but he so he lifts weights and he's this muscle head but he's really cool and now he's into endurance sports and so on his youtube channel which now when we had him on i think it had like 200 000 subscribers now it's getting close to a million seven eight hundred thousand he did this thing he's got this whole team behind his his youtube channel he's got like three or four guys working full time on it he released a 45 minute documentary about him running the leadville 100 the leadville 100 is a hundred mile race through the mountains of leadville colorado and you basically i it looked like it was like laps or something of like 15 or 20 miles and he had these guys at checkpoints to film him and i was watching this guy it was the most inspirational [ __ ] i've ever seen i'm gonna go and buy like i don't even know what bear nutrition sells because whenever i buy whey protein i just go to whole foods and i just buy like you know like uh or an amazon i'm purposely going to go out of my way to buy his stuff have you been paying attention to nick bear i don't he doesn't show up on my youtube feed i need to subscribe so it starts to show up in my feed dude you got to watch this guy it is the crate so he's ex-military you're the only fitness influencer i watch we can talk about that in a second but he this he's inspired me to like take it to the gym yeah he is so crazy this guy is nuts like he has a video of him like dead lifting 550 pounds which is a [ __ ] ton of weight and then he goes and he runs a marathon in like 2 hours and 55 minutes which is very very fast and he's the biggest guy doing it it's very interesting so i've been watching this guy and i have this like pretty big sense of jealousy where i'm like i want to be doing that and uh so that's why i'm doing this little fitness influencer [ __ ] now and it's kind of a joke but not really a joke and to be honest it's so fun dude you totally have to do this it 100 makes you accountable and makes you exercise harder yeah i love it i have to so i sampled your gym so i went to your house sampled your jam i was like wow amazing and then i called you the other day i was like yo what are you using for the flooring what are you doing for this what are you doing for that give me the give me the the the blueprint because i'm turning my garage into your garage i'm like that is a great that was such an amazing feeling to work out there i want to have that feeling on a daily basis so dude it's way cheaper than you think i know i didn't even take it's not even a lot of money but it's more like it's more of having the clear vision of what you want and seeing yours was like oh now i know what i like and i just have some addition some modifications i'm like oh my daughter who's two she loves to come out when i'm working out and she loves to work out with me side by side which is just like she just wants to be she wants to do little things next to me so we're creating a little workout play pen where she can go in there with little foam weights and do her thing while i'm doing mine so i'm like okay i'm going to craft this lifestyle to be what i want and um and so like you know that there's something to this sampling and i really encourage people to find a way to sample it if you want to know what kind of home you want go airbnb something before i did this chef thing i hired a chef for one meal to cook like a kind of a dinner for like i had some friends in town he's like oh let me hire somebody off craigslist just to make one meal like i don't want to deal with we can go out to eat but wouldn't it be cool if a chef came to our house and did it and like the cost is about the same of you know taking my friends out to a restaurant so let me just do that at home it was amazing and so uh having that chef at the at the home was like a good way to test these things and so that's my kind of challenge to anybody who has made it through this random episode which is like think about the [ __ ] that you have been telling yourself you want and figure out a way to go sample it like in the next week go rent the car go hang out at someone's house go shadow a ceo go you know hire the chef for the day do do like the sample of it and figure out does it make you want it 10 times more or 10 times less because usually that's the reaction i have when i when i feel it for the first time real is i want it way more or way less i'm curious if people are gonna like this rambling um i like this stuff but i don't know i wonder what what people will enjoy because i could talk about this [ __ ] all day i like this this fitness crap this building the life that you want crap i love this stuff ben chime in here what do you what do you think ben um i can only speak from like my perspective which is uh i'm really into the charter city stuff so that like i really liked that and the prison stuff i think is gonna be interesting to anyone so it worked for me and teddy roosevelt i mean come on you knew that would be are you gonna do dude teddy roosevelt is the most prolific person i have ever read about i've read maybe over 100 biographies he is likely the most active person have ever read uh he has done so much amazing stuff this guy's a freak teddy roosevelt's a fan where is it where is the how to take over the world episode on teddy roosevelt of uh i would say of the people that that people bring up that they want me to do teddy roosevelt is probably number two uh genghis khan probably number one that people mention and teddy russell number two so it'll dude roosevelt is like he's different than napoleon like napoleon did a lot but roosevelt is far more eclectic he like before he was even in politics when he was 21 he wrote a book on the spanish-american war and it was considered a textbook for decades um and then he wrote a couple more books he uh uh became um uh president obviously that's amazing he um was like this avid hunter and this zoo zoo what is it when you collect animals and like uh describe like the where they come from and things like that like darwin [ __ ] he did that type of crap before he was like in his 30s very prolific very interesting person you got to read about uh teddy roosevelt very intriguing what book are you reading the rise of ted of teddy roosevelt i think there's like three of them because i know of them there's one that came out fairly recently is really popular now about his trip to the amazon um later in life and that was amazing the guy was ridiculous he also has this book that i'm thinking about reading this title is beautiful it's called a strenuous life and so he had this phrase where he was like so roosevelt would like even when he was president every morning he would box like fight box like spar he loved and he was like it's our like we have to live the strenuous life where we put in effort physical effort and we get hurt sometimes and we struggle he's like you we have to do that otherwise you're never going to feel like a man or or a human being and so i've been very inspired by teddy roosevelt very interesting person that's funny you know i'm listen ben i'm listening to the vladimir putin episodes that you did on the on how to take over the world and uh i'm only i'm on part one and uh i love that he was like the opposite of what you described because when sam describes these people it's like holy [ __ ] these are just like another species it's like a guy who's done this and this and this and this all before the age of 30. and the best part about the putin thing was you're like up until 30 he basically had a very sort of like average average life there's nothing remarkable that would tell you that this guy's about to become what putin ended up becoming it was like little hints little signs a couple moments but you know by and large it was like you know mediocre mediocre student you know kind of like low level low level uh you know spy not not you know put in this like random random office not in the high highest level and then that was all until 30 and then i'm guessing because i haven't listened to part two yet but i'm guessing that obviously it's gonna turn up and he's gonna end up you know becoming the leader leader of the country but it was so crazy to me that he was unremarkable essentially until 30. was that surprising to you yeah and the the moment that you're talking about is like he was kind of like a mid-level operative in st petersburg and i think the guy that he worked for lost an election so he's like out of a job and he was gonna go just like start a judo gym in st petersburg russia yeah because he's like pretty good he sounded like just like he's from the office he's like in scranton he's just a mid-level he's assistant to the regional manager and then somehow becomes you know it's like if dwight became elon musk that's sort of like what happened with putin mid-level officer to like you know president do you think ben that he is actually the richest person in the world um [Music] no i don't in so far as like do i actually think he has like whatever a 100 billion dollars in secret accounts probably not but it's like it kind of doesn't matter because he has access to as much money as he wants whenever he wants yeah yeah yeah so he probably just doesn't have to he like doesn't have to move all that money to his account does that mean he scares me man so rich he doesn't need it in his account he freaks me out man putin scares the [ __ ] out of me sam have you listened to this episode of the putin one there's a there's no i i i dude i i fear him and so i've been nervous to listen to it there's a line at the beginning that i love those like it's like this little little anecdote it's like he was kind of like not a great student in school um and just like wasn't very interesting he's like he's the teacher's like he's smart but he's not that interested in school and so the teacher tells his dad like you know he's not living up to he's not living up to his potential and the dad like as just like as a russian dad would it's like most most russian [ __ ] ever he goes so what do i kill him or what do i do that was the response so what should i do kill him i was like wow the most russian thing ever dude he's freaked me out man a lot of the russians scare me that's kind of like why i like khabib and the ufc's because the russians like freak me out they're on another level they're on another level there's levels to it let's just put it this way on one level i've never seen a russian doing a podcast russians don't do podcasts right they live a harder life than us they're doing more and more tough [ __ ] than than sitting in front of a microphone dude i've never even seen a russian smile like they don't like they don't i think i'm almost positive they like smiling and rushing those weaknesses if you saw a russian and he winked at you what would happen in your body there's this comedian who like talks about like he's like you know like one time i was going to this bad neighborhood and um i was nervous and i wr and he was this guy's a white guy and i was nervous and and he goes someone came up to me talked to me and asked me like a question that i thought that they were just like trying to like trick me into like uh you know testing me to see where you know if they're gonna rob me or not and he goes immediately i just spoke at a russian accent and immediately they were afraid afraid of me and walked away and he's like this is my defense mechanism he just says uh dude of course i know like are you in this like horrible rush like do i know where i am of course do you like he like says this like scary thing to this guy and he like walks away from him entirely and that's the defense mechanism from now on it's just speaking of russian accent that's amazing if i do that in indian accent i just get beat up on the spot so it doesn't work the same um all right we should wrap it up i just i was going to say something i was going to stick up for the russians a little bit i visited russia with uh with my wife she speaks a little bit of russian and um my experience was like they're they are very much like that like they're kind of gruff and like a little scary whatever but there were a couple times where like um like my phone wasn't working and like we needed to get to the train station in an hour or else like we were gonna miss our flight and everything go wrong and like people were more willing to go out of their way and like literally walk with us for like five blocks make sure we found the exact right spot than anywhere else i've ever been so it's like they have this very tough exterior but once you get past it they're like and obviously we're joking if you are russian we have love for you but we're i thought we were complimenting the whole time i was saying don't poison sam don't feel sad i was saying how badass they are everything i said i stand behind as a compliment uh you know even just the cities dude st petersburg do we have anything on the level of the word moscow saint peter's these just sound tougher than american cities right like whenever i hear the word the kremlin or kremlin i'm like i freak out yeah exactly kremlin scary words bro we have like tampa bay it's this is not comparable what we have you know it's just they're on another level of toughness like denver can you imagine just put it just put denver up against moscow america america is just not where it's at all right i gotta go i'm just before i get canceled for for praising the russians [Music] you
