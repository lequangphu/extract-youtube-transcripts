dude a freaking plug-in who would have thought and he kind of had like a funny [ __ ] eating grin on and i was like how big are you guys he was like we do over a hundred million dollars a year in sales and i was like would you ever believe it he was like yeah i thought it could be done and then and then i go you just raise money he goes yeah we raised 100 million the other day i go why he goes because it's a north of a billion dollar evaluation i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want what's up everybody we just recorded the pod we talked about uh i was on cnbc today so we talked about going on tv going on cnbc we talked about a bunch of business ideas that are chrome extensions which is kind of like a niche that nobody really talks about but sam's super into it and uh he brought the fire and then at the end we shoot the [ __ ] about a bunch of random things in maybe the last 10 minutes uh talking about you know some of the stuff from the michael saylor episode and uh and some cool stuff we have going on we just shoot the [ __ ] at the end that might have been the best part so stick around for that last 10 minutes of the pod all right enjoy all right great what's going on um congratulations um do you want to talk about family stuff or no uh yeah sure had a kid uh four or five days four days ago i think now congratulations what are the details uh but baby boy is here his name is banks and uh banks why banks uh i don't know we thought of the name a lot when we were trying to name my first kid and we her name's blush and so i just thought banks and blush go well together um i don't know i just thought it was a cool name wanted to do something cool name it's a cool name it's just a unique name so i was wondering if there's a reason yeah at least this one is a name uh the first one when we named her blush we googled like oh blush name meaning and there's literally like it's like that that's not a name bro so what is banks um banks is popular last name and because of that some people started doing it as a first name um hillary duff's kid his name banks i know that uh that's pretty much the extent of the popularity of it i don't really care to pick a popular name i'd rather pick a unique name um but i could tell like when we tell our family they're like what uh is their nickname what are we gonna do with this no banks is good my nephews are named avit like the ava brothers and jude like hey jude and then now they have a girl named billy so i'm team odd names there you go i know we can't all be sam's right [Laughter] or well people call you shen yeah um there's people that just straight call me shane and they just keep calling me that and i just am not correcting them and i've just now it's like we're years into the relationship it's like vendors that i work with um well congratulations so you're a year and a half older than me i am i'm 31 i for the longest time i was like i'm going to wait to have kids but then a few things happened the first so my wife sarah's 28. the first is that um a few of my friends one of them is 39 and um i think your wife's older than you right yeah by a year so like early mid 30s and and then a few of my friends are late 30s and these women are having kids and they're like oh my god it sucks so bad i wish i would have done it when i was younger right so i've changed my i've like i've thought about having wait the guy is saying that or the woman no the woman well the guys are like it's definitely harder to parent when you're in your 40s than when you're younger but mainly for the woman they're like just harder on the body and second i had a friend and he was like dude have a kid now i was like why like i want to have all this freedom he goes it's way different once i had a kid i realized the later that i had it the less years i'm gonna be able to spend with him and now i'm just gonna die sooner and i wish i would have had 10 more years and done it at 25 than 35 and i was like oh that's an interesting perspective so my opinion has been changing lately i might have a child soon but we're still deciding yeah and by the way before we get to the first idea congratulations on cnbc you were on there today did anyone reach out to you and because they saw you uh not really only people who knew me already you know like my mom was probably the most excited you know basically like people who are 30 years older than me were like this is amazing cnbc this is the [ __ ] i was on cnbc for two and a half minutes or three minutes or something like that and so but nobody you know like i don't know if i go tweet something i'll get a lot more messages than uh than going on tv which is weird but it definitely was a cool feeling and like i don't know it's like one of those things that like i woke up before my alarm clock because i was like okay today is a good day today's a big day i got something to do today that i've never done before these these broadcast networks like you think they're huge and they are huge and they have reach and all that but like the average viewers is only like 200 000 people at a time it's not uh it's not like crazy high in the world of social media yeah even the big ones that are like half a million or a million viewers they are it's like it's kind of like a background thing so and you only get so little time to talk that even if there was a much bigger audience it's hard to get like it's hard to really make any headway in a three-minute segment um yes so like it's i it's prestigious but it's definitely not nearly as impactful as just the actual tweet that you're coming on to talk about it was right or this podcast right more people will listen to this podcast and i'll get more mileage out of this it just doesn't have the same it doesn't feel the same it doesn't get the juices flowing in the same way that being on cnbc does but i also say this this is what i think is more interesting for anybody who's ever done this um have you ever gone on it's such a weird experience have you ever gone on a tv thing so you get you get connected in and it's like a zoom call basically right now um and you can't see them so on tv it looks like you're all like split screen like you see your face their face another person but in reality you have no you there's no facial expressions because you can't see each other's video so you're only hearing each other you don't know when when it's your turn to talk and then the thing i screwed up because i was like i was going on this checklist of like worry it's like okay is my home internet going to be good all right is my you know is my hair gonna look stupid am i gonna say something stupid am i gonna and then like it's never like the things you expect it's always something else so as soon as it started i was like like 10 seconds in you look if you watch the video my eyes are like darting around everywhere because i have nothing to look at they're not on video and so i'm just like looking around my stupid like home studio garage thing and i look like it like i look like a suspicious character because my eyes are so shifty and then like 30 seconds and i realized oh [ __ ] i need to be staring at this camera because that's what will look normal and so that was like a weird thing i did uh and the other thing was i said kim kardashian's butt and i said i know i thought that was funny balls and stuff so i said some stuff maybe i wasn't supposed to say no they kim k you're it was good you you were a good interview it was great uh i watched the whole thing it was good thank you um all right you want to talk about the first idea yeah let's do it you want to do uh this thing toucan yes okay so i um along with joe spizer we i'm kind of following in your footsteps a little bit we created this thing hamptonvc.com um and we're just investing we're just investing in companies again i grew up in a bad neighborhood on the street called hampton and joe is wealthy and has a house in the hamptons all right we were thinking about names and i was like uh i grew up on this street called hampton you live in the hamptons it's just money or it's a fund we're mostly our my own money but uh him and i uh joe's an investor in your thing yeah and he would like man i want to put even more money and he goes you just want to invest with me i go yeah sure and then he's like you want to do a rolling phone i was like no that sounds like a lot of work yeah uh he's like you want to do a syndicate and you can just pick some deals like okay cool i'll do it with you right so it's just like a deal by deal basis so we created an angelus syndicate which so then basically whenever whenever you invest in something sean you got you have to tell me and then i'll invest yeah dude i have a bunch um also i heard this great description of angel list which is like it's sub stack for vcs um which is like the easiest way to kind of like spin up a little investment fund uh the same way right right lets you spin up a little newsletter it's awesome so yeah we did it and like so we i found a company already um and we invest and i was just gonna invest like i was gonna do like maybe 10 to 50 deals using my own money a year of like ranging from really low to 5 000 all the way up to 25 000 yeah i was just gonna do a ton of stuff but all low prices and um he was like why don't you just do the syndicate thing i was like all right let's try it so doing that but can i tell you about the first company that we we uh are about to finish with so i know i know about this company but give the give the what is your kind of like two sentence description of it it's called toucan and it's basically the really dumbed down version is it's like duolingo which is a language learning website but it's a chrome plugin and it changes a handful of words of every article that you're reading into the language that you want to learn so it's contextual learning um more complicated than that but that's the simple version right yes exactly so it helps you learn a new language without the effort i would say it's kind of genius honestly the founder what's your name taylor something she's magical she's great she's been a fan of the podcast actually she messaged us a long time ago like before this fundraise uh being like hey the pod is cool check out what i'm doing or maybe i did she really oh i can't believe i missed it and so i um so i've been following it since then i kind of thought about investing i didn't pull the trigger maybe i should have um but i thought the idea is kind of genius because the biggest it's okay so here's my thing um anything that there's a lot of these things that people want to do you want to work out you want to learn a new language you want to like become blah blah blah you have all these kind of like i should i should i should and you as as tony robbins calls it you should all over yourselves because you're just not doing the thing and the biggest friction is not that it's that hard to learn a language it's hard to make the time to like sit down open the book or download the app open the app and focus and just do duolingo for 30 minutes a day it doesn't sound that hard but in practice it's like it's a separate thing to do what i think is super smart about what toucan is doing is you don't have to make it a separate thing it's like you're already just browsing the internet so why don't we just let this thing automatically shift a few words on every web page you're visiting so you're not you don't have to go to start a separate activity to learn the language you'll learn the language in bits and pieces while you're browsing so i thought that was actually like pretty goddamn genius to be honest and um and you also like the space of chrome extension you kind of tip me off on the power of chrome extension so actually i don't even know why i didn't invest it seems like a great idea maybe maybe i'll hit her up after this and see if i can get in have you talked yeah do it if you don't know her well i can try to introduce you and you can just do it directly with her but this woman's a superstar i met with her and like within five minutes i was like oh well you're gonna be the ceo of a billion dollar company like oh really okay i hope it's this one but like she was just so put together she was so poised she was charismatic she it just she just oozed ceo um interesting i've never heard you say that who else have you felt that about if there's does anyone come to mind um the guy from superhuman whenever i heard him talk i was like oh yeah like you are uh some you i would bet on you for just about anything yeah whatever he was gonna do if he said i'm gonna write a book i'd be like oh it's gonna be great yeah i was like you know what i'm pretty sure you're gonna be successful yeah so i felt that about him um when we met with the shopify guy harvey or harley harley uh i kind of but obviously he's already hugely successful but like there's a handful of people we've interviewed when he came in he just had camera quality like nobody's business and so he just had this good looking guy in this great looking office with an incredible camera and i feel like you know he couldn't he didn't even say a word i was like oh wow this guy's like a power player yeah and so this woman i felt that with her i was like oh you she just she just was on top of it i just felt great another person and this is a little bit early on in their experience was this woman named pay y'all i think that's her name who started class pass pal pyle uh when i talked to her i was like oh you're really special uh so uh anyway this woman taylor met with her i was like oh you're i'm whatever yeah sounds good i'm in no matter what um and so but i started like also i mean let's we'll just we'll move on past two can but it's joinedtoucan.com the reason it's interesting is they have this like heads she worked at headspace so they have this like headspace cute branding [ __ ] right um by the way we should say toucan is like the bird toucan sam type of thing it's it's not yeah it's spelled like that t-o-u-c-a-n yeah toucan um which i don't know do those birds like speak or something i don't know maybe maybe that might be it yeah so so do you have any kind of stats you could share about them like give us a sense of why you feel like this is working uh i didn't ask her for permission to ask to talk about that but basically duolingo does like 200 million dollars a year in sales and has like i think 5 million users or 10 million users or something like ridiculously high and i just thought that and what i want to talk about in this segment is chrome plugins and i'm like well this company duolingo is very successful it's a 5 billion dollar company i think um i i've been thinking about chrome plugins what i think is like do two things one look at successful companies already that do over 100 million in sales and just say well how can i just create this in the form of a google plugin or two which behaviors do people want but they don't do it because there's a little bit of friction and how can i use this plug-in to alleviate that friction right now there's a ton of downside with google plugins you know you're a google plugin so google can ruin you but it's incredibly incredibly incredibly interesting to me and that's what i wanted to bring up was some google plugin stuff and so basically what this i don't know if this is how she did it but she basically um uh or the way that i look at it is you just look at what is what what behaviors are people already doing so for example learning a language people already want to learn a language you just change the text of the article to a different language or at least parts of it grammarly did this with grammar so you just fix it as you write uh one that i use all the time is similar web so it tells me the traffic of someone's website uh passwords you use passwords on a regular basis so a plugin just inserts different passwords and loom is another one have you heard of loom oh yeah my buddy was with the guy who started it isn't that worth like a billion dollars uh not yet but getting close it's several hundred millions i think it was the last round and all it does is uh screen record recordings yeah so so they basically say oh you want to show something on your screen here's a click boom record share um so the two famous ones that everybody kind of has heard about is honey because honey sold to paypal for several four billion four billion dollars so honey had i think 17 million users when they sold and what honey does is if you're about to go check out on some website honey will go in the background it's looking for is there is there a deal on this is there a coupon for this or a sale for this somewhere else or a coupon you can use right now and its surface is a discount okay that makes total sense i don't have to take an action i have to remember to go look for a coupon it's just gonna do it and it's the honey sign just glows whenever it has a discount available for you so that was one grammarly was another that i think shocks people because grammarly does over 100 million dollars a year so the grammarly founder spoke at hustlecon and he's an engineer he's like a very um by the book like straight shooter engineer he's really cool his name's max and i was like shooting the [ __ ] with them and i was like dude a freaking plug-in who would have thought and he kind of had like a funny [ __ ] eating grin on and i was like how big are you guys he was like we do over a hundred million dollars a year in sales and i was like would you ever believe it he was like yeah i thought it could be done and then and then i go you just raise money he goes yeah we raised 100 million the other day i go why he goes because it was at a one north of a billion dollar valuation yeah i was like oh my god you pulled it off yeah they did it exactly um so those are like the big successors but there are some other ones right so we have pinterest was started as i believe a chrome chrome extension so it was uh the pin the pin button that basically was able to get all the content for pinterest to be a cool app uh you needed a quick way to pin while you were surfing the web so that was one and then there's others that like like for example if i look at the plugins that i have installed i have adblock or you know ublock origin or whatever that's definitely one of them and so i think i think this was one of those non-obvious ideas because it kind of feels like not a serious company it's like dude you're just making this like plug-in and definitely there's a lot of people like my mom doesn't know what chrome extensions are she doesn't know there's a chrome extension store she doesn't really know how to install them like she knows apps but she doesn't know chrome stuff so you're gonna get a little bit more of a tech savvy audience you know it's a smaller market overall but the first one is a big deal i actually want to change your opinion of that so i went and looked at the numbers there's 1.6 billion iphone users okay 1.6 billion users 2 million iphone apps in the store right now chrome users 3 billion chrome users 200 000 plug-ins there's a ton of opportunity here i hear you that like your mom doesn't know how to do this but does your mom if she saw a commercial on tv for grammarly i bet you she would know what to do you just go to grammarly.com actually she does grammarly because of that um she saw it and she's self-conscious about her english because she learned english later in life and she like doesn't want to write something stupid so she downloaded grammarly for that reason actually and so that's why when i saw this toucan thing i was like oh you guys just run a commercial for this on tv that's easy you're going to get so many users and the the plug-in the reason why the plug-ins are interesting to me is the churn is so low churn on plug-ins are so low compared to iphone apps or and we built so we both have plug-ins do you have a plug-in for the hustle i have a plug-in for my my one big thing framework of just like what's the turn on one there's like no churn on it dude we have like thousands of users now the engagement's not super high like they don't always use the thing uh but they leave it installed and um it's like you know it's so we've both dabbled in this not seriously i would say neither of us took it super seriously but we were interested enough for both of us to build a chrome extension and get it out there to you know five ten thousand people it's interesting and i think that uh um i just think that people discount it and i think that it's far more it's far more interesting than most people realize and so i actually had a brave pull some of the biggest uh plug-ins so it's uh ad block ad block plus adobe acrobat what do you use adobe acrobat for i don't know probably like flash or something i don't know um safe price which is a deal thing video conferencing from uh cisco google translate which is kind of an indicator about for two can which is interesting honey pinterest say button skype what's uh tamper monkey uh i don't know it looks like it's trying to keep you safe dude there was a cool one got ghostery back in the day that would just show you who who's trying to track you on every website you go to that was kind of cool and try to shut that down uh there's also these paid ones so are there was there anything interested in the paid group no but tell me about the ones that you've invested in because they're actually similar because i and so in this document that we have i said screenshots would be great and you said oh i invested in this thing called bubbles which i remember you telling me about it but what is that bubbles is a lot like loom which we talked about earlier so the idea is how do you easily share what's on your screen with your co-worker who wants to see it and be able and so how do you do that some people just take a screenshot right they use the hotkey on their keyboard they take a screenshot and it goes into their desktop file then they have to go grab that then they drag and drop that to their friend and then the friend has to comment on it but they can't comment on it they have to like send it back as another file it's kind of annoying right so what bubbles does is much simpler it says it's a little chrome extension and on any page you go to you can say i want to record a screen recording like a video i want to take a screenshot or my favorite one is a scroll screenshot so like you know when you're on a website that like is long and you want to take screenshots of the website you have to take like eight screenshots and then send them as separate files to something yeah it's a pain with this it just takes one long screenshot and sends it to the person so it's it's easy to capture what's on your screen you can then comment like bubbles so it's like a speech bubble so you just click anywhere where you want to point something out on the screen like let's say for the hustle you want to make the trends website better you would click bubbles you would record a screenshot you would tap on the part of the screen where you're like this thing is stupid we need to change this and you would write this thing as stupid we need changes and then that's a the whole file is a link you just share a link with somebody else and they can comment back like a google doc and so is it doing well yeah it's doing well it's doing well specifically actually i think the niche initial niche that they've done well with is agencies and so agencies like creative agencies there's always creative people within the team that are sending ideas mock-ups concepts back back and forth with each other and then they have to share with the client also and the client has to give feedback so there's a lot of showing screen stuff and commenting back and forth on it and so that's where they're getting an initial foothold and i think it'll kind of break out from there so it's like loom but it does more than what loom does and what's dashworks so dashworks is a company of sn that is um it's like the home page for your company so this is this is a chrome extension that's sold to companies so let's say um somebody joins the hustle you give them their laptop if you work with dashworks when they when they open up their google chrome for the first time to use the internet they would not just see like the generic google like new tab page they would see like the hustle's branded page and that page can do three things one there's a search bar and you could type in anything into that search bar and it'll find the file inside your company so like most companies now use slack and google drive and dropbox and asana and github and like all these different tools that are all in the cloud so like if you've ever been on your macbook and you want to find a file you just use like the little spotlight search finder right you just type it into spotlight it finds the file on your computer but the thing is now with the cloud none of the files you need are on your computer they're all in the cloud so this is basically that search bar for all your cloud apps so now that so what it does is it helps any any employee find any file that's in your network without knowing where to go to find it right it's just like it's working yeah this is cool so then the second thing you can do is you can search anyone's name so i could be like oh what does steph smith do with the hustle i type steph it'll show me her profile show me what she does who she reports to and that sort of thing and then the last thing is that um you as the kind of ceo or your kind of your your admin at the company can post announcements or updates that will show up in their chrome like new tab bar so you can be like oh welcome these new employees or like happy birthday to this person or hey remember this friday we're all doing you know happy hour or whatever and so it's a kind of a communication pipe also so that that i thought was cool they're taking the chrome extension to deliver critical internal company stuff a search for people search for files and and internal announcements so um this this is interesting and another one i actually don't know how to say this company but you wrote it in here how do you pronounce that luster uh jack our friend jack was one of the early users and i think invested in it and he says it's awesome but basically they look at wire cutter amazon and dozens and dozens of other sources and anytime you have a product in front of you it tells you the average review um kind of interesting i don't know how i think it's a little better than that i think what they do is you say yourself yeah my description was about a year ago you yeah i think what it does is you go on amazon or whatever and you search for flat screen tv and uh you know it's there's so many products out there and all of them you know great it's four stars what do i make of that um and so what luster does is try to make the buying process simpler so it'll basically say here's the recommended option for what you searched for is the mo this rrai has searched all the reviews all the different websites has all this data to tell us that this is the most popular result for what you're looking for and then here's the high-end version of it and here's maybe the low-end version of it and so i don't know if the product's evolved too much since then but that's what it kind of did at that time was it would help you figure out which product should you actually buy using data and again you didn't have to remember to go to luster it was a chrome extension so you're just on any website shopping you can go to walmart go to amazon you go bestbuy.com wherever you're searching and luster will be like hey here's the product we recommend and here's why here's what the reviews say about it summarized automatically for you which i thought was pretty cool i think that that's a this could be a good product when he pitched it to me and when jack told me about it i was like this is stupid i'm not in uh i understand though i actually i think i i was wrong about it it's really cool yeah so the founders was really smart and and um for this one he showed me a chart uh a graph that was doing pretty well so here's some other ideas of things so those are ideas that we've either invested in or seen i have a couple more for you so let's use your framework of take a popular app like duolingo that shows that there's a need or a demand people want to learn a language and you make it a chrome extension as the user experience instead of a mobile app so or at least one of the main widgets or main points of distribution right so let's take meditation right you have headspace you have calm um why don't you have a chrome extension a chrome plug-in that will basically say it'll see you know you've been on you've been browsing for two hours straight you've had you have 85 tabs open hey let's take a minute would you like to earn some earn some mindfulness points and take one minute quick meditation and it just you tap the thing it turns on there's a clock and there's like a guided voice that's doing a guided meditation for you i think so i think i think meditation delivered through a chrome extension could work because it's so popular as a mobile app but again for mobile app you have to remember to go do it whereas this could just kind of like as you go it could pause you and uh and help you out that's great i think that has that has legs uh i'll i'll i'll keep going with this game um do you know the you know how do you on your iphone what's that thing called where it blocks you from using a website after a certain amount of time oh yeah like time something i don't know i don't know what do you think part of that i never use that [ __ ] no do you yeah i mean i have it installed screen time screen time um i used to have this chrome plug-in called nukem i think it was called nukem or the option was called nukem where after a certain amount of time you would nuke your website and you cannot go to certain websites so you could only go to like google docs email and that was it uh i loved it so similar to meditation i would 100 percent try to create more of a of of these uh what do you call this uh change your stop using stuff app right right right yes defend yourself against yourself okay i have a smart idea and i have a gimmick idea which one you want okay smart one or the gimmick one smart one first all right smart one first okay we had the founder of you mentioned the founder of superhuman he's the guy who built rapportive before that we both loved rapportive it doesn't exist now so some people might not know what it is but what reported was doing was when you were emailing somebody as soon as you typed in their name or their email a little sidebar would pop out of your email that would just show you their face show you their name show you the last few tweets it was like at the time it was like magic we were like how on earth do they know all this it was so it just makes you a more thoughtful person because you can see the person you can see what they're up to you can click their linkedin get a little more information and it kind of did like it served it up it was like you had an amazing assistant executive assistant who was like you know by the way sir you need to know this about this person so i think you could take rapportive all around the web so i think you could make it where any time it sees a name on a web page it just highlights it yellow and then if you just hover over that it'll just tell you something about that person so i think you could bring this idea of like anytime you see a name tell me a little bit more about that person i could think you could turn that into a chrome extension rather than something that was just for email how would you make money off of it um ads boom that's my easy answer i don't know oh all right um okay but here's my gimmick one which definitely needs ads so uh i think there should be a chrome extension let me take that back i don't think this should exist i think this would be funny if somebody tried to do this um so if you ever remember million dollar homepage it was kind of this cool idea of like here's a web website there's a million pixels on the page buy a buy pixel and sponsor it okay that's cool i've always thought about similar ideas how could you make a million bucks of something simple and goofy and there's this concept in in the bitcoin world of i think it's called a fountain or a tap it's basically a website where you go to and then sometimes there's like a think about like a spout like a fountain and uh sometimes bitcoin free bitcoin comes out and so a bunch of people like to go to these to so some projects use these to say like go collect your coin for my new coin go there and get some and you like go to the website you like collect some of the new coin that you can get and then other people have done this to be like hey sometimes something comes out sometimes it doesn't it's a game of chance it's like a um what do they call this they call it a um there's this company that did this with candles we talked about them it was called like diamond candles i think and at the bottom of every single candle we're talking candles like a wax candle that you burn in your bathtub or whatever like like cool candles that's [ __ ] the only way i don't use [ __ ] candles is what i'm saying i like that you start dropping f-bombs to like get masculine real quick while talking about bathtub candles yeah i gotta [ __ ] do it i use my my bath bombs or what are they called uh yeah anyway i've got all of them i'm a i'm a sensitive guy man and anyway uh they at like one in ten thousand candles probably has a one thousand dollar diamond right the rest have like nothing right uh something but like a like a like a cracker cracker jack ring and what you could do with this is you could always have coupons or discounts off of something and if you redeem them you get the chrome extension gets a kickback but every once in a while one out of x does get a bitcoin right yeah so something like that where basically every time you open a new tab there's a little little package in the middle of the screen you give it a quick click and then you're either gonna get nothing you get air you get you know a tiny little something it's like a puzzle piece or you know maybe like a little something i don't know something or you can actually get some bitcoin you can get you can get little satoshi's basically and so it would just become this little like the little hamster game where every time you open a new tab are you really gonna not click the thing and um and so i think you could get a lot of people to install this to try to get free bitcoin while they just browse the internet every time they open a new tab it's like a little mini scratch off lotto ticket that they get to scratch off that might have some crypto inside and um you could give away little [ __ ] coins you could give away micro amounts of bitcoin you can give away little puzzle pieces and if you get it right it's like the monopoly game at mcdonald's where you actually earn the bitcoin if you get all the pieces you can make a game out of it basically and uh and then the rest of the screen you just plaster with ads or sometimes what comes out of the box is just an ad and i think that's how you make money off of my gimmick chrome extension well i hope someone tries this because i think it would be hilarious that they create a product out of your joke so long story short we'll move on to we'll move on from uh chrome plugins but i think it's so cool i think people are underestimating this space a ton and i'm excited to see what comes out of there the last thing i'll say on this is the general idea here is just um there's a platform with three billion users and it has an app store there's gonna be winners right that now that i look back isn't it obvious like i still stand by hey there's only 200 000 chrome extensions and there's two million apps right so it's 10 times less but hey like that doesn't matter there's several winners that we've talked about here so i would say how many other platforms are like this right so like you know there's everyone talks about apps and you know google play or the apple store but what else is there right like hubspot has a platform um you know salesforce has a platform slack has a platform you know where are all these platforms and there's gonna be winners like once these platforms reach a critical mass somebody's gonna build something that's frictionless on top of it that um is able to generate revenue so i think there's there's money to be made in the unconventional app platforms that you don't really think about first yeah and i could go on forever about it but i think there's it's wordpress i think there's google sheets i think there's gmail right i mean it's a lot of google stuff but i think there's way more than people think right um what do you want to do um let's do uh what's the update on social stuff what is that oh i was saying just like our videos man our videos are crushing it we're uh the guys um henry and jordan or henry and dylan who are making these um we made an offer to them to make dozens and dozens a month are they doing it because i love their videos i think they're gonna do it so we're gonna do like i asked them i'm like send me a quote to do 30 to 60 of videos a month right so they'll do our stuff i actually think that they can reduce the quality a little bit like they're too good well like they take a long time i think that i think they can reduce the quality on youtube because i think people watch youtube a bit more passively i think and they should uh continue with the high quality on instagram and twitter because it's only two minutes long so um weird so so people need to subscribe to watch the videos because they're not just it's not just a video of what we talk about it basically takes this hour-long thing where we're just shooting the [ __ ] it finds the most interesting two minutes it edits us down so that we sound smart and it animates over the top of it so it's like actually fun to look at and it makes way more sense than just hearing us talk about so where do they go to actually watch the videos because we need them to subscribe to the video place so there's a few ways you can do it the first is you follow either sean or sean and i on twitter and we share them a lot personally the second is the hustle's twitter which is just the hustle the third is the hustle's instagram which is the hustle daily the fourth is our youtube channel which we actually have to figure out how to do this because we're using our old youtube account called youtube.com hustlecon so just google the hustle my first million on youtube you'll see it but we have to figure out how to manage that because they're actually kind of getting popular now you know five or ten thousand views a video um and if we do three a week which we're going to start doing that's kind of that gets to be somewhat interesting right so we got to figure that out but those are the ways that they can find it right now yeah i like that i go through the youtube one i like youtube myself and so uh but they're getting a ton of comments yeah the comments are great and i love responding to the comments so i'm just right now it's early days right i'm responding to all the comments because me too fun and they make fun of me a lot i can make fun of you more than you soon there'll be too many comments to respond to but for now i think there's like 17 000 subscribers so i want to like triple that just off of the listeners from this podcast so go to youtube.com hustlecon like hustle.com and then um subscribe to that thing so that you get the videos from us and then work and there'll be a video a video will have only 5 000 views but like 100 and some odd comments which has kind of been crazy and then the instagram is getting stupid amount of engagements and i think sean you're actually crushing me in terms of clips with hits so a handful of your clips have gotten close to 100 000 views um we had one with zach crockett one of our riders and he got 70 000 i think the other day nice and so we're just gonna start churning them out and we're going to do way more of these um i think we're going to launch a few more podcasts it's tbd but there's one called like how x makes money so like steph wants to break down how um something makes money and then a similar podcast is the economics of blank uh well we'll talk about the economics of something else um what else are we gonna do i forget a few but anyway we gotta like we're gonna just churn out these clips yeah it's way better to listen to honestly like when i listen to those i'm if i listen to the podcast i kind of cringe myself because i'm like i hate hearing my voice and also you know we wander it's a it's an off-the-cuff unedited conversation but the clips um they're great they're just great all right anyways what else let me wrap this up one thing and i just want to say this now because i think i want to like look back and remember this i think that in one year from now and maybe two years from now these style of clips that we're doing on social are definitely they're kind of their own genre would you agree like it's not like we're changing the world here so i don't want to like over no we're going to get copied if that's what you're getting at because already every time we every time i retweet one of them other successful podcasters or like youtubers are like holy [ __ ] who's making your clips and i'm just like dude you don't i don't know their name i forgot i swallowed that key and that box is locked because i think they're great i think they're better than everyone else's and i don't want everybody copying us and having the same [ __ ] but it's gonna happen it is gonna be the beginning of a new genre do you agree like no one makes high quality [ __ ] for a twitter video yeah and it's uh it's like easy it's easy pickings basically for for us now um all right uh we'll do one more segment yeah let's do it what do you have i got two quick ones so first gumroad just raised five million dollars through a crowdfunding campaign uh i wanted to get your take real quick we can go quick on i don't know how much we have to talk about this but good investment bad investment and then the background yeah secondly i want to know because you raised crowdfunding also so i want to hear your thoughts on that but i'll give the two seconds on gumroad so uh if you've never used it gumroad's awesome as a product it's uh the easiest way as a creator like if i make an ebook or if i make a pdf that i want to sell that has a bunch of information on it i'll go to gumroad all in 10 minutes i'll have a website up that can that i can sell my digital product and i can take payments from it so it does two things right it lets you sell a digital product so like shopify is not great for this shopify is more for like physical products and uh it's just simple it's like i'm just selling one thing i don't need a complicated store and i want to like have to like write code and also like i just want somebody to be able to come and pay with a credit card and the other cool feature they have is you can make it like kind of like pay what you want uh so it's sort of like a tip jar essentially for for something you make and so some people have made you know a lot of money doing this i think some people at the hustle i know steph did a book on i think gumroad that did like thirty thousand dollars in sales maybe 50 or something like that it did 70. i've made 10 i've made tens of thousands of dollars on gumroad what was your product you sold on gumroad how to so before the hustle i owned a roommate matching business and i mastered craigslist and in cities like san francisco and new york um a person on craigslist will get hundreds of replies to their apartment and so i just taught people how to email people in order to get an apartment on craigslist and it was so successful that on the first date with my now wife i asked her how she got an apartment she's like oh i just needed some guide online and she bought my guide i mean i sold a lot of them so that was my product that's hilarious i didn't know that um yeah so gumroad is called by the way i'll plug it gumroad the miracle craigslist template there you go um okay so so it's for that kind of thing it enables a different kind of seller been around for like i literally think 10 years now they went through this crazy story where they came out got hot raised a bunch of money from like big name vcs then things didn't go so well had to basically unwind the whole thing so like laid off or let go or employees left or whatever went back to like kind of like a one to three person operation i think um they went to like kind of bootstrapping it and went back to kind of like focusing on profitability and because they realized they couldn't raise any more money and then now they're back 10 years later so that was like you know a 10-year arc and now they're like kind of restarting it again like we're going big again and uh and they have some pretty interesting metrics so bray you pull up their go to their uh fundraising thing the metrics are are it doesn't make that much money but it has a so basically the way gumroad works is people post stuff for sale and so in terms of gross transactions i don't think they re no before that is 200 200 and something million 220 ish uh million dollars in gmv which is a bit like a month or a year yeah per year yeah so pretty high gmv it's growing like crazy uh it's a really good product i love it but the actual not the net income but like the uh net revenue um it's not significant it was like 200 000 a month it was like um i think i just read it so so i'll pull these up but uh or you go get the republic their fundraising page it has all the stats on it but basically if i remember correctly it's like eight to nine million dollars of net income last year that they got to keep and then from that they had one million dollars profit at the end of the year i don't think then it's that high but that would be cool if it were but the basis basically exploded during the kind of like covid um bump it so you could check check out this this fundraising page real quick we'll just we'll just yeah go ahead read off the stats and then i'll tell you my opinion well i'll just tell you my opinion now while you're looking that up which is i would not invest in this at all i would run away from this okay so i'll do the number i'm gonna explain why in a second last year okay i was a little high so last year 73 million this year 143 million um and then their revenue off that was 9 million their gross profit they say is 2.6 million and the net income at the end of the day for them was 1 million dollars uh in 2020. and it was only 1 million because they only had one employee so of that two so they really had two point six million dollars in revenue and the only thing they had to support was one or two employees and certainly nine million in revenue nine million was their take off the total transaction and then they have more than one employee now i think because he kind of like rebooted the company to grow again and so nine million is what the company made so but they're raising i think at like a hundred million dollar valuation or something like that um i would not i would not invest in this at all we've really butchered the numbers here sorry yeah we should have prepped this one uh i would not invest in this at all and i'll tell you why i was a fan of gumroad since 2012. my friend nathan barry told me about it because he had a book there and he went and spoke at the gumroad office and i went to their office and watched him speak and i was like damn this is great what is this whole government thing this is awesome yadda yadda i started i began as a governor to use in 2011. but the founder was like a prodigy his name sahil i think his name seemed like a like a cool dude real smart he left pinterest as the third employee to start this he was like a prodigy started the company at 19. but he failed um which is great that's fine you know you take swings it doesn't always work out and he raised 16 million dollars he got the investors to write it off saying like all right we'll give you back all the equity this is dead for us and then he went and worked on it and he kept working on it which is cool but now none of the investors or the employees who previously worked there all their equity got completely canceled out because somehow in good faith they said we're out of here fine you could have it and it's actually going to turn out to be something and i wouldn't want to invest in this person for two reasons the first i don't think that he cares about investors i think that he just cares about creating cool stuff and making his lifestyle great which is no no problem i'm like that as a little bit as well but i wouldn't want to invest money at 100 million evaluation someone with that attitude two if he takes the money and doesn't give money back to the people who gave equity to and tries to build this thing to sell uh i think that that's unethical and i don't wanna be part of that so that's why i would pass on this interesting yeah i've i heard somebody else talking about that as well uh i don't know the whole situation so i can't say you know exactly how those conversations went down and what everybody was on board with and whatnot by the way i don't know the whole situation either a lot of what i've just said is is is that's the public sound i've heard rumors and a lot of it is hypothetical but this is what i think is i mean if you if you just read publicly what's going on you can kind of it's right that's in line with what i've heard so none of that's out of line i don't think that he did it to screw anybody at all i don't think so i think literally the expectations of the company were too high it wasn't going to continue growing at that pace it wasn't i don't think he tried to do anyone either so he was like either we shut this down we fire sale this or we kind of unwind it and get it back to a bootstrappable company but if we're going to do that then this whole venture structure and all these employees don't make any sense anymore and i'm great with that right i'm great with that until right now you're going back to the growth story now the reason i wouldn't invest is just pretty simply i don't think it's a great business i don't like businesses like this i don't like patreon i don't like substance for the same reason i think they are amazing products they are good for the world but they make for crappy businesses if you just look at the numbers if you know these guys doing 150 million dollars of gmv 10 years into the business and they're making a million dollars a profit at the end of the day still is there so that million dollars of profit you're valuing at 100 million dollars today which means for me to get 10x on my money which is what i need for a illiquid early stage startup this has to become worth a billion dollars or more and so you're telling me that this company that's doing you know sub 10 million in revenue sub you know like about 1 million in profit is gonna be worth a billion dollars i find it like i think it's a bad bet and you're not getting paid for the risk you're taking because you're already paying up at 100 million valuation why because he's super popular on twitter he's super well connected with other investors like naval as an investor and all this stuff um because they're friends and whatnot and so i think that i don't think the retail investor is getting a great deal here i think that's also i have this general thing that's kind of unpopular which is uh crowdfunding is the you know bottom of the barrel companies like the best companies the ones that are hot that are growing get picked up by professional investors and the stuff that you end up seeing on crowdfunding sites i don't think are the big breakout companies in general now i know the hustle actually did a small crowdfunding thing but yours was a little different yeah i could raise that you raised from real investors and you could have raised all the money from real investors you raised most of it you just opened up a small amount so your community would feel like bought into the product i think that's a different thing then it is a different thing i actually regret doing that and i wish i didn't do it um and i wish i didn't do it because when you do that you now have a whole lot of people who are going to ask you questions and things like that and it's quite distracting and did they get paid out by the way from this deal that the deal they all got to check so they all know what the thing sold for then right how are you how are you planning to keep it a secret if they are all going to get some multiple of their money because the multiple that they get was because the total consideration was like the retention of employees and all that stuff they don't get that yeah like i personally am going to make a ton like maybe more money just off the retention package than the cap table package right um so there's things like that and also it depends i'm not saying for my deal but for some deals it depends how the note's structured yep um but it's it's not fun i think because you have to report to people on a quarterly basis about certain stuff and so it's basically like you're a publicly traded company yeah that may not be worth the hassle i don't think it's worth the hassle um and i do agree that a lot of them are bottom of the barrel not all but a lot right yeah that said if you're okay with the not having privacy which some people are cool with that i do actually think it's wise to get some users to invest in you you know this is actually how um samuel adams beer company got started they let their customers buy shares in the company before it went public and then and and in their case they said it helped them a ton i agree i like when you raise from customers i don't and i think that's a totally different thing than just going on a crowdfunding platform and saying hey person who wants to invest in tech but you don't have the network and you don't have the know-how and you're not in any of the funds um like you should just invest in my thing you're not a customer of it whereas like let's say you're samuel adams or next week next episode i'm going to talk about ben and jerry's ben and jerry's did the same thing they did it they did a share offering to their local customers in vermont so that they would be more likely to shop at their store continue to come back to the store because they feel like a part owner what you guys do with the hustle you let the readers invest um i think that's very different than what you see on most of the crowdfunding sites which is basically what when you show up on a crowdfunding site it's typically i struck out with real investors so this is my last show you know and that's why i say bottom of the barrel that's not nice and you know i'm sure that's not the case for all the companies i have friends that have done this and the friends i've had that have done this that's exactly what happened they struck out with the sophisticated investors so they go to the unsophisticated investors and try to patch together three thousand dollar checks five thousand dollar checks or whatever to get and it doesn't mean that they're not going to be successful it just means they weren't they couldn't get it done in the church where the business is at today was not juicy enough where these hawks the you know professional investors are like hawks they circle these companies that are that are high growth potential that could be big big winners and they pounce on them but you can't even you know before they even start fundraising they'll often get picked up and so um typically if you're at the crowdfunding point that means you've not only not got scooped up early by the hawks you probably went and pitched them and they said no and now you're on the retail investor great well you want to do one more topic or yeah let's do one more uh the other one is this idea or something cool that uh ben showed me called study stream live have you heard of this no google it somebody tried doing this for working but it's basically like hey everybody's working from home remotely it can be kind of lonely and i forgot what the name of the of the work related one was but it's basically i had one it was called peak and it was horrible dude there was like times where like we had this one plug-in where it would take a picture every 30 seconds or every two minutes or something so you could like see your co-workers and do [ __ ] but like there'd be times like like look this isn't this sounds like bro and embarrassing but there's definitely times where you're shirtless where you're on the toilet using your computer where you're like walking around in your underwear and there was times they caught me like shirtless in a peek and i was like oh my god this is right like right when you're laying in bed like playing on the computer or like so that's a bit of a different thing alright so i know what you're talking about that's like a uh kind of like spontaneo like it's kind of like a passive way of sharing what you're what you're doing this is different there's this is you want a focus do you want kind of like a study buddy and so you say all right for the next hour match me with someone else i think focus mate is the name of the one i was thinking about which is it matches you with one person and you get to work together you're both going to work on something at the beginning you're like oh yeah i'm working on my email newsletter today and the other person's like yeah i have this report i need to give to my boss okay i'm on there right now i'm on their website i already know what's going to happen with this company so let me explain what it is first so so you get paired for the hour you're supposed to focus and get something done so it's supposed to increase your productivity because you kind of have like a buddy who's holding you accountable from just drifting off and doing nothing um and you also can meet people and it's like kind of like a speed dating thing where you're gonna end up bumping into people and you're not just alone all day in silence in your house so that's the idea focus mate was trying to do it for for work this study um the study thing what was called study what livestream it's study stream live so these guys are doing it for studying for university students who are doing remote learning and um it is blowing up actually and so if you go there and you try to join one of these rooms they have like ten thousand person rooms uh like you can go join like a server like okay i'm gonna join this server there's a thousand spots they're all full like go go i've tried i tried them sometimes they're full uh most of the most of the day and uh which is interesting that means there's about 10 000 people that can concurrently using this product at any given time how did ben find this he said oh this thing's going viral on tick tock um and so that they might be like a temporary thing where they're full right now because they're going viral on tick tock but you know tick tock is kind of a younger generation and they're basically it speaks to them which is like hey you know you're at home it's kind of lonely it's kind of boring and you don't meet anybody but you don't get to see your friends you don't get to meet any people and you i want to focus i wouldn't say it's going viral the most video has 35 000 views um but they do have traction for sure like every video has seven thousand views so yeah i think it's other people it's not their own videos i think there's other people talking about it that went viral that's how people discovered it somebody okay i'm on the website right now i go to their website it says boost your focus join a 24 7 virtual room i click a room to join uh i click focus room and i click the room to join and it just takes you to a google uh a zoom room right like don't do it it's going to mess up the podcast but don't join it well i just clicked it and it like prompts you for a zoom room now am i weird or dirty and thinking i think this is just going to become like dicks i mean i think that the younger people the people who use this uh are like better internet people than our generation so i don't think i don't i actually like our generation i think would default to thinking it would be dicks i think that this these folks would not default to that but is this looks like a really innocent and lovely internet community is it going to be ruined with that that's probably wherever there can be dicks there will be dicks right so i think i think there definitely there's going to be some people doing it they're going to have to figure out a way to stamp that out one thing might be you know the big thing here is can they can they pull off a subscription so can they get you to pay to have this this you know study buddy kind of set up where you get to focus you get to meet some new people will people pay i i'm skeptical of it but i found it interesting this is new i don't know how to feel about it and so i think rather than judge i'm just i'm just kind of like i'm gonna watch this one and see what happens so a whole bunch of media dorks that i'm friends with they're all like oh media is like the future of education commerce and community like they use these stupid ass buzzwords and they say all this [ __ ] no or they say like we're going to create like a 3d thing things you can it's like no no no you guys are thinking about this whole like first of all colleges are always going to exist and we're always going to need them whatever yeah yeah but this company that i'm seeing uh study stream this is a crazy unique gen z like the people who i've talked about who say this are typically in their 30s and 40s um this looks like it was created by an 18 year old who's in the know and it's totally unique it's so interesting i don't care if this fails i think it's a really good uh swing very unique very very unique very great person it was like a student project i don't think this is meant to be like a company necessarily like there's a kind of like an about page on there you could probably check it out but it sort of said like this was made by the student group of whatever like some place and it just seems kind of like a humble side project that is getting a little bit of momentum and it kind of tells you like there's something interesting there it's not easy to get that level of traction uh well i don't know if it'll stay it's probably not gonna be the biggest thing in the world but i thought that was a pretty neat idea i think that this is an incredibly successful um project uh who created this i'm looking for it there is a guy named paul scott did he create this i just like him googling the url um you can't find anything about it people on reddit are talking about it uh this is crazy that's yeah this is super interesting it's very it's still very underground yeah seriously i thought this was cool um that's all i kind of have for today i have uh i have two good ones for next uh the next pod so i'm excited about that i found it uh it had this thing has funding it's like a company company so i googled studystream.live and i went to a guy's linkedin page and he's the co-founder of a vc firm it's called knowledge collective is a venture builder focused on global impact by disrupting health education and sustainability and he has studystream.live as one of their portfolio companies along with studypal dot live young leaders.digital and dot institute i think that's all that's all for this episode let's wrap it um i'll break you what'd you think of this one oh by the way uh everyone said that the um recap at the michael thing was the best thing so i guess we should do those more yeah i thought that was good i hope people stuck around to the end because we didn't uh i think we probably should have put a line in at the beginning that was like hey this is an interview with michael saylor he's an awesome guy for this reason and uh you know the interview was a little bit weird we actually debriefed it at the end of the show uh if you want to skip to the last 10 minutes you want to listen to it that's the last 10 minutes but blah blah i feel like there's probably a lot of people who got five minutes in or 10 minutes in and we're just like what's going on here uh yeah i'm gonna listen to something else i'm gonna go do something else but the people who didn't make the end gave us a lot of good feedback on it but by the way some of the feedback that we got was like why'd you guys try to brow out with him at the beginning about cars and [ __ ] like he didn't want that like dude we actually what's so funny is we like planned that we're like what should we like do icebreakers like we said like eight ideas and i was like i can just ask them about cars right and we're like oh that's the best of the worst just ask them about cars yeah i would agree with them that it didn't work but i would not agree that you should just like not try to get the guests into like like to shake off their pr speak right like it you know more times than not it's better to get somebody feeling loose and comfortable and laughing and talking about something that they're genuinely like something about themselves than them just showing up for their you know eighth interview of the last week and just saying the same thing again which you know for a guy like him he does a ton of interviews so you know if you want to listen to one of those like i've listened to many of them they're all the same on youtube you can go listen they're good but they're all the same and so i was hoping to shake them uh we failed at it and i actually had a kind of an interesting learning afterwards uh that i'll tell you about i um i was thinking afterwards i was training i went and worked out right after the thing and my trainer could tell my head was kind of somewhere else at the beginning he's like what's up and i was like man we just had this interview with this guy i'm so excited about it because i think he's a baller but honestly the interview was kind of awkward and um and i felt like he was he was a little bit flat it didn't seem like he wanted to be there and then i feel like you know i thought we could shake him out of that i thought we could make it good no matter how the guest comes in but like it didn't work or the [ __ ] we tried didn't work and he was like he asked me a question and i i sort of thought about it he goes you know he got me thinking there's this woman named glo who is the executive coach for a bunch of the top dogs at twitch i think for the ceo oh she's been her exec coach for like 14 years or something like that and she always comes and does these like with the exact team she'll do this like team building thing with us where she'll come to our off site and um normally if you get all the execs in a room it's just very type a it's like we need to talk about our problems we need to talk about our goals and our plans and like how we need to be more cross-functional and blah blah blah and when glow is there she won't let you just like stay in the logical part of your brain you have to like get real a little bit you have to be like a more of a human being more more open more emotional you have to be able to say if you're pissed off at somebody she'll get you to actually say what's on your mind and not just stay at the surface so she's like a master and this woman's like i don't know 80 something years old so what she she is like uh she was so good at this like i remember the ceo emmett he has this like twitch type a little like tick like a kind of like a speaking tick he has where when he's thinking hard or if he's like disagrees with you he'll start like kind of like grabbing this thing on his neck and he'll just do this for like 10 minutes while he's talking to you and i noticed it many people noticed it but nobody's ever gonna say anything to emmett about this like i'm not gonna be like dude what are you doing um or like hey you know you do that like i would just never say it and nobody ever says it so he always does it but it's like um and so this is the first time i knew she was a baller was as soon as he started doing it in one of the big exact kind of off-sites she was like emmett knock it off with that thing you're doing on your neck and i was like i was like whoa this lady is like and like that was just like she was just she didn't think about it she said it and she said it in such a like harmless way he took no offense he's like oh yeah thanks he just moved on and then for other and then she'll like actually do like some pretty sophisticated techniques where you say something and she'll be like you know you kind of hesitated when you said that and i know you you're a confident guy you typically don't hesitate what's what was that and then you like start pouring your soul out the glow and she like gets you she opens everybody up so anyways i was thinking what would glow have done if she was in that interview with michael sailor and that's when i realized what we should have done we should have just five minutes in we both recognized like hey this is not going super well and um i don't know about you that's how i felt would you say the same about five minutes in yes and so what we should have done is just been like you know michael like i'm i've watched a ton of your videos you are super smart you have uh taught me a lot about this space and honestly i was really really excited to have you on like i'm a fan of yours and i don't say that about most of the guests uh and i've seen you when you're switched on and like you know when you explain something uh it just it just it's so spot on and it really resonates and i feel like you're not fully switched on right now like and we should have just addressed it and just been like hey like i know you probably do a ton of these but i've seen you at your best and like can you give us your best like can you give us your a game can you and we should have i don't know what the phrasing is it doesn't really matter what the phrasing is to be honest with you but i think we should have at the beginning and not in the debrief while it was happening we should have found a way to just just open them up just say hey look let's call what it is right now like what are we doing here and let's make this great you know there's people out here who have never heard i've heard all your interviews people listen to this that have never heard of you they've never heard we should have 100 and i think what a lot of people don't realize and what i didn't realize until i got into this game was we're like try to be like friends with these people or at least cordial friendly and it's really awkward to to be like this is weird isn't it like it's like imagine just like having a conversation with a stranger at a party that you met i mean that's kind of what we're doing yes and it's really uncommon it's really uncomfortable to do that but we should have done that and that's what we should do more of and even now while i'm rambling i'm not saying the right thing like it's not coming out right but what i do know is that was the move that was the move and there's no there's no um [Music] that was the lesson that was the that was the big gain of that like i thought the episode was going to be amazing frankly i don't think the episode was amazing but an amazing thing came out i really liked it i know but for me it wasn't something i'm proud of but the thing i the amazing thing that did come out of it was we got into an uncomfortable situation and we got a rep trying something that was hard to do we kind of failed at the rep but because of that situation i now know next time what i will do if i'm ever in that situation again um and so like that was the that was the goal that came out of that for me i wanted to share that yeah and i would actually want to interview more crazy interesting off-the-wall people um i think we just need a few more reps to get to to get in there most people we've interviewed have been pretty easy i mean ty lopez was hard and we i think we actually kicked that one in the ass yeah i thought we were good on that one that one was also challenging and i was thinking um i actually think you're really good at naturally doing the thing which is naturally warming the guest up because i think you're very informal you're very casual so that just like they're like oh that's the tone of this thing uh he's not trying to like give this polished intro you'll just be like you're like a interesting guy right like you're cool and then they're like what then you're like you know you're like a cool guy and you you're clearly smart and like you know and you do this thing and like i remember with the guest who came on for deep sentinel you were like talking about how you wanted to like convert your truck into an overlander and then he like had that in common and it actually worked out amazing to just talk about like some you know something that was not just hey tell me about your company and why it's so great because he knows that pitch will go into it'll go into autopilot and you got him talking about something that was not autopilot and with like others like uh the david's tease guys or whatever you were like um i think you called him like a handsome dude or something like you know he's like it like gets them into they get some laughing it gets them out of there i call them really good-looking yeah yeah you're really looking um he doesn't expect that and so i think you do a good job of it but sometimes obviously it's a swing it didn't work dude michael alfied me out alphaed me so hard i was like yeah i got this card so fast he's like yeah like a jet he's like i prefer jets and yachts i was like all right right all right daddy you got me um i brayu what do you think about today and last week actually one of the video was is i've seen dozens of these videos and nobody's ever asked them about that ship so there you go sam was the first to ask about the ship um i think you should have them back on i think second time around might be better yeah and um i think sean one thing that i don't think i'm handling well and tell me if you're struggling with it is with these videos getting out we're getting way more comments and becoming a little bit more public figures um it definitely uh like i'm a i think i'm a pretty tough guy like in terms of like i don't let a lot bother me it bothers me sometimes does it bother you uh it's definitely the case that one negative thing i hear it 20 times forever you know it's like one negative is worth 20 positive comments it doesn't even be negative just like because often it's like something totally true and or it's just something you know ridiculous but uh a negative thing does like sit in your brain a little bit more and i think that there's probably some like getting used to of that where eventually that'll just wear off right like like in any public speaking or any kind of like any time you put yourself out there like you do develop thicker and thicker skin as you go for us we weren't like i wasn't podcasting i don't know like a little over a year ago right i didn't i didn't make content i didn't put my face on video i didn't put my name behind ideas that are good or i didn't try to like go you know interview a billionaire and do all this stuff i wasn't really trying to do that and so it's definitely definitely getting thicker skin i would say like on the whole i don't feel like i'm too sensitive about it because um uh like i just i spend very little time thinking about it but if i if i'm honest yeah a negative comment definitely does um you know reverberate in my ears ten times more than a positive compliment which i just kind of brush off immediately and don't i don't care about positive compliments they like they might as well not exist i don't even see them but and it's not to the point where it ruins my day but it like gives me it's like a shitty half hour right it's like a shitty half hour i also think i'm more fortunate than anybody right like when i did the cnbc thing today i watched the video in the first 10 seconds i'm like why the [ __ ] do i blink so much what am i doing do i always blink if it makes you feel better nobody else you look cool i think you looked cool i the the way that you look now is like a hundred times cooler than you way you looked a year and a half ago yeah my hair out it passed the uh awful zone of growing it out and now it's like okay no and you're like you used to have a little baby face you just look better i just think you look like a cool person oh thank you appreciate that yeah the facial the facial hair i think you look like a cool guy uh i said you're back i like compliments all right there we go i'm back i'm back in the game right up right you am i wrong he looks way cooler now the thing that you probably don't like is when they come when like one of them likes if like if they love you and they hate me or they love me and they hate you those are the ones that suck because it's one thing just to be a hater but if it's like no i like that guy i just don't like this other dude it's like it's like more personal than just being like you guys are idiots it's like yeah whatever i what's interesting though is i don't think there's a favorite so far i think that um you i think they hated you more and um they liked me more and i think it's slowly shifted a little bit so now i actually think we're equal i think we're equal in terms of uh the dislike and the likes yeah it's good practice though uh to do this kind of thing i really recommend to anybody who i don't know like if you got time if you got like that extra hour that you're spending on like just watching tv like make content you'll learn a lot of [ __ ] making content you'll learn a lot about yourself you learn a lot about what makes other people like resonate with something and not and you have to like come up with interesting things to say which means you need to become a more interesting person so i really think making content is uh is something everybody should should go do for a period of time just so that they experience it what do you think of bray abreu i think this part was almost better than the podcast the last 10-15 minutes i don't know if that's an insult or a compliment no the podcast was good but this part made me this part made me smile and laugh and when the podcast can do that as well that's great but this podcast didn't although it was informative um yeah i think you guys should take the good with the bad right like being out there sean you've been able to create this big newsletter you raised the fund you got all this positive stuff so like a few bad comments like i don't know you the the positives weight outweigh the bad i guess it's like i think that's a way of looking at it do you have a big newsletter now uh that's like the same it's like actually the the thread that went viral just now the clubhouse thing that added a few thousand people to it but let me see what it's at i think it's like 22 23 000 subscribers now i will say it makes i feel so validated in my sense of self-worth that i was doing newsletters five years ago and now all the cool kids like shawn and greg and all every cool kid and i literally finally stupid what you were doing i was like what is he doing finally finally all of the cool kids get it it took it took them forever but i do feel validated yeah it's like you did it right you got it big and you cashed it out and i think that's the you know that's the um you went full you you're lapping us at this point like you already did the whole thing and all of us right now are still like oh we got to make interesting content then we got to capture that person well get that let's get their email address that'll work like that's a good idea and then like let's let's hit them up regularly with something and then let's figure out how to make money it's like you've already done like eight of those steps we're all just like no i think i think there's there's room to build significantly bigger things in significantly shorter times but i 100 percent feel validated i mean i i i'm wrong all the time this is just the one time that i've been right and it makes me feel validated my sense of self-worth has just boosted by the way i tried this thing okay so check out this thing behind me this vesta board have you seen this before no is it a bitcoin ticker no no no i don't know if you could see um i don't know if you could see it because my camera like doesn't autofocus on it i tried to have this behind me so on on the thing behind me right now so for those who are listening to see this i basically have this giant um like board and the board is like if you go to a train station and you see where it's like you know like those little like flipboard signs where it's like you know this train is at station six and it's like and it switches train departs at station eight now it's like so it's one of those it does the thing and so you can put any message on here so you can program it where like i could put like you know today's revenue and it'll like keep updating every hour on there i could put a message i could put like a quote that i like on there so it's like a art piece of art that kind of changes behind me but i tried to get this up for the cnbc thing uh because i was going on i bought the domain that dude on tv.com because i was like oh my gosh that is awesome great idea i was like what if i can get a chance to shout something else like oh dude i'm gonna do my name no one's gonna spell that no one's gonna remember sean poori sean with two freaking a's like that's not gonna work great so i got i got that dude on tv.com if you go to it it just redirects you to my website and then i just had it behind me uh during the interview so that anybody who saw it could like go to it but the but the guys on tv were like hey we need you to move over to the middle i was like [ __ ] it's gonna block my sign but he's like no you need to be centered and i was like okay whatever but that was my little attempt to get any traffic uh i don't know i haven't had a chance this morning's been so busy dude i we did that i did a cnbc thing and then i'd take care of my daughter um and then and then with this crazy like situation with my wife's ecommerce store where there's like you know like crazy theft going on in the warehouse or like trying to deal with that and trying to feel like how do we deal with that so you know there's crazy stuff going on but i'm just trying to get back to my like paternity dad life and just chill with the baby that's that's what i want to do i'm basically just going to chill with the baby for the next few weeks and just try to record this podcast you know for for you know one hour one hour a week or whatever two hours a week that we do this well i'll pray you a b c d hey ah all right we could never leave without bray you're like kind of like you tell us the bedtime story we can't get off the air until you give us the validation i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the travel never looking back

The Hustle presents - My First Million. A podcast where we brainstorm new business ideas based on trends & opportunities we see in the market. Sometimes we have famous guests, and they do it with us.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
you want to talk about paid newsletters really quick a topic that we've discussed a lot yeah let's do it but this one is particularly interesting um the reason why is we've talked about this company a lot agora financial i've brought it up to you a ton they spun off a couple of their brands and they tried to do a spack and when they tried to do a spec the company that they were spacking with just like kind of like went down like dropped like significantly so they there was already a publicly traded company that was going to buy a few agora brands the stock went down big time but that's not that important what's important is the numbers behind this paid newsletter business so there's this company called um actually i don't know what they call this little it's a subsidiary of gordon of agora i think they call it beacon hill it owns six sorry 12 different newsletter brands collectively those newsletter brands do where did i put the number 550 million dollars in revenue and 200 million dollars in profit and by the way growing some that grew 77 percent over last year is that crazy now i'm going to tell you all some more numbers they have 10 million free subscribers so kind of like the hustle that's like they've got 10 million of that uh this is even wilder they have 550 000 people paying them 600 between one dollar and six hundred dollars for subscribers then they have a quarter of a million people paying them six hundred dollars to five thousand 000 and finally they have a hundred thousand people paying them more than five grand for a product for a paid newsletter and what is in this paid newsletter what's the what's here here's where things get way crazier they have some paid newsletters that cost thirty five thousand dollars now the reason why what gets crazy what gets crazy with this is that they have a hundred and sixty products across twelve brands so what's that math so each each brand has uh 12 12 or 13 uh products and the products i don't even understand but basically i understand the business model the business model as they get you to buy a 50 or 49 thing then they get you to buy a 2 000 thing and they're and so they get you to buy that 49 thing and that 49 thing is like a monthly paid newsletter like it's not significant right i don't understand how they get it to work and a large percentage of those 49 people buy the 2 000 thing okay so but i feel like okay so these must be b2b newsletters right no they're not uh yeah that's an important part that i left out nearly all of this is around and we'll link to their deck so they have a whole deck when they they it's kind of scammy so they it's a financial and a wellness company which is kind of weird they talk about health and they're talking about wellness and if you click agora up there sean under my name you'll see the deck they say that their their target demographic is self-directed investors what's that mean well i'm gonna tell you if you're looking at the website it's just a bunch of old kind of wealthy white people who are probably republican and because the reason i think this is they have ads that say like nancy pelosi is coming for your guns you better invest in these eight stocks like they say like crazy like that right it's basically the like motley fool on uh you know steroids right yes uh but i think motley fools ethical these guys aren't they also sold a book on how to cure diabetes okay i was gonna ask you why do you think they're unethical and then you answered my question and so it's all financial news financial newsletter financial news related stock picks and it's just just a crazy story i've brought this up tons of time we don't spend too much time on it but it's pretty wild to actually see these numbers i actually guessed that this is how big they were now we have proof yeah you've been talking about agora as like you know doing hundreds of millions of dollars and you know some people know about them but i would say most people don't know about this empire and most people i mean this blows away most people's expectations of you know paid newsletter right like oh you know like i just had a paid newsletter as an individual right i made you know a few hundred thousand dollars total and i thought i was crushing it and these guys are making hundreds of millions of dollars so when you look at this is my honest my honest reaction is dude why couldn't you have done this with the hustle why what what did they do or what was that why was the hill too hard to climb where you could scale like this because this is huge i don't think it was too hard to scale i think i could have done it i would say that this business has been around since the 70s right so it's kicking ass now it didn't always kick ass if you're willing to be patient you can do it second of all if you're willing to put your ethics aside a little bit it actually is quite easy to do it helps so exactly how would you do this you let's say you want to be these guys or beat these guys what does you know you're sam you're probably one of the most well equipped people in the world to do this how would you have gone about it well what you have to do is you've got to create multiple brands under one it's really hard to have one brand and only a couple products make all this money so you'd have to have for us we would have done and we were going to do this but then we got bought and the reason i got bought was a whole different reasons which is basically i wanted to um get a payday like and i wanted to i mean like i was pretty clear about that before like i wanted like it was cool it was it's awesome i'm gonna stay here but like it was nice to like get a lot of ticket um but if i wanted to be patient and do it for 50 years which i kind of do to be honest um i would have created trends but for subset sub categories and you make the first newsletter the one that people pay for only like 49 or 50 bucks and we send you just a couple things a month and then the second thing is you go to sub categories and you charge thousands of dollars for example if there was a newsletter that dissected media companies i work in the media industry and you told me it was four thousand dollars and i also got access to a community i ain't gonna complain about it right i mean i'm gonna do it if there's something for digital streaming and that you know that the five analysts are smart twitch is gonna buy that it's not that like challenging not that hard right um and so that's what i would do from multiple industries and the thing that a lot of newsletter writers do which i've talked about those plenty of times and i don't have to talk about too much is they do one of two things one they charge too little and two if they charge too little they don't have a higher end back back product you need a front end and a back end so you need your cheap thing that gets a lot of people and then you need your paid thing that gets only a few people but it charges it makes a lot of money so you guys at trends is like i don't know 300 something a year you could have been 49 and then 5 000 would have been a better mix of value if you are if you were optimizing for how do we get this thing as profitable as we can lucrative as you can yeah and had we not gotten bought i would have done that i would actually we were about to change it we were about to make that change and by the way what happens to trends now people still pay for it or it's free now um they pay for it we might lower the price before we're either gonna make that the back end or we're gonna make that the front end but we were to copy this model of a 99 thing and then a 2 000 thing yeah dude when i see companies like this it just makes me want to do it so badly uh because it's like it just seems so doable now i know that in practice when i and by the way we get we get heat for this sometimes because we're like dude it's so easy it's so simple we're talking like relatively like building a successful business is hard okay like it's not just we're not saying we're not saying things are easy sometimes we actually do says that word easy really what we mean is simple so like being able to bench 500 pounds that is um um simple like it's straight forward here's how you get strong in the bench press you lift a lot and then you eat a ton now that is quite hard to do for five years but that's that was that's the steps you take so it's like simple and so what we're saying is that this is simple it's not yeah actually i think weight loss is actually a better example because 500 pounds is a hard thing to bench weight loss is literally simple where it's like hey you need to eat these you know avoid carbs avoid sugars you need to eat a little bit less less calories than you're burning and like you should work out regularly do kind of whatever just try to get an hour a day of you know break a sweat if you actually just did those two things and be like hey give it like four to five months six months boom you're in great shape everybody knows that formula it is actually simple executing it and doing it having the discipline and having the rigor to like actually stick to it hard but it is way easier relatively than becoming a crossfit champion right and so when we're talking about business the scale is that it's like it's hard to create the next facebook that's really freaking hard uh is it hard to create a paid community well i don't think most people who try it will do it but it's relatively way easier than creating the next facebook so for people that out there that get all sensitive when we call something easy it's not we're not trying to mislead you like yeah it's gonna take work most likely it won't work it'll take some time but we're on a scale of one to spacex this is more like a one than it is a spacex and like that's a that's a scale for for people to think about i completely agree and um i think like now let's talk about what makes this hard the first and is that you have to sell your soul a little bit now many people will not be comfortable with this stuff sean is pretty comfortable with it i think i'm comfortable with it but i think i'm a little bit less comfortable with it you have to be a face sometimes you have to be you have to say i'm an expert at x pay me money to for me to tell you my thoughts right second um well no this is off that so guys like james altucher who we've had this podcast he was ridiculed for doing this with bitcoin everyone made fun of him he made 60 million dollars doing it but he still got mocked constantly and shockingly most people would actually prefer not to make the money and not get made fun of than they would to make the money and get made fun of well the way i think about it is most people truly will not they're afraid that they're going to get them not going to get the money and get mocked and so they're like it i won't do it if you really had a guarantee i think people would happily trade reputation points for bank points yeah and perhaps but that's some moot point because the fact is is that most people don't even want to because the first point you said of like they may not get the money at all that is also true and that's what they're they're not going to do that so you have to do that second it's a treadmill you can't stop this is a lifetime job so if you're a content creator you i hired people to do it for me you 100 can do that but you're gonna you can't you have to you actually have to do the work for a little while in the anyway so you're gonna have to work and by the way uh quick question on hiring because people ask me this and i have no idea i'm like why don't you ask sam he's the one who did it why are you asking me they'll be like dude the hustle has had amazing talent like they talk about trung they talk about steph smith they think about some of the people you guys you me i mean right i mean i consider you be part of our crew you me trung steph this guy colby we've got yeah we've got a bunch of people so the question is where the heck did you find these people so can you give me the 10 seconds on each where'd you find chuang where'd you find steph where'd you find colby where'd you find you know all these people colby was worked at a pr firm where he was doing some copywriting work uh and uh trung uh amen did he just apply to you or you like recognize like oh this guy's good mutual connection friend of a friend said you should talk to this person uh trung came from eamon troy a mutual friend and investor of the hustle steph uh i found on twitter because i read her blog who else that's it i just kind of want to know and then when you found these people are you what's your did you cycle through 30 people who kind of sort of saw before you found the gems when we actually sold to hubspot they were like wow you guys have a lot of churn i'm like yeah but here's what we do like this is actually quite normal in the editorial industry but you hire a bunch of people and you've got a you you either fire or there's a mutual like all right we tried it it wouldn't fit um and that happens a lot um yeah and you also when you understand the tone i would say that was also a key right because you were writing it originally and so you yeah and you called the translated the right people you saw the trends community like i was the one actually doing it before every day you were posting in that thing yeah and that sets the culture and attracts like-minded people um i also think that um once you find the winners then you go all in on them so trung is what i call he's a made man steph a made woman whatever steph wants to do something cool sounds good what do you need uh when other people come to me with an idea negotiate baby trying to time to double it trying to double that number whatever's number sam gave you time to double it these guys are all doing great um whenever if an outside person or if a non-main person comes with an idea it's you know why don't you just show me a little mvp and let's see what people think right trunk says something it's all right yes sir right yeah like you're a proven hitmaker so and then the um the last thing is when we interview them i always ask about the bottom fourth of the resume which is like the college classes and all the things that

first of all creating something that goes viral is such a crazy feeling and you've done it a ton i mean you built the hustle with a bunch of really viral blog posts like this is kind of nothing in comparison to the blog post you guys wrote and also you're a writer so you kind of have a process where you sniff out stuff that you think is going to go viral whereas for me i'm not really a writer this is kind of me just trying to i mean you you you have the it factor i think that um i think you can study and how to do it i think that you can just be born with the skill set um i think you and i are quite similar in that it's both born or we we have that natural gift and also we learn and master the craft right i think you've tried it a lot more and therefore your hit rate i think is is higher i personally i just think that but um the question i was going to do i mean dude you got to 120 000 followers on twitter in like basically six months yeah that's true um so i wanted to share so when i uh so the way this this came about because i think this is ultimately more interesting right the rant is kind of interesting but the how this happened i think for people who are listening they'll probably find it i think they find interesting um the way they started was a pretty high profile vc person called me one day i had never met them before they had said oh you seem interesting on twitter i'd love to meet so we did a phone call and then we were talking just about each other's backgrounds was cool and then they were like well what do you think of clubhouse by the way i gotta ask and um and i think they asked this because they had looked at investing they ultimately didn't invest and they were trying to figure out like am i gonna kick is this gonna be is this gonna haunt me you know for the next five years that i missed this deal or is this gonna be a good one and um you know a good pass and i basically i i just went on this rant on the phone about this it just kind of came out of my mouth just the way i kind of explained it here and um without the whole like kind of dramatized like tv show script but just the reasons why i think it's gonna struggle and um and they were like wow that was great like that was amazing and i was like [ __ ] i should have wrote that down that was like that would have um i feel like that would have been like a good like piece of content and so i went i kind of like quickly was like i gotta go and i hung up the phone and i went to my computer and i just typed the whole thing out and um and it turned into like and then i was like okay whatever i i kind of edited i took it out i did your your tip which i took a break for an hour yeah just went and did something else came back and i edited it for about 30 minutes editing is the magic to everything it doesn't matter you're talking about a viral tweet a good email editing is the magic they say write drunk edit sober oh that's a great one i've never heard that i love that um think you're in attendance i used to just edit in the moment like i'd write i don't know and that was a mistake the tip you gave me a while back was go do other [ __ ] let it simmer in your head while you do other things don't even actively think about it by the time you come back you can make it twice as good in 20 minutes yeah and there's actually some science behind it i i i can't tell you the exact science off the top of my head but basically you know how there's like a shower thought of like not doing it so there's like science behind like doing something really hard and then not doing it and then things hit you uh there is science behind why that works and that's kind of what you're doing yeah basically like the brain relaxes in some way and then when it relaxes it's able to be creative in a new way and so um okay so then i post it and then whatever you know [ __ ] as well so then uh so that was that was the oh sorry the other part that i forgot which i think is my new it's something i've been doing and i'm curious if you do something like this before uh before i write anything now at the top of every page i have a template and at the top there's like seven lines that says what reaction is this meant to get and i have seven emotions it's like lol like this is meant to be really funny is it wtf where it's like dude what the [ __ ] and that's when you're talking about something that's really unjust or people are pissed off and you want to you want to explain hey there's this really messed up thing that's happening and people will be like oh my god um then there's other ones like you know like aw aww something really cute awe oh like like that something is awesome like wow that is like kind of amazing wait did i tell you that i do this no i actually learned this from these other guys who make viral videos rubber republic they had a search engine where you would just search by one of these emotions and it would pull up viral videos that had that that were based on that emotion wow so the way to go viral is you always want to start you start with the emotion that you're trying to get out of someone um and you and we already know that certain emotions get more shares so for example creating depression or sadness that doesn't get shares um creating outrage gets far more and with small tweaks you can make something sad outrageous and that's far better right you know so it's either amazing it's super funny it's really really outraging it's um it's really touching and heartwarming that's another one um hard to do and then the one i had for this which is kind of like a new emotion which was i wrote finally someone said it and i actually think that's a that's its own genre that i didn't even have in my template because i was like i think this is going to go viral but it doesn't match any of these i was like i think for some people it's going to be wtf like dude this guy's a jerk why is he predicting failure what an [ __ ] but i thought no it's going to go viral because if you say something that a lot of people have been thinking but they've been afraid to say or they couldn't put words around it exactly but they had this hunch they will share it because they agree with your opinion it's the idea of recognizing something that you feel that you weren't sure if other people feel but you see it on paper so the same example is with location so when you see like uh how you know you're a san francisco bro or how do i know uh do you know sean perry like if i said if i saw an ad that said do you know sean i'd be like oh wait that's directed just towards me right so what the emotion that you just evoked was like finally i didn't think i was the only one who thought like it's a recognizing it's it's a recognizing something type of vibe and they're really sharing because they're like i knew it i i'm right so they're not saying wow he's so right they're actually saying i'm right read this this proves i'm right which is like a real subtle thing but i'm so interested in studying the like psychology around why people do what they do why do they share what they share because i want to grow an audience and this is the best way to grow it and i feel like this i'm this process that i'm doing i'm so glad you said you do it too because i thought i was a little crazy i was like oh my god no that's what we used to do i mean that's what i do when i i'm like i i i start with the emotion then i start with the package like how am i packaging this then i start with the headline then the preview image and then i work backwards from there right um and i always try to find like i'll find something that catches my attention just one fact or one line so for example um i was just doing research on yesterday do you know um what recaptcha is you know when like um up for something you're signing up for something that says spot right nowadays they say like spot click the thing or type in the uh the whatever picture is a sign click it yeah it'll be like you know where are the traffic lights click all squares with traffic lights and by the way this is a good example i saw this meme that was that recaptcha with the traffic lights and in one of the squares just the tiniest corner of the traffic light is in it and it shows the guy like suit like sweating like crazy like oh [ __ ] should i include that or should i not include that and that's one of those where it's like me too dude i i i almost feel that way i'm always confused by this thing that's supposed to so i always feel that way meme now here i can take it another way do you want to know when i looked it up on wikipedia you want to hear a fun fact do you know why they do it this way is because people like google um i might be butchering this just a little bit but the idea is the same people like google are paying recaptcha to translate stuff so for example somehow picking out that sign or saying where the headlights are that actually helps google and google is paying you money because it's paying a little bit so the original captcha was done by this guy he was a professor at duke and carnegie mellon and capture originally was letters remember it was always these kind of script like kind of hard to read letters but you could read it and that was basically taking they had scanned a bunch of book pages but who's going to conv the computer was not good enough at trent getting all the book pages to translate over to text in the computer because some of the book pages were a little rounded or wrinkled or kind of fuzzy and so the computer couldn't do it but a human eye could easily do it so they basically outsource the work and solve two problems with one stone on the website side they just want to make sure you're not a bot who's signing up for their service like a scammer who's going to spam everybody but then they did good in the world also because that project ended up transcribing like millions and millions of books i think all the books that they had scanned eventually and then captcha two is about a recaptcha i believe is about image classification so for self-driving cars we need to know is is this a bus or what is this and so i think that's where the original idea was uh classifying images let humans do it while they signed up and the inventor of recaptcha the second one his name is luis von on i think that's how you pronounce it he did both and that guy started duolingo and when he started duolingo he started it for two reasons one he i guess he just cared about helping you learn language but two when you are learning the language you're actually translating stuff that a third party service is paying for you to translate so this is crazy so what a genius the exact emotion that you just had of this guy's crazy that is the mo emotion wow this guy's actually i am trying to evoke by sharing that so i can tell that story in probably five tweets and i bet it will like virality is pretty impossible to predict but i can bet that there's like a three out of ten chance that it's going to that has legs i could say this has all the uh this checks is all the box to get popular i can't i ca anyone who says that they're going to be able to predict it they're wrong like shawn's thing just reached five million people he was like this is not going to work um the other part the other part you had there that was good is that you took a thing that we've all seen that's a relatable oh yeah i've filled one of those in and you so you took a very familiar thing but i told you the uncommon truth around it um which i think is like really cool like there's one yesterday i saw uh you know tom cruise's name is not tom cruise his real name no what is it it's tom uh tom cruise something it's like his middle name is cruz and his last name is like some uh like very looking up it's some like i don't know random ass like name and he changed it to tom cruise which sounds like a total movie star name makes total sense that he did it and um so yeah his real name is thomas cruz mapother the fourth or some i don't even know how yeah i can't even pronounce that mappather yeah tom mappather versus tom cruise and so you take something really familiar we all know tom cruise right boom here's the uncommon did you know and then it's like oh sweet like wow you know and that one doesn't have as much shock factor so it won't go super viral but it'll get a lot of likes but you know the closer you can get to that the surprise gap between what i thought i knew and what's real uh the more shares people will get yeah i think if anyone cares about this stuff i like the book made to stick and i like the book contagious by jonah berger contagious made to stick is how to say something so people remember and contagious is a great book by this wharton professor on how to make things get popular i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back

i like the analogy or the kind of the awareness that hey we have this giant bowl of ice cream that's melting that's that's your cash pile that's melting and the heat is basically the money printer that is uh causing acid inflation ice cube that's melting and i save a 500 million dollar ice cube and it's melting 20 percent a year and it will be gone and finally so you needed to do something with that you didn't want it to all melt away so you decided to do this now a couple quick questions one is uh this is sort of rapid fire i've had a couple rapid fire questions for you in 20 years from now what do you think has generated more value uh or more income to the company to microstrategy is it the operating income of microstrategy or the investment income of the bitcoin it holds the investment income for sure okay and then uh you know to be to be very clear what happened in march of 2020 is when the cost of capital goes to 25 that means that every investor and all investment income every every investor generated 25 more doing nothing right and every main street company that worked 25 harder got nothing right right you literally tilt the playing field so that if you don't own if you own an assets you're having the best year of the 30 years and if you don't own assets it's impossible to have a good year right and um and so so the second question is um you uh as you acquire as you acquire more and more bitcoin is microstrategy bet like do you just position the company at this point like it's a bitcoin etf it's like buy this buy this bitcoin buying it it's not a bitcoin etf everybody's you're sloppy with those words an etf is a company that invests in securities and it tries to keep its assets under management equal to the amount of shares of etf that it sold it's a financial company an etp is a similar type of company that invests in commodities if you create you know if you create this bitcoin entity that that equalizes assets under management equal to the shares you sell you created a bitcoin etp we're neither of those things we're not a finance company we're not an etf we're not an etp we're not eq we're not buying or selling bitcoin to equalize assets under management we're an operating company that owns property bitcoin is property and in that way you should think of it as a company that like i i bought a million acres of land in texas or i bought uh a million gallons of of fill in the blank a million bushels of soybean you can buy any kind of property right and and you're holding it on your balance sheet as a company right that's what we that's what we are now what's your question you are talking about like let's say the the cost of capital uh being 25 right because since march that's what the s p 500 has done but the the stock market goes you know it does go up and down in years where you know the market dips and and goes up you know the average or you know over time the geometric mean is whatever seven or eight percent something like that so d some would argue okay yes this year assets inflated by that much that doesn't mean next year it's going to remain at 25 a year um and so you have to make some prediction right and so are you are you basically forecasting it at 25 15 10 8 and does the decision change at a certain number there so so gen first of all for the decade from 2010 to thousand and twenty it was generally about eight percent like it was it was pretty consistent and the single biggest driver of cost to capital is the rate at which the broad money supply expands and if you look at if you go google m2 money supply fed you'll get a chart and you'll see the ch by the way the chart's not all over the place the chart is very consistent seven percent slope for a decade it's not jerking around so it's not that volatile it was very consistent monetary policy for a decade then that chart goes like this straight up 24 so if you uh if if you're going to make a decision as an investor and this is any investor what it this this has to do this applies to all 400 trillion dollars worth of investors and it applies to every company on earth they all have the same exact thing they have to calculate which is you have to estimate the rate at which the money supply will expand each year for the next eight years and so that's the same if you want to figure out the signal or or the single most important thing in the world for everyone but for everyone 7.8 billion people for 100 million companies for everyone with money on earth and everyone that earns a salary on earth this is the big idea of the podcast you have to estimate the rate at which the currency is going to expand and if you believe the currency is going to continue to expand at 15 a year for the next eight years you come to one conclusion if you plug in 10 it's a different conclusion if it's 25 it's a different conclusion so what do i think um i think that um 15 is 15 for the next eight years is reasonable um if you're a pessimist you could say 20 if you're an optimist you could say 10. but um the money supply is expanding because the federal reserve and the eu central bank are buying a trillion dollars worth of um bonds every year each and it's also expanding because uh the the government of the eu and the us are running a multi-trillion dollar deficit and it is also expanding because of trillion dollar plus stimulus and there's no reason to think that's going to change in the next four years and i don't think in the next eight years i think i think that at the point that the democrats took control of the senate and the house you saw that you have um if you could have you could have forecasted 12 percent inflation if it was a it was a split government but i think that in a a non-split government there seems to be remarkable consensus that we should run deficits continue to keep interest rates low and continue to stimulate the economy so what does that mean if you plug in a number 15 it means that the risk-free interest rate or the the risk-free return is 15 it means you have to generate in excess of 15 on your money every year for the next four years in order to stay ahead of the rate of asset inflation a reasonable person would say the assets are going to inflate at that rate that's that's pretty much what they do that means that if your company is not growing its cash flows you know at a 20 rate then it's not going to hold value as a stock it means that if your bond is paying you an interest rate of less than 15 percent you're destroying value in the bond if your rent yield is less than 15 percent your commercial real estate's destroying value and if you're holding cash you're losing 15 percent of it a year that's that's the negative real yield so once you actually uh embrace the idea of asset inflation and asset inflation equals cost of capital equals the rate of the money supply expansion once you have that rate then you realize that there's a negative real real yield on everything except for bitcoin for the most part the negative real yield on gold is three percent that's the rate at which we mine it or hypothecate it the negative real yield on sovereign debt is about 12 13 the negative real yield on corporate debt is ten percent every company that's got a growth rate of less than fifteen percent has got a negative real yield on it so you know once you do that then you can then what you realize is you can't really have a business strategy as a company unless you find a way to solve the treasury problem so the big idea here is you want to fix any company sweep all the cash flows into bitcoin convert the treasury into bitcoin borrow against your future cash flows and dollars convert that into bitcoin finance all your fixed assets in dollars convert that into bitcoin and issue equity as much as you can now at the highest valuation you can now in dollars and invest in bitcoin right and and you might say why bitcoin well because bitcoin is the apex property it's the most scarce monetary asset in the universe you can't make any more of it it's encrypted money and and what that means is it's least likely to be impaired by a property tax an execution issue um money printing delusion counterparty risk and corruption so we have we have engineered a superior asset a thermodynamically sound technically superior asset it's placed on a global digital monetary network which is open an open protocol and the combination of the the the apex asset on the open monetary system makes it the um the most disruptive technology in the world when you were first starting microstrategy you were you were in the weeds you were thinking i have to make a product that solves a problem and i have to make money off of it right now you've gone way up the hierarchy of now we can do whatever we want now you can do whatever you want at what point did you notice a shift like oh my gosh like this business is stable it's working it's working pretty well uh yep it's quite predictable at what point did that shift happen because what you're talking about now is quite important to what i think we look we solved our problem when we actually embraced bitcoin i i i could say to you oh yeah well when i had 500 million in cash in the bank i could and we were focused but the problem with that is that if you have a bunch of cash generating zero interest the cost of capital goes to 25 then all the public company investors forsake the company and if the stock if if the stock market forsakes the company the mainstream media for stakes the company right then the employees become dejected because eventually you're going to have facebook amazon apple or google steal every one of your employees if you can't drive the stock up right nobody wants to invest in a company that makes a lot of money growing at five percent a year i mean it's it seems brutal to say that but it wouldn't be true if the cost capital was zero if we had a sound money policy in this country then you could hold your head up high and say i run this great restaurant and we made a lot of money last year we're going to make a lot of money this year and our plan is to keep doing what we've been doing and everybody pat you on the back and say that's good that's honorable but if if i tell you i'm going to devalue the the cash by 25 a year or 20 a year at some point you're driven into this cycle where i have to either do a big acquisition to keep my revenues growing i have to take extreme risk and do dilutive acquisitions or i have to go borrow billions of dollars to buy the stock back to leverage up the cash flow per share and if i don't do either those things the investors dump the stock and they dump the stock the employees start feeling like you know why don't they go work someplace cool and hot and you're gonna get all your engineers stripped away by facebook or or amazon or something so the truth is when we actually fix the balance sheet we fix the stock and we fix that you know at this point the company has five billion dollars more than five billion dollars in assets if the if the cost of capital remains at let's say it goes up 20 percent if if we print 20 percent more money next year i can reasonably expect to generate a billion dollars in investment income which would be a you know 20 increase in bitcoin right but the truth is i can reasonably expect better than that if the cost of capital is 10 i can reasonably expect 500 million investment income well all two thousand people doing a hundred thousand things right perfectly for the entire year competing against microsoft that has more money than god they can generate 75 million a year okay so so the truth is the company its future became secure when we actually converted the balance sheet to bitcoin because now we don't have to struggle let me say it a different way i don't think any company could be successful without a financial strategy in the year 2021 like i wouldn't have said it three four years ago if you have a sound money macroeconomic environment where the money supply is expanding at two or three percent a year you can go out and make things and create things and market things and sell things and service things and generate cash with that and then and that makes sense but if the money supply is expanding at 20 percent a year you need to own assets because because what's happening is no one's going to invest in any project that doesn't generate more than the 20 hurdle rate and so what who can generate consistently risk-free 20 returns you have to be a monopoly you have to have a digital monopoly or some kind of monopoly so it becomes exponentially harder to grow and what and so what happens next all these other companies could get squeezed out of the ecosystem right there they get decapitalized and rendered insolvent by by the monetary policy so i i would say that you know if i can get my st my stock was twenty 120 a share what is it right now like uh i haven't checked in the market 768. okay so if i if i get my stock up then i can actually make my shareholders happy i can change the narrative i can recruit i can retain talent i can get that you know i can inspire the confidence of my customers i can i can drive momentum and then we can do what we want to do i guess it's it's similar to if you're a university and you had no endowment you know and or university there's a billion dollar endowment or university is a 100 billion dollar endowment you know if you're a professor which university you want to work for if you're a student where you want to go you know do you have a shiny building coming or not right at the end of the day right money is a measure of energy and so if you have monetary assets you have energy and if you have high energy you can pursue your vision you know with integrity and what percentage of your time now are you spending on this on investing the income versus on the day-to-day of micro strategy of just the the business as usual making the products that making business intelligence products versus investing the the income um i'm i'm the ceo but we have a president and the president of the company is fong lee and he actually has day-to-day operational responsibility for sales marketing and even technology development at this point so i'm the chairman and the ceo i i oversee the company strategy and i oversee that i oversee financial strategies i oversee long-term direction and i and i oversee technology strategy but i'm not i'm not in the weeds in the day-to-day running the business that's really left for the operating executive team i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on a road less travel never looking back

my favorite uh kind of podcaster content person out there dm me and was like this is this is this is a [ __ ] great thread and uh i was like blown away that this guy wrote this and then cnbc was like hey would you like to do this some german news station was like will you come on and talk about it and i was like wow this is unbelievable what could happen with just a random ass tweet i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all how many uh people did your tweet reach how many people did my tweet reach yeah so go to twitter and then click insights and then look at reach i'm gonna guess 5 million okay let's give it a shot uh so it has 13 000 likes and yeah almost 5 million 4.8 million impressions wow and who all who are some of the more interesting people who reached out to you well first what what did you what happened here for the listeners okay so what happened um i went on twitter and i wrote a thread i wrote a thread about clubhouse and the thread starts basically saying you know everybody seems to think that clubhouse is the next big thing and um i think it's gonna fail and here's how i think it's gonna go down and then i wrote it in this way that's a little bit like goofy i kind of went over the top i just i was like all right you're the ceo like first of all congrats champ you did it you know and i walk through like the high that they're on right now because everything's going great and everybody thinks it's the hot [ __ ] and then like where things might start to go wrong and what what might go wrong based on you know the way that the product is set up the nature of that product and all that good stuff and so that uh that was a thread i put it out there and i thought it was gonna kind of flop because right away nothing happened and usually you could tell like you know this you could tell pretty quickly within a couple minutes you know if the thread if your tweet's gonna get any action or not it didn't look like it's gonna get any action then the first reply was this guy being like dude this is way too effing long like what are you doing and like the way he said like what i thought i assumed some people would say this is super long because it's like i don't know 50 tweets or something crazy um but when he was like what are you doing i felt super embarrassed and i was like [ __ ] let's just delete this this is stupid and then i just like let it ride for a few more minutes and then uh it took off and now some crazy shit's happening and like i'm going on cnbc tomorrow to talk about it and [ __ ] so all kinds of crazy stuff has happened you're going on cnbc tomorrow yeah i wonder if it's the same person who invited trung on so you're the second person associated with the company who's been on in the past two weeks i'm hot on trunks heels i saw him on last week talking about uh kathy wood and ark and stuff like that and he was great so if i can do half as good as he did i'll be in good shape and who else reached out to can you say you told me a couple uh yeah i mean okay so i can't say all the names i'll say well okay so first i started getting mentioned uh by a bunch of cool people so like the guy who started youtube was like dude this is [ __ ] hilarious like i love this and then uh so a bunch of people who have started big companies kind of were saying something and i started getting dms from people and and i kind of went to sleep at first i was refreshing for like four hours because i couldn't stop uh like i was mid workout and then like between sets i would go check my twitter it was kind of annoying and sony was like what the hell are you doing like what is this and i was like i don't know i'm obsessed i i really just want to see it was like a i would pull the refresh thing and then a different kind of famous person who i look up to was usually saying like this is awesome or something like that so that was kind of addictive i went to sleep i woke up the next day and so in my inbox is a offer for a book deal hey uh like a famous movie director who directed like a bunch of movies that we've heard of uh wrote like dude amazing storytelling this is all i found my email address and emailed me that he's the uh i think i could say it he's the director of uh like space jam 2 and like a whole bunch of famous movies and then um i i don't know if i could say this one but my favorite uh kind of podcaster content person out there dm me and was like this is this is this is a [ __ ] great thread and uh i was like blown away that this guy wrote this and then cnbc was like hey would you like to do this some german news station was like will you come on and talk about it and i was like wow this is unbelievable what could happen with just a random ass tweet like how is it gonna take you to write not even a good one really um it took me an hour i sat down and so the way this played out actually was i had already believed this but i thought okay that's not cool like nobody thinks it's cool to just say oh a startup is going to fail well most startups fail so like there's nothing that original there but because i had built a product very similar to club boss i kind of knew what the challenges are going to be and where they might get tripped up or what's going to be really hard for them and um and so i thought well i kind of feel like i know the product strategy here but like that's kind of a if i just write about the product decision like some of the product challenges and the product strategy it's a pretty boring tweet storm nobody's going to really care so when i ended up writing it i wrote it like an episode of silicon valley in fact ehrlich's ability to jerk different dicks simultaneously [ __ ] yeah i think it would like the hbo show like i basically wrote it in that style like i wrote like you know okay you know emily chang invites you on to you know whatever cnbc and to do an interview you know you wear your your visionary gray v-neck shirt you go on and you say this this and this and so i was just kind of writing like a goofy style i wasn't just writing information i'm trying to entertain a little bit and uh and then emily chang replies to the thing being like you know i can't confirm or deny this but this is on point and um so all kinds of crazy stuff was happening but yeah it took me about an hour and then i just hit publish and you got like 30 000 followers from it congratulate or 20 000 maybe yeah dude that's the way that twitter works though is like you think it goes against like all the conventional good advice which is just like you know be consistent put out content all the time and like you know try to like hit a bunch of singles and like what i found and i think i don't know you tell me if you found this too which is like it's just like five tweets that grew me from 20k to 120k everything else was the cost of doing business it's a it's the hits business yeah it is and uh so so summer summarize this actually bray you asked me to ask you to summarize this the your bear case for clubhouse because we're actually going to use this probably for one of our twitter videos okay all right so all right so let me okay we gotta we got we gotta we gotta get the the video guys video guys this is the part you're gonna edit all right here we go uh so everybody's saying that clubhouse is the next big thing you're hearing about it all the time they went you know from a test i think they were in test flight and they raised at a billion dollar valuation which is kind of crazy that apple's no they were in test flight they raised at 100 million but it's right but now they're at a billion dollar evaluation it hasn't been long they're still ios only still pretty exclusive you can't even you can't even join the app unless you have an invite and so um but i see the other side of it i think that they're gonna fail i hope they don't fail i think the world is more fun if they win it would be awesome if they win but i don't think me wanting them to win doesn't mean that that's what's going to happen i sort of i said in the twitter thread i said you know if uh if me wanting something to happen would happen then every bag of chips would come with guac but that's just not the way life is and um and so okay so here here's how it works all right pretend you're the ceo of clubhouse sam you know first of all you [ __ ] did it you made it people actually like the thing you made and they don't like it they love it and uh you know you check your dms and chrysa is in your dms he says dude congrats this thing is this thing is kick ass and you know naval is liking your tweets and keith reboy is basically saying like this isn't [ __ ] uh you know this is not garbage and so you take that as a huge compliment as it is and it feels like every day you open up the app and like a new star is coming on the platform like first kind of like just tech dork stars like you know the market andreessen's ben horowitz people that we like but they're kind of niche in our in our circles and then it'll expand and all of a sudden you'll get you know nba players coming on you know famous musicians logan paul will come on and then this was the most liked tweet in the thing was i said you know gary vee realizes that you've created a new place to yell and he starts telling everybody hey if you really want to make money go move back in with your parents and sell their furniture on craigslist and uh so every life is good right you get a term sheet you're valued at a billion dollars and you know you're doing interviews about you and you gotta kind of ham it up right because you can't just say oh i made this app where you can go in chat rooms and talk to people that doesn't sound very very fancy so you try to play it simple but you talk really fancy you say things like you know this is like this is a serendipity network this is this is not not just chat rooms this is audio escapism this is you know when you start saying like historical [ __ ] like you're like you know humans have been talking to each other since the dawn of time you know around the camp you know around the campfire and you know audio is so powerful because you can see your your tone and texture and um and so you're going on the media tour and then like you get back to your computer one day and you look at the charts and you know the graph doesn't look as you know as upbeat and to the righty as it's supposed to be and so you're like what's wrong with this thing you refresh and it's still the you know the growth is kind of flat maybe even declining and you you start to look a little deeper and what you'll find if you're the ceo of clubhouse is after about you know a year into the product you see that retention is not so good it's not as good as it used to be in the early days and you know why is that the case and and what will happen is that you'll realize that clubhouse is used for two totally different things there's two ways that clubhouse can be used if you talk to users or you watch them you'll see these two things number one it's a place to create content and number two it's a place to just chill just to go hang out with other people and have conversations and so content is what we see all the time on there it's panels it's fireside chats q a's amas and it's like oh this is content it's like the next youtube it's where you go you make you make content people consume it um you know and the problem is that a lot of the content like on youtube is just like meh you're right 98 of the content is junk and that's okay that's the same for every platform you just need to find that gold and there is gold on clubhouse right if you watch the good time show or the the nyu girls who go on there and they have that show called shoot your shot and that is gold but um you and so you want to triple down on that you're like guys this is what this is what we need to double down on how do we make this how do we get more gold content and you tell the whole team we're going to go get more gold content and so the engineers they go start building features for content creators they build like a scheduling feature and q a tools and like a monetization features where you can make money from your fans and the creators are happy but the retention stays bad and what you realize when you talk to somebody who knows what they're they're talking about here is that there's this like problem called the interestingness problem which is that when you open up an app um there's one metric that matters called ttf and ttf is time to fun how long does it take me to have some fun inside this app get some dopamine and all the great apps within seven seconds if you open tick tock youtube instagram in seven seconds you're gonna get something juicy you're gonna get fun and um and you know the way those apps do it is they have billions of pieces of content to choose from and the algorithm knows okay this is the most liked content the last 24 hours so it shoves it in your feed and when you open the app it's going to show you something great right tik tok calls us the for you page because it's here's the best stuff for you and that's why tick tock is so addictive every time you open it you get something great but for clubhouse you know you tell your engineers hey that's what we need make an algorithm that will do that and the engineers you know they sit you down in a chair and they'll say okay we're gonna do our best but just so you know it doesn't like it's one thing to just find what's interesting but we have to find what's interesting and is being created live right now and when you multiply those two things together it doesn't become twice as hard it becomes 200 times as hard to find interesting content when you open the app and so the what happens is most people will download this app they heard about clubhouse they heard it's cool they'll open an app and whatever's on right then they'll walk into the first room and it'll be kind of boring it'll be kind of meh and then they'll walk into a second room and then within 30 seconds like why the hell am i here this app is stupid they'll close the app and they'll probably never come back and so they'll get a bunch of downloads a bunch of signups and then but they'll all just be leaking out the bottom of the bucket and so um you know you're the ceo and so you're like oh okay yeah live is harder i get it but twitch did it twitch is live and look at that they got you know hundreds of millions of users so clearly it can work you guys the engineers you guys just need to make it happen and then you know the product manager the engineers will come back to and they'll say well twitch is a little different right because on twitch the great content creators are creating about 40 hours a week of content they stream every day six to eight hours a day and um they're playing a game so they can do that they can play a game for six hours straight just talk while they're doing it it's hard but it's not anywhere near as hard as just opening clubhouse and being entertaining for six hours straight while talking maybe some radio hosts can do that but the average person cannot and um and then the second thing they'll say is like also you know almost all the content on twitch is about gaming so as a viewer if i come on there maybe one creator's not live but another fortnight creator is live or another fortnite creator is live it's like density around one passion whereas clubhouse is every category some people come there for music talk some for sports some for tech and so if i'm a sports person and i see a tech room that's of zero value to me so twitch is vertical club is horizontal this is gonna be really hard to get great content in every category and so you know i kind of fast forward and you know okay this is tough and um you know your meeting ends the next meeting engineers leave next meeting is the biz dev guys biz dev guys come in and the biz dev guys are like you know what do you want us to do boss and you say you need to go get great content go get all the stars we got all this money in the bank go go pick cut some checks let's get some star creators on the platform and you'll go to people um who have who have a big audience who go to podcasters right you go to people like us and we're gonna say okay so if i could spend an hour on clubhouse and get i don't know 2 000 3 000 people in the room that's good right but like if i just record a podcast i'm going to reach 300 000 people with that so why am i why would i ever make this trade why would i go live here when i go live there right when i could just record my podcast so you're the ceo you say all right that's a tricky problem but maybe you could do both right why do you have to choose do your show live on clubhouse and we'll add a recording feature so that you could just make a podcast out of it later you can have your cake and eat it too and so you do that and some creators start to use it but um you realize there's a big problem with that which is as soon as you start to like let people record and the core thing becomes i'm recording my podcast here i'm just doing a live version that will turn into my podcast or turn into a youtube video well then this live thing becomes a second class citizen and i stop letting guests hop on my clubhouse room and chat with me because i don't know what the hell they're going to say it's unpredictable and you know what makes for a great live session is that spontaneity but that makes for a shitty recording and so um you know that's that's another trap there so okay you finally you have an emergency team meeting you say this whole content thing sucks um you know we we only have a few pieces of great content only a few hours a week for every vertical this is going to be impossible to do in every category that's like recreating all of tv and that's just really hard to do um you know and and i'm tired of all these people on there doing shows and q and a's and these success coaches trying to manifest millionaires and all this [ __ ] you know what is this discord for douche bags like screw shows we need a new plan and we're going to plan b plan b is chillin right this is a social network it's not a performance network you come here to socialize you come here to just talk to other people that's the most human thing in the world seven billion people on earth talk to their friends this is what you know this is what we'll do here um and you know you you you ask people who had a great experience so far in clubhouse the people who think it's amazing like our you know our friend narendra or you know bit different people who have really enjoyed their experience and you ask them why and they'll say well i came on and i was i was in this room where this really cool thing happened and mark andreessen was there and then this guy was there and then you know i went into a side room and i met a bunch of other cool people in the tech world and we got along great i made a bunch of new friends and you say all right that's what we're going to do and um and sure enough that actually solves your retention problem because people will come here it will solve loneliness people will come here they'll hang out and they'll make friends but all of a sudden your growth will stall right because if i'm coming here to make friends and i'm not bringing friends to the platform that's kind of the the rub there right so any platform where the value prop is to make friends i'm not gonna bring friends so now you have sticky retention but now you have no growth and in the other world you had fast growth but no retention and so you're stuck in this catch-22 and um you know so then you know just to kind of round it out you eventually get disillusioned you realize this shit's not gonna work you try to pivot you eventually sell the company to facebook you spend a year as the manager of facebook voice and uh then you quit you go you travel in southeast asia for a year you do some ayahuasca and you vow to yourself i'm only gonna ever work in enterprise sass again you know screw this social thing and uh so that's my story uh over the top i hope i'm wrong but i think that's how it's gonna play out and i think a lot of people who are hating on you didn't realize that this is the life that you led yeah yeah some people are like wow that's really detailed where this where's this coming from and some people are like dude that's way over the top and i'm like dude i built this before like we built a app so similar to this it grew to four million users and tony robbins was using it an espn was using it and the jonas brothers and then oracle was using it and then you know some of the tech guys and the 37 signals guys were using it and it was awesome product was using it and then we hit the you know we get to 4 million members and we just started to see these same issues we tried everything to fix it and i hope these guys find the solution that we missed or maybe the world has changed or there's some differences but the reason i you know this was 70 my experience 30 percent you know fantasy that i wrote this thing with i guess uh we're gonna have to check in on this podcast in like maybe one year i bet i think we'll see how things shake out in about 12 months yeah and i guess like the more interesting part that i wanted to talk to you about was okay so first of all creating something that goes viral is such a crazy feeling and you've done it a ton i mean you built the hustle with a bunch of really viral blog posts like this is kind of nothing in comparison to the blog post you guys wrote and also you're a writer so you kind of have a process where you sniff out stuff that you think is gonna go viral whereas for me i'm not really a writer this is kind of me just trying to i mean you you you have the it factor i think that um i think you can study and how to do it i think that you can just be born with the skill set um i think you and i are quite similar in that it's both born or we we have that natural gift and also we learn and master the craft right i think you've tried it a lot more and therefore your hit rate i think is is higher i personally i just think that but um the question i was going to do i mean dude you got to 120 000 followers on twitter in like basically six months yeah that's true um so i wanted to share so when i uh so the way this this came about because i think this is ultimately more interesting right the rant is kind of interesting but the how this happened i think for people who are listening they'll probably find it i think they find it interesting um the way they started was a pretty high profile vc person called me one day i had never met them before they had said oh you seem interesting on twitter i'd love to meet so we did a phone call and then we were talking just about each other's backgrounds it was cool and then they were like well what do you think of clubhouse by the way i gotta ask and um and i think they asked us because they had looked at investing they ultimately didn't invest and they were trying to figure out like am i gonna kick is this gonna be is this gonna haunt me you know for the next five years that i missed this deal or is this gonna be a good one and um you know a good pass and i basically i i just went on this rant on the phone about this it just kind of came out of my mouth i like just the way i kind of explained it here and um without the whole like kind of dramatized like tv show script but just the reasons why i think it's gonna struggle and um and they were like wow that was great like that was amazing and i was like [ __ ] i should have wrote that down that was like that would have um i feel like that would have been like a good like piece of content and so i went i kind of like quickly was like i gotta go and i hung up the phone and i went to my computer and i just typed the whole thing out and um and it turned into like and then i was like okay whatever i i kind of edited i took it out i did your your tip which i took a break for an hour yeah just when it went and did something else came back and i edited it for about 30 minutes editing is the magic to everything it doesn't matter you're talking about a viral tweet a good email editing is the magic they say write drunk edit sober oh that's a great one i've never heard that i love that um i think you're in an attempt to just i used to just edit in the moment like i'd write no no no no and that was a mistake the tip you gave me a while back was go do other [ __ ] let it simmer in your head while you do other things don't even actively think about it by the time you come back you can make it twice as good in 20 minutes yeah and there's actually some science behind it i i i can't tell you the exact science off the top of my head but basically you know how there's like a shower thought of like not doing it so there's like science behind like doing something really hard and then not doing it and then things hit you uh there is science behind why that works and that's kind of what you're doing yeah basically like the brain relaxes in some way and then when it relaxes it's able to be creative in a new way and so um okay so then i post it and then whatever you know [ __ ] as well so then uh so that was that was oh sorry the other part that i forgot which i think is my new it's something i've been doing and i'm curious if you do something like this before uh before i write anything now at the top of every page i have a template and at the top there's like seven lines that says what reaction is this meant to get and i have seven emotions it's like lol like this is meant to be really funny is it wtf where it's like dude what the [ __ ] and that's when you're talking about something that's really unjust or people are pissed off and you want to you want to explain hey there's this really messed up thing that's happening and people be like oh my god um then there's other ones like you know like aw aww something really cute awe oh like like that something is awesome like wow that is like kind of amazing wait did i tell you that i do this no i actually learned this from these other guys who make viral videos rubber republic they had a search engine where you would just search by one of these emotions and it would pull up viral videos that had that that were based on that emotion as well so the way to go viral is you always want to start you start with the emotion that you're trying to get out of someone um and you and we already know that certain emotions get more shares so for example creating depression or sadness that doesn't get shares um creating outrage gets far more and with small tweaks you can make something sad outrageous and that's far better right you know so it's either amazing it's super funny it's really really outraging it's um it's really touching and heartwarming that's another one hard to do and then the one i had for this which is kind of like a new emotion which was i wrote finally someone said it and i actually think that's a that's its own genre that i didn't even have in my template because i was like i think this is gonna go viral but it doesn't match any of these i was like i think for some people it's gonna be wtf like dude this guy's a jerk why is he predicting failure what an [ __ ] but i thought no it's gonna go viral because if you say something that a lot of people have been thinking but they've been afraid to say or they couldn't put words around it exactly but they had this hunch they will share it because they agree with your opinion for them it's the idea of recognizing something that you feel that you weren't sure if other people feel but you see it on paper so the same example is with location so when you see like uh how you know you're a san francisco bro or how do i know uh do you know sean perry like if i said if i saw an ad that said do you know sean i'd be like oh wait that's directed just towards me right so with the emotion that you just evoked was like finally i didn't think i was the only one who thought like it's a recognizing it's it's a recognizing something type of vibe and they're really sharing because they're like i knew it i i'm right so they're not saying wow he's so right they're actually saying i'm right read this this proves i'm right which is like a real subtle thing but i'm so interested in studying the like psychology around why people do what they do why do they share what they share because i want to grow an audience and this is the best way to grow it and i feel like this i'm this process that i'm doing i'm so glad you said you do it too because i thought i was a little crazy i was like no that's what we used to do i mean that's what i do when i i'm like i i i start with the emotion then i start with the package like how am i packaging this then i start with the headline then the preview image and then i work backwards from there right and i always try to find like i'll find something that catches my attention just one fact or one line so for example um i was just doing research on one yesterday do you know um what recaptcha is you know like um when you're signing up for something you're signing up for something that says spot right nowadays they say like spot click the thing or type in the uh the whatever picture is a sign click it yeah it'll be like you know where are the traffic lights click all squares with traffic lights and uh by the way this is a good example i saw this meme that was that recaptcha with the traffic lights and in one of the squares just the tiniest corner of the traffic light is in it and it shows the guy like suit like sweating like crazy like oh [ __ ] should i include that or should i not include that and that's one of those where it's like me too dude i have i almost feel that way i'm always confused by this thing that's just supposed to so i always feel that way meme now here i can take it another way do you want to know when i looked that up on wikipedia you want to hear a fun fact do you know why they do it this way is because people like google um i might be butching this just a little bit but the idea is the same people like google are paying recaptcha to translate stuff so for example somehow picking out that sign or saying where the headlights are that actually helps google and google's paying you money it's painful i have a little so the original captcha was done by this guy he was a professor at duke and carnegie mellon and captcha originally was letters remember it was always these kind of script like kind of hard to read letters but you could read it and that was basically taking they had scanned a bunch of book pages but who's going to conv the computer was not good enough at tr getting all the book pages to translate over to text in the computer because some of the book pages were a little rounded or wrinkled or kind of fuzzy and so the computer couldn't do it but a human eye could easily do it so they basically outsourced the work and solved two problems with one stone on the website side they just want to make sure you're not a bot who's signing up for their service like a scammer who's going to spam everybody but then they did good in the world also because that project ended up transcribing like millions and millions of books i think all the books that they had scanned eventually and then capture two is about a recaptcha i believe is about image classification so for self-driving cars we need to know is this a bus or what is this and so i think that's where the original idea was uh classifying images let humans do it while they sign up and the inventor of recaptcha the second one his name is luis von on i think that's how you pronounce it he did both and that guy started duolingo and when he started duolingo he started it for two reasons one he i guess he just cared about helping you learn language but two when you are learning the language you're actually translating stuff that a third-party service is paying for you to translate so that's crazy so what a genius the exact emotion that you just had of this guy's crazy that is the mo emotion wow this guy's a channel i am trying to evoke by sharing that so i can tell that story and probably five tweets and i bet it will like virality is pretty impossible to predict but i can bet that there's like a three out of ten chance that it's going to that has legs i could say this has all the uh this text is all the box to get popular i can't i can't anyone who says that they're gonna be able to predict it they're wrong like shawn's thing just reached five million people he was like this is not going to work the other part you had there that was good is that you took a thing that we've all seen it's a relatable oh yeah i've filled one of those in and you so you took a very familiar thing but i told you the uncommon truth around it um which i think is like really cool like there's one yesterday i saw uh you know tom cruise's name is not tom cruise his real name no what is it it's tom uh tom cruise something it's like his middle name is cruz and his last name is like some uh like very look it up it's some like i don't know random ass like name and he changed it to tom cruise which sounds like a total movie star name makes total sense that he did it and um so yeah his real name is thomas cruz mapothere the fourth or something i don't even know how yeah i can't even pronounce that mapathar yeah tom mappather versus tom cruise and so you take something really familiar we all know tom cruise right boom here's the uncommon did you know and then it's like oh sweet like wow you know and that one doesn't have as much shock factor so it won't go super viral but it'll get a lot of likes but you know the closer you can get to that the surprise gap between what i thought i knew and what's real the more shares people will get yeah i think if anyone cares about this stuff i like the book made to stick and i like the book contagious by jonah berger contagious made to stick is how to say something so people remember and contagious is a great book by this wharton professor on how to make things get popular how to make them spread like a virus hence contagious i like it you want to talk about paid newsletters really quick a topic that we've discussed a lot yeah let's do it but this one is particularly interesting um the reason why is we've talked about this company a lot agora financial i've brought it up to you a ton they spun off a couple of their brands and they tried to do a spack and when they tried to do a spec the company that they were spacking with just like kind of like went down like dropped like significantly so they there was already a publicly traded company that was going to buy a few agora brands the stock went down big time but that's not that important what's important is the numbers behind this paid newsletter business so there's this company called um actually i don't know what they call this little it's a subsidiary of gordon of agora i think they call it beacon hill it owns six sorry 12 different newsletter brands collectively those newsletter brands do where did i put the number 550 million dollars in revenue and 200 million dollars in profit and by the way growing some that grew 77 percent over last year is that crazy now i'm going to tell you all some more numbers they have 10 million free subscribers so kind of like the hustle that's like they've got 10 million of that uh this is even wilder they have 550 000 people paying them six hundred between one dollar and six hundred dollars for subscribers then they have a quarter of a million people paying them six hundred dollars to five thousand dollars and finally they have a hundred thousand people paying them more than five grand for a product for a paid newsletter and what is in this paid newsletter what's the what's this way here's where things get way crazier they have some paid newsletters that cost thirty five thousand dollars now the reason why what gets crazy what gets crazy with this is that they have a 160 products across 12 brands so what's that math so each brand has uh 12 12 or 13 uh products and the products i don't even understand but basically i understand the business model the business model as they get you to buy a 50 or 49 thing then they get you to buy a 2 000 thing and they're and so they get you to buy that 49 thing and that 49 thing is like a monthly paid newsletter like it's not significant right i don't understand how they get it to work and a large percentage of those 49 people buy the 2 000 thing okay so but i feel like okay so these must be b2b newsletters right no they're not uh yeah that's an important part that i left out nearly all of this is around and we'll link to their deck so they have a whole deck when they they it's kind of scammy so they it's a financial and a wellness company which is kind of weird they're talking about health and they're talking about wellness and if you click agora up there sean under my name you'll see the deck they say that their their target demographic is self-directed investors what's that mean well i'm going to tell you if i look at the website it's just a bunch of old kind of wealthy white people who are probably republican and because the reason i think this is they have ads that say like nancy pelosi is coming for your guns you better invest in these eight stocks like they think like crazy [ __ ] like that right it's basically the like motley fool on uh you know steroids right yes uh but i think motley fools ethical these guys aren't they also sold a book on how to cure diabetes okay i was going to ask you why do you think they're unethical and then you answered my question and so it's all financial news financial newsletter financial news related stock picks and it's just just a crazy story i've brought this up tons of time we don't spend too much time on it but it's pretty wild to actually see these numbers i actually guessed that this is how big they were now we have proof yeah you've been talking about agora as like you know doing hundreds of millions of dollars and you know some people know about them but i would say most people don't know about this empire and most people i mean this blows away most people's expectations of you know paid newsletter right like oh you know like i just had a paid newsletter as an individual right i made you know a few hundred thousand dollars total and i thought i was crushing it and these guys are making hundreds of millions of dollars so when you look at this is my honest my honest reaction is dude why couldn't you have done this with the hustle why what what did they do or what was that why was the hill too hard to climb where you could scale like this because this is huge i don't think it was too hard to scale i think i could have done it i would say that this business has been around since the 70s right so it's kicking ass now it didn't always kick ass if you're willing to be patient you can do it second of all if you're willing to put your ethics aside a little bit it actually is quite easy to do it helps so exactly how would you do this you let's say you want to be these guys or beat these guys what does you know you're sam you're probably one of the most well equipped people in the world to do this how would you have gone about it well what you have to do is you've got to create multiple brands under one it's really hard to have one brand and only a couple products make all this money so you'd have to have for us we would have done and we were going to do this but then we got bought and the reason i got bought was a whole different reasons which is basically i wanted to um get a payday like and i wanted to i mean like i was pretty clear about that before like i wanted like it was cool it's awesome i'm gonna stay here but like it was nice to like hit get a lot of ticket um but if i wanted to be patient and do it for 50 years which i kind of do to be honest um i would have created trends but for subset sub categories and you make the first newsletter the one that people pay for only like 49 or 50 bucks and we send you just a couple things a month and then the second thing is you go to sub categories and you charge thousands of dollars for example if there was a newsletter that uh dissected media companies i work in the media industry and you told me it was four thousand dollars and i also got access to a community i ain't gonna complain about it right i mean i'm gonna do it if there's something for digital streaming and that you know that the five analysts are smart twitch is gonna buy that it's not that like challenging it's not that hard right um and so that's what i would do from multiple industries and the thing that a lot of newsletter writers do which i've talked about those plenty of times and i don't have to talk about too much is they do one of two things one they charge too little and two if they charge too little they don't have a higher end back back product you need a front end and a back end so you need your cheap thing that gets a lot of people and then you need your paid thing that gets only a few people but it makes a lot of money so you guys at trends is like i don't know 300 something a year uh you could have been 49 and then 5 000 would have been a better mix of value if you are if you were optimizing for how do we get this thing as profitable as we can lucrative as you can yeah and had we not gotten bought i would have done that i would actually we were about to change it we were about to make that change and by the way what happens to trends now people still pay for it or it's free now um they pay for it we might lower the price before we were either gonna make that the back end or we're gonna make that the front end but we were gonna copy this model of a 99 thing and then a two thousand dollar thing yeah dude when i see companies like this it just makes me want to do it so badly uh because it's like it just seems so doable now i know that in practice we're not in by the way we get we get heat for this sometimes because we're like dude it's so easy it's so simple we're talking like relatively like building a successful business is hard okay like it's not just we're not saying things are easy sometimes we actually do say that word easy really what we mean is simple so like being able to bench 500 pounds that is um um simple like it's straight forward here's how you get strong in the bench press you lift a lot and then you eat a ton now that is quite hard to do for five years but that's that was that's the steps you take so it's like simple and so what we're saying is that this is simple it's not yeah actually i think i think weight loss is actually a better example because 500 pounds is a hard thing to bench weight loss is literally simple where it's like hey you need to eat these you know avoid carbs avoid sugars you need to eat a little bit less less calories than you're burning and like you should work out regularly do kind of whatever just try to get an hour a day of you know break a sweat if you actually just did those two things and be like hey give it like four to five months six months boom you're in great shape everybody knows that formula it is actually simple executing it and doing it having the discipline and having the rigor to like actually stick to it hard but it is way easier relatively than becoming a crossfit champion right and so when we're talking about business the scale is that it's like it's hard to create the next facebook that's really freaking hard uh is it hard to create a paid community well i don't think most people who try it will do it but it's relatively way easier than creating the next facebook so for people that out there that get all sensitive when we call something easy it's not we're not trying to mislead you like yeah it's gonna take work most likely it won't work it'll take some time but we're on a scale of one to spacex this is more like a one than it is a spacex and like that's that's a scale for people to think about i completely agree and um i think like now let's talk about what makes this hard the first and is that you have to sell your soul a little bit now many people will not be comfortable with this stuff sean is pretty comfortable with it i think i'm comfortable with it but i think i'm a little bit less comfortable with it you have to be a face sometimes you have to be you have to say i'm an expert at x pay me money to for me to tell you my thoughts right second um well no this is off that so guys like james altucher who we've had this podcast he was ridiculed for doing this with bitcoin everyone made fun of him he made 60 million dollars doing it but he still got mocked constantly and shockingly most people would actually prefer not to make the money and not get made fun of than they would to make the money and get made fun of well the way i think about it is most people truly will not they are afraid that they're gonna get them not gonna get the money and get mocked and so they're like [ __ ] it i won't do it if you really had a guarantee i think people would happily trade reputation points for bank points well yeah and perhaps but that's not moot point because the fact is is that most people don't even want to because the first point you said of like they may not get the money at all that is also true and that's what they're they're not going to do that so you have to do that second it's a treadmill you can't stop this is a lifetime job so if you're a content creator you i hired people to do it for me you 100 can do that but you're gonna you can't you have to you actually have to do the work for a little while in the anyway so you're gonna have to work and by the way uh quick question on hiring because people ask me this and i have no idea i'm like why don't you ask sam he's the one who did it why are you asking me they'll be like dude the hustle has had amazing talent like they talk about trung they talk about steph smith some of the people you guys do me i mean right i mean i consider you be part of our crew you me trung steph it's got colby we've got yeah we've got a bunch of people so so the question is where the heck did you find these people so can you give me the 10 seconds on each where'd you find chung where'd you find steph where'd you find colby where'd you find you know all these people colby was uh worked at a pr firm where he was doing some copywriting work uh and uh trung uh eamonn did he just apply to you or you like recognize like oh this guy's good mutual connection friend of a friend said you should talk to this person uh trung came from eamon troy a mutual friend and investor of the hustle steph uh i found on twitter because i read her blog who else i'd say i just kind of want to know and then when you found these people are you what's your did you cycle through 30 people who kind of sort of stopped before you found the gems when we actually sold to hubspot they're like wow you guys have a lot of churn i'm like yeah but here's what we do like this is actually quite normal in the editorial industry but you hire a bunch of people and you've got a you you either fire or there's a mutual like all right we tried it it wouldn't fit um and that happens a lot um yeah and you also when you have to do the tone i would say that was also a key right because you were writing it originally and so you yeah and you called it interesting people you saw the trends community like i was the one actually doing every day you were posting in that thing yeah and that sets the culture and it attracts like-minded people um i also think that um once you find the winners then you go all in on them so trung is what i call he's a made man steph a made woman whatever steph wants to do something cool sounds good what do you need uh when other people come with an idea trying to double that number whatever's number sam gave you time to double it these guys are all doing great um whenever if if an outside person or if a non-made person comes with an idea it's you know why don't you just show me a little mvp and let's see what people think if trung says something it's all right yes sir right yeah like you're a proven hitmaker so and then the um the last thing is when we interview them i always ask about the bottom fourth of the resume which is like the college classes and all the things that they take because i want them to like entertain me during the interview so in the same way that you are really good at storytelling you have to have other people that are good storytelling right right okay i like it um can we do one idea real quick before we we jump so um this is kind of kind of kind of going to feel like it's out of left field but i would say there's something interesting here so i light it on the page oh yeah uh so i'm down here uh virtual team building so for a long time people have had this problem of we have a team we're working on stuff together you know as the boss you're you know sometimes you got to crack the whip and it feels like it's just task after task and deadline after deadline and you want to make sure that this team is really coming together and is bonded and you want people to have a good time here and you don't want them to leave and all the good all the good things you care about your people the experience they have working for you and so in the old world this was different team building solutions and so we would do off-site i don't know what you did with the hustle crew but like you know some people go to a shooting range some people go to an escape room some people do like you know um painting and wine tasting and whatever you know what i liked most just like a fancy dinner right yeah let's go out to dinner right let's go to a cool place i you know it's on me order what you want type it yeah i just like go we would do like fancy dinners right and um and and this is every team literally i heard a nba coach talking about this the other day he goes man we got all these new players so hard with kovid because in the old days you just go to the bar you put your card behind the tab you know and you say all the drinks are on me tonight you know go crazy guys he's like he's like you didn't have to like have conversations like you just needed to give guys a night out together and good things will happen and um and so with the you know we have this remote work trend everybody's going remote um so how are those teams gonna do it how are they gonna do team bonding because although you get to spend more time with your family and you get not less time and traffic commuting you do lose the water cooler you lose the team bonding so how are people going to do this so i've seen some cool companies popping up that are doing this and i think they're doing quite well so i want to point out a couple and then get your take on if you think these are good ideas bad ideas or how you would do it so the first couple of team team rock team rotary is that right yeah team rotary like camaraderie but for a team and so this is actually backed by some pretty legit players like some pretty pretty famous people in silicon valley which i'm surprised at because it kind of just looks like a goofy like they seem like small bootstrapped ideas but actually they have some big backing because i think people recognize the spaces companies pay tens of thousands of dollars per division a year to have team bonding and so then you know in a big company you have you know easily high six figures low seven figures worth of spend on uh on this type of thing that's my guess uh i'm not in the finance team so maybe i'm off but i think that's about right i'm sorry first of all team rotary looks interesting horrible name what an awful name um they've got a pretty badass uh a pretty badass set of advisors guys like heather boy who seems to hate everything as you've said uh is on their advisor or their board pretty interesting yeah exactly so he's on this and it says trusted by three 300 plus global teams you see pinterest who's that you don't remember summer sanders she was from and uh she was like a swimmer in the 90s and then was the host of all the nickelodeon tv shows no way that's that's hilarious summer sanders works at product development at team rotary so like you know you could do things so if i click their experiences right i click the bond and engage category so it's like a coffee and tea tasting a wine tasting a guacamole tasting a painting class or whatever it could be if you do kick off kick team kickoffs uh okay we got our guacamole tasting again but we also have the high-heeled shoe project a lesson for inclusion um you know so there's these like uh kind of team experiences lessons in a box or bonding in a box experience it so that's one then our friend from the pod greg eisenberg created one called nice break dot fun um dude this guy loves like cute names yeah give me give me a name check how do you feel about nice break that fun it's okay it's good he loves like he he love greg is like the coolest guy in my company like public school or like school works or like school bus like well his studio is called late checkout checkout like you know the grocery store i remember being like why did you open this agency late check out it seems like a weird thing to do like you're an entrepreneur why are you doing this like kind of like product design creative agency thing and um and then every week he's like yeah we're like i'll put i'll post a cool product that i think is awesome he's like oh yeah we worked with him we designed the prototype i'm like he's doing it for all of them i'm like oh actually this is [ __ ] awesome you're like on the ground floor of all these things you can invest in them you're meeting them you're like seeing all these spaces and getting paid to do it like okay that's pretty cool and he's using that to fund his own in his own projects they're their own internal projects which i don't know that's that's actually a pretty cool way of doing it but they have things like a comedian will do like an improv class with you guys over zoom or a virtual escape room or a um you know a wardrobe makeover or stuff like that right so i think this is kind of cool and there's other products like this that are like just a straight up zoom escape room it's like eight people enter one hour goes on the clock and the whole thing happens in zoom so i think there's this is going to be i think a pretty big space that starts out looking like a toy but ends up being a pretty pretty solid business what do you think yeah i first of all late checkout.com or sorry uh with latecheckout.com is greg it's uh mostly shawn's buddy uh he's got a community community design firm go to that website and look at what he's doing it's really good that guy is really good um nice break fun nice breakdown fun i think it's cool they're charging a lot of money which i think is badass so they charge two thousand 000 a month plus okay so a grand a month gets you two nice breaks per month for and that's for companies that are 25 to 50. if you're okay i understand how this works uh yeah this could break this could be a hit i think this is great i think this could totally be a hit can it be a huge vc thing i don't know but this could make tens of millions of dollars in the subscriptions exactly and the other thing is um one way to think about problems like these or find opportunities like these is you go uh in the c-suite so you say okay there's a ceo there's a cmo there's a cto cfo cio whatever right you go through all of them and we were laughing because you were like what the hell is a chro so this is what a chro thinks about they're the chief people officer essentially of a of a company i kind of use this interchangeably maybe there's some nuance difference sorry to you know the three chroes that listen to this podcast um i didn't mean to to uh what is the chr chief human resources i think uh officers right so so they think about the stuff right they're like okay the whole workforce has just gone remote we really care about what's called employee engagement which just means how happy are people to work here are they going to leave are they going to is this a toxic work environment or not and so then they have this do you so one thing you could do is you go talk to these people and you just sort of say what sucks what's what's keeping you up at night what are you stressing about and you start to ask these questions and at first they won't give you a whole bunch but then you say all right can you show me your budget for the year oh wow you spend a lot of money on you know people development what is people development means and it's like oh that's corporate training and blah blah blah oh interesting who do you guys use for that you go look up those companies that is like some people sometimes people ask like how do you guys think of these things that's how we learn these things it's like we just start to sniff in these types of ways and you start to learn about all these spaces that are outside of just your day-to-day world view so if you're out there as an entrepreneur trying to figure out where can i build a company where there's i don't want to just guess on demand this is one way you go talk to somebody who's in charge you figure out what their what's stressing them out what problems they need solved what language they use when they describe it that's your landing page that's your ad and then you look at their budget and you see do the does the money map to the problem and if the money maps to the problem you start to see oh okay and you ask them hey which budget line item is growing a lot year over year which which line item was smaller last year and bigger this year because that's the space where they're still looking for new solutions and you could do that for an individual as well i think what you can do is you can go sign up for mint or whatever and just look at the categories of your money and just look at the trailing 12 months and be like wait what am i consistently spending money on and do that with five or 10 friends and that's actually a great way to find an idea and doing it with businesses is far more profitable so you just go and you look at they're co you look at quickbooks and you say all right what's going on here where's all the money going to right it's an awesome way that's actually kind of a cool business in itself which is like how do i how do i what like wallet share like how do i just see how call wallet share these people are moms in america where is their wallet going right like what are they spending their time and money on i think you know big brands like i don't know procter gamble they they think about this a lot they interview a ton of moms they say oh okay you know the mom controls this much of the household budget you know 70 percent or whatever and then within that every month she's spending x percent on groceries y percent on household cleaners this percent on this 60 on this and that's how they decide okay we need to invest our product development according to where the budget is um because that's how that's how we make our money back that's such an interesting way to do things like i guess you could do it how many public companies there's two thousand public companies in america you could easily or i think there's like four thousand something four thousand uh however many michael actually said last episode four thousand let's say you could easily do that with with all their categories right you can't see line items but you could see like gna or but you might be that's kind of an interesting study right and uh and you can do this with just media companies how are media what what does the expenses look like of a media company where are they allocating you know where where are they where do they spend all their money and where which which ones are changing uh over time where is things shifting and so i think that's kind of like an interesting signal that you can use at the company level one um division in a company an individual person whatever and i think you get a lot of insights from that i think that's a great idea i think what we just said of like did you make up that name wallet share is that a thing uh i think that's a term in general um like it's it's a general term but but um i've also seen this by the way in terms of for in the social networking space in terms of time so wechat i think or um one of the chinese companies they had this presentation i saw and you know i'm sitting there trying to go through a chinese presentation so you know maybe someone's lost translation but i got the general idea which was they want an app for every minute of your day because china has all these like super apps like wechat you can pay your house bills in it and it's like whatsapp and you can also like subscribe to netflix through it you know their version of netflix but it's also like you know where you post photos and something like that so what they said was like they took a person's day so they're like okay 15 year old kid wakes up in the morning at this time first 10 minutes of the day what what products are they using what apps are they using and they start to break it down minute by minute basically like what where are their gaps so today we're taking up four hours of this person's time if they're awake for 12 hours how do we spend how do we get 12 hours of their or 16 hours how do we get 16 hours of mind share from this person well they watch movies at night we need an app for movies well during the day they need they message their friends we need that they need news they get the news all right cool we're going to do news and that's how they they think about because how do they expand if you're an ad based business you need attention so how do i get more attention well i need more hours of the day of yours how do i get more hours of the day well i got to figure out how you spend it today and i got to insert myself there i have a few friends that have worked on those on that at facebook where they were like all right we have found out that if you put stickers onto photos people spend like five seconds more and they have like 50 people just working on stickers and i'm just like kill yourself uh like these people hated their job dude one of my best friends his job at facebook was literally he was in the you know it was called like security and safety and privacy of community or something like that department and literally he's like i just try to make sure a dick doesn't show up on your facebook feed he's like so uh he's like you wouldn't believe how many dicks are posted on facebook every day he's like have you ever seen a dick and i was like no never not one he's like that's right at least there's that's cool you're like trying to protect people whatever that's cool but he's like i'm writing like he's like i'm reviewing folders of images that are just being like dick not a dick dick not a dick right and then like also same thing on the algorithm side like we were writing programs to train the computer to recognize this verse that and he's like it's a cat mass game always harder than you think they're always one step ahead like dimes or sean's d [Laughter] no that's just about a dollar in pennies [Laughter] they uh but yeah i mean at least that job is all right but like i can't imagine working at a facebook or an instagram and just all i'm trying to do is suck more of people's time um yeah it is sad when you think about it like the the best brains of our generation are basically sitting inside the giant slot machine and being like okay how do we how do we get the rat to come back again you know like how do we get her to come back more and more and more and spend more time and more time right like that's the reality and it's like hey i get paid 500 000 a year to do this and i get free lunch and they do my laundry and i get foot massages on fridays and like people think i'm joking that's those are all true things that happen um before we wrap up did you see that you were you so you and i are one for one of being turned into meme so you posted something like i'm looking for a meme creator 500 a month no vacation and uh you posted all this other funny stuff and people like mocked you uh liquidity a bunch of people mocked you it's pretty great i think hopefully they realize that like we do this [ __ ] on purpose yeah or like it's not even okay like okay i'd love to say huh i'm in on the joke i knew this like yeah i knew it was silly but like i didn't think anything would turn into like we know like we're self-aware enough to know this is like like mockable i wrote no vacation it's not even a real job like of course this is a fake job posting i'm not fake it's like i'm basically like just being like hey does someone want a side hustle for me by making a bunch of memes you can make 500 bucks a month just make me a few memes every week that's really what i was trying to say but if i say that it's only going to get like 100 likes but if i say it the way i said it over the top boom i got thousands of likes and the things spread and a bunch of people got angry and literally like taylor lorenz was like why does this person not get sick leave because and so um yeah we're kind of doing this on purpose but also i am just kind of a character and like i don't i'm just saying things you know as i think them and then i move on with my life and like i win either way like i win if if you get mad i win if you you know like if you take it seriously and um you apply i win like it's i win i win no matter what as long as i don't get completely canceled i win which might happen one day soon but we'll have we'll have fun until then um and i will explain someday why i am hiring uh a personal meme god to uh to to do some memes for me i will explain you have to explain that why i mean there's nothing no there's something there's actually a cool story um there's actually a cool story around it but uh it's not quite ready yet the story will be cooler if i put the whole thing together and then explain it when it's uh when it's ready so that will come in i don't know a couple months um and i guess you'll have to share some of the best ones you got yes sir um all right that's it i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to travel never looking back

The Hustle presents - My First Million. A podcast where we brainstorm new business ideas based on trends & opportunities we see in the market. Sometimes we have famous guests, and they do it with us.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
you own a a ton of domain names right yeah i bought a bunch like how many do you own now or how many have you i won't count all i mean i own hundreds and hundreds but the ones that are our top level primary domain names about 16. i like words in the english language that everybody understands like i own emma uh frank i own my own name i own michael.com i also own my nickname mike.com uh so like my personal website i've got it on michael.com you just type michael.com you see all the stuff about me uh hope yes sam go to hope.com see where that takes you go to hope.com yeah well actually bitcoin is hope so if you type hope.com you get everything there is a know about bitcoin i actually repath hope to all of our bitcoin resources and materials uh speaker i i owned voice.com and i sold it for 30 million dollars a couple years ago that's the largest uh naked domain sale in the history of domain so tell them tell the short version of that story the story is kind of crazy i've heard it once before but i i would assume sam and most people have not heard the story of sellingvoice.com you bought all these early on in the web you kind of recognized oh these are these are probably going to be valuable to own these names there's only one you know there's only one owner of each of these names you you own it and you hold it for a really long time like over a decade and uh at some point you decide okay maybe we should see if somebody wants to buy some of these so tell the story of sellingvoice.com real quick well yeah we i i bought all these domains because i thought wouldn't it be great to own a part of the english language i mean owning hope or owning voice i mean eventually there'll be a google voice so there'll be you know some some telco company that'll want to launch some service and what a great domain on to launch on the on a word like voice.com so we held them a long time and and uh i think at some point we were looking for joint ventures we're looking to commercialize them and we did commercialize a bunch for example i created a company called alarm.com and alarm.com is now publicly traded on nasdaq it's like four or five billion dollar market cap company and and you can guess what it does it actually integrates your home alarm into the internet you know and i created another company called angel.com and we saw that for a bit more than 100 million dollars and that was actually a speech interactive voice response like surrey or alexa before siri and alexa came along and uh so i had voice and i was holding it and we're looking for some kind of good uh commercialization and someone out of the blue they contacted us one of the domain brokers and they said well you know do you want to sell it we'll give you 150 000. and uh and i you know i was like someone came to me said they have 250 000 i said no so i thought nothing of it because i just i couldn't see the point a week later they come back and say well they doubled it to 300 000 i said tell them no so a couple days later they go well the broker's really insistent uh and so they went to 600 000. i said no so they said well what should you say i said don't tell anything tell them you know like we're not interested it's got to be something serious so they went to 1.2 million i said tell them no i said well they want to know what you want for it i said um well send them a note or something and just tell them i said it's like it's it's the word voice in the english language right so it's gonna have to be something you know north of uh i don't know i don't think i said seven or eight eight figures but i just said a lot of money um and so it went on and they doubled again to two and a half million and then uh and then uh 5 million and then around 10 million then i said they said i had like 18 people in my office they're like or not eight but eight eight people they're like looking at me like aren't you are you gonna take the money it's like a lot of money now i said uh no send them back uh at this point send them back an a note pointing out that this is like the word voice in the english language and it's and it's it's worth a billion dollars to the right company and uh they said well you're going to give him a response i said uh okay tell him 30 million tell him i'll take 30 million for it because i thought like if i didn't give them some number they would stop negotiating after you know five no's so i said tom 30 man i don't want to sell it for 30 million i want to sell it for 100 million or more but i guess i'll say 30 million so that so at that point they said well you know they offered you i think they upped their their offer to like um 12 million i said tell them uh no but if you want i'll take a meeting with them so when it got to 12 million i said i'd get on the phone for half an hour so then we got on the phone and the call started with someone saying well how about 22 million and i said um let me explain this is like my daughter like i'm willing to i'm willing to like marry her off but only to a man that values her more than i value her i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road travel never looking back

for everyone 7.8 billion people for 100 million companies for everyone with money on earth and everyone that earns a salary on earth this is the big idea of the podcast you have to yeah i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking what's up everybody we got a special guest in the house michael saylor the um have you heard the nickname they give you on youtube the giga chad have you seen this one i might have heard it once or twice so michael um go ahead charlie i was going to ask you something have you heard this nickname that they give that they gave michael sailor the crypto no the community you know sort of give it and take it away you know they are extremely passionate and uh devoted but they are also you know just nuts online like my my twitter mentions are unusable now i'm sure michaels are the same just because of that group but they are funny also so they they nicknamed him the gigachad because he is sort of like probably the most credible established person and company with microstrategy to adopt bitcoin in a major major way and really um is driving the kind of institutional pickup of it so if you're listening this you've never heard of michael saylor the reason to listen to this is pretty interesting guy had a really interesting career but most notably uh most known now for basically using his company microstrategy and buying about two billion dollars worth of bitcoin or they own two billion dollars with a bitcoin bought about i don't know how much you guys put in half a billion or a billion no um we uh we bought uh 2.2 billion worth of bitcoin we own about five a bit more than five billion depending upon the day wow more than five billion in bitcoin okay all right so you uh you you have a for not everyone's gonna be able to see this but you have a ship behind you right like a huge what is that it's an antique handmade model a 19th century model of a 17th century galleon like i think a model to amsterdam a a galleon that sailed out of amsterdam in the 17th century and it was uh it was made in the 19th century so it's a very interesting piece are you um are you a car guy i have a bunch of cars but no i'm not a car guy what's the coolest one you have i i lean toward suvs i have a bunch of suvs i had had a a lexus convertible that i used to love that i drove a lot but i i don't really drive a lot so you can go so you can give sam a great sam just sold his company came into a bunch of money and he bought what what did you buy sam okay so i was driving at all this weekend and i've been getting made fun of i can't believe people are making fun of me do you know what an amg station wagon is like a mercedes amg i can imagine okay so basically there's mercedes which is everyone knows mercedes and then there's amg which is like a subsidiary and they basically put race car engines into cars um and i bought this but the problem about fast cars and cool cars is that they're like super unpractical mostly and but i wanted something that was like kind of fast and fun to drive but i wanted to be more practical and there's this thing called an amg e63 wagon it's a station wagon it looks like a mom car except you can put your dog in the back and it has five seats and but still goes zero to 60 in three seconds so i bought a souped-up station wagon like the one of the fastest cars in the road but it's a station wagon that's my that's currently what i'm driving right now it works for you well i was looking for someone to geek out on it but i guess that you're you're i would have i for some reason i pegged you as a car guy but i guess i'm wrong um i'm more into boats and planes than cars what do you what what does that mean if you're into planes well i like i like aircraft because if an aircraft can go mach 89 or mach 85 you're allowed to legally fly it that fast is mach 8 like 2 000 miles an hour no market five like uh like 500 knots like or something like that so the point is like airplanes can fly at their full speed and and yachts or boats can go at their full speed over the water but an automobile that could go 160 miles an hour you don't very often get to do that legally so so i i like vehicles that you can operate at their design point legally and safely well what planes do you have healing as an engineer i have a global express xrs um before we get into bitcoin stuff and because shawn's been talking about you for like a year now uh because he was following a micro strategy and all that but um you own a a ton of domain names right yeah i bought a bunch like how many do you own now or how many have you i won't count all the i mean i own hundreds and hundreds but the ones that are are top level primary domain names about 16 i like words in the english language that everybody understands like i own emma uh frank i own my own name i own michael.com i also own my nickname mike.com uh so like my personal website i've got it on michael.com you just type michael.com you see all the stuff about me hope yes sam go go to hope.com see where that takes you go to hope.com yeah well actually bitcoin is hope so if you type hope.com you get everything there is a know about bitcoin i actually repath hope to all of our bitcoin resources and materials uh speaker i i owned voice.com i sold it for 30 million dollars a couple years ago that's the largest uh naked domain sale in the history of domain tell the short version of that story the story is kind of crazy i've heard it once before but i i would assume sam and most people have not heard the story of sellingvoice.com you bought all these early on in the web you kind of recognized oh these are these are probably going to be valuable to own these names there's only one you know there's only one owner of each of these names you own it and you hold it for a really long time like over a decade and uh at some point you decide okay maybe we should see if somebody wants to buy some of these so tell the story of sellingvoice.com real quick well yeah we i i bought all these domains because i thought wouldn't it be great to own a part of the english language i mean owning hope or owning voice i mean eventually there'll be a google voice so there'll be you know some some telco company that'll want to launch some service and what a great domain on to launch on the on a word like voice.com so we held them a long time and and uh i think at some point we were looking for joint ventures we're looking to commercialize them and we did commercialize a bunch for example i created a company called alarm.com and alarm.com is now publicly traded on nasdaq it's like four or five billion dollar market cap company and and you can guess what it does it actually integrates your home alarm into the internet you know and i created another company called angel.com and we saw that for a bit more than 100 million dollars and that was actually a speech interactive voice response like surrey or alexa before siri and alexa came along and uh so i had voice and i was holding it and we're looking for some kind of good uh commercialization and someone out of the blue they contacted us one of the domain brokers and they said well you know do you want to sell it we'll give you 150 000. uh and i you know i was like someone came to me said they often fifty thousand i said no so i thought nothing of it because i just i couldn't see the point a week later they come back and say well they doubled it to 300 000 i said tell them no so a couple days later they go well the broker's really insistent uh and so they went to six hundred thousand i said no so they said well what should you say i said don't tell anything tell them you know like we're not interested it's got to be something serious so they went to 1.2 million i said tell them no i said well they want to know what you want for it i said um well send them a note or something and just tell them i said it's like it's it's the word voice in the english language right so it's gonna have to be something you know north of uh i don't know i don't think i said seven or eight eight figures but i just said a lot of money um and so it went on and they doubled again to two and a half million and then uh and then uh five million and then around 10 million then i said they said i had like 18 people in my office they're like or not eight but eight eight people they're like looking at me like aren't you are you gonna take the money it's like a lot of money now i said uh no send them back uh at this point send them back an a note pointing out that this is like the word voice in the english language and it's and it's it's worth a billion dollars to the right company and uh they said well you're gonna give them a response i said uh okay tom 30 million tell them i'll take 30 million for it because i thought like if i didn't give them some number they would stop negotiating after you know five no's so i said tom 30 man i don't want to sell it for 30 million i want to sell it for 100 million or more but i guess i'll say 30 million so that so at that point they said well you know they offered you i think they upped their their offer to like 12 million i said tell them uh no but if you want i'll take a meeting with them so when it got to 12 million i said i'd get on the phone for half an hour so then we got on the phone and the call started with someone saying well how about 22 million and i said um let me explain this is like my daughter like i'm willing to i'm willing to like marry her off but only to a man that values her more than i value her so i value this domain you know at 30 million and so if you don't want to give me the 30 you know i'm going to regret after i sell it anyway i'll have sellers remorse but i would i would do it just to make the market but if you don't want to value the 30 i'll just keep it like uh okay we'll give you 30. i said okay so 30 you went you got a 30 from 100k so they did like double seven or eight times and i eventually they started 150k i think and we ended it and i said 30 we ended at 30 but but the point was i didn't really need the money it was a matter like if i had at the point maybe 600 million in cash in the bank and the company the micro strategy was is a multi-billion dollar company so i was like a million is not going to move the needle for me a hundred thousand's not going to move then needle for me five my ten million is not going to move the needle one way or the other so there's no point in doing it unless it was something material were you all like you know the eight people in your office were were they like your co-workers or uh i mean business development the people that wanted the commission on the deal you know so like any any most likely they want to like do the deal and and the only way you get 30 million is to like say no to 22 million right and well like any reasonable most reasonable people which the reason you are where you are is your many would probably consider you not reasonable right i mean you have your your extreme personality type and that's why you're very successful but any reasonable person would say what are you an idiot like you paid nothing for this take it were you but were you always that like uh my view on it is that the english language is going to be important to the human race for a thousand years and a thousand years from now voice will probably still have value just like a lot of like hope it's a valuable word forever i mean until you murder everyone that speaks the english language if you think about how valuable it is my real view is is i think people are are crazy for spending hundreds of millions of dollars on ad campaigns to market a brand that's a misspelling of a normal word it's like i got to convince you how to sell ingention with like two y's and a z you know i'm like why would you do that because in the modern era spell checkers when you try to type these crappy brands that are misspelled that you know your iphone unspells it for you or properly spells it so try going to a website that's a misspelling of a name most brands and most brand consultants i just disagree with them all they you know they charge you a lot of money to come up with a misspelling of a common word and then you spend half a billion dollars marketing the brand a much better idea would be by the word hope or angel or alarm or alert or or voice even if you got to pay a hundred million or 200 million or 500 million dollars because if i see your br your ad and you tell me that you know your brand is alert.com i can remember it in one second i can spell it in one second you leap immediately to the top of the google search engine so i just i always view domains as being undervalued and then mark people spend hundreds of millions of dollars on crappy marketing to send someone to a place they can't spell that they can't remember i think the world will gradually come around to that point of view but they're not there yet but that so that was my view like i didn't want to sell it to tell you the truth like if you owned the word angel or the word alarm or the word hope or voice like the truth is google should have paid a billion dollars for the word voice i mean if they're going to try to launch a voice service it's worth it to them and eventually you know what you're going to see is apple amazon facebook google are just going to keep generating more money but the word voice or the word hope or the you know fill in the blank any kind of positive uh positive easy to spell short word in the english language is going to be an awesome place to build a brand and so right now it looks like you own are you owned or or you're currently trying to reach me i own this strategy wisdom.com alarm.com angel.com a a alert courage mike.com voice.com usher.comhopespeaker.commichaelmikesailer.org so you own a bunch of them yeah and so and so my view is like like trying to sell the i got 20 picassos and i wanted the world of market to value picassos so i sell the first one for 30 million but the next one i want a 100 million for or or i really want you know someone to create a a billion dollar business with me on that right that's the right way to think of it and i mean i look at it this way how many people have learned that have learned to speak english on earth what is that number two billion maybe how many how many years of your life do you learn do you spend learning english i mean a typical person spends it takes english 10 years like from kindergarten through 12 maybe 12 years but let's say that we shorten it 2 billion people spend 4 years of their life and that's 8 billion years of time spent figuring out how to spell and type your brand what's the if you value the 8 billion years at 20 an hour that's 160 billion dollars worth of money spent teaching people that hope is a good thing right what's it worth like what's it worth like to have a brand which is universally understood and easy to spell that's burned into the head of billions of people you know you couldn't you're going to go and buy advertising to convince them that h-o-o-p-e is a good thing hopi or like not really so i i think that um they're just good investments they're scarce real estate and cyberspace and they'll always be good and the world undervalues them but in time like when i tell you alarm.com you can remember alarm you can go type alarm when you get off this podcast anybody that wants to go check out what alarm.com does they don't have to go and like look it up and sort through 197 000 google search pages to figure out which one is the one that sailor was talking about yep my friend uh started com.com.com the meditation app and uh the first thing he did was get the domain basically and uh he decided early on art i'm gonna build a brand around the feeling of being calm and it took the form of a meditation app but he sort of decided up front what it was gonna be and had got that domain and really like had to negotiate to get it and it was you know these domain negotiations go prolonged but but definitely another uh i don't know success story of that that pattern and i'll remember it too by the way like like what you just said you just pitched me on an idea i'll get off and if so off this podcast and if four weeks from now someone asks you so what was that meditation business thing i'll be like c a l m dot com right hopefully they got the right spelling of it right yeah no there's three l's no i'm just joking it's the it's the right one um all right so let's let's talk about works let's talk about something else so you you uh you've been in the game for a while i think you might be how long you've been this you've been like the ceo of microsoft 30 years almost since 1989 so 31 years i've been the public company ceo since 1998. i think sam was born in 1980 public company yeah you've been you've been a publicly traded company or a public ceo longer than i've been a lot and so uh and you've kind of had some ups and downs so i i saw an interview of you on charlie rose um you know you were looking like tom cruise you go on charlie rose and they're you're flying how you're a 34 year old guy who took the company public i think microstrategy was worth 11 billion or something at that point and uh and best of all i think you owned half of it or maybe a little bit more than half of the company and so you're you know a 34 year old billionaire and i think you know a few years later the stock price crashed pretty dramatically uh but you i think there's two kind of remarkable things a i want to hear what was it like to be in that position and then face that crash and then b how the hell did you keep your job was it because you owned a controlling stake in the company because most ceos cannot survive a stock price crash from 300 something dollars a share to under 50 cents a share how did that happen you know i think if you if you're in business long enough you're gonna have setbacks and you know you can't let the setbacks crush your spirit or or or cause you to stop thinking and stop innovating and stop growing so i mean they're humbling uh well we all kind of know that's the right answer but like when sorry we all kind of know that's the right answer like hey setbacks happen you gotta pick yourself up and that's true and everybody sort of agrees but when it does happen what like do you remember what that felt like what the day was when when when you're experiencing this crash what were you thinking as it was happening it's not pleasant it's not pleasant but you know you have to move on right yeah you have to focus you have responsibilities okay and you're you were talking about at one point you're like all right when i was selling this domain when did you sell that domain name how many years ago um two years ago maybe okay so not that long ago actually but you were saying like well we had i had 600 million dollars in cash with the company was doing great why continue staying as the ceo when it seems like you're incredibly i mean bitcoin seems like you're one of your main top two focuses next to microstrategy why not just focus entirely on that as opposed to continuing continuing to run this business well first of all the the business has two strategies and the first strategy is we sell business intelligence software to our customers and the second strategy is we acquire and hold bitcoin that is the business got it and um and and if you look at what we've done we um we bought uh 250 million dollars worth of bitcoin that we had generated as a publicly traded company so without the business we couldn't have bought the first 250 million of bitcoin and that required you know an intricate set of of um due diligence and disclosures then we did a dutch tender offer but basically it's an an equity offering of sorts of you could think of it that way but we did a we did um a reverse dutch auction and with the res at the end of that point we bought another 175 million worth of bitcoin and so that's another thing you have to have to be a public company to do then we swept our cash flows as a public company into bitcoin we bought 50 million more bitcoin and uh without the company couldn't have done it then we did a convertible debt offering for 650 million dollars of debt at 75 basis points and without being a public company we couldn't have done that one either we bought bitcoin and then it went up again and then we did we bought some more with cash flow and then we did a billion dollar debt offering and we did that billion dollar convert offering at zero percent interest you couldn't have done that without being a public company so there are benefits to being a public company public companies are credible they're really the gold standard as a counterparty right i mean there's a hundred million companies in the world there's only about 4 000 publicly traded companies on u.s listed exchanges so it's a very very rare thing you have to go through a huge amount of of compliance you know we're we're filing 10 queues 10ks we've got a lot of a lot of compliance architecture security architecture i'm signing sarbanes-oxley statements you know every quarter right we're responsible for fcpa you know et cetera responsibility so that gives that gives investors comfort with a publicly traded company so probably the most important thing to to take away from the podcast is bitcoin is an exploding uh asset class it's it's really it's it's the greatest treasury reserve asset of our lifetimes and it's the solution to every company's treasury problem so if you have a corporation that has capital or generates cash flow you can immediately double or improve the value of the company or dramatically enhance the value of the company simply by changing your treasury policy so if you take with cash and you invest in bitcoin you have inves you've converted a liability to an asset and so so i was enhancing the value of the company by pursuing the bitcoin strategy they go together they're synergistic so let's let's lay out the the kind of the context for people who don't know exactly how it all played out because i would say in our audience right we're going to get about 300 400 000 listeners this month and in that audience probably you know five percent are as crazy about bitcoin as me um and have put like you know you know a huge chunk of their net worth into bitcoin and then you know fifty percent are curious and fifty percent are novices let's say you know just roughly rounding things out and so just to put into context microstrategy is this couple billion dollar public company it's been around for a while has a good track record has a business selling enterprise software you generate a ton of cash your business spits off cash you have about 500 600 million i'm just using fuzzy numbers doesn't specifics don't matter you use about 500 600 billion dollars of cash that's your treasury for your company and you're looking for something to do with it and at some point you realize you have this treasury problem and um and you're not alone actually all companies have this treasury problem whether they are aware of it or not so can you describe the treasury problem that you experienced and you experienced it at a 500 million dollar level but anybody including an individual with 500 000 or about you know 100 000 in the bank has the same fundamental problem so explain the treasury problem as you saw it a few years ago or yeah the treasury problem is that subsequent to march 2020 the cost of capital exploded from eight percent to 25 percent and uh you can see that in the performance of the s p 500 index which went from about eight percent a year for a decade to more than 25 in that next year that means that anybody investing money on behalf of a of a limited partner or any other investor has to generate that cost of capital in order to avoid destroying wealth if you inve if you generated less than a eight percent yield for the decade from 2010 to 2020 as a financial advisor you destroyed wealth because the alternative was just to buy the spy index if you generated less than 25 from march of 2020 onward you destroyed wealth because you could have made 25 actually a bit more depending on what day of the week you measure it or what day of the year you measure it you could have generated that much just by owning the index now um the pro the treasury problem is that when the cost of capital is zero if by the way the cost of capital is being driven by the expansion of the money supply the federal reserve is expanding the m2 money supply by about five to six percent a year for that decade and when you tack on the risk premium you get to your 8 s p return when the when the federal reserve expands the m2 money supply by 20 to 25 that's where you get that explosion and the cost of capital the inflation doesn't show up in consumer goods the inflation immediately shows up in assets we have asset inflation within minutes of when uh the central bank uh decides to stimulate the economy the price of all the assets explodes um and so the problem for every company all 100 million companies in the world every private company every public company the problem is you have capital in your treasury and that capital has to yield the cost to capital and if it doesn't you're destroying shareholder value another way to say it is if you generate cash and you put it into the bank account to pay zero interest and if if the cost of everything you want to buy goes up by 10 a year in seven years you'll only be able to buy half as much you've lost half of the value of your savings when that discount rate or that cost of capital doubles well then in three and a half years you've lost half your money at a 25 cost of capital in three years you've lost half your wealth so the treasury problem is the cost of capital has exploded and the cost of capital as it goes through the roof puts every company in a quandary they either have to decapitalize and give all of their assets back to their shareholders because they can't if sam is controlling an investment company that invests in dollars and you are running an investment company that invests in the s p 5 index and i gave each of you a million and sam proudly tells me how he didn't lose my money and you tell me you made 25 return i'm pulling all my money out of sam's fund and i'm putting it into your fund so ultimately that the problem is the company's sitting on capital if it can't meet the cost of capital it has to give the money back to the shareholders or at least it's under extreme political pressure from the show everybody's beating you up as ceo saying what are you doing with all that cash you should just pay a dividend or you should buy the stock back and um and the second pressure you have is if you run a company and your cash flows are growing at eight percent a year but the cost of capital is 25 a year that means that i'm discounting you at a rate that's higher than your growth rate in essence the value of your stock is going to be forecast to go to zero you can't hold value in a company growing at five percent a year when the cost of capital is 25 percent a year that's why the only thing you can buy is going to be a high-tech stock that's growing you need to buy a tech monopoly that can grow 20 or 25 a year and if you come to me with a business idea for a company which makes a lot of cash or is makes a lot of money but it's growing two percent a year or one percent a year i'm just not interested in a high cost of capital environment so the problem we faced in march is what do we do give all the money back to the shareholders or can we find something to invest in that that's going to actually generate more than 25 return and that puts us to a question so what we did in essence was split the difference you know if if i was in a situation in the ideal situation you would just buy 500 million worth of bitcoin and put out a press release and do it but if you did that that would be such a shock to the outside shareholders that the fear would be well is someone going to sue us or dump the stock because you were so aggressive because they'll claim that you took a risk that you didn't disclose so our response is let's disclose everybody we're about to take a risk and after that let's go ahead and take a risk but at the same time let's give everybody an insurance policy so we we offered to buy back 250 million dollars worth of the stock in this dutch auction so if you disagree with the decision to buy bitcoin you can sell the stock back at a at a profit our stock was 120 we offered to buy uh the stock back at up to 140 and so we cushioned the blow of the investment strategy by giving people an exit strategy from the equity that rotates the shareholder base and then we began to pursue the bitcoin strategy as a primary treasury reserve asset with uh with a different shareholder base so let me ask you a question now you know i i like the analogy or the kind of the awareness that hey we have this giant bowl of ice cream that's melting that's that's your cash pile that's melting and the heat is basically the money printer that is uh causing acid inflation ice cube that's melting and i save a 500 million dollar ice cube and it's melting 20 percent a year and it'll be gone and fine so you needed to do something with that you didn't want it to all melt away so you decided to do this now a couple quick questions one is uh this is sort of rapid fire i've got a couple rapid fire questions for you in 20 years from now what do you think has generated more value uh or more income to the company to microstrategy is it the operating income of microstrategy or the investment income of the bitcoin it holds the investment income for sure okay and then uh you now to be to be very clear what happened in march of 2020 is when the cost of capital goes to 25 percent that means that every investor and all investment income every every investor generated 25 percent more doing nothing right and every main street company that worked 25 harder got nothing right right you literally tilt the playing field so that if you don't own if you own an assets you're having the best year of the 30 years and if you don't own assets it's impossible to have a good year right and um and so so the second question is um you uh as you acquire as you acquire more and more bitcoin is microstrategy bet like do you just position the company at this point like it's a bitcoin etf it's like buy this buy this bitcoin buying it it's not a bitcoin etf everybody's you're sloppy with those words an etf is a company that invests in securities and it tries to keep its assets under management equal to the amount of shares of etf that it sold it's a financial company an etp is a similar type of company that invests in commodities if you create you know if you create this bitcoin entity that that equalizes assets under management equal to the shares you sell you created a bitcoin etp we're neither of those things we're not a finance company we're not an etf we're not an etp we're not eq we're not buying or selling bitcoin to equalize assets under management we're uh an operating company that owns property bitcoin is property and in that way you should think of it as a company that like i i bought a million acres of land in texas or i bought a million gallons of of fill in the blank a million bushels of soybean you can buy any kind of property right and and you're holding it on your balance sheet as a company right that's what we uh that's what we are now what's your question you are talking about like let's say the the cost of capital uh being 25 right because since march that's what the s p500 has done but the stock market goes you know it does go up and down in years where you know the market dips and and goes up you know the average or you know over time the geometric mean is whatever seven or eight percent something like that so some would argue okay yes this year assets inflated by that much that doesn't mean next year it's going to remain at 25 a year um and so you have to make some prediction right and so are you are you basically forecasting it at 25 15 10 percent and does the decision change at a certain number there so so gen first of all for the decade from 2010 to 2020 it was generally about eight percent like it was it was pretty consistent and the single biggest driver of cost to capital is the rate at which the broad money supply expands and if you look at if you go google m2 money supply fed you'll get a chart and you'll see the tr by the way the chart's not all over the place the chart is very consistent seven percent slope for a decade it's not jerking around so it's not that volatile it was very consistent monetary policy for a decade then that chart goes like this straight up 24 so if you uh if if you're going to make a decision as an investor and this is any investor what this this has to do this applies to all 400 trillion dollars worth of investors and it applies to every company on earth they all have the same exact thing they have to calculate which is you have to estimate the rate at which the money supply will expand each year for the next eight years and so that's the same if you want to figure out the signal or or the single most important thing in the world for everyone but for everyone 7.8 billion people for 100 million companies for everyone with money on earth and everyone that earns a salary on earth this is the big idea of the podcast you have to estimate the rate at which the currency is going to expand and if you believe the currency is going to continue to expand at 15 percent a year for the next eight years you come to one conclusion if you plug in 10 it's a different conclusion if it's 25 it's a different conclusion so what do i think i think that um 15 is 15 for the next eight years is reasonable um if you're a pessimist you could say 20 if you're an optimist you could say 10 but the money supply is expanding because the federal reserve and the eu central bank are buying a trillion dollars worth of um bonds every year each and it's also expanding because uh the the government of the eu and the u.s are running a multi-trillion dollar deficit and it is also expanding because of trillion dollar plus stimulus and there's no reason to think that's going to change in the next four years and i don't think in the next eight years i think i think that at the point that the democrats took control of the senate and the house you saw that you have um if you could have you could have forecasted 12 percent inflation if it was a it was a split government but i think that in a a non-split government there seems to be remarkable consensus that we should run deficits continue to keep interest rates low and continue to stimulate the economy so what does that mean if you plug in a number 15 it means that the risk-free interest rate or the the risk-free return is 15 it means you have to generate in excess of 15 on your money every year for the next four years in order to stay ahead of the rate of asset inflation a reasonable person would say the assets are going to inflate at that rate that's that's pretty much what they do that means that if your company is not growing its cash flows you know at a 20 rate then it's not going to hold value as a stock it means that if your bond is paying you an interest rate of less than 15 percent you're destroying value in the bond if your rent yield is less than 15 your commercial real estate's destroying value and if you're holding cash you're losing 15 percent of it a year that's that's the negative real yield so once you actually embrace the idea of asset inflation and asset inflation equals cost to capital equals the rate of the money supply expansion once you have that rate then you realize that there's a negative real real yield on everything except for bitcoin for the most part the negative real yield on gold is three percent that's the rate at which we mine it or hypothecate it the negative real yield on sovereign debt is about 12 13 the negative real yield on corporate debt is 10 percent every company that's got a growth rate of less than 15 percent has got a negative real yield on it so you know once you do that then you can then what you realize is you can't really have a business strategy as a company unless you find a way to solve the treasury problem so the big idea here is you want to fix any company sweep all the cash flows into bitcoin convert the treasury into bitcoin borrow against your future cash flows and dollars convert that into bitcoin finance all your fixed assets in dollars convert that into bitcoin and issue equity as much as you can now at the highest valuation you can now in dollars and invest in bitcoin right and and you might say why bitcoin well because bitcoin is the apex property it's the most scarce monetary asset in the universe you can't make any more of it it's encrypted money and and what that means is it's least likely to be impaired by a property tax an execution issue um money printing dilution counterparty risk and corruption so we have we have engineered a superior asset a thermodynamically sound technically superior asset it's placed on a global digital monetary network which is open an open protocol and the combination of apex asset on the open monetary system makes it the um the most disruptive technology in the world when you were first starting microstrategy you were you were in the weeds you were thinking i have to make a product that solves a problem and i have to make money off of it right now you've gone way up the hierarchy of now we can do whatever we want now you can do whatever you want at what point did you notice a shift like oh my gosh like this business is stable it's working it's working pretty well uh yep it's quite predictable at what point did that shift happen because what you're talking about now is quite foreign to what i think we look we solved our problem when we actually embraced bitcoin i i i i could say to you oh yeah well when i had 500 million in cash in the bank i could and we were focused but the problem with that is that if you have a bunch of cash generating zero interest the cost of capital goes to 25 percent then all the public company investors forsake the company and if the stock if if the stock market forsakes the company the mainstream media for stakes the company right then the employees become dejected because eventually you're going to have facebook amazon apple or google steal every one of your employees if you can't drive the stock up right nobody wants to invest in a company that makes a lot of money growing at five percent a year i mean it's it seems brutal to say that but it wouldn't be true if the cost capital was zero if we had a sound money policy in this country then you could hold your head up high and say i run this great restaurant and we made a lot of money last year we're going to make a lot of money this year and our plan is to keep doing what we've been doing and everybody pat you on the back and say that's good that's honorable but if if i tell you i'm going to devalue the cash by 25 a year or 20 a year at some point you're driven into this cycle where i have to either do a big acquisition to keep my revenues growing i have to take extreme risk and do dilutive acquisitions or i have to go borrow billions of dollars to buy the stock back to leverage up the cash flow per share and if i don't do either those things the investors dump the stock and they dump the stock the employees start feeling like you know why don't they go work some place cool and hot and you're going to get all your engineers stripped away by facebook or or amazon or something so the truth is when we actually fix the balance sheet we fixed the stock and we fixed that you know at this point the company has five billion dollars more than five billion dollars in assets if the if the cost of capital remains at let's say it goes up 20 percent if if we print 20 more money next year i can reasonably expect to generate a billion dollars in investment income which would be a you know 20 increase in bitcoin right but the truth is i can reasonably expect better than that if the cost of capital is 10 i can reasonably expect 500 million investment income well all 2 000 people doing 100 000 things right perfectly for the entire year competing against microsoft that has more money than god they can generate 75 million a year okay so so the truth is the company its future became secure when we actually converted the balance sheet to bitcoin because now we don't have to struggle let me say it a different way i don't think any company could be successful without a financial strategy in the year 2021 like i wouldn't have said it three four years ago if you have a sound money macroeconomic environment where the money supply is expanding at two or three percent a year you can go out and make things and create things and market things and sell things and service things and generate cash with that and then and that makes sense but if the money supply is expanding at 20 percent a year you need to own assets because because what's happening is no one's going to invest in any project that doesn't generate more than the 20 percent hurdle rate and so what who can generate consistently risk-free 20 returns you have to be a monopoly you have to have a digital monopoly or some kind of monopoly so it becomes exponentially harder to grow and what and so what happens next all these other companies get squeezed out of the ecosystem right they're get they get decapitalized and rendered insolvent by by the monetary policy so i would say that you know if i can get my st my stock was 120 a share what is it right now like uh i haven't checked in the market 768. okay so if i if i get my stock up then i can actually make my shareholders happy i can change the narrative i can recruit i can retain talent i can get that you know i can inspire the confidence of my customers i can i can drive momentum and then we can do what we want to do i guess it's it's similar to if you're a university and you had no endowment you know and or university that has a billion dollar endowment or university is a hundred billion dollar endowment you know if you're a professor which university you want to work for if you're a student where you want to go you know do you have a shiny building coming or not right at the end of the day right money is a measure of energy and so if you have monetary assets you have energy and if you have high energy you can pursue your vision you know with integrity and what percentage of your time now are you spending on this on investing the income versus on the day-to-day of micro strategy of just the the business as usual making the products that making business intelligence products versus investing the the income um i am i'm the ceo but we have a president and the president of the company is fong lee and he actually has day-to-day operational responsibility for sales marketing and even technology development at this point so i'm the chairman and the ceo i i oversee the company strategy and i oversee that i oversee financial strategies i oversee long-term direction and i and i oversee technology strategy but i'm not i'm not in the weeds and the day-to-day running the business that's really left for the operating executive team so um about a year ago i tweeted out that i had moved 25 of my uh net worth into bitcoin which has now become like i don't know 50 plus percent almost um and a friend called me our friend who comes on this podcast name's andrew wilkinson very successful business guy he's got a public company in in canada now sort of has owns businesses that are worth about over a billion over a billion dollars and he called me and he was just like hey i just want to make sure you know what you're doing here and you know uh like a concerned friend and and he comes from like kind of the warren buffett and you know he's a warren buffett disciple and famously buffett and munger you know charlie mugger called bitcoin uh rat poison and then buffett called it rat poison squared and so you get really intelligent people um who are well respected for what they've done um talking about bitcoin so first what's your reaction to the buffett opinion on bitcoin i think everybody's captured by their frame of reference warren buffett would would you agree that warren buffett for the most part made money investing in stocks yeah in non-technology stocks primarily and and maybe and maybe overseeing operating companies how successful would he have been if he did that in nigeria or let's say zimbabwe or argentina for the past 15 years of venezuela not very strategy wouldn't have worked right for example there is no strategy that would work if you were a business person in zimbabwe when the currency collapsed and if you look at the argentine blue dollar uh the argentine dollar the argentine peso actually used to be worth a dollar and then was worth and then it was three pesos to the dollar today it's on the black market they call it the blue market it's worth about 150 pesos to the doll there's you know if you live in a world where you just let's just start by assuming the currency is strong and we have no problem with that and that stocks are going to work and then let's talk about our investment strategy well if if you if you live in that world and you and you can make those assumptions great but what if the currency weakens at 15 a year for the next decade then um then your strategy doesn't work so i i think that for the most part the world's full of successful people but there's two things that are missing one they're they're assuming optimistically that um that in the united states and western europe um whatever currency challenges we have whatever weakness of the currency we have will be rapidly rectified they're either in denial like here's how you'll know ask someone as an investor how they did last year if they're honest they'll say oh all my you know the dollar crashed and all my stocks are up 20 to 50 because the dollar is weaker and and if they tell you oh i had a great year all my my portfolio is up 37 or 50 because i'm a genius stock picker right that's how you interpret the world is the dollar weakening or is the market getting better right and um so there's a lot of people that that have been successful in their frame of reference and so they just attribute the virtuous activity of you know their virtuous stock picking or their virtuous business strategy for their success right and then they wonder why everybody else can't be like them right right and then i think the second part of this is bitcoin is paradigm shift it's the first time in the history of the human race that we managed to put first layer money on a digital network i mean there is no uh there is nothing to study someone that's telling you they've studied this how could you have studied it it's like we invented fire or we invented electricity it's such a new invention that um if if your friend said i spent 47 hours studying bitcoin right and i have the following you know detailed concerns about how it's going to evolve as a dominant digital asset network and these are the things i'm worried about maybe with the constructive conversation but i i think that most people don't they don't even understand yet that it's a digital monetary network they don't even know there's a class of such a thing it's the first such thing in the history of the re of the human race so so i've created the ability to manifest property in cyberspace using strong encryption and i have decentralized that network such that no company or no ceo or no country can be a point of failure right this is this is um a first in the human race that you know this is a fire in cyberspace that's that's burning with a trillion dollars of energy it's the fastest growth to a trillion dollars of any digital network in the history of the world 12 years and so if you embrace that and you say okay i've got two things going on here i have a macro i've this is the first time in 30 years that the money supply the the broad money supply in the us and europe is all linked and all and all collapsing at a rate north of 20 percent we didn't have this not in your lifetime not in my lifetime the last time we got something similar since 1980 but and before night in the 70s but in the 70s you had a bunch of different central banks the german bank the french bank the u.s bank the u.s was not the world current it was like 30 of the currency trades in the 1980s it wasn't 90 percent so we had the formation of the eu the eu tied all of european currency to the dollar that became 90 of all the currency every other central bank tied in the dollar so we arrive in a period in the last 12 months where where the behavior of the u.s fed and the expansion of the m2 money supply is in essence weakening every currency on earth at the same time you've only got three sets of currencies you've got the strong currencies weakening at the same rate as the dollar you've and that's like 20 rich countries then you've got um you've got most currencies weakening 20 to 40 percent more against the dollar and then you've got the last basket of currencies weakening 80 or more against the dollar they're utterly collapsing and so you have a macroeconomic circumstance we've never seen in our lifetime and then you have a technology the most disruptive technology of our life more disruptive than google than facebook more disruptive than youtube more disruptive than zoom more disruptive than than the iphone it took google 22 years to get to a trillion it took amazon 24 years to get to a trillion it took apple 42 years to get to a trillion it took microsoft 44 years to get to a trillion it took bitcoin 12. it's some it's a monetary fire it's burning in cyber space and these two things together you know by how do you feed a monetary fire with money how more money than ever the money is feeding the fire right and anybody living in a comfortable environment with a business strategy that worked last year right they're going to be late to understand this because they haven't had this jarring realization that there's something fundamentally different but if you lived in argentina or you lived in lebanon and your currency like let's take lebanon it collapses overnight by 80 and if someone handed you an iphone and said you can put bitcoin on this and you won't be broke and starving tomorrow you would have an incentive to learn about this new technology because your entire world crashed around your head but if you're living in a world where you think you just made 30 return on your portfolio you don't quite have the same appreciation of the problem yeah go ahead sam so you you it almost is it's almost like rooted and the decision to do all this is definitely shareholder stuff shareholder value but a lot of it was like really like well i just want to attract great talent um or that was definitely a a factor how has how many people work there now 2000 how has this impacted your ability to recruit and retain people it's been great for retention has been great for recruiting we can get we we get people first of all the company's brand has been amped up by a factor of a thousand i mean a lot more people know us now and like what's the culture like now is it different just more just happy bitcoin is hope okay so let me say it a different way if your family has a hundred thousand dollars and you showed up you know today and i told you it was in a bank in lebanon and now it's 20 000 but you can't spend it and it's going to zero what's your family's morale right well i mean yeah and if your family had a hundred thousand in bitcoin at the same in the same year and i told you oh by the way bitcoins up by a thousand percent and now you have a million dollars and it's probably going to keep going up forever and you don't have to worry it's not black and white like that it's not black and white no it's not i'm looking at your glass door reviews i'm looking at the glass door reviews not everyone agrees uh like surely there's downside to this i mean not everyone agrees i i'm looking at i see a lot of bad reviews and every great company has a lot of bad reviews but it's not black and white that everyone agrees i mean you have a 43 review on glassdoor i know that glassdoor isn't the full picture but it's clear that not everyone agrees with your opinion and i want to know is that is that only stats for the past six months no there's a there's a thousand reviews and it's been uh isn't it for the past decade um but i can sort by date so i can i can tell you a a number by any you could just i could set it by uh any constraint right now it's uh all so one thousand reviews within its and it's a low review um and i and it so it doesn't seem that everyone agrees with that are you looking at the past 10 years and if you go back over the past 10 years we had we had one point where the company was contracting and we laid off employees and so so no i'm looking at reviews all from 2020 there's i think truth be told nobody gives a [ __ ] about glassdoor reviews right like you know i do i don't know i think i think i think that i think there's two no matter how thin the pancake there's always two sides but there's bits of truth in all of it right you could you could gain friends what is the do you what is the point you would like to make and what shall we discuss what i want to know is is what's been the downside of this because it's not black and white that everyone agrees with you um it's not black and white that like this has been perfect sam can i ask you a question in a slightly different way i think i get what you're trying to say so it's not not necessarily oh have people disagreed with you because right now also you look like a genius you bought the thing the brand is up the stock is up the bitcoin price is up like if you really disagree now this is your own personal problem at this point the strategy has clearly worked up till now the question is more that hey we've had periods of time i've been holding bitcoin since 2013 2014 and i've seen bitcoin go down you know 70 80 percent drawdowns and you have basically uh taken out a bunch of debt you bought bitcoin you own 5 billion bitcoin the majority of the company's value is the bitcoin that the assets that it owns and if we do see i think we kind of agree volatility will dampen over time but that doesn't mean we can't see a drawdown like that again what happens when bitcoin price drops by 50 again um you know what's your reaction to that how you know how does that affect your strategy or what's your overall viewpoint of this possibility that's not that that's not the downside of your strategy right yeah yeah yeah on a day-to-day level at the company i imagine there's a ton of people that love this but what is what has been any of the downsides of this because with every great decision there's always going to be downsides as well as upsides i can't see any downside for the employees they've all benefited i can't see any downside for the investors that stayed with us they've all benefited right i mean there are critics out there that don't like bitcoin and by there are people that will say you're a ceo you shouldn't invest it you know i there are there are people that will say operating companies shouldn't have assets right there's a cr like uh there's criticism people say well your ceo you should go back to your cubicle and write software and leave the investing to the professionals but i think that the fundamental element in the room here is that the macroeconomic environment is so incredibly unfair to people without assets like literally if you're an operating company or a main street company you have to work 30 harder to stand still and if you're a wall street company you can stand still and get 30 more like the playing field is so tilted in favor of property owners or asset holders against manufacturers and and companies that that do things that you you can't really be successful in business unless you have assets as part of your strategy and so so okay so me and sam were asking different questions sam wanted to know more about the morale i want to know if we do see another bitcoin you know crash draw but draw down 50 60 uh what happens to your position and uh what happens to your your point of view well we we have permanent capital so it doesn't make a difference to us right like right now for example we have a three billion dollar investment gain so if you cut bitcoin in half we would still have an investment gain right i mean our basis is 24 000 so if it goes down to less than 24 000 and stays there forever then it will have not been a good investment i suppose but otherwise we we've got a long-term strategy which is you buy it and hold it and and i think that a lot of people live in fear of volatility but a lot of people live in fear of a lot of things right if you're if you have enough fear you won't leave your house you won't do anything and so you have to have a bit of courage and conviction i i can give you a thousand reasons why i think it makes sense to invest in bitcoin like i can't give you any reason why why i should be afraid to do a rational thing so you know it doesn't really bother me right there's this is a rational strategy if i had it to do all over again would i of course i would right ask all the investors that made billions and billions of dollars you know over the time frame right of course you would do it again uh and i think we're gonna we're gonna have to wrap uh based on time so appreciate you coming on uh do you wanna leave anybody with a way to way to find you place to follow place to take a next step if they you know liked what they heard sure if you're interested in bitcoin bitcoin is hope so go to h-o-p-e hope dot com we have lots of information in it if you want to follow me i'm uh michael underscore sailor on twitter how much you think bitcoin.com is worth roger vera owns it now how much would you be paying for bitcoin.com i don't know i i wouldn't speculate i wouldn't speculate you know i think for most people a lot of what you're saying i think is going to be uh over their heads that listen to this to be perfectly honest with you um i think but but i could distill it down into a very simple a simple way of looking at it for anybody that listened to this and they were intrigued but they didn't know they haven't you know sort of gone down the rabbit hole yet which is very simply if guys like michael saylor who own public companies that have a ton of money are worried about what they're going to do because their money is melting and they're looking for you know investment grade you know uh sort of uh the most powerful treasury asset and he's decided it's bitcoin and uh you know square has put some money in paypal has put money in um tesla's put a billion and a half dollars into into bitcoin um it's likely that there are more companies out there and it'll take them six months to a year to make this move but they will take a portion of their treasury reserves and they'll move it into bitcoin and these are long-term holders these are not retail day traders that are going to be you know buying and selling the thing like crazy so the real simple thing is you can sort of invest into the network you can buy bitcoin yourself and you can front run the institutions that are coming uh that was a very simple very simple thesis a very simple takeaway for somebody who's listening to this if you're a company you better be thinking about what you're going to do with the cash if you're an individual person you should also be thinking about what you're going to do with your cash and the easy move is that for once you get to front run the institutions and you get to get in before they all get in whereas typically the retail investor is last i i think that's it's a a reasonable thing to say i agree with it another big picture way to say it is there's a hundred trillion dollars of treasury assets that have a negative real yield of minus 10 to minus 15 a year that means they're they're destroying 10 trillion dollars a year of value the solution is convert all of that money into bitcoin bitcoin's a trillion dollar asset the you know people that understand bitcoin think it's going to grow to become the 10 trillion dollar asset the gold is and then it's going to replace negative yielding sovereign debt and then corporate debt and and ultimately it will become the primary treasury reserve network and treasury reserve asset and so if you have a company if you're an investor it makes sense to buy it because it's got a brilliant future and it solves a problem that everybody on earth has and if you're a company it makes sense to plug your treasury into bitcoin because the road to serfdom is working exponentially harder for currency growing exponentially weaker right you're just going to work yourself to death you know put yourself in a position of working as hard as you can in venezuela or argentina or zimbabwe and roll the clock forward a decade and ask yourself the question what do you wish you did and the answer is protect your assets protect your your monetary energy or your treasury by putting it into a scarce asset in a bank in cyberspace where no one can steal it debase it or destroy it and and that's the bitcoin ethos we're simply trying to we're trying to make it worthwhile to do the other stuff there's no point in doing a hundred million other things if at the end of the journey you've got nothing to show for it yeah why create all the value if you cannot store it so here's a better store of value right yeah but that's the big idea and that's and that's a business strategy for everybody small medium large doesn't matter and you know i'm just kind of anticipating somebody who hears this and they say but we're not argentina we're not venezuela do i really need to worry about this and what's your answer to that my answer is the single most important thing for you to to have in your life is a forecast for the money supply expansion in your country for the next eight years so i would say that before you invest the next decade of your life doing whatever stop and study up on macroeconomics and form an opinion about the rate at which your currency is going to lose economic energy and then you can act accordingly if you think that the currency is going to hold by the way the currency has never held it's lost six percent of its value every year forever right it's always losing 600 value you just have to decide for the next decade whether or not the cost of capital is going to be 8 12 16 or 20 and once you make that decision that will inform you with regard to with what what degree of enthusiasm will you pursue a hard asset strategy if you think that the if you think that the currency is going to weaken rapidly then you would shift you would um you would shift and prioritize hard asset strategy and hard asset acquisition um aggressively and if you think that the currency is going to not weaken that rapidly you would prioritize other strategies right and you everybody's got to make that decision for themself but when you know when zimbabwe started to crash normal companies management consulting companies started buying lumber and coal and oil and anything they could buy because at least you'll still have it tomorrow whereas the cash the currency the receivables will be worth nothing so you just have to make that decision we can't there's plenty of information in the world for you to form your own opinion once you've formed your opinion then then you can act accordingly cool all right michael thank you for coming on gentlemen yeah we appreciate this is great um thank you we just did this interview with michael's what's this sailor or yeah l right and no i mean i wouldn't sure if it was sailor or sailor without an l recap it and then explain your opinion first objectively try to recap it objectively uh we had this guy on uh he's objectively successful financially uh objectively a wonderful businessman he came on for he he said ahead of time his objective for this interview was to promote bitcoin which that's cool we could talk about that for a bit that we i'm down with that i wanted to ask him a little bit more beyond that but we didn't get to it and he talked for 60 plus minutes all about this topic and i personally pressed him on a few topics and he disagreed with me and my vibe this is no all right we're past the objective part my vibe from this was uh i don't trust i don't trust his opinion okay so i'll give you my two cents and then we'll we'll just talk about it real quick so i just was i thought he came on just kind of low energy slash maybe like kind of arrogant i don't know smug a little bit not in a bad way but i think at the beginning we were clearly trying to like warm him up just talk to him about something and he had zero interest in uh in chattan about uh anything besides the virtues of bitcoin and so that was a little bit i don't know just personally a little off-putting i guess like i find it more fun when a guest comes on and there's somebody that you leave the podcast being like man i want to i'd love to hang with that person more um i think that's a great sign for the guest and i think in this case you know i didn't walk away with that feel i agree with all the things he said objectively he's super smart you know literally a rocket scientist who built a billion dollar company by the time you know a 10 billion dollar company by the time he was 34 you know from 24 to 34 he built a 10 billion dollar company has been running it for 30 years as a public company ceo went into bitcoin heavy and has made three billion dollars in bitcoin like you guys is definitely a smart guy and i think ahead of the curve in many ways i've read his book the mobile wave which he wrote 2012 basically saying that mobile's gonna like mobile's gonna destroy everything and uh which in 2012 was a sort of safe prediction but uh still a good prediction nonetheless i don't agree with you that he was just like would you say like not trustworthy or something so explain well and let me just say this is like a d jerk reaction so i don't want my opinion's certainly evolving as as it's going and and i've sean you've talked about them all the time so that was my experience when i read a wikipedia page and i probably watched the top two or three interviews that's that that's my experience i don't want to say distrusting but there was something about it so in the interview i question about something silly not not silly i don't think it's silly sean thinks it's silly and that's okay i understand why someone thinks that i i said your glass door reviews are pretty shitty like recently um well no you asked a more reasonable question you said it's all been okay great bitcoin's up this is your stock price is up but like what have been the downsides which i think is a perfectly reasonable question to ask and he was just like well there are no downsides and i was like well that's like objectively false because there's there there's some people they they're anonymous and it's glass doors so that doesn't hold a ton of weight but there's a lot of people on your reviews that say that this is crazy and that your products are failing and you're doing this to distract that like what are the downsides and he i think he he kind of dodged the question and i couldn't get the truth out of him and because of that i'm like if i can't trust something so obvious or if someone can't give me a straight answer on something i feel is so obvious of saying like yeah look there's a ton of upside which i've discussed but here's some of the downsides then in my head i'm like well i can i believe anything you're saying right once you are um once you are not reasonable or rational about one thing i can't fully think you're reasonable and rational about this other thing that you're telling me about that's kind of what you're saying how anything is how you do everything and and i also think that anyone who brags about how rational they are are some of the least rational people um i don't which by the way i don't think he bragged about it i think it's like when you ask him you know this person is this bad thing about it he's like well i just think it's a clear because of this this is true that's a rational thing in my opinion i don't think he was saying yeah he he never claimed he never said that correct but he said like well this is this is an incredibly rational decision i don't see downsides and i'm like well we're naturally so not rational i'll defend his i'll defend by the way i spent most of the podcast basically even though i'm a huge bitcoin bull i spent most podcast podcasts bringing up things that a critic of his strategy and a critic of bitcoin would say just because i wanted to hear his answers but in general like i get what he's saying that look we bought two billion dollars worth of bitcoin it's gained three billion more our stock price is up i don't know 4x since we made this strategy change and you're asking me like how do my employees feel like they feel great our brand just went up a thousand x people know what microstrategy is now they didn't know what the hell it was before our stock price is up our assets are have we've gained a lot more value in our assets so what are you talking he was basically like there's no downside that's all upside so i get that but he didn't uh you know give you the inch that i think most most reasonably people would do which is to say that yeah everything has its trade-offs maybe like it would he could have said it was really complicated to go through the process of being the first public company to make this huge bitcoin purchase and so that was a huge just you know regulatory and legal you know like mess we had to work through but i'm glad we did or like you know there's always some people in the company that disagree with the decision and so they you know they haven't you know they're no longer with us or you know they've had to get on board with something that they didn't see as was the right decision and that's always tough whenever you have strong-minded people you're not all you can 100 agree with a radical strategy he could have said any of those things he didn't but how does it make me personally distrust him i think for you that was a turn off i i don't want to i like i said before the this is an all-knee jerk it just happened i i so i want to be careful my words if i said distrust i i actually i take that back i don't entirely mean distrust but i i mean that there's something going on that i had this gut feeling that um i can't just believe what you're saying and i want to go and and this should be the case all the time on my own right i think it's all pretty above board which is he's basically bet his entire company on bitcoin now they own five billion dollars of bitcoin the company's worth seven billion dollars and bitcoin you know so obviously and his objective his stated objective to us coming on was to communicate the nature and virtues of bitcoin to the audience and leave them excited about the opportunities that bitcoin offers so he wasn't there was no bait and switch he said what he wanted to do he tried to do that um and it's clear that he is incentivized for more people companies and individuals to buy bitcoin because he is maybe the largest holder of bitcoin in the world uh i don't know i don't know what satoshi's stake is worth now uh maybe check that out does he have more bitcoin than satoshi he he i don't think so he said i think it might be the podcast uh three billion at one point his three billion is his gain he owned they owned five billion dollars worth so uh what is satoshi's stake with either way he's one of the top five bitcoin whales in the world he clearly wants bitcoin to go up and wants more people to adopt it to me that's like you got to have a natural discount of what somebody's saying when it comes to um when they are highly highly incentivized for you to invest in that same thing that doesn't mean he's wrong or he's like doing anything dishonest it's like you just have to know that hey this guy's clearly he believes it he has high conviction and he has an incentive to make other people believe it too abreu what did you think i mean i think i i just quaking in fear right now say what you really want to say let's let's not let's not uh i will say that i for the most part agree with what you guys said i mean talking about michael himself like super intelligent but professorial he like he doesn't make for a great guest and you see this on other podcasts as well like when joe rogan has like some kanye well-renowned like super intelligent like scientists on sometimes they're you know they're they they just want to go on about their field and their studies and um so those will make for the best guess so i'll say that um yeah which is kind of sad because you know from my point of view my i i guess we both walked away from the podcast feeling a little disheartened or i don't know like whatever uh we didn't we didn't feel like we we had a slam dunk um i think you for a different reason than me for me it was just i didn't think it was highly entertaining for people and i'm kind of bummed about that because i actually think it's a super [ __ ] i think he's a super [ __ ] interesting guy has had a super interesting life and business story and also what he's doing with bitcoin i think is super interesting so somehow despite there being an underlying like substance that is super interesting i don't think it got communicated i almost wish i could just do a billy of the week segment just explaining everything i know about michael saylor doing the right yeah for this interview i think that would be way more entertaining than what actually happened when he came on was basically talking about quite technical you know economically technical terms that i think for most people they're not going to resonate with it's not going to click and doing it in a way that was sort of like it didn't feel like somebody who was trying to break it down and make it more accessible it was just like this it is what it is and i can sort of explain it in bits and pieces to you if you want and if you don't see it you're crazy you know what one of the best parts was towards the end sean when you like took a few minutes and kind of explained what we just talked about in a high level i thought that was like the easiest part to digest the whole thing and more that should have been more of what the podcast was and unfortunately it wasn't and it wasn't for a lack of research as far as like the interview not being that great like we put you guys put a ton of research into this um i think sometimes just the guest personality doesn't make for the the best podcast well i think people can listen to it uh it's an hour long i i i want to say i appreciate him coming on michael's a big deal uh uh i i definitely appreciate him coming on i'm gonna i want to i definitely want to take back like you know the whole i don't trust him entirely but uh there's something sitting there after that interview there's something sitting right where something inside me is like uh something is going on here and i gotta figure out what it is um maybe we can have him on another time now that we kind of like know him a little bit more but uh yeah i'm sure aside for themselves you know actually it'll be kind of interesting because we're gonna leave this in by the way like the whatever our discussion about it and i hope i hope it kind of gets received as what it is this is a instant hot take reaction to something that we were really excited about then it happened we're giving a quick reaction i think uh you know sam basically uh didn't see the the kind of the bitcoin bull case as black and white as maybe michael taylor first of all like let me just say that i when i my opinion of him is totally separate of bitcoin i would say i'm a i'm a huge novice i'm not an expert but uh i felt that he was actually uh he he was a poor representation of it because there's something about it that i'm like oh i don't know if i could trust this right because he's representing it you weren't buying what he was selling i don't know i don't know how to put it but nothing no attack on his character you just didn't walk away from listening to the guy for the hour and you didn't fully um buy in like we do sometimes with certain guests where they start to explain what's going on in their field or their business and we walk away saying [ __ ] that guy knows what he's talking about and like i totally agree with the way the world is going and i want to invest in that guy's company you know that's sometimes the way we feel he didn't persuade me if if that was his goal i don't think it i don't think goal was not achieved can i give people the like i'm gonna can i try a three minute like billy of the week segment on this guy real quick this is your podcast you do what you want yeah go for it oh i mean are you interested i don't know if you're interested okay so let's do it here's here's okay michael saylor to me is uh you know more than the billy of the week he might be the billy of the month uh okay so here's some cool things about him that i found doing some research for this so the guy's a badass he you know graduates first in his class in high school valedictorian he's voted most likely to succeed he goes to mit on a like you know rotc you know scholarship he goes to the air force he wants to be kind of like a fighter pilot and um you know eventually like you know he i think for whatever reason he he wasn't going to be able to be a fighter pilot i think some he didn't pass one of the physicals or something like that um and so he's like you know because they have a very strict requirement for that so anyways he decides that 20 uh he's he's working at dupont i don't know if he knew this part sam he's he works at dupont when he's like right out of uh college basically and he's doing simulations for dupont and dupont's trying to make a billion-dollar decision should we invest in this or not and if anybody's been in a big company you know that when an executive trying to make a case for when the executive wants to do something it's sort of their pet project they don't really want the simulation to be this really objective case of pros and cons they kind of just want some data to support what they already want to do so they can go get a billion dollars of funding to go do the thing they want and so he builds the simulation and the simulation basically says don't do it and anyways he he ends up just like leaving dupont he's like i don't know why the hell i'm at this company they just they didn't even want the results of the simulation they just wanted me to say what needed to be said so that some executive could go pitch their case so i'm leaving this place and the executive is basically like hey where's that kid who's doing that model i need that data and he's like um he's like and they're like he left the company he quit and so the guy's like go hire him back give him what he wants and so they go to him and they say hey we want to hire you back and we'll give you more money and he's like i don't really want to work there so i don't want more money and then the executive's like give him more we'll give him what is it whatever he wants just give it to him and he's like well i kind of want to start my own company so why don't we do this you give me a quarter million dollars and i want to hire some of my colleagues from dupont i want to hire eight to ten people from there and um i want you to be my first customer so i want you to give me you know a few million dollars worth of contracts to do work for you and i'm gonna start my company microstrategy which does the same simulating thing for companies and you'll be my first customer so pretty badass negotiation he goes and instead of being an employee he basically gets dupont to seed fund his company and become a multi-million dollar customer for him so from there he's 24 years old that's microstrategy how it starts basically what they do is like what's called business intelligence or executive intelligence they they take all the data you have so like your victoria's secret you have all this data of purchasing and all your stores all across the country microstrategy goes in and says hey you're carrying the wrong sizes you need bigger bras in chicago than in new york so if you rebalance your inventory you're going to save all this money and uh there's data you're sitting on this gold mine of data you just don't know how to analyze it we can give you intelligence from this data so he does that for mcdonald's and for victoria's secret and all these different companies by 34 he's a billionaire the company's public it's worth 11 billion dollars he owns the majority of the company owns over 50 and he's doing his thing now over time 2003 2004 stock price crashes from 333 dollars a share to 42 cents a share or something like that and you know he goes through that whole transition he's been the ceo of microstrategy for like 30 years like literally i was born in 1988 sam's born in 1989 he's been the ceo of microstrategy since 1989. you know like that's pretty pretty wild and more recently like you know microstrategy has been flat for like a decade stock price not really going anywhere business is profitable he's got 500 million dollars of cash in the bank but the stock price is not growing and he's like 500 million dollars i think personally he said uh no i think in this case it was the corporate treasury we had about 560 million dollars he owns the majority of the company i think he owns currently no i think i think in the podcast he was like i have whatever he he's basically he was incredibly wealthy and the company was great he's incredible and the company's incredibly wealthy and he basically comes to this realization during the coveted crash and he's talked about this on other podcasts which is it comes to this realization that um wait a minute if the money supply you know we hear about government stimulus we hear governments printing two trillion dollars six trillion dollars 13 trillion dollars total uh the money supply is increasing which means if you had 500 million dollars in the bank if you go back and look it'll still save 500 million dollars but it won't be able to buy you as much as it did before because there's all this trillions of new dollars in the in the in the in the money supply and similarly like uh people have been wondering during covid wait a minute all the businesses are shut down and people are locked in their homes why are all the stock prices at like all-time highs what's this disconnect between main street and wall street and what he's pointing out i think rightfully so is that when you have all this money printing assets inflate basically assets like companies inflate so that's why the stock prices are going up it's not that you know um zoom or you know zoom's a bad example it's not that apple is making all all this much more money than they were three months ago it's that apple stock is more of a hard asset to own versus own just keeping cash in dollars which is getting printed and diluted essentially by the government right so long story short microstrategy goes out and they they basically do this aggressive aggressive um aggressive strategy to buy a quarter billion dollars of bitcoin they're kind of the first public company to go do such a bold bet and then he keeps buying bitcoin um more and more and more he's basically bought two billion dollars of bitcoin so first he took all the money they have a majority of the money they have and they bought bitcoin with it um and and he first announced it and he told his shareholders look we're going to buy a bunch of bitcoin with our cash if you don't want to hold our shares we'll buy your shares back from you if you don't like that strategy so they bought 60 70 million dollars back they use the rest of the cash to buy bitcoin then he starts issuing debt he goes and raises 500 million dollars he goes raises a billion dollars of debt from the public markets takes all that money buys bitcoin with it and so since then he's basically put in two billion dollars he's gained three billion dollars and he has a total stake of bitcoin of five billion dollars which i think makes him makes microstrategy you know a top five owner of bitcoin in the world um you know just behind satoshi and maybe a couple others and since then you know famously elon tweeted out something about bitcoin michael saylor responded saying hey from one rocket scientist to another let me show you how we let me explain to you why we did it and you should too and a few months later tesla goes and buys 1.5 billion dollars of bitcoin so he's kind of was ahead of the curve on this stuff um in addition to that some other cool things early on in the doc he sort of identified early on that the internet was going to be a big deal and bought a bunch of domains so we spent about two million dollars buying domains like alarm.com alarm.comwisdom.comstrategy.com michael.com mike.comangel.com courage you know hope and he owns all these premium domains one word english word domains and he has since you know sold or created businesses under those domains for you know over a hundred billion dollars so he turned you know one or two million billion one or two million dollars sorry one or two million dollar domain purchases into over 100 million dollars of value um he also has this thing called sailor.org which is just like a free education it's just a free university um and he said you know since 1999 they've had over half a million students in it so this guy's done a bunch of cool [ __ ] and i think is like a pirate of the best kind like super smart technologist super smart business guy has just been in the game for so long and is doing pretty radical things so that's why you know i think this guy's a baller unfortunately i didn't feel that all that came through on the podcast but you know i'm a fan well i i think michael uh and his team will reach out and say thank you sean because i think that you did an awesome job of uh you did a better job of showing showing off him than him uh which is cool and uh i think i think you're just you're just better at storytelling so maybe maybe uh maybe people will have a uh the same opinion after this interview the the part that i uh kind of was like i don't know how i feel about this it happens like probably 15 minutes left in the episode maybe a brayu or someone will uh mark it uh and you guys will be able to hear it for yourselves but uh i think sean you're just really good at this and uh i guess we'll see uh this episode is gonna be weird it's i wonder what the people are gonna say i guess we'll find out yeah same all right cool i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i'll put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

The Hustle presents - My First Million. A podcast where we brainstorm new business ideas based on trends & opportunities we see in the market. Sometimes we have famous guests, and they do it with us.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
let's talk about three groups that i have that i think this could work for so if you're going to start picking me i'm going to start with the bottom one or i actually think it's the best one but it's fun i'm on my list nurses we've talked about nurses a ton it's an interesting demographic i think nurses are kind of cool for this space for two reasons or three reasons the first work could pay for it maybe i think work would maybe pay for it second nurses are typically i've spent time around nurses so they're typically women and they typically are people who feel like downtrodden like they feel like they're forgotten because they're not worked overworked underpaid or underappreciated yeah and that is so groups that are the um whatever you just said i guess i don't know how to explain it but groups that are like the us versus them like we don't have someone speaking for us typically that's like there's a lot of like i've looked when i was researching communities there's so many successful um women like women discussing x y and z communities this is just like that so i think that they have that uh us versus their mentality and the third reason is there's a [ __ ] ton of nurses yeah have you seen this instagram account nurse life are in no how many is it it's 1.2 million members on instagram it's run by this guy i think his name is eb or ebby i'm not sure exactly how you say his name and it's this guy this is black nurse and um private they just went private uh they used to be public and i think you have to like you have to request so that they can make sure that you're a nurse before they let you in um which again is part one thing that communities do well the you know what's that quote it's like i don't want to be a part of any group that would accept me um you know the the better your gate at the front uh the more people will value being in the group and so this is a group and they they just post mostly like nurse memes so it's like you know if you it's like being underappreciated or whatever they'll make a joke out of it or like you know coming home and realizing you still have whatever you know on your shoe and uh it's just you know relatable memes from the eyes of a nurse so that's how they like keep their members engaged it's just meme content that's a good like inside joke for the community but he partnered with the makers of bala shoes which is the nurse shoe brand that's coming out that's trying to be nike for nurses basically it's nike for medical footwear and so he got equity in that company and gets paid every month because he is the promotional vehicle for the forbal issues who wants to like penetrate this community right so um not a paid community as such but it is a private community and on top of that they do this now what would incredible health you know the startup that's raised i don't know how much money 25 million dollars from entries and horowitz and all that what would they pay to access 1.2 million nurses that are like engaged and trust this brand and trust this leader of the community they would pay a lot right uh nurse job boards like so so if this guy's ambitious he could create a job board he could create the next incredible health uh he could take equity and balance shoes and be a part owner of the shoe brand like i think that's where this goes for for nurses i think that's a great example of one i think this could crush i think that guy is gonna that guy's sitting in a gold mine that like if you if you fast forward 10 years and tell me that he turned this 1.2 million person instagram page into 100 million company i won't be surprised right if you go and start truck life rrn right now uh i i think i think that's what's going to happen after this pod truck um the second one this is shocking to me okay google sheets there's this guy who tweeted at me and he started this thing called sheets con and he had 6 700 people sign up is that i mean i guess that's shocking because like i know that probably 100 million people plus use google sheets but and i guess it doesn't and i guess it also doesn't track me because i am a google sheets nerd and like i've dorked out about what i want and some of the most uh profitable online courses in the world are become an excel master uh how to use excel become better at excel those are like if you go look at the charts of uh most profitable online courses highest revenue online courses excel is always in the sort of top five yeah encore the founder of um teachable teacher one time one time told me that uh there was some guy making a million bucks a year and he was like the biggest earner on teachable on excel exactly so google sheets i 100 think you could do a paid community now it would have to be cheap though because it's the same it's the math of like how much money do you make for google sheets i think that there's absolutely something there um and then the last thing is this someone tweeted at me a community of vetted senior engineers who talk about advance advanced uh engineering concepts like how to scale a tech stack from 100k to 10 million users totally buy into that something like that that is incredibly niche and incredibly high-end where if there's a there's this other component that we didn't talk about with the community is you have to make it so that information that you gather in that group you cannot find online like um for tiger21 not that many people are gonna talk about how like because it's embarrassing how do i gift my child 15 million dollars without the government getting hands on it like that's not something you're going to tweet because that's embarrassing same thing with 100 000 to 10 million users there's just simply not that many people who have done it so you're not going to find a lot of reputable information on that so that's another trait of these paid communities and why i think this one in particular is interesting i think any job in any any job can do this so nurses is a good one because you have some are going to be better than others because you have uh you know the more people the more potential and the more um kind of like insider knowledge is needed the more uh downtrodden that group feels i'm trying this is kind of a negative word but kind of what you're saying like sort of like they feel that they need to take action um in order to like level up in some way uh the better and so like you know this could work for nurses but it could also work for designers i could see somebody just making a community of you know professional designers at all these different companies it's like yep we have designers from figma and from hubspot and from octa and from github and you should if you're a designer at one of these companies you're making 150 000 a year 200 000 a year um why would you not want to be a part of the like the best network of other designers like you where you can share tools tactics salary information if you're looking for new jobs opportunities if you're looking for new jobs like every job i think needs this and the more new infringe your job the more they the more the community is needed so like i know that our friend david spinks did this with community because community was like this there's not really like there's no chief community officer at these big companies but all greek companies say it's all about community facebook's like it's all about community twitch is like it's all about community and uh what does that mean and who in your company show me your who's in charge of community at your company right and there's typically not a c level who's in charge of community so david spinks said well look there's all these like kind of mid-level people who are community they run community for these big ass companies and there's no playbook on how to do their job they're underpaid they're underappreciated and they're overworked trying to run all these events i'm gonna make the best community for community professionals and so he made the community for community people it grew pretty large he ended up selling the thing i don't know how big of a business it was in terms of a business outcome he might have been a little early but i think that's a great example of somebody doing this just taking a job and making it happen so there's my idea i just wanted to talk about communities because i think they're actually kind of cool businesses i think a lot of people think that they want to start one but um i also think that there's a lot of mistakes made of like charging too little and i wanted to show a few examples of companies that make like a quarter of a billion dollars of value off communities because i think they're kind of cool so that's all i got to say about communities i'll leave it with this which is a lot of people i think the majority of people who listen to us they would love a non nine to five way to make ten thousand dollars a month and if i was gonna write or uh i read that in your uh your survey results yeah um yeah which we could talk about that but but in general that's that's the number one thing i think people listen to this would would just grab right away they don't all want to be founders of billion dollar companies or 200 million dollar companies or whatever um but if i said hey this is something outside your nine-to-five it's a side hustle it doesn't take up all your time and it's gonna bring in ten thousand dollars a month i would say that this to me right now is the number one way to do it i think there are some other ways right you could try e-commerce or drop shipping or something like that you could try to do a newsletter or paid newsletter i would do a community if i was gonna that would be my fastest path to that right now and i'll tell you the reasons why are all the things you said which is like it's not that much work to run the members provide the value to each other it's not all about you creating content all the time it's not that hard to spin up you just have to be smart about which group you're choosing and what where you kind of have an edge what's your group and then the last thing the downsides of it are that it can't scale super large but that's not your goal anyways you're just trying to get to ten thousand dollars a month of free free cash flow from your side hustle and so that is super achievable you know uh 20 a month for for 500 members and you're there you know so i think that is where i think this business fits in and i and i and i said before i actually do think they can scale but not all of them can some of them some some of them can but i i'm someone i've built a paid community that makes many many millions of dollars a year in recurring revenue and it is i would say that it's really hard actually to start because i had to create a lot of the content early on and i had to create the um the culture of the community but now i barely post and it has its own culture so yeah once it's once it's taken off yes it you you create that flywheel and it works or not by the way i just did this i just did this in e-commerce and it probably i've probably put in a grand total of maybe eight hours into this thing and i'll tell you what it is so i wanted to create a community for people who have ecommerce stores so i created a gate at the front that said your ecommerce store must be doing a hundred thousand dollars a month it doesn't even have a website there's no website um it's it's called club ltv ltv is like an inside term in the e-com world lifetime value it's like what every e-com store owner wants is their their ltv to go up so i called it club ltv it's people trying to increase their ltv and so i said you have to have a hundred thousand dollars a month of of revenue i told so i tweeted it out so i definitely had a head start because i have an audience so that brought in about the first 35 members you said yep and they would just send me a screenshot of their dashboard yep here's me this morning okay so so what i did was i made it free to join for the uh the store owners but you had to have this much value like this much you had to be this kind of far ahead in the game um but what i did then was i went to sponsors and i basically said hey i have a group of 75 store owners ranging from 1 million to 50 million uh dollars a year in revenue and all of them trust me like me and i meet up with them once a month and um would you like to sponsor this so i have one sponsor on board they paid me five thousand dollars a month um all i do is at the event i say boom i do my intro my high energy intro and then i say hey let me pass it to the guy that makes this possible that makes this group possible and he says his thing for two minutes he's had uh i can't say the names but um i don't know if i should i guess i just give him a free plug so mercury bank is the sponsor of it because that's who i would use for e-commerce projects and they're they have a big push in e-commerce and so they've had at least from our group five different um five out of the 75 e-commerce stores switched to mercury just from the sponsorship so they've gotten their money's worth out of it including one companies that's a two billion dollar company has switched over to them and so uh you know they definitely got their value out of the sponsorship but is this still going yeah this goes every month and so all that we do we have we have about one hour a month of of prep and then 90 minutes a month of the actual event and the one hour of prep is that ben goes and gets a cameo made from a different rapper every month and the rapper's just shouting out club ltv he's like so we had like you know um we had uh sean paul do the cameo one month and he's like hey it's your boy sean ball just one of the like big big ups to club ltv you guys are all doing so great with your ecommerce store and he's like you know just it doesn't even make any sense but it's just like a video that plays and people like it because it's like i don't know it's kind of goofy so we do one we get one cameo ordered and he sends the calendar invite so just make sure everybody gets it sends one reminder email and then the last thing is that after the event he just says hey if you learned something really useful that you're going to implement in your business um email me the one line of the most useful thing that happened for you in the hour because the structure of it is we break everybody up into groups of six so you're in a group with six other store owners who do between 1 and 50 million a year in revenue and then the the format is you say one thing you did in the last month that's really working it's driving revenue up and one thing that you're struggling with that you might want help from from the group and so afterwards they all email him the most useful things he just comp he just takes he just takes that sheet and he just sends it to everybody so hey here was the top insights from the group so that whole thing takes in one hour what's that why wouldn't you charge for that because because i can actually make much more off the sponsorships for example i've been approached by you know the companies that want you to build their ecom store on their platform there's the people who want you to use them for email marketing there's the people who want for influencer marketing who are you using for facebook advertising who are using what's the agency that manages your your um your data tracking like your pixel stuff so all these companies each are willing to pay multiple thousands of dollars i just have to onboard them now um because now i have the group and the group is where the value is that's the honeypot it's the same thing you were talking about where eventa they have a free group and they might they have they are making 25 million dollars a year on the sponsors who want to talk more than that oh sorry that's the profit they're making 200 million but um that's the same model that i'm using here don't charge the members just make sure all the members have successful businesses and once they think this is going to get or do you care i mean i put zero effort into it since then but like we have 75 people who show up every month to the thing and um which is like 80 85 of the members show up every single month to the event so they're getting value out of it and so i bet if i told ben hey go on twitter and just reach out to these 250 cold email these 250 or these 500 e-commerce stores because it's very easy to get lists of e-commerce stores that are successful um i bet we could triple the size of the group if we if we put some effort into it but don't really care about it it's more for fun but it's cool because it's just free money every month and uh it's a good group to be in i want to learn from these people i want to learn what they're doing what's working what's not and make these connections that's badass well you uh you know i it's funny i've i've built the community as well but it's like every time i learn something like you the way you're doing it is a lot different than the way that we've done it and it's really neat to hear a different point of view and perspective uh on how to get it done right i optimize mine for how do i spend the least time but get just enough value whereas i think for you is like a part of your business you're like i'm gonna this is gonna be a multi-million dollar thing and we're gonna make it [ __ ] awesome which is awesome by the way if i had to start over i would have done it differently um i would have charged way more money right um because i've learned the mistakes that you have to add a ton of people to build a big business and a ton of people for certain groups isn't necessarily good right i feel like i can rule the world travel never looking back [Music] uh

hey i've got a white male six foot three he's got a crowbar and i have and he's trying to break into this building here's the address i've just given them a description of the suspect a description of the crime and the existence of weapons every single police department in the nation that's what their dispatch is designed to do and they just described this at his own house practicing crowbar combat i know right yeah i feel like god you look fantastic this is the best this is the best i've ever looked if i look in a mirror i've never seen this coming back so whatever this camera is doing for me this is just know if you're watching this i'm uglier than this looks right now so no i'm uglier than this looks i think you kind of look celebrity-ish like you got cool hair a cool beard i think you look i think you look like i think you look cooler than you've ever looked thank you that's how i feel i feel cool and i think i need a tattoo or something i'm just like now i'm trying to triple down on the celebrity status that i i see no i i think you look wonderful um two things first today i want to talk about paid communities a lot but before we get into that the second thing is what i want to tell you last night my wife sarah goes good night sean um because everyone's been saying that dude they say it in such a mean way was she trolling or was it an accident he's trolling because someone tweeted like well we think that you are sean and sean do because indian guys typically have high pitched nerdy voice and white guys like you have like low pitched alpha voice it turns out shawn's the one with the alpha voice and i'm like [ __ ] so she called me uh thank you oh that's amazing i hope you guys were doing some great things while she called you sean that was awesome yeah well she burned me good but uh let's get right in you want to get you want to talk about paid communities i did a lot of research because this interests me right now okay let's do it okay so paid communities interest me because i came across this thing called tiger21 and this sounds like lame that i'm bringing this up now after selling the company but i've been interested in this for for years um do you know what tiger 21 is i've heard about it what i know about it is it's kind of like a mastermind peer group thing but it's for a certain wealth level i don't know if there's a i don't know if there's an actual cutoff but it's supposed to be for wealthier and i think it's mostly older people and uh we have a couple friends who are in it so i i texted one of them today about it so i got a little bit of info but tell me what i missed what do you know about it okay so tiger21 uh google it i don't know the url maybe maybe just that.com um but basically it's a peer group where you have to have at least 10 million dollars of investable assets in order to join it's very expensive it's 30 000 a year i wouldn't call it a mastermind because mastermind has a certain connotation but yeah it kind of is that um i logged on to the site i'm not a member but uh i used a friend's login to check it out and there's uh at least 850 members according to the what i saw and according to their site so what's that map 24 million dollars a year in revenue um they have local chapters that meet up uh i guess now digitally and they do things like they share one another's portfolio and you have to defend your portfolio and so it's basically rooted in rich people talking about rich people stuff mainly being investing but i think it turns into a little bit of therapy every once in a while like a lot of groups do but what did your buddy say all right so i texted uh our mutual friend keith um and he's he's uh he's a real estate guy he's been on the pod you can go listen to keith's episode and keith's a good dude and he goes i go you're in tiger 21 right and he goes yes um what's up and i basically asked him what do you think about it he's like it's an interesting group it's because it's all about investing preserving wealth it's mainly for older people and um he goes the typical meeting goes four hours you do like you said a portfolio defense where you talk about what you're holding and why and other people get interested in it and sometimes there's speakers um sometimes it's sometimes an external speaker sometimes it's somebody from the group who speaks and there's like a moderator and they also do like events because if you go to the website you can see like they hosted a tiger 21 event at magic johnson's house and so they're definitely trying to build this kind of like who's who network this sort of like soho club soho house vibe uh to the whole thing and it uh yeah so they do that they also you get like deals so a friend of mine sent me a deal where they basically when you're wealthy you get this thing called umbrella insurance which you paid two grand a year and it's just like general insurance and it's basically the story they tell you is like if you get in a car crash and someone googles you they're going to see you're rich and they're going to want to sue you for 5 million and this protects against all types of stuff and so they give you a discount on umbrella insurance um and so by my calculation i actually would bet they do 30 to 40 million in revenue and they recently sold to private equity and so it's a relatively big business and i actually read about uh read up on it and someone said like there's 90 retention rate which is pretty amazing i've also been following reddit's fat fire which is a subreddit similar to this and it's like tripled over the last year so this space has got me incredibly interested but this is just one example of a paid community and so what i wanted to do was go through a few other paid communities that are interesting i want to explain i'm going to try to explain why i think they work and then where the opportunity is for other paid communities can i start can i start with one opportunity which is why isn't this just a business model for our podcast like why aren't we starting tiger 21 for people that are you know that have let's call it a million dollars of investable assets so a million dollars of sort of like liquid net worth that you can go invest into something and uh why aren't we starting this now this seems like the perfect thing to do for a podcast like this i think that probably there should be something like this i agree if you go to the tiger21 website um you'll see like you know the type of models that people use on their website is like their ideal customer and it's like 65 year old white dudes who own insurance companies that are quite wealthy but not young or not like our kind of crew um so i agree i think there's something there okay fair enough so let's go into it all right so let's talk about where should we start i've done a bunch of research um how about we talk about by the way sorry sorry interrupt you one more time the thing i just said by the way i think is important uh i said why isn't that the business model for this podcast i think way too many podcasts try to just do ads and we've talked in the past about like super cast which lets you do like a paid a paid kind of super premium version of it for your hardcore fans who pay you nine bucks a month or five bucks a month or whatever and uh you know i started a rolling fund largely off of the audience from this thing that said hey i've listened to this guy a bunch i trust him he's he has a good track record and so now that rolling fund is four million dollars a year that i get to invest into startups that's more value than all of the ad revenue that we had before um and so i think that more people should figure out business models that are different from the content that they're creating and so i'm surprised more podcasts don't have different business models i agree with you but we are working we're in one of the most lucrative niches there is i mean like if you're a comedian if you're um what's that [ __ ] called the two women who talk about sex all the time call her daddy yes like that's a little bit different so how do you make money off that that's a little bit different and that's actually what we're gonna talk about with pay communities so let's actually [ __ ] up let's and i'm going to bring that up so let's talk about what makes them interesting and what makes them not interesting so to me what makes them interesting is that they can grow pretty quickly so you had a podcast um you do this four million dollar fund now building the audience takes a while but you turned your fun on and you it was four million dollars in a matter of months very quickly so they seem relatively fast to grow they're really fast if you have an audience but compared to like a software company which would take 10 years i think you definitely could build it in a matter of two or three years second they seem pretty fun to run if the interest of your community is the same interest that you have if you if you if they don't then it's definitely not as fun but it's kind of interesting if you're very interesting if that's what you care about third you don't really need a lot of money to start one you kind of actually need no money you really could just start with a paid facebook group and you could have a really lean team to do it and finally they definitely seem pretty profitable because you can have a lean team but let's talk about the cons one and this is what i've learned with our paid stuff and from friends i think churn could be pretty high did you notice that churn was high in any paid communities you've been part of honestly the churn was not high in the paid community that i ran um i don't measure the year yeah yeah for sure but i was it was a monthly it was a monthly fee so you could churn out monthly right for trends i think you charge annually so you don't know your churn until you know sort of later unless somebody actively cancels so it's not like uh like enterprise software return where it's like a net like a 100 negative yeah so that that i don't think that exists in most communities by the way my my paid community just for real numbers mine was seven percent a month was churning which is like if you just if you're not adding any new members you know that doesn't take long for it to go to zero but i think seven percent is one year no i'm talking about monthly i was monthly i was churning seven percent and so uh so oh you're saying one year for it to go to zero yes i think if you have a i think if you have a four percent churn that's 18 months and and so when with including my growth i think my net churn was like one percent so i think i was adding six percent and i was losing seven percent basically every month and um can you share anything about trends what was the retention like yeah um so we had some payment issues when we first launched so basically we had some issues um where if someone signs up on day one and on day 366 they get a renewal um the credit card statements there a lot of the banks will be like whoa whoa whoa what's this that's fraud so we actually had a big fraud a problem with banks blocking it but 80 of people uh were opted in to uh renew in the year one or in renew in year two in our first cohort um ballpark ballpark about 80 which is pretty good but not but like it's hard to get new customers on a consistent basis yep um okay so uh the second thing is a lot of times they don't scale that well and the reason they don't scale that well is if your community is kind of like trends where you value close-knit connections or tiger 21 more people makes it actually worse now if your community is content based which we're going to talk about in a second it can actually make it way better but a lot of communities like a ypo like or um like if there's 150 people at your meeting versus five people at your meeting one is worse than the other the scale gets worse for two reasons one is exclusivity so if the reason to be in this group was that it's exclusive the more people in the less exclusive it is or the if the value is that oh i really like this conversation this conversation was really really nice but now you get a noisy room of a thousand people well now it's just too noisy i can't keep up with this i don't know who these people are some of these people are saying stupid things i'm out of here right so that's the two reasons that the scale scalability hurts yes and it can work though because if you're a reddit which is a community not a paid community but it's a good community um you want more you need more you need way way more people if you are um quora you need way more people if you're some of the other examples that you need you need way more more people is good and that's great um but it's not always good to add more people so what i want to talk about is a few communities that i found that i think are interesting and then i want to talk about opportunities in the space and then finally we can talk about what i think you need to build a successful community um so the first one that i discovered and i've actually brought up here a ton it's called aventa have you seen aventa no okay so eventa i know the first example is gonna it's like doesn't even entirely apply because i think aventa is actually a free community but you need to apply and eat or get invited so it's somewhat similar but eventa is a community is a professional group um i believe it has uh 18 000 participating members and it's for executives particularly uh are you on the website right now no i'm on our our notes okay uh basically it's for fortune 500 or fortune 100 people um it's people like the i don't even like because i've never worked at a company i don't even understand all these roles but like a cio was that a chief information officer so uh i said c-s-o i'm looking at their website um c-i-s-o i don't even i don't know what c-i-s-o means it was that chief information security officer yeah cso yeah so these are like things that i don't even oh i guess they have cfo i know that is cheap uh financial officer so it's basically executive you just turned into a glossary section for sam to figure out well you know what the role phro is yeah that's basically your hr chief hr officer basically okay i guess that one was easy a cdo i don't know that one chief data management officer because come on a lot of people aren't gonna know what this stuff is but it's a big thing they have 18 000 members and check this out they sold in 2016 for close to 300 million dollars it was 375 million they sold for and it was for 12 times profit which means their profit was 23 million dollars a year and almost all of that profit came from sponsorships and so the way it works is is that uh they would get groups of 10 or 20 people they would host a talk uh like i think it was mostly an online talk that says like how walmart is gonna handle how walmart is gonna promote work remote work and ten people like i'm just gonna guess what's a fortune 500 so like the cmo of northern i'm looking at now the chief information officer of northern trust i don't know what that is but it sounds like a huge company uh the cio of um delta of chevron of nestle is going to go which is like it's only 10 people at that talk but it's 10 people who each control 20 000 people and sponsors will pay stupid amounts of money hundreds of thousands of dollars to reach these people enough that it makes 25 million dollars a year in profit uh very interesting an interesting community again like tiger 21 if you go to the website it just kind of looks like pretty old school mostly older white people so who knows if it's if it's hip or at least like in the know of everything but where's that where's this land with you interesting uh it's interesting but i think you know if i'm most people i'm like okay the hard part of this is going and getting the cio of nestle or the cmo of delta to join some group how do you do that and i remember what's the name of the the mastermind group that's the more popular company not tiger 21 but like the other one we've both studied i can't remember the name ipo young presidential organization no no the the one that does like a hundred million dollars a year uh it's a competitive ypo yeah oh uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what's that i don't remember what that's called uh except for the c i think it slips my name is what is this as well anyways so vistage uh does the same thing as this and i remember getting phone calls saying uh from some you know pick up some random number and it was hey sean you know this is wendy from vistage uh okay have we have we met um yeah actually i've heard a lot about you um you're the ceo of monkey inferno right yeah that's right uh again like where do we meet no no see i'm i'm actually the chapter president for san francisco for vistage and um i actually want to invite you to join our ceo network uh we have ceos from this company this company this company and uh we just really think you'd be a great fit for for our ceo group we meet up about once a month in san francisco um it's a great time blah blah blah okay ceo group you you sound like you know me you're talking about my city this sounds pretty legit um okay so what are you asking me for yeah so the membership is twenty thousand dollars a year and uh and i was like oh okay this is a sales call [ __ ] uh like good job you got 45 seconds into the sales call and so this is how them and i don't know if it was them exactly but it was a company just like them uh was recruiting people was just they were just cold calling c-level people with a script that made you feel like they were calling for you uh based on your city and your company name and your role your job title there and so i think this is what you would have to do is you'd have to be a pretty badass cold caller and you'd have to figure out how to get this thing going with just enough brand names where this sounds legitimate i look i host an event called hustlecon i've over the years i've probably had 150 speakers um tens of thousands of attendees when i started it i didn't know any of these people i cold emailed them and there's a way to play it off that it's cool to be part of um there's a way to get customers i think that's a little bit better than cold calling and now i think cold calling cold emailing like that should exist and you should do that i think there's a few different ways like having a podcast uh there's a few interesting ways to do it um but nonetheless i think it's an interesting community the second one that i want to bring up and i got hold of their deck uh a year ago and i could have invested into it and i skipped it i passed and i think that might have been a mistake but it's called soul savvy have you heard of soul savvy it's like a shoe thing yeah it's pretty interesting it's a sneaker head lover community something like that yeah so it costs 33 a month and you basically when when i was got their deck it was basically just a slack group that's all it was and i don't know if that's what it is anymore but there's a lot of kids probably grown people as well who are uh want to get insider tips on when a certain drop of a shoe is and they somehow game the system like it's what it's called cook groups so there's these like groups where they team up and somehow i don't know anything about the space but they somehow get insider information on when a drop is gonna happen and they and they collaborate and scheme together on how they can get access to these certain shoes now what soul savvy's doing is they started with shoes it was just a slack group which i think is stupid by the way i think if you're building one of these on a slack group that's not the right move but they get they get because they have a group of i think they have 5 000 members now so it's 160 000 mrr um because they have this contingency of 5 000 like really big shoe fanatics they can probably give them special access to x y and z they can do interviews with special people it's kind of interesting they raised two million dollars uh recently they say that they're adding 400 people to what to their waitlist a day i don't know if that's true but yeah it's an interesting it's an interesting space nonetheless what do you think of that uh i think you did good by passing on it i think it's a cool business for the person who owns it it's definitely not a as constructor right now that i don't see how that becomes a super large business worth investing in worth why they need two million dollars and how they're going to turn that into you know a 200 million plus company i don't really see that because like we said communities themselves this you know these chat groups don't scale and um you know you're looking for diehards who are going to pay if you're paying 33 a month right like you know that's more than it's like you're providing more value than amazon prime you know what i mean like that's double that's triple the price of amazon prime and so you know you really have your yeah the hardcores are going to go for it but also the more people you let in the more people who all have access to the same information the same tips the same drops that they're trying to go buy the harder it gets for you to actually go buy anything that's valuable so i don't really see how this becomes a big big venture scale business but i think it's a great idea for somebody who's a big shoe fanatic to create a community like this i think that's an awesome lifestyle business to to own and uh like if that's your thing that's great i love it i agree with you um so let's talk about three i can can i give you can i give you two characteristics i think make it work one is high passion um and then the second one is the ability to make money on the other side so this happens a lot with stock trading groups so um there are a bunch of stock tip groups out there where people are looking for additional information and they want to be in a group where the crowd is moving a certain direction um you have this for sneaker heads you have this for nfts right now collectibles um so so the key characteristic is it's not just like i'm a big fan of the you know the golden state warrior so i'm going to join this paid community for them typically that doesn't work as well as if i join this group i'm going to get tools that are going to help me make more money so it's a very simple money and money out calculation for people and i think that's why it works for sneakerheads and it works for trading cards and it works for crypto but it doesn't work as well for like you know people who just love gossip girl yes so there's a few ways i think that if you're going to build this uh you've got to think about the first is the amount of money that your company is going to make is exactly what you said which is it's directly in proportion to the amount of revenue that the uh attenders member can make back so for example if you are enthusiasts of rc cars um well the equation here is how much revenue the attendee or member is going to make times how many there are so members of people who like rc cars i have no idea i just made that up but there's probably not that many of them and because it's like a hobby that you don't really make any money from you probably cannot charge a lot for it so that like probably won't be massive that's not i mean maybe you should do it but that doesn't mean it's going to be actually that big so that's the math that you have to do which is how much revenue is the member going to make and how many of those potential members are there right or or the one like you said with tiger21 so tiger21 is actually like that right when you when you go and you hear somebody's portfolio you're going to get investment ideas and even a single investment idea a single like improvement to your portfolio if you have over 10 million dollars in investable assets one good idea is going to more than pay for the 30 000 of your membership excluding the friends you'll make and the deals you'll do together and that real estate thing you'll buy together and all that good stuff so excluding all that now on the other hand if you're looking at something like um the aventa or whatever where it's like what is the cmo of nestle gonna do when she meets the cmo of delta like they're not gonna directly get revenue out of it i don't think that's why i think it's like how hard were how hard is it to accumulate this group of people in a room so if it's really hard to reach these people these are all high value people then it's the membership is worth the value of the people in the group so if it's just a bunch of sneaker head buyers each individual member is bringing zero like clout to the table but if it's cmos of different companies and it's about how much clout do they need to bring to the table that's the value not so much how much revenue they're going to make yes and so let's talk about three groups that i have that i think this could work for so if you're going to start a paid community i'm going to start with the bottom one or i actually think it's the best one but it's fun i'm on our list nurses we've talked about nurses a ton it's an interesting demographic i think nurses are kind of cool for this space for two reasons or three reasons the first work could pay for it maybe i think work would maybe pay for it second nurses are typically i've spent time around nurses so they're typically women and they typically are people who feel like downtrodden like they feel like they're forgotten because they're not worked overworked underpaid or underappreciated yeah and that so groups that are the um whatever you just said i guess i don't know how to explain it but groups that are like the us versus them like we don't have someone speaking for us typically that's like there's a lot of like i've looked when i was researching communities there's so many successful um women like women discussing x y and z communities this is just like that so i think that they have that uh us versus them mentality and the third reason is there's a [ __ ] ton of nurses yeah have you seen this instagram account nurse life rn no how many is it it's 1.2 million members on instagram it's run by this guy i think his name is eb or ebby i'm not sure exactly how you say his name and it's this guy this is black nurse and um private they just went private uh they used to be public and i think you have to like you have to request so that they can make sure that you're a nurse before they let you in um which again is part one thing that communities do well the you know what's that quote it's like i don't want to be a part of any group that would accept me um you know the better your gate at the front uh the more people will value being in the group and so this is a group and they they just post mostly like nurse memes so it's like you know if you it's like being underappreciated or whatever they'll make a joke out of it or like you know coming home and realizing you still have whatever you know on your shoe and uh it's just you know relatable memes from the eyes of a nurse so that's how they like keep their members engaged it's just meme content that's a good like inside joke for the community but he partnered with the makers of bala shoes which is the nurse shoe brand that's coming out that's trying to be nike for nurses basically it's nike for for medical footwear and so he got equity in that company and gets paid every month because he is the promotional vehicle for the forbala shoes who wants to like penetrate this community right so um not a paid community as such but it is a private community and on top of that they do this now what would incredible health you know the startup that's raised i don't know how much money 25 million dollars from entries and horowitz and all that what would they pay to access 1.2 million nurses that are like engaged and trust this brand and trust this leader of the community they would pay a lot right uh nurse job boards like so so if this guy's ambitious he could create a job board he could create the next incredible health uh he could take equity in abolish shoes and be a part owner of the shoe brand like i think that's where this goes for for nurses i think that's a great example of one i think this could crush i think that guy is gonna that guy's sitting in a gold mine that like if you if you fast forward 10 years and tell me that he turned this 1.2 million person instagram page into a 100 million dollar company i won't be surprised right if you go and start truck life rrn right now uh i i think i think that's what's gonna happen after this pod truck um the second one this is shocking to me okay google sheets there's this guy who tweeted at me and he started this thing called sheets con and he had 6 700 people sign up is that i mean i guess that's shocking because like i know that probably a hundred million people plus use google sheets but and i guess it doesn't and i guess it also doesn't track me because i am a google sheets nerd and like i've dorked out about what i want and some of the most uh profitable online courses in the world are become an excel master how to use excel become better at excel those are like if you'll go look at the charts of uh most profitable online courses highest revenue online courses excel is always in the sort of top five yeah encore the founder of um teachable teachable one time told me that uh there was some guy making a million bucks a year and he was like the biggest earner on teachable on excel exactly so google sheets i 100 think you could do a paid community now it would have to be cheap though because it's the same it's the math of like how much money do you make for google sheets i think that there's absolutely something there um and then the last thing is this someone tweeted at me a community of vetted senior engineers who talk about advance advanced engineering concepts like how to scale a tech stack from 100k to 10 million users totally buy into that something like that that is incredibly niche and incredibly high-end where if there's a there's this other component that we didn't talk about with the community is you have to make it so that information that you gather in that group you cannot find online like um for tiger21 not that many people are going to talk about how like because it's embarrassing how do i um gift my child 15 million dollars without the government getting hands on it like that's not something you're going to tweet because that's embarrassing same thing with 100 000 to 10 million users there's just simply not that many people who have done it you're not going to find a lot of reputable information on that so that's another trait of these paid communities and why i think this one in particular is interesting i think any job in any any job can do this so nurses is a good one because you have some are going to be better than others because you have uh you know the more people the more potential and the more um kind of like insider knowledge is needed the more um downtrodden that group feels dumbfounded is kind of a negative word but kind of what you're saying like sort of like they feel that they need to take action um in order to like level up in some way uh the better and so like you know this could work for nurses but it could also work for designers i could see somebody just making a community of you know professional designers at all these different companies it's like yep we have designers from figma and from hubspot and from octa and from github and you should if you're a designer at one of these companies you're making 150 000 a year 200 000 a year um why would you not want to be a part of the like the best network of other designers like you where you can share tools tactics salary information if you're looking for new jobs opportunities if you're looking for new jobs like every job i think needs this and the more new infringe your job the more they the more the community is needed so like i know that our friend david spinks did this with community because community was like this there's not really like there's no chief community officer at these big companies but all greek companies say it's all about community facebook's like it's all about community twitch is like it's all about community and uh what does that mean and who in your company show me your who's in charge of community at your company right and there's typically not a c level who's in charge of community so david spinks said well look there's all these like kind of mid-level people who are community they run community for these big ass companies and there's no playbook on how to do their job they're underpaid they're under-appreciated and they're overworked trying to run all these events i'm gonna make the best community for community professionals and so he made the community for community people it grew pretty large he ended up selling the thing i don't know how big of a business it was in terms of a business outcome he might have been a little early but i think that's a great example of somebody doing this just taking a job and making it happen so there's my idea i just wanted to talk about communities i think they're actually kind of cool businesses i think a lot of people think that they want to start one but i also think that there's a lot of mistakes made of like charging too little and i wanted to show a few examples of companies that make like a quarter of a billion dollars of value off communities because i think they're kind of cool so that's all i gotta say about communities i'll leave it with this which is a lot of people i think the majority of people who listen to us they would love a non nine to five way to make ten thousand dollars a month and if i was gonna write or uh i read that in your uh your survey results yeah um yeah which we could talk about that but but in general that's that's the number one thing i think people listen to this would would just grab right away they don't all want to be founders of billion dollar companies or 200 million dollar companies or whatever um but if i said hey this is something outside your nine to five it's a side hustle it doesn't take up all your time and it's gonna bring in ten thousand dollars a month i would say that this to me right now is the number one way to do it i think there are some other ways right you could try e-commerce or drop shipping or something like that you could try to do a newsletter or paid newsletter i would do a community if i was gonna that would be my fastest path to that right now and i'll tell you you know the reasons why are all the things you said which is like it's not that much work to run the members provide the value to each other it's not all about you creating content all the time it's not that hard to spin up you just have to be smart about which group you're choosing and what where you kind of have an edge what's your group and then the last thing the downsides of it are that it can't scale super large but that's not your goal anyways you're just trying to get to ten thousand dollars a month of free free cash flow from your side hustle and so that is super achievable you know uh 20 a month for for 500 members and you're there you know so i think that is where i think this business fits in and i and i and i said before i actually do think they can scale but not all of them can some of them some some of them can but i i'm someone i've built a paid community that makes many many millions of dollars a year in recurring revenue and it is i would say that it's really hard actually to start because i had to create a lot of the content early on and i had to create the um the culture of the community but now i barely post and it has its own culture so yeah once it's once it's taken off yes you you create that flywheel and it works or not by the way i just did this i just did this in e-commerce and it probably i've probably put in a grand total of maybe eight hours into this thing and i'll tell you what it is so i wanted to create a community for people who have e-commerce stores so i created a gate at the front that said your ecommerce store must be doing a hundred thousand dollars a month what's up it doesn't even have a website there's no website um it's called club ltv ltv is like an inside term in the ecom world lifetime value it's like whatever e-com store owner wants is their their ltv to go up so i called it club ltv it's for people trying to increase their ltv and so i said you have to have a hundred thousand dollars a month of revenue i told so i tweeted it out so i definitely had a head start because i have an audience so that brought in about the first 35 members you said yep and they would just send me a screenshot of their dashboard yep here's me this much okay so so what i did was i made it free to join for the uh the store owners but you had to have this much value like this much you had to be this kind of far ahead in the game um but what i did then was i went to sponsors and i basically said hey i have a group of 75 store owners ranging from 1 million to 50 million dollars a year in revenue and all of them trust me like me and i meet up with them once a month and um would you like to sponsor this so i have one sponsor on board they paid me 5 000 a month um all i do is at the event i say boom i do my intro my high energy intro and then i say hey let me pass it to the guy that makes this possible that makes this group possible and he says his thing for two minutes he's had uh i can't say the names but um i don't know if i should i guess i just gave him a free plug so mercury bank is the sponsor of it because that's who i would use for e-commerce projects and they're they have a big push in e-commerce and so they've had at least from our group five different um five out of the 75 e-commerce stores switched to mercury just from the sponsorship so they've gotten their money's worth out of it including one companies that's a two billion dollar company has switched over to them and so uh you know they definitely got their value out of the sponsorship but and is this still going yeah this goes every month and so all that we do we have we have about one hour a month of of prep and then 90 minutes a month of the actual event and the the one hour of prep is that ben goes and gets a cameo made from a different rapper every month and the rapper's just shouting out club ltv he's like so we had like you know um we had uh sean paul do the cameo one month and he's like hey it's your boy sean paul just one of them like big big ups to club ltv you guys are all doing so great with your ecommerce store and he's like you know just it doesn't even make any sense but it's just like a video that plays and people like it because it's like i don't know it's kind of goofy so we do one we get one cameo ordered and he sends the calendar invite so just make sure everybody gets it sends one reminder email and then the last thing is that after the event he just says hey if you learned something really useful that you're going to implement in your business um email me the one line of the most useful thing that happened for you in the hour because the structure of it is we break everybody up into groups of six so you're in a group with six other store owners who do between 1 and 50 million a year in revenue and then the format is you say one thing you did in the last month that's really working it's driving revenue up and one thing that you're struggling with that you might want help from from the group and so afterwards they all email him the most useful things he just comp he just takes he just takes that sheet and he just sends it to everybody so hey here was the top insights from the group so that whole thing takes in one hour what's that why wouldn't you charge for that because i can actually make much more off the sponsorships for example i've been approached by you know the companies that want you to build their e-com store on their platform there's the people who want you to use them for email marketing there's the people who want for influencer marketing who are you using for facebook advertising who are using what's the agency that manages your your um your data tracking like your pixel stuff so all these companies each are willing to pay multiple thousands of dollars i just have to onboard them now um because now i have the group and the group is where the value is that's the honeypot it's the same thing you were talking about where eventa they have a free group and they might they have they are making 25 million dollars a year on the sponsors who want to talk more than that oh sorry that's the profit they're making 200 million but um that's the same model that i'm using here don't charge the members just make sure all the members have successful businesses and once they think this is going to get or do you care i mean i put zero effort into it since then but like we have 75 people who show up every month to the thing and um which is like 80 85 of the members show up every single month to the event so it's they're getting value out of it and so i bet if i told ben hey go on twitter and just reach out to these 250 cold email these 250 or these 500 e-commerce stores because it's very easy to get lists of e-commerce stores that are successful um i bet we could triple the size of the group if we if we put some effort into it but don't really care about it it's more for fun but it's cool because it's just free money every month and it's a good group to be in i want to learn from these people i want to learn what they're doing what's working what's not and make these connections that's bad apps well you uh you know i it's funny i've i've built the community as well but it's like every time i learn something like you the way you're doing it is a lot different than the way that we've done it and it's really neat to hear a different point of view and perspective uh on how to get it done right i optimize mine for how do i spend the least time but get just enough value whereas i think for you is like a part of your business you're like i'm gonna this is gonna be a multi-million dollar thing and we're gonna make it [ __ ] awesome which is awesome by the way if i had to start over i would have done it differently um i would have charged way more money right um because i've learned the mistakes that you have to add a ton of people to build a big business and a ton of people for certain groups isn't necessarily good right um fair play all right one more quick one before we go uh only if it's you because that's all i prepared okay um okay i kind of have like a like a advice thing this is my psa this is my public service announcement um do you know what the word inertia means yeah it's like uh uh when something starts moving it's hard to quit moving yeah so i've noticed this and you tell me if you've if this has happened in your life but i've noticed for myself and many people that kind of asked me for advice inertia explains like 90 of why people are doing what they're doing right they're doing what they're doing because they're already doing it and sometimes that's good because like hey the train's in motion so i kept going even when things weren't you know going gangbusters but i just kept going because it was it was already in progress and i'm glad i did because i had this good outcome but more often than not whether it's your business your relationship with somebody um maybe it's something you've invested in and why are you invested in it well i already own it i don't want to sell it okay but if i gave you that money today would you buy it no so it's like you know there's all these weird things if if i didn't if you weren't already doing this business if i gave you a clean slate tomorrow would you go start this business again no then why the hell are you doing it right and so in my life i've had this kind of like weird moment many times where i realized [ __ ] inertia is a [ __ ] and inertia is the reason i'm doing all these things i'm doing not because i actually want to be doing them or think that it's the right thing to do right now and so i just wanted to say this for to say see if this has ever applied to you um but b for anybody out there who's listening to this and like something is not going the way they want in their life coach like just check yourself like is this am i doing these things because i really think they're the right thing to do and i want to do them or am i doing them because this is just the way that things were already going and i i don't have the courage to change it i remember with my company when we sold our company it's because i had a conversation with my buddy silly and i you know while we were talking we were trying to figure out okay how do we make this bigger how do we make this grow and we were both looked at and we were like i don't think there's like we don't have great ideas like left we've tried so many things we've white boarded all these different ideas it's like do we even believe that this is a big opportunity like knowing everything we know now would i be still doing this opportunity if i wasn't already doing it and the answer was hell no and it was like so this was my test it's if this project ended tomorrow for whatever reason the company had to fold would i wake up tomorrow and start working on the same project and the second question was if the company had to dissolve the investor you know the company went bankrupt and i needed to go start again would i call these same people like hey you want to work together on the next thing because if i if no then i have the wrong people today if yes then i have the right people today if i would call them again and so for me it was always the people were right but the project was wrong and that's when i decided look maybe i should sell this instead of keep going on this for another five years and um you know just sort of keep going with the inertia so has this been a thing for you in your life yeah and i'll tell you how i combat it and i think i'm actually really good at combating this i think i'm i'm not great at a lot of stuff but i'm good at combating this and warren buffett says it's like uh bailing out water of a leaky ship he's like it's sometimes it's better just to get a new boat and the way that i get out of this is i do two things the first is i burn bridges so a lot of people say don't burn bridges i say no i actually do burn bridges so quit your job or move to another city or do something drastic because for me i've said i cannot focus on more than one thing at a time i can only focus on i can only focus on one thing at a time and so in order to like get to create to break inertia and create new type of momentum i like to create some something that i have my back's against the wall and i think more people should do that i think that's the way to go um they say that like once you have a kid you your that changes so that's one that's an example once you get fired a lot of things change so i like to create those moments where i have where yes i love those forcing factors and the second thing that i tell that i do and i actually tell people is i say just do something really small so for example if you're starting a business don't think about a million dollars what can you do tomorrow that's just one dollar and creating little tiny things actually helps a lot um because breaking the pattern is quite challenging and i love burning bridges i think that's the way to go well you gave advice on two things there you said basically you you cut things off and you burn bridges that's how you stop current momentum and then how and when you start you start with ultra small baby steps or uh and i've heard this now for many people so when i went to this tony robbins event he used to say he's like how many of you like if you think in your life has there ever been a decision that has like altered the direction of your life like obviously yes for all of us our life is full of choices and if we have made different choices we'd be in a different spot right now and so clearly like choice and decisions are like one of the superpowers that we have and he goes but how come there's times where you know maybe it's like weight loss you keep saying you want to lose weight you keep deciding to lose the weight you make that new year's resolution and then you don't do it right or this and that you know you you say you want to quit your job you want to start your business then there you are nine months later still in your job still with no business and so he says like the word decision we've kind of we just used it too freely he goes the word decision the root word of it like decision is like kind of incision which is a cut and he's like the word decision means to cut off the other possibility when you decide x you remove the possibility for y you cut it off completely and he always says like i forgot that um famous like story or whatever but it's like you know these people going the general is going they're trying to surge take over this island so they arrive on boat and they're trying to try to make it to land and trying to take over the land and he says you know if you want to if you want to win if you want to win the war get you got to burn the boats they say like if the soldiers know there's no boats there's no place to retreat there's no boat to get back on and go back home where you came from they'll win this island and um so he's you know the the story i guess i don't know if there's real or not but the story is the general burns all the boats and then the soldiers go and they win and same idea so that's kind of what you're talking about which is you're better than most in that when you make the decision you literally cut off the other opera option by physically moving by sending that email by like or cheaper or i make the old option really embarrassing or hard to continue doing so a good example is this is as we speak i have i'm actually going to talk not loud doesn't hear me i have a chef in my kitchen cooking for me and it's very expensive it's a very expensive fee and i'm doing it because i'm trying to i got actually really fit the summer time and then i got a little chubby and now i'm gonna get fit again and it cost me a lot of money to have this guy here doing this and the reason i'm doing it is because i'm gonna lose weight quickly and eat only the food because right i want to stop doing this and so that works really well another example is if you want to lose weight you sign up for a competition like an ironman or something you can't get out of something you cannot get out of and those types of forcing functions are the i have found for me personally who's pretty lazy and stubborn it's the only thing that works right i'm the same way i want to use psychology against myself i want to use my own psychology against myself so if i say something publicly like we've said on this pod we're going to grow this bot we're going to make this a top 10 podcast this podcast can be doing 100 000 lists per episode we've said that now egg on our face in front of all these people that we think are cool and we want to seem cool against if we don't make it happen if we don't if they don't see us taking the steps and taking this seriously to make it happen so when they see us putting thousands of dollars into our studio adding video adding youtube uh doing more research so we're coming onto these podcasts more prepared they see that we are taking massive action towards it and we can't be embarrassed on it tim ferriss used to do this thing where he would say i don't know if i don't know how real this was or this was just a thing he used to sell his books but he used to say if i wanted to lose weight i would give my friend a 5 000 check and say donate this to the kkk if i'm not this weight by this date it's already in the envelope you just have to put it in the mailbox and that he doesn't want to lose the money he doesn't want it to go to the kkk he thought of the worst possible outcome for himself that would give give use his own psychology in his favor to serve him in this case yeah there's a business around that it's called stick s-t-i-c-k-k or it's spelled like with two k's or something it's like a cute spelling and you have a referee of a challenge that you want to do you fund the account with a certain amount of money you pick something you hate and the referee deans if you hit it or not and then that money goes to your anti charity right yeah i i think that's a cool idea i think there's even more people can do to like use use our own psychology to get us to do the thing we really want to do in our life and of course you know like these things are kind of external motivators they're not great you know like what you would rather do is you know build great habits and you would rather be internally motivated and make a decision for yourself that this is this is like a must for you you're going to do it it's not a should um but but you know some of these these tools can help you get leverage and i'll actually leave it with that what what changed what are you talking about can you say or no uh for what do you mean why did i bring this up yeah i was talking to a friend and i just realized like i can help this friend the friend just needs to make a change and then the rig realization was that the friend didn't even want to be doing what they were doing anyways they were just doing it because of inertia and i looked at my own life and i saw all these different examples of where inertia had inertia was inertia had the drivers you know had the wheel and um inertia should not even be in the passenger seat a nurse should be in the trunk and it's just something you carry with you at the mo at the most and so i just felt like i need to say this in case there's somebody out there listening for whom this happens because when my friend was in that situation i explained it and they were like dude thank you like i needed to hear that because it made it more clear and now i'm kind of embarrassed that i'll just keep doing this just because of inertia like no that's not a good enough reason for me i'm gonna actually choose the things i do and then for better whatever they turn out at least i chose that path rather than like autopilot sleeping i think there's a lot of people listening that might say like and i think you agree with me and like taking drastic changes i think there's a lot of people listening who are like well that's pretty reckless um and my answer to that is yeah if you want like a drastic outcome you have to take a jurassic period yeah or or like be honest what is the real risk the real risk in almost all of life is mediocrity you know like my my trainer tells me this all the time he goes most people are so afraid of so many things it's like there's a lion sitting in the room he's like and i'll be the first to tell you look if there's a lion in the room don't meditate don't uh don't take deep breaths run if there's a lion run sure he goes but most of the time there's no lion in the room and basically what he's saying is like the things that we the things that we want to do we should have the courage to do the reason we don't do them is fear and um and one other you know like we should not be fearful all the time because most of the time there's no line in the room most of the time the risk is much lower than you think for the things you're hesitating on and the the real risk over the long term is mediocrity is having a mediocre life a life that's not on your terms that isn't the way you want and so um you know i think that's true and i think you can apply this to anybody like abraham if you if if i if i say this to you now or as you've been listening to the separate you is there a part of your life that you you think is like that's inertia that's inertia driving not not me choosing it could be doing this podcast i don't know how long you've been i hope you won't say that it could be though like because bray has big dreams so brady wants to start a company he wants to do all this stuff and he you know this pro this podcast was a passion for him and it turned into a job for him and i don't know like is this what he wants to be doing with his time or does he have a bigger dream and he's just doing this because he was doing this i don't know what do you think of bray what do we how what this is a weird episode this was the weirdest episode it kind of became about me but like that the community part felt less like a podcast and like we could charge for that there was so much value in there for the right person i think for a lot of people listening i think that's it was not as entertaining as the stuff that we normally put out i think but it was more valuable if that makes sense yeah uh i don't know which one is best so i guess we'll find out speed at us so we know and just tweeted us like i i don't know if bray i don't know if a brave speaks for the average listener we think he does so that's why we ask him but if you're like if you're like yeah i generally agree with the braves grades then tell us and if you don't agree usually and you're like don't listen to that guy also tell us go just go on twitter or email us or something and i don't blame you because i disagree with myself so oh also i put this out there uh everybody put the link to the hotline in the description of this i want to start doing q and a's where we take um ideally like somebody asking a question like you talking somebody asked this question we play it we respond to it or we take call-ins or something like that but i mean say i want to do some bonus episodes i opted him into this i don't even ask him if he wants to but we want to do some bonus episodes i committed to a third episode um so and if it's a q a that's like the e that's that's required zero work for me so yeah i think it'll be fun so we're gonna put a thing in it's basically a hotline where you can just ask your question to the mfm hotline and we will get those we'll sort through them we'll put the good ones into the episode and we'll answer them so uh do that all right i'm out hey everyone we did an interview with dave sellinger aka selly he's the founder of deep sentinel really interesting home security company dave is also really interesting himself he's a multiple time founder really cool guy not only do the guys discuss deep sentinel but they also talk about some of the opportunities dave sees in the moment so we'll leave this interview here at the end as a little bonus as a little nugget hope you guys enjoy and as always leave us some feedback so we're going to do a relatively quick statement segment uh dave do you go by david or dave uh go by dave you go by sally most of my my friends and co-workers call me sally sally all right that's a good one um selly s-e kelly uh i dig it um okay so i invited you to come on because i have this thing called senegal deep senator i say it right deep sentinel yep fentanyl um my friend noah you mispronounced his name you mispronounced his company is your friend's name really nella yeah i i people make fun of me because i mispronounce a lot of stuff but um i have been using this it's quite interesting and i want to give a summary of what this is my friend gave it to me basically i had ring these ring cameras and ring is pretty good i mean it's fine it's cameras but my friend noah was like oh that's cool you can watch people steal your [ __ ] um and i was like what do you mean he's like well i mean what's the point like you got to monitor all them and i was like yeah that's actually a great point he goes here try this thing called deep sentidol so i tried it and basically what it is is it's a it's a bunch of security cameras around my house and there's security guards watching it all the time and if something is triggered and uh they see someone at my door that looks suspicious or even just someone at my door they say hey who are you uh do you know the person who lives here what are you what are you doing here um whatever yadda yadda and i tested it online on my twitter handle and i like did the secret sign you could like put your hands above your head and do a sign and someone checks and goes hey is everything okay and it's just like pretty badass and so i invited you on because i wanted to learn a little bit about this did i describe the company accurately you nailed it right like our our motto really is um and one of our one of our marketing gimmicks is that we make a a t-shirt that says oh you have ring congratulations uh you know now you can watch people steal your [ __ ] and that's and that's literally kind of where no i got that is it i personally have uh i have a ton of cameras i've been a camera fanatic for a long time and my neighbor had a home invasion and so you know the the neighborhood it's a pretty scenario we all freak out and we're like you know what what can we do we have the police come and i introduce myself i'm kind of the head of the the neighborhood watch and blah blah so i i asked the cop i say you know look my neighbor she has all these cameras she has an alarm system you know why did she still get a home invasion and the cop who i'm now friends with by the way says like the rudest possible thing which is which is straight on point he says well you're the tech guy what did you think the freaking cameras were going to do and it was like this moment of just utter eye opening wtf was i thinking you're right like they're just cameras and they don't actually stop anything and so i i spent the next five years building a product that turns cameras into something that can stop crimes how many subscribers do you guys have we have uh about 2500 customers across the country about half of them are businesses and half of them are are residential and how many security guards do you have and where are these security guards so we're we're bordering on like kind of the the secret sauce here but i'll tell you we have a ratio of about one guard for every about 100 properties right now and that's how we make it so that it's affordable because uh it's a hundred dollars a month kind of our starting price point and if you think about like having a security guard at your house if you happen to you know have a bunch of friends who are billionaires for example they're spending thirty to a hundred thousand dollars a month for a security guard and our our entire point was like that's just not attainable to most people but security is really really important how do we make it affordable and so we use ai and like a bunch of technology in the middle to make it so that we can have one guard protecting lots of properties at once okay so you don't have to answer exactly but if i had to guess and i mean you just said it around 25-ish security guards a couple dozen a few dozen some some number in that ballpark yep um and how can this how well the question that i had when i was thinking about this business is two things the first is this whole idea of like someone real life actually doing manual work is like on the other side of a of a tech a tech product is kind of interesting to me i remember you guys remember when you were younger there was that service called cha-cha and you could like text them a question and they would answer it totally like i think there was a real person on the on the other end who would just google the question you had because google wasn't on your phone at the time yep that's exactly what it was and that's kind of like what you're doing and so my question is this how do you scale that and you just think of a ton of guards and also what other services can i apply this to so that's exactly the way that we think about it kind of inside of our four virtual walls of the company um so so number one the the number one thing that we do to scale is that if you think about the the old business of security right like a guy or a gal sitting at a chair watching the entrance to you know a corporate building that is inherently not scalable right you have no levers because you have a physical chair and what's neat about deep sentinel and the big kind of aha moment for me is that there's all this internet stuff that can sit between the cameras and the guards and when there's internet stuff that means you can instrument it that means you can you can start measuring things and then like uh what i did at amazon and my last couple companies you once you have data you can start optimizing it you can start looking at what are the real problems what are the things that aren't problems how do i how do i make the guards into super guards right like in fact at our office we have an iron man at the entrance because that's that's the way that we think about this is that our technology turns these you know regular awesome guards into super guards that can instead of having four guards protecting one property you have one guard protecting 100 one guard protecting 200 properties because all of the the the ai filters out events it also sends them clips that it thinks are interesting that they should look at like hey here's a clip from 30 seconds ago maybe these things are tied together and so as you do more and more of that it's not like we're getting rid of the people but we're making each individual person more powerful right and more engaged in their work um the last thing i'll toss out about this too is that one of the other things that a lot of people don't know about guards is let's take let's take like the most badass special forces guy in the world right like i'm ripped i've been trained for for years and i'm going to put you on night watch so you get to stay up between 10 a.m and 6 a.m and you're in an area that's like this dangerous it doesn't matter how badass you are right like the tendency to fall asleep when there's nothing happening for eight hours in a row is incredibly high one of the other neat things about what we do is because we spread this across all of our customers there's always something happening we don't have like a lull time where our guards are just not doing anything they're always engaged and so we're we're able to keep them awake engaged like you know stimulated in a way that allows us to provide like what you just said you show the the symbol on your cameras and bam within 10 seconds there's a guard responding you can do that 24 7. okay and so where are the other opportunities like this what do you call this this model i don't know what you call it where you have like real real people doing stuff yeah so um the the kind of like way to still be called a tech company is you make the human the second part so you call it human in the loop that it's a technology loop and there just happens to be a human for a tiny piece of the work uh versus a traditional services business where the human's doing everything and so human in the loop it's being applied right now already in some other industries like cyber security uses it so if they detect like what looks like an intrusion or like in the case of ricotta where they don't detect it until after it's done and the hackers release it uh you know that you know that was a that was a jab at them but like you know the idea being that the computers can detect things that are kind of anomalous but the human really applies his or her intelligence to figure out the last little bit so it's also being applied like in in medical telehealth right so you have these experts and you use technology around them to make sure that you take an expert who could only generally be regional historically but now a cancer expert because of video conferencing and you know remote records and things like that can actually have a lot more impact for us what we think about are how do we take this in a security context because we want to stay in security and how do we expand that to a a virtual greeter at a multi-tenant apartment building a skyrise in in new york for example how do we apply that to watching elderly folks at home who may need just a check-in every 15 minutes how do we apply it to hotels where you don't need to have a guard there 24 7 but you need to check the lobby every 15 minutes and how do we do that at a cost that's 10 or 100 times less than having a physical guard on location that's interesting how big is that how big is that market of just checking in on how many doormen are there in new york you know you know it's it's a great question actually one of the most interesting things about this market is uh that it's it's pretty big right so the alarm side's about 20 billion dollars and then the guard side's like 20 to 30 billion dollars but what what deep sentinel hits is like this really kind of weird seem where there hasn't been a solution at all ever and that price point's between about 100 bucks a month and 10 000 a month there is nothing and there's nothing there not because there's no demand it's supply side constraint there's never been anybody that's been able to create a product that has a price point in that price band and so what we're finding is that there's just this huge vein of untapped demand right like a hotel let's use that example for that my friend happens to own a few hotels and he was telling me it costs him 3 000 a month to have this guard who's kind of schlocky to be completely honest i don't know if that's an appropriate term on your podcast but i've never never heard that word am i the only jewish person on here okay so i i'd say so uh uh i don't know another word for it but but he's schlocky so he's he's kind of sloppy he you know he's not really going to scare anybody away and he slept to use another speech he slept up to the place that's right that's right so he uh he shows up three times a night this is for three thousand dollars a month he shows up three times a night and just walks around the parking lot for about five minutes he gets a total of 15 minutes of security over the course of 10 hours and it's 3 000 bucks whereas with us we'd be able to provide that service for for maybe a thousand dollars a month and there'd be someone watching 24 7 in case something happened it's just it's so massive what the disruption is when you create something where there's literally just been kind of a vacuous hole and so you know that's kind of a way of me avoiding the question answering the question but like it's it's tens of billions of dollars that's just untapped there's buildings that would love to have somebody greeting them in new york that don't have someone because their cost would be 20 000 bucks a month but if it costs a thousand bucks a month bam they do it in a heartbeat so what does your security person do when they see somebody that is a potential intruder are they calling the cops are they like yelling through the camera hey buddy back away you know i'm a tough guy inside you know what are they doing to actually eliminate the threat so so there's there's a bunch of different things that that we do and and you know you mentioned two things on on kind of the ends of the spectrum right and it's a it's kind of like an escalation spectrum and so on one end right like hey i see a kid right that's the really most innocent thing and the kids kind of like poking at the door and so we have a juvenile protocol each of these things are in their own little protocol that we train the guards on and that's part of what the technology does the technology helps them know the the potentially relevant protocols to engage here and the uh and with the kids you'd say hey hey kiddo i see you're there do you belong here right and that's kind of the softest just touch right then there's an adult that may be looking a little creepy and then we say hello this is deep sentinel security can i help you and that way if it does happen to be a friend or family we're not insulting them right so sam's best friend from college that we've never seen before shows up and he decides that the right thing to do is go right up to the door and start looking through the windows without knocking you know that's the greeting he's going to get he's going to know somebody's there but he's he's not going to necessarily feel insulted right off the bat if if somebody shows up and they've got a crowbar it's sirens on hey stop what you're doing and and the the we automatically escalate so either that guard or another guard is contacting police all of that's happening within about 10 seconds and that's where the neat the other neat thing starts is that because we have somebody watching our calls to police are very different than what they get from like if you have adt or like some some i'll use the word again some other schlocky kind of home security system adt calls and they say hi uh this is this is becky from adt uh i have a motion alarm in the living room and the police say well is it the homeowner is it a cat is it the wind is it the dog and she says no no this is becky from adt i have no idea i'm just calling you because i thought i'd waste your time hangs up when we call i say hey i've got a white male six foot three he's got a crowbar and i have and he's trying to break into this building here's the address i've just given them a description of the suspect a description of the crime and the existence of weapons every single police department in the nation that's what their dispatch is designed to do and they just described this at his own house practicing crowbar combat i know right and that's why two way out but that's a that's a great joke but like that's why two-way audio is really important because by the way homeowners do do crazy stuff and so sometimes i have like a sledgehammer that i use to like exercise you've just described me working out well and we'll say hey like are you there and you say no no it's me sam here's my special code word and then we don't call the police so when we call police it's a hundred percent verified our calls are 100 verified and most people don't know this when alarm companies call the police and ask for dispatch it's 99 false alarms in fact freakonomics wrote a little piece about this and they're just like it's it's horrendous it's a waste of police time right and so most police jurisdictions have actually passed laws where they don't have to respond at all to alarm calls yeah that's what i was gonna say in san francisco i feel like i can call the police and say hey this guy's got a gun to my head and they'd be like well you know let's see if you could if you can resolve that with your hoa before we uh send somebody out there right then you can get his name and call us on monday that'd be great right and so how many crimes have you guys stopped we stop about 15 to 20 crimes a day i mean and that's crimes means like stealing packages it means everything right drum beats right like it's just it's stealing packages it's attempted break-ins it's assault why don't you have a a tick-tock channel that publishes every crime that stopped just the footage of the crime we do it it's the stopped video channel yeah send everyone to it okay i gotta get what is it called it's stopped it's on youtube we're just starting tick tock we just found tick tock right like i'm old sorry so like i didn't i didn't really get tick-tock my kids were on it and they were like look at me dance and we did like the dances but i didn't really think about it as like hey let's post these things on there uh people are loving it on tick tock so because on youtube what is it it's stopped what it's the uh it's the stopped deep sentinel stopped video series and every single week we produce the the best 5 10 15 20. oh it's amazing these have thousands of views great good for you some of them have close to a million i think yeah we have a couple that have a million uh and it's it's cool like it's what's neat about it is it kind of taps into um you know if you've ever been the victim of one of these crimes like you you want nothing more than to get back whether you're getting back at that individual person or just like getting back at the world because it makes you feel powerless and one of the neatest things that you know we actually don't really publicize that we do as a company um is we we actually reach out to people that have been the victims of of like really heinous crimes and uh you know a lot of times i i reach out personally and say like hey i i i'm not asking you to promote us i'm not asking you to do anything i just want you to know that we've created a product that actually can make you feel safe in your own skin safe in your own home again and i'd love to just give it to you for the next six months and uh and it's the neatest thing like i actually this morning i happened to drive by there was a there was a home invasion in my hometown um last year and i gave the system to these people that live in pleasanton and uh and i happened to be by their house this morning so i stopped in this morning and the husband answered the door and you know he's like he's a like a big tough dude right and he he's not the type person that you would expect to say like i'm really scared in my home but we all have like our our kids or our family or the moments where we're not home or or like we're asleep and it was really neat to hear him just you know i say like this is this has really changed the way that we live and and after something that horrible you know it's it's really life-changing so we only have a few minutes left in this segment but what i want to ask you is where's the opportunities based on what you've discovered because i think like i've actually read i like reading about um companies that got big 20 30 40 years ago and there's a lot like the beginning of adp or adp what's what's the security um and a bunch of other like interesting security basically the same company but yeah yeah go ahead uh a bunch of companies that are just like like um the guy who started um you know wonderful brands like he got a lot of his wealth i believe from a security guard company like security guard companies are just kind of interesting to me for some reason it's kind of weird um in this space with this like human in the loop service in the security space where's interesting opportunities that i wouldn't know about because i'm not involved um one of one of the ones that we see a lot of uh is construction recently um and uh the what's what's interesting about construction yards is you have these massive amounts of assets with no security like literally no walls most of the time right like sometimes you have chain link fences and and that's gonna generally in security like speaking outside of like deep sentinel in terms of human in the loop one of the other interesting things that that we're seeing is like just the movement of stuff seems pretty unsolved right like there are still companies that make a hundred million dollars a year and they have a line of business called cash like in the age of venmo and in the age of paypal and in the age of apple money and facebook money and and every type of virtual currency in the world there's still people getting paid money to like put their lives in danger to go move pieces of paper around i mean it seems like so absurd i'm reading uh hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy right now in the first chapter it says like humans are generally miserable because they spend all their time moving green paper around and green paper doesn't make them happy and and it made me think of like the this this business that like oh my god every every year people are like scared and die because they have to move the paper around how dumb is that right like there has to be something for i mean just i don't know vapor take a picture of it and vaporize it and then digitize it i don't know but that one seems like there's there's just a a asinine amount of risk and opportunity there so construction is there one more um what's another i mean like most of them are pretty obvious right like car lots oh my god actually car lots are interesting too because one of the things that that people don't realize is that everyone thinks like oh my god car lots everyone's going to come and steal a car but that's kind of a big crime actually the number one thing that we see is people going and breaking into cars at car lots because uh there's just lots of um catalytic converters there's lots of stereos and there's lots of leather and so you know every once in a while there's somebody like stealing cars off the cartridge but what we see a lot of is just these people going and grabbing the doors actually wait i'll go with one more meth so meth uh meth is a a horrible thing right um but what meth has led to is like this really weird pattern of mail theft and i call it agricultural mail theft and so one of the things that you'll see this a little bit on extra like hey i saw this guy like going and checking my door handles or checking my mailbox and then it goes on next door and everyone in the neighborhood for like 15 miles says oh i saw that same gal or guy too and meth has created this entire lifestyle where these people actually go and farm neighborhoods and they'll go in a cyclical schedule go from this neighborhood tonight to this neighborhood next week in this neighborhood and they literally check every single door every single mailbox as again kind of tending it like they would be tending their plants in agriculture and uh and it's just really it's a weird what are they stealing is they're just stealing mail or they're still stealing something violated um they're stealing wallets and and mail that's typically checked they're actually pretty careful and when i say agriculture like they're actually careful so so when they put your mail back it's very infrequent you see them just throwing it on the ground because that's that that like ruins their their agricultural area so it's actually really interesting when you see the video they're like they open your door and then they're very careful when they put your mail back because the last thing they want is for somebody to find out and frequently again if you look at next door what you'll find and this is why deep sentinel is needed everywhere is they'll go be like oh my god i went back for the last three months and this guy's been coming every four days and i only happen to notice this one time because he took something too valuable to me and and it's just this really consistent theme across america that your doors are getting checked your mailbox is getting checked way more than you're aware of i've caught a bunch of people my camera's being being weird i get an email where it says a guard intervened i've caught a few people uh i hate it yeah it's almost made me freak out more now that i know well i mean i i it the the the good news is that you know you do have a layer of protection the bad news is you now know like for real like if if you had a ring you're getting 100 alerts a day and so you just didn't know because who's going to comb through all 100 of those alerts every single day just not it's not worth it well i appreciate you uh coming on this is super interesting i've been a fan of your product so it's nice to talk to the creator of it uh one of the creators of it um this is pretty badass um well thank you guys yeah i mean as you can tell like i'm super proud of it i'm happy to talk about it any day if you put me on for five hours i'd keep going right like i love it it's it's the neatest company i've ever had a chance to touch and i'm i'm so proud to be able to touch people did you help build ring or did you work at amazon i worked at amazon yeah so i was there way before ring times how long what did you start there uh 2002. holy moly i bet we should have you on another time just ask stories about that too i i have lots of stories there's lots of people that have great stories about amazon amazon is such a neat company to have watched go from you know when i joined every single uh every single quarter the wall street journal would run a story when does amazon shut down because it just isn't sustainable what uh number employee were you oh gosh uh you guys were in the thousands at that point probably like three thousand something like that probably you uh haven't sold too many shares all of them oh my god but good good wait good news though i sold them in order to start redfin so and i held on to some redfin stock so i did not know that dude you've been doing it wait redfin the real estate thing redfin the real estate thing i didn't know you started that so you've done all types of [ __ ] man i tried to yeah it's been it's been really neat i've had i've been i've had a very blessed career um but again like what's neat about this one is you know redfin's really really cool we invented interactive mapping but this business the number of times i get an email every single week that says you changed my life that's tech companies get criticized for like oh you're just building toys and frivolous stuff you're like it's like you're literally saving lives uh so you get to do both you got to do fun you know tech with with all kinds of crazy [ __ ] involved and at the same time you're saving lives so i like that i'm jealous of my friend james who invested in you guys early on i remember seeing him post about it on facebook and i was like this is a pretty good idea and what i didn't put i didn't think about at the time because i was like how are they going to scale this up i thought oh they're going to do labor arbitrage they're going to get people the philippines to watch your stuff and uh you know it'll just be a lower hourly rate you know and the price point will be you know sort of high unachievable for most but what you're saying is smart which is one guard is going to have 100 houses under monitor most of them most of the time nothing is happening so you don't need eyeballs on the screen and the ai is going to basically say something's going on on house 42 42 pops up human eyes decide is this good or bad next swipe to the next and so it's really it's actually more than human in the loop it's in my opinion like these should be called something else this should be called likes you know super services or something like that because it's taking a example and it's scaling it like a superhero where it's like oh what if that security guard could not just watch one house but actually could watch 100 houses now you have a super service that can scale in the way that services typically can't and so i think that's even more i know for pitch decks you use hooping a loop and i've seen that a bunch but i i think super services i freaking love that dude i'm gonna steal that from you if that's okay yeah that's great uh i think this is awesome and now now i'm kicking myself because i'm like oh [ __ ] that this actually if i'd asked one question earlier this would have made sense to me and now it does so thanks for coming on and and uh explaining it to us hey thank you and and if you're still interested we're raising another round this year so hey uh you know let me know see the only problem is i'm a cheap indian dude who's like oh the price back then the price then would have been i don't know what you could raise your first round at maybe 10 million or something like that 20 million i have no idea what it was but uh now i bet like have you you've raised an a right uh we're in the process of raising the a right now so okay actually i'm going to email you i'm going to invest in this company anyways you got to send it to me too look you guys are i'm not taking your spot we can both get in baby can we i mean you've raised 24 million dollars um right or 23. we've raised we've raised a bit we have a we have a really unique investment vehicle that's open right now so you know if you're serious uh there there is an opportunity because you know adt and these guys what are the other security companies the big ones i've looked into this before but they're all multi-billion dollar sort of sleeping giant incumbent types that for them to do something like this they either have to buy you or they have to like change their dna inside their bodies which is not going to happen so has a 6 billion market cap and wait i'm so confused adt has 5 billion in revenue and a 6 billion market cap is that right if you look at their enterprise value that's the secret they have a 6 billion dollar market cap because they have 10 billion dollars in debt so they actually have an enterprise value of 15 billion dollars 16 billion okay so there's some by the way and the other way we could do this is if you happen to have 10 billion dollars i could borrow i could do that too yeah this podcast doesn't pay that well [Laughter] yeah we uh we missed that one but uh dude send me the information i'm definitely interested if you wanted to talk about it or you're willing to have either of us that sounds awesome happy to do it it's funny how such a small thing makes difference i saw the video sam posted and the operator the security guard who spoke back was like clearly not like you know my relative in india and i was like oh wait this is actually going to feel totally different to have a human who's got your back who feels like a trusted american voice there with you right there with you and then like right right now in my neighborhood our front gate we have like a door guy just sitting there all day couldn't stop anybody if we wanted to um but you know just sort of useless uh you know there's all these little points of failure whether it's mail it's the doorman it's your personal house it's my for example for e-commerce or warehouse yeah they spend a lot of money you know just guarding because they have millions of dollars of goods in their warehouse and um and it's just so inefficient so capital inefficient the way they try to uh secure you know have security for those things nowadays because you have alarms which are just going to be like kind of just a sound you know you're playing an mp3 to protect you or or you have a human you've got you know a club spotify now by the way mp3s are the old ones that's right for you we're going to stream we're going to stream the security to you or you have a guard who's 99.9 percent of the time gonna do nothing and um and so it just doesn't make sense right like so finally you know a solution that makes more sense and no i'm not paid to say this it just makes sense to me well i i if i can i'll tell you one more story one of the things that got me off my butt to do this was uh there was a story of this elephant that escaped a zoo and the video was uh the elephant not not a small animal right like an elephant right and the elephant did not escape the zoo by going around the guard the guard was sitting at the at the gate and and like you know the chairs tilted back the way that you expect the chair to be told guard is totally asleep and a freaking elephant walks right by him and leaves the zoo and you're just like there has to be something better than this this is ridiculous has there ever been a conversation like in san francisco there's all these car break-ins like can a city adopt this do you ever do you think a city realistically is going to ever adopt this where you know the cameras are on the street post or you know on the lights and basically you can guard the whole street of cars that way or no you know we've we've talked to a couple of cities about it the thing that i don't like is i don't like the idea of big brother being part of the government like one of the things i really like from kind of an ethical visit i'm a pretty principled guy i like to think um is that by making this surveillance private and focused on private property and protecting that property in service to that individual you don't have that like panopticon risk of turning into you know the evil eye and and uh you know we never question who our customer our customer is the person that that pays us and owns this property and that's a it's a tried and true like deep principle of you know american liberty that's fair enough i like that yeah the person who buys it is the one who's opting in to their own protection basically yeah yeah that's right my um someone just rang my doorbell and i know that because my i just got a notification on my phone that deep senator is talking to him this is where you're gonna people are going to be like you didn't know they rang your doorbell because they rang your doorbell like [Music] i can't i can't hear it but i know that uh i could i can see on my phone i just got the notification i love it it it makes me feel so much safer for my i've got two little girls and i absolutely love it it's great i'm digging this i'm i mean i can see my wife in our courtyard this is awesome i'm a fan well thank you guys i love i love getting the opportunity to be here thank you so much for bringing me on and uh you know and and for being a good customer thank you hold on good talking man i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back [Music] uh

i i don't think i would want to do something that high profile because if you screw up it would be a big deal oh look at you you're afraid to fail now oh you make it big you sell your company and now and now you're like i i gotta i gotta watch my step what's going on where's the guy with the pirate ship tattooed on his thigh what would that guy do yeah i feel like i can rule the world sean's new studio are you in a garage is that what that is i am in my garage we uh we upgraded we improvised so we did this crazy thing where we had talked about on the podcast we were like [ __ ] we need to like upgrade our setup i think mostly was you just telling me to get a haircut which is fair um and wear a shirt wear a shirt and uh i took that as i need a whole new studio uh so so basically these guys who are um from chicago they're like 23 year old guys who love the podcast they were like they heard that and this is like their forte they do like camera audio they have their own podcast they have their own youtube channels they're basically what i realized was i went and watched their youtube channel and this youtube channel has like this guy henry his youtube channel has like i don't know five hundred and subscribers so it's not like some big youtube channel but if you watch it it's the same level of quality of like video audio and editing as like casey neistat's channel and i showed this to our friend sully and i go i go check these guys out like look at look at their channel these are the guys coming this weekend to make my studio and he goes he goes i remember when i was kind of like 21 22 we were coming up and what the kind of 30 and 40 year olds used to say was oh man you guys have this huge advantage because you're like you're you're like digital natives that's what they were calling us like we grew up with a computer and the internet like i think we got the internet and computers when we were like in sixth grade i don't know about you it's probably around the same fifth sixth grade something like that and so you know first for our parents they were getting a computer when they were 35 or 40. so it's just like you know you didn't have that you didn't have it to grow up on and so he goes these guys this is the next the next wave they're video native basically they grew up with a camera in their hand and they just like constantly shoot videos they know how to edit it they're not afraid to be on camera and like it's such a super power and i think it was so true what he was saying you said one thought line that i think is the real superpower which is um being on camera so for you and i be we're kind of like media people so we're maybe a little bit more used to it than the average joe but even i am still very uncomfortable just talking to a camera and like looking at it young people are not when i was at the airport i saw 12 year old kids with like the phone on the ground with a pop socket right and they were like filling and i could see that they were doing tick tock dances and it was like that's like unheard of for me because i'm like oh my god you're gonna do that at the airport with people watching right right yeah the upside is they all look cool they know how to dance and they know how to edit videos the downside is like you know they're like riddled with anxiety and stuff like that so you know it's not all it's not all good but but and they're not having sex which is a topic we're going to talk about we're going to talk about that um but the other thing i was going to say is let me ask you this when you get us you're on snapchat right you have snapchat uh i have no i have an account all right so all right bray you are you you got to chime in here i bet you how old are you 27 all right so you're more like us than i like the people i'm talking about that are kind of like i'm not going to say gen z yeah but john i think i think those couple he is he's a lot hipper he's a lot hipper than we are all right he's a little bit more into it okay so so basically uh when you have snapchat right so someone sends you a snap right they send you a picture of something they're doing something looking at and you need to reply tell me do you just type the reply like in the text version or do you send back a photo that's so weird yeah see that's crazy to me uh that is wild to me i'm like you say something i comment like it's [ __ ] like it's facebook right i just write like oh looks fun cool that's great you know like i'm like a 90 year old you're talking about young people another interesting thing to do is when you ask a young person or did you show me this when you ask a younger person what what do you do when someone calls if they put their hand for the people listening i have my hand like i'm waving high like high five and they put their hand like a high five to the ear versus they put their pinky and thumb out like this well or or if you say um hey do like a gesture to take a picture so if i said to you hey sam take a picture yeah you're gonna do this that's an old camera yeah there's not a camera right so so what they do is they they hold up their their hand like this with their thumb like you're holding an iphone right we're like out here with a polaroid trying to trying to demonstrate what a picture is anyway so um i don't even know why i'm talking about that but basically these guys are you know i would say younger people are video native and i think that's going to be a huge huge win for them because people like us are like self-conscious and like just don't know how to use the tools right i want to bring up a topic that's both related to this and something else so at sean's old office at monkey inferno the guy who owns it michael burch awesome it looked like it was out of a magazine but he had one or two things that really stuck out and one of them was this macintosh computer it was a max mac two is that what's called two apple ii so i'm gonna look that up so the reason i'm bringing this up is i am building my studio to look good like yours um and i was looking thinking of like designs and interesting stuff to put in the back and i also this whole nft has got me uh interested in art and like you know just beautiful yeah just like valuable or not valuable beautiful interesting cool stuff i've always liked stuff uh just like junk right uh that's what i used to like uh but now i'm gonna try to get some nicer [ __ ] anyway i was looking around how much do you think uh so is an apple ii is that apple ii the same as a mac as a macintosh too uh i don't know well wow how much you think an apple ii that still works costs i don't know a couple thousand i'd say maybe somewhere between two and five it would be my guess two and five thousand you can get one that's in pretty good condition for like five hundred dollars you can get one you can get a mac macintosh two which i don't know the difference between the apple ii and the macintosh ii you can get a macintosh too that is still in the box for like a grand and do you remember the commercials when we were younger we were in our teens we were probably in eighth grade or ninth grade where it was like a colored mac so it was like a blue it was called the imac i think right yep you can get those for like 300 now strictly speaking like from like a collectible like just it's interesting it's um it's cool to look at that's incredibly cheap for a machine i tell you what every single person who came to our office was like oh this is awesome now granted it's tech nerds coming to the office but they were like wowed by this thing and there was like expensive art all up on the walls nobody cared about any of that people saw this old thing and then we would boot it up and they would turn on and they were like amazed by it so it definitely every single person commented on it i think these types of like old computers these vintage computers i think these are going to get really popular and the reason i think that is i was looking up how much uh so for a gift i thought about buying people a an ipod that wasn't connected to the internet did i tell you this no um so i was gonna buy people uh like our investors i was gonna buy them like a small thank you i was like maybe if i spent 200 ahead let's see if i can go and buy a bunch of if i can buy like 20 uh ipods that aren't connected to the internet and my plan was ruined because i'm like oh wait you have to have uh itunes itunes and that doesn't even exist so like this is pretty much meaningless but these old ipods by the way itunes exists well but i mean like you who no one buys it can you even buy mp3s anymore from it i don't think so yeah you have to like have your own music yeah like that no one does that anymore you we all stream and like these things didn't even have internet i wanted it so you could like download it and then it would only work if you were attached to wi-fi but anyway uh old ipods like old old ones first generation ones are expensive like five six hundred dollars and so anyway i think that both it would be cool to have this stuff on your dude if an old ipod is five six hundred dollars and apple ii in the box or mac 2 in the box is also 500 yeah i i definitely know which one i think has more more like long-term value here uh those those those things are collectibles i think you're you're spot on i would scoop up five to ten of those right now and just hold them yeah i'm okay so look here's a vintage working in one in good condition uh macintosh two for 250 i'm looking at it on ebay right now here's a macintosh uh in the box for 400 bucks [Laughter] it's pretty interesting right i think this might become pretty popular these old computers and i think that it's kind of a cool idea yeah i like that a lot um those are good and i i actually will go after this on ebay and try to scoop up at least at least two of those just to hold and see what happens um all right you want to get into uh you have two updates and then we have an idea two ideas yeah okay so one update is on the michael jordan thing so last episode we talked about michael jordan's house has been on sale for 10 years it was a it's a 56 000 square foot house and um it was originally listed for 30 million dollars now it's been price cut price cut price get all the way down to 13 million and it's still not selling and this is after the last dance it's after this giant boom in like trading card collectibles like the michael jordan rookie card is going for almost 2 million dollars and his 56 000 square foot house can't sell for 13. like something seems off like a little tiny three-inch piece of cardboard can sell but not this so uh and he's paying property taxes i think some somebody said he's paid about a million dollars in property tax just while it's sat on the market and so we threw this out there last time we said hey look why don't we either collect just me and you or we crowdfund uh why don't we buy mj's house and like what could we do with it and we got a bunch of good feedback so i would say like there's a bunch of smart people who immediately pointed out that one of our ideas which was to turn it into some kind of museum the museum of mike um you know the basketball museum wouldn't work because you know the hoa the neighbors would never permit you to let like tens of thousands of people come into their neighborhood and go to this museum every year right so that's what i thought about i mean i was thinking about i just figured there's got to be a way around something exactly exactly when you start an idea you don't think about all the different like small reasons why it might immediately fail you think you know what if this works and then you try to find a way to make it work um but the more interesting one in my opinion was always the simpler one which was you don't have to turn it into a museum you don't have to get permitting you don't have to have guests coming in and operations folks you just treat it differently you don't treat it like a house you treat it like it's a monument it's a piece of art and there are paintings that sell for 85 million dollars and so if for painting itself for 85 million dollars i think michael jordan's house this relic of the greatest basketball player of all time is going to be worth something and so the idea would be you crowdfund it you get i don't know 5 000 people to each pitch in 2 grand you buy the thing out for 10 million bucks and uh you hold it as a piece of art and then you know what i there's a couple of good suggestions i thought came in through twitter so some of the good suggestions were you could list this on rally road where people go to buy like you know vintage cars or rare first edition lord of the rings book sets for thirty five thousand dollars that you you know 500 people each buy it a fractional share of it so that was one idea people liked and the rally road guys said hey we're interested let's talk so i'm talking about they they howled at you they did they replied to the tweet and then rob the i think he's the ceo i know his co-founder uh he emailed me yesterday and so we're gonna we're gonna chat and see what is everyone cool reach out to you bro they know they know damn i didn't get anyone hollered at me well are you are your dms open on twitter my dms are open yes i've also talked to him before through dms because i was just like rally is [ __ ] awesome so i had reached out to him actually and that's it saying hey riley is awesome can i invest in this thing so he knew i was a fan boy already um but anyway so that was one interesting thing some people in the crypto world were like dude let's turn this into an nft bro and uh so i talked to the the founder of of nifty gateway which is just exploding this this marketplace is just exploding for nfts right now so i asked him hey would you like to dabble and then the last thing was that some people were like hey and what did they say uh he was like hey this is cool but he was like you know we're just crushing so hard on the digital stuff i don't know if we want to get into this physical thing uh because there were some cool ideas from from twitter some people were like you know let's say you came in and you bought a 50 000 chunk so you instead of the 2 000 entry you go for 50k that should get you like if you present your your certificate of ownership if you show your app and you show that you're you own a piece of this thing um you should be able to have like a three-night stay once a year with you and all your friends we're gonna time share mj's house exactly so so you're not fully doing an airbnb you're treating it like it's art but if you own a big enough share if you're you know a super minority owner of this thing then you can actually stay one weekend a year and i thought that was pretty dope um so anyways there's some cool ideas but then at the same time i ain't got time to do this and neither do you so uh what's gonna happen from here you're asking me i don't know i feel like you're kind of the leader on this one uh nothing if i had that nothing i here and here's why when i did my deal every smart person i talked to what did you know what they said i bet you can guess what they said no no what did they say do nothing for six months right so don't invest it on your hands yeah yeah don't invest and so many times i've been i've wanted to change and do something and everyone has said the same thing and i'm gonna try my hardest to stick to it so that's one of the reasons why although that's probably a [ __ ] excuse the reality is it's kind of an i don't think i would want to do something that high profile because if you screw up it would be a big deal oh look at you you're afraid to fail now oh you make it big you sell your company and now now you're like i i gotta watch my step what's going on i'm not afraid where's the guy with the pirate ship tattooed on his thigh what would that guy do dude my first time buying like a a real estate asset and doing something like this would be like i mean that would be national i mean i guess yeah i'm being i'm okay i'm not i'm not saying you buy it i'm saying clearly the way to go here is to crowdfund this thing because it's just more fun that way and you don't have to put out 10 million dollars of risk capital how many emails did you get so somebody oh yeah that was the other thing so somebody created a website uh jonathan created a website i think it's like by byjordanshouse.com or something like that and i think he said you know pretty early on after the tweet he said he had 200 people dropping their email and i think about the same on twitter said i'm in including a bunch of higher profile people there's a bunch of people who are a bunch of really wealthy people founders of companies uh owners of owners of businesses that were like i'm in for 5k i'm in for 10k type of thing now are they just talking is this real i don't know we'll see but i think it was cool i mean the the little video that we had reached a hundred thousand people i think uh across a couple of different platforms it so it was cool and what we decided the takeaway from this is we got to do viral clips all the time we gotta we gotta be like obama the club isn't the best place to find whatever exactly it's not even a conversation this is now just a collection of clips and the clip the clip had 60 000 views too uh your twitter clip of you talking about it really yeah well the shitty part is that it's you talking about it and me looking at just like it kept showing my face and you're talking the whole time and i'm just dude that's the way the world goes you put the white man's face up there and the brown guy's just in the back coming up with ideas and and handing them over that's why they get our voices confused because they say i look like a pro but i talk like a nerd and you look like a nerd but talk like a bro dude that was the most spot-on i wasn't even i was like i'm not mad at all that is so accurate and um you know i mixed now i understand why people keep saying this thing that they get as confused and victimized now um let's talk about sex um you have something on here and you before we get into it i want to tell you a fun fact so we have this list where sean and i list ideas he has one thing and it says um why aren't young people having sex and what are the opportunities here and apparently 31 of men 18 and 24 were sexually inactive before yes inactive um and the tweet was from a guy named nat allison um who does a bunch of cool stuff the tweet's not there anymore for some reason um or at least i can't see it get cancelled probably can't say apparently you can't say man anymore so this guy nat is really interesting his name's nat ellison uh google he's got like a cool website he owns uh this agency business did you know that this guy so he's interested in this because he owns this thing called like um i'll look at what's called but it's a kegel app do you know what a kegel is i do know what a kegel is it is okay the like exercise you do with your private parts yeah so basically it it makes it so you don't premature ejaculate and i think women do it too you know i don't know like i think women do it because it it like it can increase like the pleasure but also i think it's just healthy for you to do like it's just like a it's just like a movement that's good for you i guess i don't know and this guy his name is eliason nat eliason he has a an app called uh uh i i'll look it up what it's called but it should be called squeeze because to do it to do a kegel you're basically trying to like you know for a guy you're basically trying to like flex your balls that's the best way i could describe it um and and for a girl i'm sure there's you know the equivalent but i don't know what it is it's called stamina stamina i don't know what that play on words is anyway it walks you through how to do these kegel exercises and it makes like 100k a year he just made it one time and it just ranks it's a crazy interesting thing kegel exercises i never i never knew that was a thing uh go ahead um okay so so we've talked about this before and before when we said uh i think you actually were the original person to kind of rant about this you were like dude kids aren't having sex you're like i went to this you know people make funny for the hot dog stand thing they're like we get it you used to own a hot dog stand the other story that i've heard you tell a number of times because very entertaining and i think it gets you hyped up is you went to some camp and they had a bunch they had like a gen z like you went to some summit and i had a gen z analyst there and the gen z analyst was like hey all the kids are depressed and not having sex and you were like dude what's going on and you talked about replica which was this app messaging app where you message like a virtual girlfriend and i tried it out you've tried it out um after you told me about it i went downloaded it and it was okay it was interesting there's definitely a bunch of people who are really into this it's like this ai virtual girlfriend but i have a different slant to it that i want to bring up here so and by the way this whole sex thing this has been a problem in japan i think for years right right yeah there's like a you know the sexless generation or something they call it like um okay so i want to actually talk about a company that's based in austin right where you're where right where you are you might be able to see it if you look out the window it's called interactive life forms llc you know these guys uh yeah i i know where their building is i've seen their building do you know what they make no interactive do they make sex styles interactive life forms this is the maker of the fleshlight and so i wanted to tell you about this i did a little research i got a message from a founder of a tech company uh i won't say his name because he said no uh he said don't say his name but he messaged me and he goes dude idea modern fleshlights and i was like what he goes fleshlights and he breaks he broke it down for me he goes the um the sex toy market is bigger than you think he goes uh female sex toys like a dildo or a vibrator are on the rise and there's this big like kind of like anti-stigma like people trying to remove the stigma around it uh i don't know if you've seen any of this but it's like kind of the feminist movement um they call it they call it sex positivity which is basically like hey sex doesn't need to be taboo it doesn't need to be stigma um it's okay to have sex that doesn't make you like you know a bad person or something like that and so there's this sex positivity movement and with that has been this big boom in sales of sex toys primarily female sex toys so i started looking at the most popular male sex toy which is the fleshlight and so here's some information about the fleshlight uh it was started by this guy steve shubin and this guy's super interesting he basically he's a si he's one of 13 kids he uh go he plays college football then he goes into the army then he comes back and he's a police officer with the swat team in la and then he like retires from swat when he's like 30 something because he's like i love being in the police force but um it doesn't pay well so i'm gonna start a business and his wife is a pro tennis player so this is he's got this hot tennis player wife and he's like i'm going to start a business he doesn't know what he's going to start and by the way do you know who that hot wife and steve schuman's son is no who aubrey marcus the founder of on it oh no way i didn't know yeah and he joe rogan yes because flashlight was joe rogan's first sponsor that aubry secured that's amazing okay so i'll get into that that's actually a part of this so um so he so years go by he does nothing then they're in their 40s um steve's wife gets pregnant and the doctor tells him hey you're in your 40s so this is kind of like an at-risk pregnancy um so you can't uh you can't be having sex and he's like okay doc like you know what do you want me to do i'm a six three red-blooded american what what am i supposed to do and so um he starts thinking about it and he goes why isn't there a um why isn't there a a sex toy for men and so he originally plans to make a mannequin and in fact in 1998 he gets a patent for a mannequin with sexual application so it's basically like a doll that he wants to make so he's trying to make this doll and he puts in 50k and he starts working on this doll and he's he's trying to blend all these different polymers how do you get this skin feel of this doll how do you get the flesh to feel like flesh how do you get it to look like a doll feel like a doll i feel like a human and um and he makes it a family business so he brings his sons into this to the table they get a white board out and they start uh brainstorming together as a family which i find hilarious uh because you know in my family this is not a it's not a business we can start together so he he keeps going two years go by he's put into a quarter million dollars now he's sold zero uh zero to zero products so far and he keeps trying to make this full body doll and he meets a guy one day a friend of his and his friends like hey um i think what you're doing is great there's this weird taboo around this but why not more pleasure in the world what's the problem so he says um will you give me one i'll buy one off you and he says cool what's your address i'll send you the doll and he's like no dude no way i can't bring that doll into my house he's like just take out the part that's like the vagina of the doll and send me that like put it in a little box and my wife won't see it and just send me that and so he's like dude if my friend who wants this won't like can't buy this doll this doll is dead so that's why he pivoted from the doll to just the just the like you know just the the organ part of it just a single piece one component and so he's like okay how do we brand this so him and his sons are brainstorming and they're like what do guys like guys like tools okay this thing's kind of like a flashlight okay we'll call this the fleshlight so that's how it gets its name uh during that process and so here this was like a father-son project father-son project multiple weird man and so um now years have gone by they've put in over two million dollars and this guy believes so much in this thing he ramps up production he's pumping out 1200 units a day before they've sold anything because he's like the world is gonna love this they're gonna buy this thing and um so he goes all in on this to meet this you know future demand and turns out they actually did it so the fleshlight now these guys do i believe about 100 million dollars in revenue it's definitely above 50. it's they don't report it but it to me i did some sleuthing and i think it's 100 million a year company over 100 employees they um basically dominate the market for for male sex toys now and uh you know this guy who went all in on this thing it ended up being a successful family business which i think is you know just a heartwarming story what a crazy story and i had heard a little bit about it but i didn't realize i didn't know all those details but by the way this is the best part of the whole story so he he opens up a facility in austin so he's manufactured near you um then he has a one in spain and he has one somewhere else in asia i think and he has so much like like manufacturing capacity so what do they do with the excess capacity when they when they have a little extra guess what they make they make prosthetics for elephants who have had their legs blown off in the you know from where there's mines in in southeast asia um so they're they're the top maker of elephant prosthetics in southeast asia that's their backup that's their side business what got you interested in this uh well when this guy said it i was like you know the founder who messaged me he you know this is might have to bleep this but he goes dude every guy jacks off there's got to be a market what if you he's like what if she's like i don't own this product you don't own this product he goes but what if this thing made it 10 times better isn't that crazy that there's still a taboo around this that's going to change dude the sex positivity thing for women it's going to affect men i bet you you can make a modern-day ddc version of the fleshlight and so i started thinking about it and started looking up okay how big is this how big is this industry and it is a pretty big industry like they do like the sex toy industry itself is about 20 billion dollars a year percentages to men so women so this is kind of i was trying to figure out the sales difference so it's mo it's dominated by female um sales so the fleshlight is the biggest of males but uh the female industry is much much bigger about 65 percent of women say that they have used one um there was a stat that said 50 of mail men said that they've used one which i don't believe um i don't i know a lot of dudes i haven't heard one ever talk about this so maybe it's just happening on the download sex toy yeah like i've never i've never had one conversation with a friend not a single yeah so yeah so i don't know if i believe that stat but um basically the european market is bigger than the american market like places like italy it's like super common apparently they're you know free love um places the fastest growing markets right now are india and china where it's the most taboo but what's happened is because it's all gone to e-commerce and the e-commerce companies are using very discreet packaging like they send it to you and it looks like one thing but inside is another and so that's the like that's where this thing is growing and so there's a bunch of startups in this space as well that are um doing like 15 million a year like love honey like just just check out this traffic so uh the top the top website for this the top sort of amazon for this thing is called adam and eve yeah i was just i was just looking at adam and eve uh because they have stores all over san francisco they they have about eight million visitors a month to their ecommerce store which is a huge e-commerce store uh lovehoney has about four million to their store and what's interesting is there's all these problems all this friction and trying to build one of these companies because stripe won't let you take payments why wouldn't stripe let you take payments for a deal they say they say we don't um we do not do any sexual products so so you can use shopify but shopify uses stripe and so you can't do shopify basically because stripe won't allow so adam and eve love honey these these companies they can't uh they can't process on stripe and so there's an opportunity i think for for you know building stripe for vice products because cannabis can't use stripe and neither can any uh any any sex products uh porn can't use stripe and so if you know just those three industries alone that's like multiple hundreds of billions of dollars of turnover and so who's building stripe for vice i don't know i want to go i want to go look into that another one of these like opportunities is um is is that you can build a a brand that figures out a new form of marketing because you can't advertise on facebook or instagram um or any like kind of display network that's uh mainstream for these products and so i was looking into how do they get around this and i was curious how would you get around this if you were trying to market one of these products it's an interesting sort of like job interview question i would ask somebody who wants i would write articles on like you write articles that are yeah so you have to write let me all right so if we're talking about like a vibrator you would write an article about like uh sexual health i guess or i don't know whatever i mean i would have to i would have to do research what what a woman who is about to buy this what is she what type of content interests her right and i would write that article and i would display it on outbrain or i would display it on uh i don't know where would i display it it's hard so i i looked into how these guys are doing it and i think there's there's three interesting pornhub you got to go you could do like pornhub so so they use the adult ad networks like traffic junkie and exo click so they advertise on porn sites basically that's that's a good that's the easy one pretty straightforward um the other thing that they do is they they do heavy like content so so even though you can't advertise on um on facebook and you can you're kind of limited on google you can do it for certain keywords and for just stuff that people searching for so people are searching for what is the best one i should buy what you know reviews and so you remember how the cat the the mattress company casper was buying up the mattress review websites um and then like promoting casper so that's what these guys will do as well they'll buy up the review sites and then they'll just put their products as the best reviewed product on there and they'll say this is you know i'm an affiliate for this for this company um so that's one way and then the i thought the most innovative one and they also do like kind of direct so like you were saying uh fleshlight was one of the first sponsors on joe rogan they'll do that they'll go direct to podcasts or newsletters that are willing to take them as a sponsor and they'll they'll go for it there but um the last one i thought was interesting was what fleshlight did this is a little bit this whole segment's a little bit x-rated you know um you know apologies if you're listening to this with kids in the car you know i hope you've skipped forward at this point but basically what fleshlight did was they wanted celebrity sponsors um so what they did was you know nike goes to lebron james and says okay we want you to sponsor our stuff um so are they gonna get women to be the they got they went to famous models and porn stars and they created molds of them and so it's like you can buy the i forgot the i looked up this chart of who was the top selling skew of that and so there's a woman kayla or shayla or something like that i don't remember her name was but she's some model she some points are i don't know who she is but she's famous and they they they bring them in they do a cast a cast mold of her body and then they turn that into a product and then she can sell that product to her fans and so i was thinking if you were going to do this now you have only fans where where you know i think a billion billion plus dollars is being paid out to their creators i would go to only fans uh creators and i would do this i would do that model for them i think that would be probably the strongest distribution tactic you could get dude what a fascinating thing i uh would you ever i would invest in this but i wouldn't i would never work on this i would never work on this i have zero interest in this from from you know like to actually like pursue it but i do think it's one of those things that nobody talks about and so because nobody talks about it it's both interesting and it's surprising when you look into it how this whole system actually works so i like you know just like i love the silk road but i would never go on the silk road and buy drugs but i like to learn about it and see how it worked and how big it was and who was behind it and how they kept it stealthy like that's fascinating to me just like i like watching prison shows but i'm not trying to go murder anybody i like watching you know bank heist but i'm not planning to rob anybody that's how i am with this these types of products so at the adam and eve store or what was it called uh yeah adam and eve stores um i saw those we had so many locations in san francisco we probably had three or four or five different locations um it's a pretty huge business hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue currently owned by i believe a private equity company um that is also another fascinating business did you research that uh no i didn't research that one but what other two other like interesting things about how they how they market these things i thought was pretty clever uh it just shows you know entrepreneurial creativity here all right so uh there's one company that's doing these like uh you know like the the sort of mlm model which which is uh you get one person who's kind of a seller for you and they have a party so this is like the old tupperware parties um they call them passion parties for this and so they have women invite their friends over and they're called passion parties where they show the different toys and what they could do or whatever i don't know how this sounds like the most awkward party to me but apparently it's working um the second one that i thought was super interesting was um they basically there was a company called diamond products and they make they make uh some brand of something i have no idea and they couldn't advertise in any traditional channel so they went and they bought um sir richard's condoms company so they said oh condoms are allowed to be advertised on tv and on on different websites it's more loose to like trojan right we've all seen trojan ads on tv for example so if the restrictions are loose or there they went and bought that company and then on their website they just they upsell other products basically and so he went and bought this company because he goes they're sold in whole foods he's like this makes it so easy for me to advertise because now i own this little thing he's like it's my trojan horse hahaha like you know this is how i advertise my sex products company and so i thought that was pretty interesting and you know i think if you did this with instagram models and oldie fans you could basically just copy the um what's that watch brand mvmt you can copy the the movement movement watches brand uh model and try to you know they they went to 100 million in sales and watches i bet you could do the same uh using their influencer strategy dude how interesting like i i i love learning from these types of people i i don't even like i'm i don't even like going to this i went to the fleshlight website i don't even like going to that i think right close the tab yeah i think it's weird i'm on my work computer just so anyone uh at hubspot listens yeah i apologize my uh my wife's dad listens to the podcast i i'm just going to tell him hey don't listen to this one i apologize if you like well it was a fairly academic discussion about something well the worst part is now my now i'm getting retargeted like crazy because i was doing research on this for the pod and now all my ads are completely uh messed up well do you want to talk about another interesting person yes or do you want to talk about an idea personally okay we're gonna do a an interesting person okay there's this guy who we're gonna do billy the week here where this guy and i by the way i think we're gonna do this we've discussed doing this every friday maybe we will but google by the way we need like a jingle for the billy of the week it needs to be like you know the billy of the week somebody make us a little jingle for that that would be pretty cool um we do need that google brad kelly and make sure you spell it like b-r-a-d so brad space k-e-l-l-e-y okay if you're on your phone do it brad kelly now you're gonna see a picture of a guy with a red beard you see the red beard i see okay and then two over you're gonna see a picture of an old guy with a longer like he looks like uh like mark twain yep see it black okay so that's the same guy the photos are just he's just older now so this guy he's so interesting to me for a couple different reasons so this guy's name is brad kelly he at this point he's probably in his 60s and he's known as the man with a million acres that was a headline that was written in the new york times about him and they wrote it about him because he is one of the largest landowners in america at one point he was number three or number four and he's kind of known for being incredibly reclusive so he doesn't do any interviews he doesn't do anything like that but he's bad to the bone he's a really interesting guy and i read a little bit about him and i've kind of got a feel for this guy and he's so intriguing to me so he was born uh you know he's 65 years older-ish he was born in kentucky uh went to college in kentucky but at age 19 dropped out because he started buying warehouses and he started making enough money buying and leasing out warehouses that he goes all right i'm going to do this i don't need school anymore and eventually he started renting them out to people who were building stuff so creating little miniature factories he would fix them up and lease them to people and eventually he saw that people were using them to store tobacco and one of his tendons moved out and he got whole he they left a machine that turned tobacco and like pumped them into cigarettes or you know like a like a rolling machine or something like that and he was like well i got this machine let's try it and so he started making cheap cigarettes and eventually he rolled uh he made it a proper company and he called it commonwealth brands and if you google commonwealth brands i don't smoke cigarettes but i recognized some of the brands they're like uh i think he has like 15 or so cigarette brands yeah it's like i think parliament's that's like uh when i was a kid that would like we would joke like if someone spoke parliament that means they were like a broke kid um uh but he made cheap cigarettes and after 10 years he sold this cigarette company for a billion dollars and i hate smoking and i don't think it's cool to smoke um and he doesn't either and he but he didn't hide that he goes i've never defended smoking and i hope that it will be phased out of society but i did it because you know it made i made a living doing it you know it made me a living for me and using almost all i love when billionaires say they're just trying to make a living it's like no you made you made like a billion livings that's a lot you made a lot of livings and with all this money he did a couple interesting things the first thing that he did well he didn't do it first but the first interesting thing is he bought lonely planet you know what lonely planet is i've heard that name what is that is that a dating site that's a date i bet you if you look at your uh your book collection you might have a lonely planet book it's a travel website and book company oh okay and it was a big it was a really big deal for many years and then when digital came along it got crushed and he bought lonely planet for 70 million dollars and he had us and they probably had 300 employees and he had a kid that he liked somehow met this young guy who was 24 and he put him as ceo and they never signed a contract they just shook hands and they go all right you're a ceo now you know talk to me if you need me such a kentucky thing to do just shake your hand and this kid ran it and it didn't do so hot i mean it on like it would have been cool if there's a better ending to that part of the story right either to a combination of the 24 year old sucking and covid they sold it uh for like 50 million so he didn't make money on it um but what he did with the rest of his money is he bought ranches and leased them back to the owners and they make a little bit of profit but not a significant amount of profit and at this point he owns um over a million acres in america which is a huge huge huge amount making him and 2012 the fourth largest land owner in america the guy never does interviews he you can't find him if you want to he's really hard to find uh the only reason people really truly know about him is at one point he sold one of his ranchers for 400 million dollars uh really interesting guy i like him because he's uh i think that like i get caught in this world on twitter of like oh building build in public you know what's your mrr i gotta go to executive coaching and it's so nice to hear from a guy this guy actually seems like a pretty thoughtful guy but he definitely gives off the redneck vibe uh obviously he's highly intelligent but they say that like he goes to his ranches and he likes to drink bourbon's bourbon and wear a kilt he's like kind of a wild guy he's into some weird [ __ ] all right yeah but pretty interesting guy and i wanted to bring this guy up because i bet most people have never heard of him uh but so interesting he also owns do you know what kentucky downs is the horse horse track yeah he owns that oh wow and so he just owns all types of real estate and that's what he put all of his money into very interesting person uh yeah this is this is cool so why were you saying the part about people um who have like executive coaches and well what was the contrast there so to explain that one like i see people who've got like small ass companies who like are not even they're like barely just started and they're like tweeting out like leadership quotes or they're talking about like uh how they need to be more inclusive at their company or this and that and i just get sick of this hype thing and i see all the people like oh build in public uh and and i'm guilty of all this as well um but like all the and we're part of the hype cycle right we're media but it's cool to see someone who you've never heard of who just is anonymous and shuts the [ __ ] up and just works and does cool stuff and has a cool life and it's entirely like you know everyone's like i got in a fight on twitter about people which uh about buying domain names you think this guy knows how to buy a domain name in one of the interviews he said he he doesn't know how to use email right yeah this guy's not vegan yeah no this guy eats vegans right this guy is made of leather uh yeah okay so you just like that he's like kind of like a tough guy rough guy business guy doesn't give a [ __ ] and uh everybody else you know makes such a big deal of little things it's kind of weird i just think it's cool to see to hear different perspectives and i'm sure that uh he does a lot of bad stuff i mean he owns a cigarette company right like that's kind of pretty shitty but uh it was just cool it's cool to have a different perspective and this guy if you google them i'm pretty sure there's only three pictures that i've i've researched this guy a lot i i've only found three pictures of him and he's worth three or four billion dollars i like it all right he is indeed the billy of the week um i wonder i wonder who i wonder how people will will react to this guy because i think some people are like so anti-cigarettes that they're like you are you know you that you're saying that you you're kind of idolizing this guy who is a uh you know who did bad things like you know like a warlord almost and so i don't know you were the one who also said you would not invest in jewel right was that you yeah look i'm not i'm not defending this person's actions i think but i think that no matter how evil or horrible someone is there's you can always find something interesting maybe saying admirable is a bit of a stretch but you can always find something interesting no matter how bad someone is and i don't think this guy is necessarily a bad guy but yeah he i mean he [ __ ] he's still poison yeah it's pretty right see i think of it i think i don't know maybe i'm a little disconnected from reality but for me i'm like i don't like movies where everybody is a good guy i would not play a game a video game where you just walk around as a good samaritan like those aren't fun to me and i think that the real world has all kinds of people shapes colors beliefs all kinds of different things and i'm interested in the variety of ways that people live their life and i'm glad that people live their life doing all these different things even though a lot of them are like villains or a lot of them i'm not saying this guy's a villain but like i think that's just the way the world is and i think it's crazy to believe that the world shouldn't be that way or won't be that way where people are going to live their life doing different things maybe this guy likes to drink bourbon and wear kilts on a farm that he owns like all right great i'm glad that character exists i'm glad that that that you know i'm glad these characters exist i think that um most people will not feel that way most people will say well if this person's a bad guy um you know he shouldn't exist and i don't know i i find that to be this is not the way i think about it i believe every great man or every great woman is also a bad man so what i mean by that is if you are at all if you're considered great at anything or one of the best inevitably you have many enemies because you can't make everyone happy right now by the way can you tweet that out so i'm doing this thing i'm getting uh behind me one of the things that's going to go behind me is i'm pre i'm getting these laser etched signs that are tweets basically it's called lasertweets.com and so uh you can basically get any tweet turned into a wooden laser etched sign and i'm gonna put i'm gonna hang a couple of my favorite quotes and tweets behind me and one of them one of my favorites is every great man is also a bad man and so i need you to tweet that out so that i can do it but what you can't do is you can't or you could do person um if you want to not make it gender specific here but i need you to tweet that out so i can i can get that one made yeah you're gonna get you're gonna get on my wall i don't think i may i think i made up that phrasing but uh i read it in a book and uh i don't remember exactly how they phrased it but that's how i phrased it but i believe it to be true and dude i did so much research on this guy that i went and i went to land forums so a really interesting research tactic that you should do is you type in whatever you're searching for like flashlight and then you type in forum right and then you are brought to user generated content of message boards and what people are saying or you could do the same thing but you just type in the word reddit it's pretty sick and i went to land forums where this guy bought people's land and they go yeah you know or someone's like hey this guy named brad kelly offered to buy my land who sold to him and people were like yeah we sold to him uh he's fine enough doesn't bother us and offered us a fair deal and so they're like well and we all and people said well and we read about him doing cigarettes and that kind of sucks but he's never caused us a problem so anyway every great man is also a bad man i like it uh did you want to do any any of these other ones or are we saving them uh i think this one should they should be saved okay i have one quick one because i don't really have much to say but we talked we could do the ndvc one okay i'm gonna do a one quick plug for these guys that took an idea we talked about and they made it so we talked about levels.fyi which is a salary comparison website we had a whole episode about like open salaries and should you or should you not transparent data how that helps blah blah blah and we said hey levels does this for the tech industry where you can go see all right if i'm a facebook product manager level five what will i make if i live in seattle what will i make if i live in san francisco what's the benchmark what are the what is some data so i know if i'm getting if i'm getting hosed if they gave me a fair job offer or not fair job offer and so we said dude somebody should do this for other industries because this is awesome um why isn't this happening another so these guys made med levels.fyi and it's basically dr pay um and so they if you go to it you can see they don't have a ton of data yet but um they're getting some they're getting doctors to to put in how much they're getting paid based on where they live what type of doctor they are i think it's great super simple it's just basically an air table displayed on a website so really easy to build and uh no it's uh google forms i think yeah i'm saying like in theory right it's like such a simple simple product to do so med levels.fyi good good job by those guys if you're a doctor listen go put your [ __ ] in there yeah it's pretty cool i was looking at this um all right we'll wrap it up by talking about one more thing and maybe we should put this in the beginning but let me ask you how has your angel investing gone so far i'll tell you in 10 years that's the problem with angel investing [Laughter] but how many deals have you invested in uh i think a little under 20 maybe like 18 something like that 18 companies we've invested in deployed about i don't know million and a half 2 million or something like that and do you feel confident that you have some winners uh yeah definitely there's some winners um now we'll see i think any anything anything can happen but i would say i'd be surprised if out of these 18 if we don't have you know two companies that are worth a billion dollars or more i'd be surprised so wow that's pretty sick so we um a few weeks ago i tweeted out something that andrew chen said basically i asked andrew chen who's a partner at andreessen horowitz what his advice to me for angel investing was and he told me his opinion and i tweeted that out people [ __ ] on me even though i was like i'm not saying this i'm just or i'm just like i'm the messenger yeah like i'm just like reporting on someone interesting opinion but i did tend to agree on a couple of the things and one of them was that there's this narrative that you there's this narrative of people who hate vc and they're like i would rather grow slower and it's like okay that's cool do that but in order and they also say profits matter you know like and they love to mock silicon valley companies they're like dude these guys you know they don't know anything about profits sorry i'm just over here running a profitable business just growing steady every year and so they they like to get on that kind of high horse which is crazy because like both can exist and be wonderful but there was this guy who i really like and i don't mean to [ __ ] on him at all um his it was called ndvc and it was it was kind of weird i don't know why it was a venture capital firm because its whole shtick was basically we invest in bootstrap businesses that want to grow slowly um they didn't exactly say slowly but it was for bootstrapped companies which is again a little bit of an oxymoron why is the bootstrap company gonna be taking venture capital right but a lot of people really liked it and the guy who ran it i forget his name i met with him awesome guy and they went out of business this week and i think it's his name bryce i like bryce bryce is a good guy but the model didn't work and i wanted to bring this up because something that andrew said was he said two things he was said uh invest in quantity so just kind of throw money at a bunch of stuff so like anything that seems promising just kind of mindlessly invest in it and second make sure it's growing 3x a year if it's not then it's not good and a lot of people didn't like when i said that and they didn't like it i think because it kind of hurt their feelings of like well you're saying i'm not worthy of venture capital and the answer is is yeah you're not right you're not and but that's okay that doesn't like you shouldn't be offended um right you don't have to shut down your business it just means this type of asset this type of venture you know venture capital is chasing a certain profile a company and you may not fit that profile and by the way i think that most people i bet you i mean this sounds so douchey i bet you i've made significantly more money than a lot of people who have raised absolutely and so i was telling somebody this the other day i was like um i was like you know media companies we're talking about media companies and you know you guys just sold you you guys are media company and it wasn't the biggest exit ever it's not like you know some insane thing but i was like dude he i don't how much did you raise total like a million and a half dollars two million dollars something like that a million a million dollars right so it took so little money and then not so so give give the profile it was a million dollars and it took you how many years from start to finish uh finished but but one week start as in we raised money to finish uh less than five years and i made eight eight figures right exactly and so and you owned you know majority of the business or whatever so like because you didn't have to raise all this money and dilute yourself over and over and over again from round after round after round and it's like there are if you look at companies that are selling for a billion dollars where the founder owns four percent or two percent or seven percent and um you know it's not like and they and they sweated it for 10 years and every hair on their head is gray because uh because of that path so it doesn't the size of the exit is not not linked really to the to the uh outcome for the for the founder themselves i agree which proves that we're not or i i know for speaking for myself and i i think you you're not [ __ ] on this this idea of anti-vc whatever but this company went out of business and it goes against this narrative of like if you're gonna give money to venture capital or companies that fit the profile of vc you want them to be what many would just think or describe as reckless right and one thing i didn't get why did they go out of business so so basically they couldn't raise more money was the idea yeah right that's how a vc fund goes out of business and he said in his thing he's like we invested in 10 companies or whatever he gave some numbers so so tell me he goes they were all bootstrapped and profitable and they're all still going and they're 40 you know he said something like we've invested these they're all still going they're all still profitable but we couldn't raise any more money it's like what what do you i don't understand what what is his reason why did they go out of business he kind of sounded like he was crying a little bit like he was kind of whining because he's like our lps didn't like our model so they pulled the plug because you know whatever i did i didn't read the thing very carefully so you tell me you you looked into this no i mean yeah why is he saying they failed i don't think he was whining i think he was just saying the fact that like most people don't like this idea and weren't willing to stick it out and i don't blame them because if you go to indy.bc the website it's a video of a unicorn head on fire as if like they're anti-unicorn and i might have returns are good if his returns are good every people would still be looking to back the fund because people who invest in the returns aren't as good as other stuff like so that's what he needs to say it's not that people don't like this he needs to say i was wrong my returns weren't as good as i thought they would be and they were not good enough to get more money because people invested i invest in vc funds i also would invest in real estate which has a different profile i'll invest in crypto which has a different risk return profile i invest in many things and so that's why i thought it was kind of whining because i didn't it didn't just say the honest truth i had this idea that this would be a great way to invest and my but my returns were actually shitty and therefore i couldn't raise more money and either that's true or his returns were actually good and he sucked at going and getting new investors i didn't there's only two ways to go about it right like i didn't understand i didn't i stopped reading because i didn't he wasn't saying the truth in my opinion no i mean he said the truth he said that uh like our strategy a lot of lps bailed uh it cost us 80 of our lp base they didn't want to come back um and it was just yeah the strategy didn't didn't work in the sense of investors did he post his returns no okay that's the thing he needed to say right he's saying they didn't like our strategy it was so he was kind of just like patting himself on the back i felt he's like they didn't like that we were going against the grain going against the vc thing and they had to pull out because of that it's like well is it that they didn't like what you were doing or is it that it wasn't working and the returns weren't very good and they didn't believe the returns were going to be very good i don't know i i'm being harshly i don't know the guy but no he's cool and i'm not bringing this up to show them i think it's cool he took a shot it was a bad shot though and that's that's great right you take swings sometimes you miss for sure but uh i think though it's important it's important that we look at what this what's what does this mean here and i think that someone like andrew chen who's this from the outside you think of him as like an elitist like went to uh i don't know he just like give this vibe that he's like an elitist type of guy um but and so and he kind of represents a lot of people like him right these like vcs who like oh like [ __ ] these tech bros and the reality is though is that that strategy of like doing stuff that appears to be reckless from the outside it is the right strategy it just feels really uncomfortable for a lot of people dude if you if you it's it's a classic don't hate the player hate the game it's not that it's not that vc's decided oh you know what i'll do i'm going to invest in a bunch of companies and one or two will return the fund and everything else will go to zero it's not that they want that right that's actually extremely stressful for them um that hey if i get into this company that becomes a 10 billion plus company i'm a hero and i'm the best and if i just miss them and i invest in a bunch of other good companies that didn't quite get there i suck and i can't raise my next fund and i'm out of a job and um and so so it's crazy to me that like they're not picking this that just is the nature of the game and they have to play it if they want to succeed at it it's like in any game theory um the game will the players in the game will eventually find the meta game the strategy that is the optimal strategy and if you just because of your like you know your opinion and your personality and your morals don't want to play it cool that's fine but you're just not going to get you're not going to be playing the optimal strategy you're going to eventually lose the game and so i think it's crazy that people hate the vcs when it's just that's the way that innovation works the innovations that break through become humongous and the innovations that don't become zeros and uh or close to zeros and the winners are so big that that's they dominate all the returns but then there's this other ground where it's like fvc which me personally i'm on that boat where i want to be a vc but i don't want to take vc money and that that's this other group of people it's like dude they all can exist like right and that's what that quote is so insightful right don't hate the player hit the game cool you can hate the game that's allowed that's in the quote um you're allowed to hate the game and say i'm going to play a different game no problem you can play games where you bootstrap or you don't raise vc money where you you don't do business at all you go be an employee somewhere no problem that's always an option well i guess we just did a little rant but i wanted to bring that up um we'll see if this episode turns out to be anything interesting um i'll bring you how we do b plus i want the graphics guys to like slam a big b plus all over the screen all right why b plus you got to give give the people that your explanation why why why are you saying what you're saying i mean i it was good research but it just wasn't as juicy as it could be it was good i've never seen sean more animated than when he talks about flashlights by the way yeah i was super into that to be honest i i got ruined when i went to the website it's pretty freaking disgusting but did you go to the website no i did all my research i didn't go to their website it's not great it's pretty gross um but no i think it's interesting i think what we'll have to do is um i think uh like if we did an entire episode on fleshlight or entire episode on this guy brad kelly i think it would be crazy fascinating um i want more i thought i thought you're saying i went too much into it no that the flesh that was the best part i'm just saying you're very animated about it yeah and i i have i have space but it's cold so i have to talk in an animated way to like not freeze you're passionate about flashlights it's okay so i've been listening i listen to a true crime podcast every night which is weird that i'm in bed like with my wife about to go to sleep hearing about like how this guy just like murdered and raped these people um but it's this one lately called generation y it's really popular and all it is is two guys discussing crimes and mysteries ranging from 911 to serial murders to the bermuda triangle all that all that type of thing and all they're doing is talking and retelling a story we should definitely just do that with one interesting person yeah i think that's great um although if it's not true crime i don't know how interesting people how interested people would be in it um if you told a 60 to 70 to 90 minutes story in the same way that you told that fleshlight story um people would love it i could tell because i could i was enthralled by it what's the first story we could tell how could we try it well um one time we talked about this the french bill gates that that guy was so intriguing to me um uh to do 60 minutes that's like you can really only tell like your own story or like some something you really go or like a you know the american kingpin store you can like retell it retell the book basically as a podcast well that's what you're doing at the end of the day which is you're just reading 15 articles and you're telling the long story about it and what you could do is uh one of us is the more more researched and the other one listens and asks questions okay all right i'm down to try it if you have an idea am i wrong abrayu i mean it could work i'm just i don't know how you can make it that exciting like true crime there's suspense there's mystery you know what's gonna happen i don't i guess business maybe like big business scandals you could do that with no dude you do it exactly like you did the flesh the origin stories yeah i think origin stories are good right that's what i tried to do with the fleshlight guy was like basically you tell how this thing came to be um so i think you could do it that way it works i don't i but i agree with john i don't know how you get 60 to 90 minutes out of it i think you basically yeah forget the 69 minutes that doesn't matter it could be 20 minutes it's no issue but um it's like just a well-told story a well-researched and therefore well-told story about something that happened i honestly know like for me i started listening to this youtube channel that basically is like it's like book summaries but um actually done good i actually like it and what's it called it's a productivity game as a youtube it's a youtube channel with about half a million i think subscribers or something like that um i could be wrong on that but there's a lot of subscribers um but i've listened to probably 10 of their book summaries of just books i've had i bought i just haven't got to i'm like do i really want to go read like made to stick or can i just like watch this seven minute video and like oh those are the four principles i made to stick cool i still might read the book but now i know if it's like interesting or not and so similarly i'm reading like you know whether it's um like for example i read this book uh paypal whatever the paypal origin story or whatever if we just retold that it's like you know just take the book and then turn it into a 20-minute retelling of the story um i think that's pretty that could be pretty well i know that would work american kingpin would be great there's this awesome podcast called we study billionaires which sounds lame but honestly it's like you guys know it's they're huge and it's really good um and they'll read a book on someone or just a long article and just retell the story right it's really good i love this podcast it's called the investors podcast you've never heard of this yeah either good man i know they're i know their thumbnail the red thumbnail they're huge yeah 40 million downloads they have so that would work off of fanboys um i guess we're we should publish us talking right now but speaking of books you know what i'm doing is this isn't what i'm doing with it i'm just going to read one book this year but i'm going to study the [ __ ] out of it i'm sick of reading like two books a month and not remembering anything yeah i'm just for me like youtube is just so much better like i'm just going deep on like you know like uh charlie munger peter lynch youtube stuff and i'm just like watching watching so many of their videos or listening to their videos and uh there's just a lot of wisdom in there and charlie munger said this thing he's like he's like i don't want to read the news he goes i want to read something that it made sense 30 years ago it makes sense today it's going to make sense 30 years from now and i'd rather just read that 10 times than read like whatever the latest thing is and that's kind of what you're saying yeah i i agree um all right well um let's bounce i'm gonna get my [ __ ] set up uh by the next podcast better i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what never looking back [Music] um

sean put something on here that i actually think i was telling uh a friend as i was researching i actually think that this is one of the better ideas that we and you you've ever come up with the michael jordan thing all right yeah you want me to explain it okay so um i've been looking at this house for a long time michael jordan's house has been for sale for like a decade and it hasn't sold and this is his house uh kind of like you know in illinois near chicago where you know michael jordan was on the bulls and he had this 56 000 square foot home in highland park and so this thing originally he put it up for sale and like i don't know nine years ago for 30 million 29 million dollars and now it's you know the price has been cut in half and the thing is still not selling and if you look at the photos you can just go it's like on zillow so you can go look at the photos he's got like an indoor basketball court you know the gate leading up to the driveway has his big 23 number like embossed in it he's got you know everything you would want like huge you know closets because he's got you know all his air jordans or whatever and so his house is it's pretty unbelievable right there's there's all kinds of um epic [ __ ] here but it's not selling and it's not selling for i think a couple reasons it's like you know it's very custom to michael jordan um like it just it's like it was custom made in many senses so you know that other rich people don't necessarily want to live in a house that's like made for another dude um it's also you know it's very expensive for the area the property taxes are really expensive all that stuff but i was thinking okay the price is now cut in half now it's now it's a 13 million dollar house or a 12 you know 13 million home that you could buy 13 14 and now it's in range where maybe there's something fun you could do with it now you might be getting a value buy so i was thinking all right there's a bunch of people obviously that are basketball fans that love michael jordan um there's a bunch of you know new ways to crowdfund that we've been talking about nfts or uh kickstarter or different different crowdfunding platforms so the question is should we buy michael jordan's house should we start a crowdfunding campaign and buy michael jordan's house so if you could get 5 000 people to each put in 2 500 then you can own a fractional share of michael jordan's house uh you could you you could own a piece of of this history and we could just buy it out take it off the market um and we could own this thing and then the question is like what do you do with it um and so i wanted to brainstorm with you a should we buy michael jordan's house and b what could we do with it if we did buy it what do you think so the whole nft thing i wouldn't do that i think that i think you've had two ideas here one is to buy his house and two is to end do the nft thing uh one of those ideas is great i think the other one is over complicating it i would 100 buy it and the reason why i think it's such a great idea is immediately after you seeing you write this my thought right away went to graceland you know what graceland is no that's funny that you don't know what that is it's because it's such a big deal in my family or elvis is at least so graceland is elvis presley's house uh it's in memphis it's in downtown memphis it's actually in a pretty crappy neighborhood now or the neighborhood is not nice and it's like kind of gross but it's just like a cutesy thing to do if you visit memphis and i went and did research on it and so around 600 000 people a year go to graceland which brings in something like where i have the numbers here okay so graceland just in attendance uh just in ticket sales brings in 21 million dollars so it's yeah pretty wild just on tickets and then 600 000 visitors a year uh 36 a ticket right yes and i got interested in this so i thought what are the most visited homes in america so i came up with a few and i want to fill you in on them so the white house doesn't count because you can just you i think you can get a tour but you could also just walk outside of it but graceland six hundred thousand the second one i'm you guys are gonna make fun of me i don't know how to pronounce this what is it monticello i think so okay monticello that's uh thomas jefferson's house and so the interesting thing about this place as well as a few other i'm going to mention is that they're non-profits which means all of their numbers are public and so uh the revenue for monticello which includes a ton of investment revenue was around 200 million dollars in 2010 but around uh 8 million 7 million came just from ticket sales so 8 million a year in ticket sales which is crazy and they have around 500 000 people another uh most visited home is never uh like homes that people drive by neverland ranch people don't go there but the other another great one is mount vernon which is uh i think uh what's our first president george washington's house uh and they do in in in uh food sales alone this is crazy just in food seventeen million dollars a year wow is that crazy the whole operations and then they do 15 million dollars a year in admission sales and in total they do about 51 million dollars a year in total income which includes 10 million from contributions is that crazy that no that's absolutely insane so let me ask you these okay so this all of a sudden this starts to get really interesting right because i think michael jordan is on par with elvis and you know thomas jefferson michael jordan's got tj beat by a long shot so you know mj over tj i think is is part of the the slogan that we have when we when we buy this thing but um if they're doing this much in traffic i got to know is there something else meaning like are these in really hot like popular areas uh where there's already just a lot of tourists or something like that and this is just a pit stop because you know michael jordan's house is in a neighborhood you'd have to only be going to go to this place i looked up michael jordan's address guess how far away it is from chicago airport one of the most popular airports in the world i'm gonna guess 45 minutes 20 minutes it's 20 minutes away okay so it's at like have you been in memphis memphis is like there's not that much going on in memphis and all these people are going to memphis um people are chicago's what the fifth most populous city in america or maybe third something like that something is interesting here so what i would do is i wouldn't do the nft thing i would raise uh two or three million dollars from a bunch of rich people um or i would try to use my own money if i had two or three million dollars that i wanted to spend on this and i would buy it and then it would probably cost a fair bit of money to get it set up it would probably cost a lot of money another many more millions but then you'd have to convince collectors to lend you the stuff and you create a michael jordan museum yes and that's how you do this and the companies that we've just mentioned graceland monticello and um mount vernon so those obviously those folks lived in the 1700s or probably died in the 1800s so they've been around those properties have been around as tourist destinations for a hundred plus years but they've done 50 million revenue which is a [ __ ] ton but even if you've just um two or three million dollars in revenue and you could do that and adjust for inflation for 50 plus years kind of like graceland has done it for 60 years that's incredibly fascinating right yeah i'm with you so so i think you you know you're [ __ ] on the nft thing a little bit but it's not about nft what i'm saying is crowdfunding um so i think that there's a benefit to crowdfunding which is that crowdfunding is a way to make the story more viral um it is a it's a more pr worthy story that uh you know people from the internet people from reddit whoever got together and bought michael jordan's home off the market for for 15 million dollars they raised 15 million dollars and bought the house versus a rich guy went to his rich friends and raised some money the second thing is those become you know your evangelist to spread the word and to come make the uh the pilgrimage to go see michael jordan's house and i think you could do two or three things with it i think you could make it a museum that's like a modern museum that we've been talking about like the museum of ice cream or something like that where the tour is very heavy um photo based and so you're you know you're going through and it's all these different photo exhibits of you know you in michael jordan's bed and you know wearing you know a pair of his air jordans or standing in a pair of giant air jordans or something like that and you make it like a museum of ice cream where you're going to walk out with you know 10 photos that are instagram worthy at the end of it i also think give give people background on an ice cream museum yeah you can pull the latest numbers but i think these guys uh raised it like a hundred million dollar plus valuation and if you if you ever go to one they're pretty cool it's you know it's not the most amazing thing i honestly i was a little bit disappointed but the photos do turn out cool it's a museum that you walk through uh so it's like a guided path and you go through maybe like 13 different rooms and every room is something cool and you get a little you know you get an ice cream cone of some flavor and then you can take photos next to some like exhibit that they've set up and the idea is not for you to look at the art like a traditional museum but for you to like take a photo in the art uh and post it on instagram and that's their marketing that's the free marketing that they get and so museum of ice cream oh yeah here everybody has it they raised 40 million they raised a 40 million dollar series a at a 200 million dollar valuation last year and um and i think this could be bigger i think this could be much much bigger as a brand um the other thing the other thing that you could do is uh sports cards are having this incredible boom right now and i think what you could do is you could have certain collectors put their collection um in in the house the house could be basically the vault to store some of the most rare memorabilia in the sports world sign basketball shoes and sports cards and that could be part of the museum and you you basically store it and you um you store it for some of these collectors so i think i think there's a bunch of stuff you could do to make this work but the idea is like can you buy this thing for 13 million put another four or five million into uh you know getting it all set up and then could you make five million dollars a year could you make 10 million dollars a year like you're saying these other guys do um as a pilgrimage for you know tourists going to chicago and basketball junkies i think the answer is definitely yes and i think it's so interesting um i found a i found another example of one and it's called the um it's called the national trust for historic preservation and it's a non-profit and all they do is buy um historical buildings and their historic i looked at their numbers they've been doing like 50 or 60 million in revenue for years and i'm still trying to figure out how to entirely read uh nonprofit statements but they have a buy a line item that's revenue less expenses which i guess that just means prop i mean i don't know how they define yeah i don't know how they define either of those but it was 26 million and it's been doing that for years is that nuts so i like this idea i like this idea a lot and i kind of want to dig a little further into how these um homes home museums work because i think this is pretty interesting the other good thing about this by the way is that the basketball hall of fame sucks uh nobody cares about it nobody goes to visit it um all the other sports like you know canton for football these are like tourist destinations you know tons of people go there every year it's really cool and the basketball one is known to be super lame because they let way too many people in and um and it's not like it's not a thing that basketball fans really care to go do can i give you two more examples that we what we could consider doing instead of even doing a museum maybe this is even simpler yeah so i'm staying at my friend jack's house it's a badass house um five doors down or ten doors down something like that nearby is what's they call it the obama house and when obama was in office from uh when was he in office oh the oh the second the second term um or whatever it was he would stay at this house down here and the owners let them stay i think for a massive discount now it's like it has its own wikipedia page and it's called like the obama house and it sold 10 years ago for 7 million after he had already stayed there which sorry 7 million i said i say seven for seven million which is a lot of money but they rent it out right now on airbnb for six thousand dollars a night or if it's booked all the way up 180k a month and it's branded as the obama house i think that you could absolutely crush it with a jordan airbnb house would you and a group of friends be willing to pull together three thousand dollars a day to stay there maybe i think the way you'd have to do it is you'd have to make it like a vegas alternative for bachelor parties and stuff like that birthdays it's like what is the man cave man dream vacation it's like dude we're gonna go stay in michael jordan's house 14 of us are going um and it comes with like all the amenities and you know all that stuff this is where you go this is where you want to go if you want to live like the sports fans dream i think you could do that i do like the museum one better what was the second idea you had you said you had two oh what wasn't the second i guess it was more so uh just another example the fresh prince of bel air house um it's it's kind of interesting but do you remember living in san francisco how there's like the what's it called the painted ladies which is the whole the full house house and then there's the missed out firehouse um i would just want to buy all these and turn them all into twitter so i lived a block away from the uh from the full house house and uh literally 24 7 there is somebody standing outside of that house during the daytime uh taking a photo of it so there's just a constant and it's not like it's not like a huge line of people but there's always like four people standing outside taking a photo in front of the full house house every single day for the whole year it's kind of crazy and then it just sold actually and it sold at basically like i think 1.5 or 2x the market rate in that area so um they got basically like a double premium because it is the full househouse which i think is you know kind of interesting um but okay i think we should uh i think we should buy michael jordan's house i think we should crowdfund uh i think we should crowdfund five thousand people together we should own this thing or we could go to rally road and we could say hey rally let's put michael jordan's house on rally and uh you know let's sell this baby out i think if five thousand right now with if you go on rally roads you'll get two thousand or three thousand people buying a fractional share of you know a pair of jordans or a signed autograph or a signed rookie card or something like that [ __ ] all that let's own the guy's house so i think you could easily get 5000 people on rally road to buy a fractional share of michael jordan's house i'm surprised they don't already do this if they're listening to this uh you know go go for it just give us credit and give me a share of the house i actually think that they wouldn't do that because how do you liquidate that it's been on the market for 20 or how long 10 years no one is obviously no one's buying it so like how do you get liquidity from that after seven years i don't think you don't i think the game here right the point of rally is that they take things that are not assets and they make them not liquid assets they make them liquid assets so because you can own a fractional share now there's liquidity any one person who owns a piece of michael jordan's house can swap it for anybody else who wants to own a piece of it so you don't need a 15 million dollar buyer because you can sell them in blocks of a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars and so when you bring that price point down there's people who want to own a piece of the a piece of the art a piece of the asset which is how they do like you know they'll sell um you know a harry potter first edition signed you know set of books and uh you know instead of selling it for 25 000 they'll get you know 2 000 investors to each put in or whatever whatever the math comes out to 150 bucks to go buy uh you know to own a piece of that thing so they introduce liquidity by making it fractionally owned yes but there's still no cash flow you have to create an operation around this cash flow and there's no cash flow in a basketball card there's no cash flow and air jordans there's no cash flow and harry potter first asian investor who's willing to buy it no dude you're still thinking like the old world you haven't seen what's going on rally you're staying with jack smith you should go ask jack smith about how this stuff works uh he's the one who who taught me and he's one of the biggest investors in this stuff he's not buying it for cash flow um you know he's buying it because yeah there are there is another there is another collector and when you make it fractional now way more people can get in on collecting it versus just the rich deep pocketed people who could buy the whole asset 100 percent yeah bro but who lik who liquidates it after a handful of years on rally road uh someone actually buys the car after a few years very rarely occasionally somebody comes and offers to buy out the whole the whole lot um and then they put it to a vote i don't know if you've seen this but like you know let's say a box of pokemon cards went on there uh like a super rare pokemon card set they i don't know what the ip what the ipo was but on rally the ipod let's pretend it was 50 000 and then what happened is a is a big you know asian investor came in and said we'll buy this thing out for 85 000 now so you'll all get a profit but we want to own this thing and they put it to the vote of all the share owners and they said no they said we're going to hold it we think it's going to go up so they voted no they voted to keep it so they're not all trying to liquidate um soon you know some some people who are buy and hold investors will want to own these assets for a long time because they think hey you know if i just hold this now you know what's michael jordan going to be what's michael jordan's fame going to be 20 years from now if michael jordan passes away how much is it going to be worth and there's people who are in it for the long term so i think there's i think the collectibles thing is a little bit different than i think about it differently than you do i would say you basically need jordan to have like a tragic accident or like for example dance came out so so the last dance is ten part documentary that came out on netflix and espn um you know millions and millions of people watch this thing and jordan's brand you could see all the price of jordans went up jordan's like brand visibility and brand sentiment went up because this documentary came out and he's still alive it wasn't a tragic event but somebody told the jordan story to the the younger generation who you know grew up with you know they were two years old when jordan was at his prime and so jordan brand got stronger with the last dance coming out and i think that's just going to continue you know over time because he's got all these different you know the legacy becomes bigger than the person itself but i have a different thing that's sports related okay i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like the road

look if you don't figure this out you're [ __ ] you're broke i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what yeah what's up sean why we keep getting two things that's kind of like keeping me up at night the first which doesn't keep me up at night but weirds me out why do people keep confusing us and the second thing and the second thing that does keep me up at night is i don't know if they're saying it just about me or about both of us but they say that we look differently yeah and i think both are like i think both are insults wrapped in disguise like they're not saying anything bad but the way they're kind of like laughing makes me think uh it's not a it's not a good thing i don't think it's an upgrade for them someone said that i write like a bro but i look like a nerd and i'm like you're you're you're insulting both my looks and i like how do you make me look i want to look like a bro maybe and talk or wait which one do i want to do i want to look like a bro and talk and and talk like a nerd maybe that's hilarious um um yeah so it's people mix up that means for months they've just been listening to this and they think i'm you and they think you're me and when they follow us they uh you know they have it all wrong it's kind of funny and then um i have uh do you know what e foiling it what what's e foil what are you talking about i'm about to rent one so it's a twelve thousand dollar device and it looks kind of like a wake board but it has like a three foot to four foot like rudder that sticks on the bottom of it and on the bottom of that rudder is a motor and it's like a boosted skateboard with like a with like a handheld acceleration device and it you lift off and it you ride three feet above the water i've seen this uh now that you say i thought you were talking about something related to like i don't know microphones or voices you just switched topics uh with a hard left turn but i appreciate that so i saw this because what's the name of that one surfer guy who's like uh super famous laird hamilton yeah laird hamilton i saw him doing this where he was go i don't know if his i think his was like even taller but basically he was surfing with you know there's like a there's like an underground fin and then he's elevated above the water and he was like and there's it's like a jet ski that he's standing on it was kind of crazy sounds like that's what this is yeah well i'm about to go do it in an hour i'm pumped this is the next before we get into ideas it might be it might be there i'm getting ads for it constantly on social media it might be um we have a good episode today because you brought something up incredibly interesting and i do i went deep on it but before we get into that can i tell you a quick story yeah go for it okay so a few weeks ago i got mocked on the internet for like doing this trapped in a closet for with andrew chen thing so this guy named andrew chen what is a partner at andreessen horowitz he's got a cool startup e blog but i heard he told me one of the wilder stories i've heard recently so when he was in i think i could i might get uh some of the details like wrong by year or two but when he was in about sixth grade he took the sat and scored really high and when he did i think it's the university university of washington does this thing where every five or ten they take five or ten students per year who are in sixth or seventh grade sometimes younger like 12 years old whichever grade that is and they asked them to come to college to come to university of washington and he was one of the students and so he at sixth grade i think he skipped seventh grade and went straight to college and he moved there in a dorm went to college and i asked him who else was in it and he actually said emmett emmett shear from twitch was one of the folks wait wait so he didn't go to college he didn't like become a college student he just went for like a camp or something or he's no he's like no doogie houser stuff like he literally instead of going to seventh grade he moved into a dorm went to college and and here's where it gets even crazier so he like moved there moved away from home which i think his parents are from the state as well but it was like moved half an hour however far away from home lived there as a college student and he understandably was kind of embarrassed and didn't really tell a lot of people and so they thought that even though he was however whatever age you are in seventh grade they kind of assumed that he was just another 18 year old and apparently he told me that he even dated a girl he um just kind of acted normal and they didn't find out that he didn't like hide it from them but he didn't bring it up and they didn't find out until senior year or something like that when everyone was turning 21 and they were like when you turned 21 he was like oh i'm i'm actually 17 years old or six whatever 16 yeah and i it's a pretty wild story and i asked him like who else was part of this program he said the founder of twitch was some person running a huge hedge fund just like baby genius like real baby geniuses crazy fascinating story and apparently the university of washington still does this every year where they select i forget what they call the program but it's like a thing where they have psychologists and therapists meet with the kids every quarter every month to discuss what's going on and it was incredibly fascinating and in a very typical genius response i said isn't that weird that you skipped high school and he was like well what do you think about it adolescence is really just like a societal constraint and i kind of experienced the same thing i was like oh yeah i mean i guess you're right but like thanks for proving my point that you are just a figment of my imagination um yeah isn't that wild that is wild also i don't know if that's true because emmett definitely went to yale and so did justin khan so i don't know well maybe it was through yale but he said that emmett was part of the same program or maybe he dropped out um but he said that age 13. i love it we said that emmett was part of his program i i don't know what if program that they do in a ton of different schools but like a uh 13 year old freshman in college uh would you let your kid do this or would you want your kid to do this let's say your kid's 12 scores high on a test would you want him to skip high school and go and be a 13 year old college student and like amongst the you know amongst the crazy 18 year olds so it's a good question because your my gut instinct is probably the same as everyone else's which is high school is important you learn uh about yourself and and it's important to go through all that normal stuff but we also complain that high school often or that like what you learn in high school is kind of [ __ ] and and you know what does the world look like if you do combine the two so like maybe it is i don't so i don't know but isn't that isn't that a wild story yeah that that's crazy i um uh such a fun fact about someone yeah i also think it's an interesting strategy for the colleges like why are they doing this um i think it's kind of cool i remember the reason i ended up going to duke is because they had this thing called the tip program which is the talent identification program and you would take the i don't know the psats or something like that and then if you scored above a certain thing duke would send you this kind of like kit this goody bag and it basically was like it felt like getting an owl from hogwarts and it's like hey you're 12 and like we want to invite you to this special school for the gifted and talented and it just said like you scored high on this we have identified you as a talented person we would love to you know like have you come visit our campus and like eventually and the [ __ ] worked i went to duke eventually i didn't put two two together that's why but like if i think about it that's why i started paying attention to them and that's why i started following the basketball teams that's how i even heard about it otherwise as a 12 year old kid you don't even you don't even hear about colleges right so i thought that was pretty interesting and if you think about it you know these schools are for-profit these schools are trying to get um you know they're trying to get tuition they're trying to get people to come in and pay the uh 40 50 grand to go to school and so these little investments um and and you know who doesn't like to be called talented who doesn't like to be called kind of like a phenom uh what parent doesn't want their kid to be identified as a special um that [ __ ] works and i'm surprised that more schools don't do this and when i start my school i i too am gonna do this yeah i'm i'm trying to like do some research on it right now what we're talking and it's not really effective but uh you'll have to look up this program when you're done it's just a really cool interesting thing uh and it was funny to meet someone who went through it and it was just such a silly fun fact about someone by the way my roommate in college um we when he got when we got to college i was like yeah yeah you know we're all 17 or 18 whatever we were as freshmen and he was like yeah like um he would say like yeah but then like i noticed this expression i was like well what he's like well i'm like 19 and a half about to turn 20. and i was like what why are you so old and basically they do the exact opposite when it comes to sports so in sports uh the common thing to do is to like sandbag your kid and basically hold your kid back a grade or like send them to school a year late so that they're always bigger faster stronger than all the other kids in their grade and you're always like the star athlete because you have like an extra year of development or you have a better shot i should say of being a star athlete and so he was from wyoming and he's like oh dude in wyoming this is that's par for the course dude every you know every sixth grader is like an eighth grader's age because everybody wants to like have their kid be yeah my first two years of college i was an athlete and i would compete against these guys and there was two groups of people that we would like and i was friends with them but we would tease about they're not really it's like it's a little unfair which is the first was kenyan so kenyan runners um i think that there's i don't know i don't know i don't think they were lying about their age but i think there's a an exemption if you serve in the military so you get to compete in college and college athletics i think until you're this was ten years or eight years ago however long you get to compete until you're 26 years old um and then the second is for um religious stuff so the mormons at age 18 would bounce for two years so they would be a 20 year old freshman which means there'd be a 24 year old senior in college so i was 18 my freshman year competing against 24 25 year olds and so yeah mo the mormons and the in the kenyans if they and uh anyone served in the military and uh i know this topic is basically nobody gives a [ __ ] about what we're talking about but i will say there is a lesson uh that's in life you get to choose are you gonna punch up or punch down and uh the andrew chen thing going to college at 12 or 13 that's a kid who's punching up you're you know you're in an unfamiliar circumstance you're stretching beyond you know what you what you're playing in the bigger leagues than where you are and then there's the uh athletes that are that are held back years or you know come back and compete against people you know two to five years younger than them that's punching down in weight and i would say like punching down has some benefits because typically you're gonna score better do better um in these little like games you know in you know high school or college athletics but in the end you really want to be somebody who punches up uh you always want to i think you know for long-term success you want to be somebody who punches up who somebody somebody who's always in a room where you're just barely hanging on because it'll push you to get better more so than just dominating people because you're older and stronger than them well it works for andrew chen i think he's 38 years old but i was like but you're really like 45 [Laughter] right like in my experience like a 45 year old all right let's get to the top first full-time job okay let's get to the first one so sean put something on here that i actually think i was telling a friend as i was researching i actually think that this is one of the better ideas that we and you you've ever come up with the michael jordan thing all right yeah you want me to explain it okay so um i've been looking at this house for a long time michael jordan's house has been for sale for like a decade and it hasn't sold and this is his house uh kind of like you know in illinois near chicago where you know michael jordan was on the bulls and he had this 56 000 square foot home in highland park and so this thing originally he put it up for sale and like i don't know nine years ago for 30 million dollars 29 million dollars and now it's you know the price has been cut in half and the thing is still not selling and if you look at the photos you can just go it's like on zillow so you can go look at the photos he's got like an indoor basketball court you know the gate leading up to the driveway has his big 23 number like embossed in it he's got you know everything you would want like huge you know closets because he's got you know all his air jordans or whatever and so his house is it's pretty unbelievable right there's there's all kinds of um epic [ __ ] here but it's not selling and it's not selling for i think a couple reasons it's like you know it's very custom to michael jordan um like it just it's like it was custom made in many senses so you know that other rich people don't necessarily want to live in a house that's like made for another dude um it's also you know it's very expensive for the area the property taxes are really expensive all that stuff but i was thinking okay the price is now cut in half now it's now it's a 13 million dollar house or a 12 you know 13 million home that you could buy 13 14 and now it's in range where maybe there's something fun you could do with it now you might be getting a value by so i was thinking all right there's a bunch of people obviously that are basketball fans that love michael jordan um there's a bunch of you know new ways to crowdfund that we've been talking about nfts or kickstarter or different different crowdfunding platforms so the question is should we buy michael jordan's house should we start a crowdfunding campaign and buy michael jordan's house so if you could get 5 000 people to each put in 2 500 then you could own a fractional share of michael jordan's house you could you you could own a piece of of this history and we could just buy it out take it off the market and we could own this thing and then the question is like what do you do with it um and so i wanted to brainstorm with you a should we buy michael jordan's house and b what could we do with it if we did buy it what do you think so the whole nft thing i wouldn't do that i think that i think you've had two ideas here one is to buy his house and two is to end do the nft thing uh one of those ideas is great i think the other one is over complicating it i would 100 buy it and the reason why i think it's such a great idea is immediately after you seeing you write this my thought right away went to graceland you know what graceland is no that's funny that you don't know what that is it's because it's such a big deal in my family or elvis is at least so graceland is elvis presley's house uh it's in memphis it's in downtown memphis it's actually in a pretty crappy neighborhood now or the neighborhood is not nice and it's like kind of gross but it's just like a cutesy thing to do if you visit memphis and i went and did research on it and so around 600 000 people a year go to graceland which brings in something like where i have the numbers here okay so graceland just in attendance uh just in ticket sales brings in 21 million dollars so it's yeah pretty wild just on tickets and then 600 000 visitors a year uh 36 a ticket right yes and i got interested in this so i thought what are the most visited homes in america so i came up with a few and i want to fill you in on them so the white house doesn't count because you can just you i think you can get a tour but you could also just walk outside of it but graceland 600 thousand the second one i'm you guys are gonna make fun of me i don't know how to pronounce this what is it monticello i think so okay monticello that's uh thomas jefferson's house and so the interesting thing about this place as well as a few other i'm going to mention is that they're non-profits which means all of their numbers are public and so uh the revenue for monticello which includes a ton of investment revenue was around 200 million dollars in 2010 but around uh eight million seven million came just from ticket sales so eight million a year in ticket sales which is crazy and they have around 500 000 people another uh most visited home is never uh like homes that people drive by neverland ranch people don't go there but the other another great one is mount vernon which is uh i think uh what's our first president george washington's house uh and they do in in in uh food sales alone this is crazy just in food 17 million dollars a year wow is that crazy insane the whole operations and then they do 15 million dollars a year in admission sales and in total they do about 51 million dollars a year in total income which includes 10 million from contributions is that crazy no that's absolutely insane so let me ask you these okay so this all of a sudden this starts to get really interesting right because i think michael jordan is on par with elvis and you know thomas jefferson michael jordan's got tj beat by a long shot so you know mj over tj i think is is part of the the slogan that we have when we when we buy this thing but um if they're doing this much in traffic i got to know is there something else meaning like are these in really hot like popular areas uh where there's already just a lot of tourists or something like that and this is just a pit stop because you know michael jordan's house in a neighborhood you'd have to only be going to go to this place i looked up michael jordan's address guess how far away it is from chicago airport one of the most popular airports in the world i'm gonna guess 45 minutes 20 minutes it's 20 minutes away okay so it's at like have you been in memphis memphis is like there's not that much going on in memphis and all these people are going to memphis um people are chicago's what the fifth most populous city in america or maybe third something like that something is interesting here so what i would do is i wouldn't do the nft thing i would raise uh two or three million dollars from a bunch of rich people um or i would try to use my own money if i had two or three million dollars that i wanted to spend on this and i would buy it and then it would probably cost a fair bit of money to get it set up it would probably cost a lot of money another many more millions but then you'd have to convince collectors to lend you the stuff and you create a michael jordan museum yes and that's how you do this and the companies that we've just mentioned graceland monticello and um mount vernon so those obviously those folks lived in the 1700s or probably died in the 1800s so they've been around those properties have been around as tourist destinations for a hundred plus years but they've done 50 million revenue which is a [ __ ] ton but even if you've just um two or three million dollars in revenue and you could do that and adjust for inflation for 50 plus years kind of like graceland has done it for 60 years that's incredibly fascinating right yeah i'm with you so so i think you you know you're [ __ ] on the nft thing a little bit but it's not about nft what i'm saying is crowdfunding um so i think that there's a benefit to crowdfunding which is that crowdfunding is a way to make the story more viral um it is a it's a more pr worthy story that uh you know people from the internet people from reddit whoever got together and bought michael jordan's home off the market for for 15 million dollars they raised 15 million dollars and bought the house versus a rich guy went to his rich friends and raised some money the second thing is those become you know the your evangelist to spread the word and to come make the uh the pilgrimage to go see michael jordan's house and i think you could do two or three things with it i think you could make it a museum that's like a modern museum that we've been talking about like the museum of ice cream or something like that where the tour is very heavy um photo based and so you're you know you're going through and it's all these different photo exhibits of you know you in michael jordan's bed and you know wearing you know a pair of his air jordans or standing in a pair of giant air jordans or something like that and you make it like a museum of ice cream where you're going to walk out with you know 10 photos that are instagram worthy at the end of it i also think give give people background on an ice cream museum yeah bray you can pull the latest numbers but i think these guys uh raised it like 100 million dollar plus valuation and if you if you ever go to one they're pretty cool it's you know it's not the most amazing thing i honestly was a little bit disappointed but the photos do turn out cool it's a museum that you walk through uh so it's like a guided path and you go through maybe like 13 different rooms and every room is something cool and you get a little you know you get an ice cream cone of some flavor and then you can take photos next to some like exhibit that they've set up and the idea is not for you to look at the art like a traditional museum but for you to like take a photo in the art uh and post it on instagram and that's their marketing that's the free marketing that they get and so museum of ice cream oh yeah here everybody has it they raised 40 million they raised a 40 million dollar series a at a 200 million dollar valuation last year and um and i think this could be bigger i think this could be much much bigger as a brand um the other thing uh the other thing that you could do is uh sports cards are having this incredible boom right now and i think what you could do is you could have certain collectors put their collection um in in the house the house could be basically the vault to store some of the most rare memorabilia in the sports world sign basketball shoes and sports cards and that could be part of the museum and you you basically store it and you um you store it for some of these collectors so i think i think there's a bunch of stuff you could do to make this work but the idea is like can you buy this thing for 13 million put another four or five million into um you're getting it all set up and then could you make five million dollars a year could you make 10 million dollars a year like you're saying these other guys do um as a pilgrimage for you know tourists going to chicago and basketball junkies i think the answer is definitely yes and i think it's so interesting um i found a i found another example of one and it's called the um it's called the national trust for historic preservation and it's a non-profit and all they do is buy historical buildings and their historic i looked at their numbers they've been doing like 50 or 60 million in revenue for years and i'm still trying to figure out how to entirely read uh non-profit statements but they have a buy a line item that's revenue less expenses which i guess that just means prop i mean i don't know how they define yeah i don't know how they define either of those but it was 26 million and it's been doing that for years is that nuts so i like this idea i like this idea a lot and i kind of want to dig a little further into how these um homes home museums work because i think this is pretty interesting the other good thing about this by the way is that the basketball hall of fame sucks uh nobody cares about it nobody goes to visit it um all the other sports like you know canton for football these are like tourist destinations you know tons of people go there every year it's really cool and the basketball one is known to be super lame because they let way too many people in and um and it's not like it's not a thing that basketball fans really care to go do can i give you two more examples that we what we could consider doing instead of even doing a museum maybe this is even simpler yeah so i'm staying at my friend jack's house it's a badass house um five doors down or ten doors down something like that nearby is what's they call it the obama house and when obama was in office from uh when was he in office oh the oh the second the second term um or whatever it was he would stay at this house down here and the owners let him stay i think for a massive discount now it's like it has its own wikipedia page and it's called like the obama house and it sold 10 years ago for 7 million after he had already stayed there which sorry 7 million i said i say 7 for 7 million which is a lot of money but they rent it out right now on airbnb for six thousand dollars a night or if it's booked all the way up 180k a month and it's branded as the obama house i think that you could absolutely crush it with a jordan airbnb house would you and a group of friends be willing to pull together three thousand dollars a day to stay there maybe i think the way you'd have to do it is you'd have to make it like a vegas alternative for bachelor parties and stuff like that birthdays it's like what is the man cave man dream vacation it's like dude we're gonna go stay in michael jordan's house 14 of us are going um and it comes with like all the amenities and you know all that stuff this is where you go this is where you want to go if you want to live like the sports fan's dream i think you could do that i do like the museum one better what was the second idea you had you said you had two oh what wasn't the second i guess it was more so uh just another example the fresh prince of bel-air house um it's it's kind of interesting but do you remember living in san francisco how there's like the what's it called the painted ladies which is the whole the full house house and then there's the missed out firehouse um i would just want to buy all these and turn them all on so i lived a block away from the uh from the full house house and uh literally 24 7 there is somebody standing outside of that house during the daytime uh taking a photo of it so there's just a constant and it's not like it's not like a huge line of people but there's always like four people standing outside taking a photo in front of the full house house every single day for the whole year it's kind of crazy and then it just sold actually and it's sold at basically like i think 1.5 or 2x the market rate in that area so um they got basically like a double premium because it is the full house house which i think is you know kind of interesting um but okay i think we should uh i think we should buy michael jordan's house i think we should crowdfund uh i think we should crowdfund five thousand people together we should own this thing or we could go to rally road and we could say hey rally let's put michael jordan's house on rally and uh you know let's sell this baby out i think if five thousand right now if you go on rally roads you'll get two thousand or three thousand people buying a fractional share of you know a pair of jordans or a signed autograph or a signed rookie card or something like that [ __ ] all that let's own the guy's house so i think you could easily get 5000 people on rally road to buy a fractional share of michael jordan's house i'm surprised they don't already do this if they're listening to this uh you know go go for it just give us credit and give me a share of the house i actually think that they wouldn't do that because how do you liquidate that it's been on the market for 20 or how long 10 years no one is obviously no one's buying it so like how do you get liquidity from that after seven years i don't think you don't i think the game right the point of rally is that they take things that are not assets and they make them not liquid assets they make them liquid assets so because you can own a fractional share now there's liquidity any one person who owns a piece of michael jordan's house can swap it for anybody else who wants to own a piece of it so you don't need a 15 million dollar buyer because you can sell them in blocks of a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars and so when you bring that price point down there's people who wanna own a piece of the a piece of the art a piece of the asset which is how they do like you know they'll sell um you know a harry potter first edition signed you know set of books and uh you know instead of selling it for 25 000 they'll get you know 2 000 investors to each put in or whatever whatever the math comes out to 150 bucks to go buy uh you know to own a piece of that thing so they introduce liquidity by making it fractionally owned yes but there's still no cash flow you have to create an operation around this cash flow there's no cash in a basketball card there's no cash flow and air jordans there's no cash flow and and harry potter first asian investor who's willing to buy it no dude you're still thinking like the old world you haven't seen what's going on in raleigh you're staying with jack smith you should go ask jack smith about how this stuff works uh he's the one who who taught me and he's one of the biggest investors in this stuff he's not buying it for cash flow um you know he's buying it because yeah there are there is another there is another collector and when you make it fractional now way more people can get in on collecting it versus just the rich deep pocketed people who could buy the whole asset 100 yeah bro but who lik who liquidates it after a handful of years on rally road uh someone actually buys the car after a few years very rarely occasionally somebody comes and offers to buy out the whole the whole lot um and then they put it to a vote i don't know if you've seen this but like you know let's say a box of pokemon cards went on there uh like a super rare pokemon card set they i don't know what the ip what the ipo was but on rally they ipo owed it let's pretend it was 50 000 and then what happened is a is a big you know asian investor came in and said we'll buy this thing out for 85 000 now so you'll all get a profit but we want to own this thing and they put it to the vote of all the share owners and they said no they said we're going to hold it we think it's going to go up so they voted no they voted to keep it so they're not all trying to liquidate um soon you know some some people who are buy and hold investors will want to own these assets for a long time because they think hey you know if i just hold this now you know what's michael jordan going to be what's michael jordan's fame going to be 20 years from now if michael jordan passes away how much is going to be worth and uh there's people who are in it for the long term so i think there's i think the collectibles thing is a little bit different than i think about it differently than you do i would say you basically need jordan to have like a tragic accident or like for example dance came out so so the last dance is ten part documentary that came out on netflix and espn um you know millions and millions of people watched this thing and jordan's brand you could see all the price of jordans went up jordan's like brand visibility and brand sentiment went up um because this documentary came out and he's still alive it wasn't a tragic event but somebody told the jordan story to the the younger generation who you know grew up where you know they were two years old when jordan was at his prime and so jordan brand got stronger with the last dance coming out and i think that's just going to continue you know over time because he's got all these different you know the legacy becomes bigger than the person itself but i have a different thing that's sports related okay yeah can i do this one so the different thing that's sports related and ties into the idea of um making assets out of things making liquid assets out of things that were non-liquid assets so there's this company called big league advance did you see this thing no keep going all right i'm looking it up so um so shout out to uh joe pompliano uh you know pomp's pomp's brother one of one of his brothers um who you know does these twitter threads all the time so he did this twitter thread that caught my eye and it was about this player fernando tatis so this guy's one of the young i don't follow baseball anymore because baseball's slow and boring to me now but i used to and you know back in the day i remember fernando tatis his is that for is it for nano testing junior because okay when i was a kid the senior played in st louis and he was like a huge deal i think he hit like he hits three grand slams in one inning and he was like our hometown hero for years okay that sounds crazy but um uh yeah basically this guy's like one of the youngest star baseball players and now like um he you know signed one of the big contracts he signed a 340 million dollar deal with the padres and the interesting thing that came out of that was that this company that i had never heard of called big league advance made 30 million dollars off of that deal so who who is big league advanced so basically what these guys do is they go to minor league baseball players of which there are thousands and they say look you're making you know you don't make [ __ ] in in the minor leagues um you you know you you're riding the bus you you get paid nothing um and you're hoping to one day get to the league and you're hoping one day to become a star you're hoping for the fernando t story where someday you'll sign a huge contract and what they do is they go and they offer you a deal so they'll say like hey we'll give you a hundred thousand dollars for one percent of your future earnings so it's an income share agreement like we've talked about with lambda school and whatnot and they'll go and they'll say you know three hundred fifty thousand dollars for eight percent of all your future earnings so we'll bet on you we'll take a risk on you so you get some money today you can give your family a better life today you don't have to keep like roughing it while you work your way up but hey if you hit it big like we're going to get paid out and they basically do a bunch of analytics on their side to try to guess which players to invest in what what what is the exact deal to offer them so it's like a startup investor who's coming up with the valuation of every minor league baseball player and um they know they'll lose many money on like 80 percent of the deals that don't pan out and they're hoping that the 20 that do turn into huge returns like a fernando tethy's junior and so um i think this is an awesome idea this actually is similar to a company that we've talked about called pipe pipe is uh they basically take companies that have sas revenue and they say hey you got all the sas revenue um let's turn that into a tradable investable asset let's take your contracts you have with customers let's make it so that anyone can just buy some of your sas contracts off you and uh you get money today up front for for those contracts you don't have to wait the 12 months for for your customer to pay you every month and um and for that that investor they're going to get a premium you know so they'll pay you the years worth of the contract and in exchange they get like a 12 return on on their money and you get money up front which you can reinvest into your business so i really like these companies that are taking things that were not investable tradable assets and making them investable tradable assets and i think big league advance is a cool one because it it's basically betting on minor league players that might turn into stars what do you think of this well i'm looking at their website so how can a minor le does that ruin the amateur stat or is there still amateur status with an uh my monday is pro minder league is is that you're a pro you're a professional player you're part of a team's farm system and you get paid you're out of the college system by then by then so you can only do the you can't do this for college kids correct that's cool so i think that you i'm looking at their website now so you i imagine this would work for golf baseball tennis basketball tennis i guess anything that's like crazy numbers related right like you can kind of like i wonder which sports do you think are the most predictive in terms of baseball is known to be the most predictive um and the most like kind of statistically modelable because your teammates kind of don't matter when you're up there batting it's just you and there's no like team dynamics whereas in basketball a player can be better or worse because there's five other people on the court all moving around and it all affects each other but you know that doesn't really matter in this case but here what you're basically saying is let's say there's a like this guy spencer dinwiddie tried to do this on the nets he um he he had signed like let's call it a 30 million dollar contract and what he tried to do was offer people um token shares in his future so he said look i i think i'm today i'm a like a b-level player i think i'm going to be an all-star someday so if you invest in me now you'll get a share of my future contract and so you're just betting on a player you're just saying i think that this player is going to be a star and i think this player is going to earn this much in his career so i will um i'll invest now in an income share agreement of his future earnings and so for the player they get money up front they don't have to wait to earn their contracts and they get a little bit of insurance like if anything happens they get hurt or you know something bad happens in their career hey at least they didn't risk it all they got paid some up front and for a fan it's a way to kind of bet and invest in players that you think are going to have more future earnings than uh than what they're offering today as a valuation this is so amazing i'm looking at their uh so they've raised 150 million dollars i think that from the looks of it it looks like they only have like 30 employees do you think that's accurate and if they made 30 million from from this this one guy alone so this was like the big home run um and you know they've had other things where like they they got sued by a player because they offered him 360 000 for ten percent of his future earnings and then he you know he tried to sue them being like oh [ __ ] that was like a predatory deal i didn't want to give up ten percent of my all my future earnings for just 360 k but in actuality the guy only made 1.2 million in his career so it actually turned out to be a profitable deal you know he took 360k up front and ended up only paying 120k out uh to these guys in the end so so he dropped his lawsuit why why is there so little information about these guys online you think there's really not a lot of flying like face page they're not a tech company uh it's just a financing company basically they um they tried to fly under the radar they also got like kind of disavowed like the major league baseball doesn't like them the players association said we do not like con we don't like like we don't say that this is a good thing but for the player you know it's they're cutting a deal with an individual player and um and i guess it's allowed in baseball whereas in basketball the nba blocked the thing i was talking about they blocked spencer dinwiddie from tokenizing his future contract and and basically selling off future future earnings so some leagues are not allowing it but major league baseball still uh still does allow it and minor league baseball still allows it so my question is this and you're more of a sports guy than i am and i'm looking at this and it seems awesome my question is what actually would make this fail and not work well so bad predictions so you invest in a bunch of players that don't pan out you could go underwater like i don't know i don't know how favorable their um i don't know how much room margin of safety they have when they do this stuff like with startups for example just like just like startup investing a lot of people um are angel investors or a lot of you know average vc funds actually can't even beat the stock market in terms of returns and um they're illiquid and they're risky and they don't they don't outperform and so it really comes down to these guys ability to pick and value players accurately um if they can't do it well they're going to go they're going to go broke and if they can do it well they're going to make a bunch of money and i think that's a healthy setup how challenging is it to to do this because i don't know anything about sports but i feel like this whole moneyball thing seems kind of like table stakes at this point for for professional teams right i don't think it's that challenging to be honest with you i think that there's uh you know you're getting you're collecting data all the time you have scouts you have all these different ways to value players and in this case it's such an inefficient market because the minor league players just make nothing and the baseball teams don't want to pay them a lot it's like hey dude you know do you want to live out your dream or not and so we'll pay you the absolute minimum required for you know just to have you in our minor league system and so what these guys are doing that's smart is they're taking a percentage of all the future earnings and uh and so i think they're they're basically going up against nobody right now but i think and i think there's even an easier way to do this in the nba because the nba has guaranteed contracts so let's say i sign a five-year 100 million deal i'm an nba star cool that means i'm going to get 20 million dollars a year uh dripped to me and so somebody could come and offer this guy 80 million dollars up front or 75 million dollars up front lump sum here's your money today and uh good you can use that you can go ball out nba does the nba does the nba have big as big of a minor league they i know they have the d league but i feel like i know so many i've got three friends that go into minor league baseball yeah so the nba g league is not anywhere near like all baseball players stars and don't stars and not go through minor league baseball stars in the nba go straight to the nba they skip the g league g-league is like journeyman and so um it you wouldn't do this with minor league in the nba you'd do it with the actual nba athletes and for them what you would be doing is saying cool you're on your first contract i'm betting that your second and third contract are going to be bigger and i'm willing to pay you up front on this multi-year contract because hey it's guaranteed you could go and break your leg tomorrow and you're still going to get all this money from your team so the nba has guaranteed contracts so it's way less risky uh you could just say look i'll give you this money up front so you can go invest it and you can go ball out you go buy your mom a house you can go buy that buy that i think you always wanted um and in exchange i want to get some some margin on the because i'm willing to wait the four or five years for your contract to play out and i can bet on your next contract and i can you know give you some future some money today in exchange for some percentage of your future because i think you're going to be a star i i think that this is this is awesome would you value this at a software company because how like if it's like a if the light if the average length of an mlb or nba player i don't know what it is but i bet it's in the eight to ten year range which means you're you have a really high ltv you have i imagine a quite predictable stream of income would you value this at software or close to software no i don't think so because it can't scale that's the be the beauty of software is that it scales sort of infinitely and um you know for every additional customer you have you don't have that many additional costs in this case i think this is more like real estate i think it's just people as property um you're buying this asset this multi-family property that has this much rent and um it's gonna it's gonna cash flow for this many years and so you basically are i think you're just buying properties yeah but real real estate sells for almost sas like multiples real estate sells at like what like a five or six percent cap rate yeah but software is like 50 dude like if you go look go look at salesforce or slack or go look at these guys multiples you know it's it's like you're at hubspot hubspot is doing a billion dollars a year of top line revenue uh that's not profit and you know even on the revenue i think hubspot is valid at what it's like a 30 billion dollar company or something like that um so it's a 30x 30x of revenue in that case so software has better better multiples than real estate sure well you want to talk about one more thing yeah go for it let's talk about uh we don't have enough time i think to really dive deep into the studio model but i'm really interested in this so there's two companies that i've been eyeing the first is atomic which is uh sorry by this guy named jack abraham and he has launched maybe 10 different startups one of them being hymns which is a multi-billion dollar company but the more interesting person is this guy named josh kushner kushner his brother everyone might know as jared kushner he's the guy who was uh on trump's cabinet uh josh kushner is married to this model what's his her what's her name carly kloss i think so he's like can have quite of a fascinating lifestyle or a fascinating life but with he started um a small fun he was born into a wealthy family so he he had money early on invested 400 000 into instagram made a significant sum from that and then has since uh not invested in companies through his his fun but really started them and one of them or she has two of them one is oscar which just went public and his stake in that is 1.2 the other one is called cadre i think it's called which is a rich person's investment platform but what do you think and the reason i brought this up is because you kinda had that experience a little bit like your uh bibo was kind of a startup studio do you like this model of starting companies and operating them but doing more than one at a time or do you think that just passively investing is better um okay so the thing we did which was called monkey inferno bibo was one of the companies inside monkey inferno was definitely a studio and in fact before jack started atomic um we met up in our office and he said hey i'm thinking about doing this studio tell me everything you've you've learned good and bad about running the studio so i can kind of learn from those mistakes and i told him hey like here's what i think is great here's some of the things i think that that trip us up um if i was you starting from scratch here's how i would do it and then he's you know he took that and he wait so jack came to you yeah he came to our office and we hung out and we we brainstormed and i kind of told him look these are the strengths and weaknesses of the studio model how are you planning to do it and to his credit he already what he had as an idea coming in was already the exact advice i was recommending and so it's not like oh i told him you should do xyz then he went did it he was already planning to do it that way but um but yeah and at the time i was like you know good luck because very few studios there are many many studios the studio is like the the reason studios happen is like successful entrepreneur wins they take some of their lottery winnings and they're like all right [ __ ] it i'm gonna do a studio this time because i can't pick one idea and i just want to do a bunch of [ __ ] i want to do a bunch of cool things and like now i have my own money i don't need other investors so much or i can i can easily raise money from investors because i have this big reputation and so you saw you know garrett camp the co-founder of uber he starts a studio mark pincus the founder of zynga he starts a studio kevin rose that you know sold his company to google then he starts a studio uh michael burch does bebo sells it to aol he started the studio that i i ran um you know there's a whole bunch of these guys that do this stuff and very few of them have success um we didn't have any breakout wins um garrett camp from uber he didn't win mark pincus he didn't win kevin rose he didn't win so so you know there was for a long time there was literally zero like breakout winners from studios and recently there's been a few that have worked atomic has had a few that have worked hymns is like the big win for them it's a public company now i believe and uh multi you know a multi-billion dollar win that they incubated in their studio um then there's uh the bark uh barkbox guys so they think they're in their studio is called pre-hype so they they you know they took barkbox uh public and um they've done very well and i think they also have uh row which is a competitor to him so now there's been a few like there's somebody got on the scoreboard so it definitely can work uh i would say the odds are that studio thrive and now thrive yeah thrive with oscar going public is great um and so i would say the odds are still you know it's just like startups where startups 90 of startups you know fail similar uh similar odds with the studio it's not like you get that much better um i would say a couple things super fun to do because who wouldn't want this it's like an entrepreneur's playground you get to go to work dream up ideas you have a t you have a bunch of teams that are building them all in parallel in theory you're killing the losers and you're doubling down on the winners and uh you know you're just being super creative every day so it's like the dream job then does it do you actually increase your odds of success on one hand yes because you're getting multiple shots on goal you're not you don't have all your eggs in one basket with one idea the second thing is that you're learning pretty rapidly so you're learning from all these different reps these different attempts you're doing and you're keeping the team together so like when a team even if you fail the team retains those learnings and just applies it to the next project right away whereas in a normal startup if you fail it's like everybody goes and gets a job for two years because now you're you know you just did this thing for three years it didn't work you're in debt you need to go make some money and so typically the team breaks up and goes and does something else in this case the team sticks together the learnings are retained so that's that's what's good the bad part which i think is what you're gonna focus on the big butt of this whole model that i think is what makes it not a great idea if you if you're if you're optimizing for success i don't think this is the best way is uh you're not focused because you have multiple ideas and you know one of the benefits of one of the key things in life is is focus and laser focus on on making something successful and the second thing which is kind of related to that is like shiny object syndrome every project goes through like kind of periods of plateaus like i remember with the hustle you started off you know with the events then you started the blog and then like there was a moment i remember our conversations where you were like the blogs are bringing in a bunch of traffic but i don't think this is working i need to figure out something else what if i did this daily email newsletter right you were like trying to figure out what do we do is it video is it this newsletter what is it and in a studio when that happens when you plateau or things just stop working or growth stalls it's super easy to instead of being like [ __ ] how do we find a way out of this how can we try to make this work uh it's really easy to be like hey what about that other idea that we're doing like that one's still super exciting it's not in a plateau right now so you just like unconsciously start to spend more energy on the thing that's not stuck because like who wants to stay in a [ __ ] stuck on a stuck project but as an entrepreneur you have no choice you told everybody you told your investors you told your team you told your mom i am building this and you have to find a way and that's like the most valuable thing a startup has is that like the the the do or die situation for a startup and i think studio takes away the do or die mentality because it's like do this or do that or do that or do the other thing and so you have all these options and those options actually um they actually take away your biggest asset as a startup so i would say if you're going for fun studios are dope if you're going for success i think that going like dabbling and picking a startup to go all in on is a better model than trying to run a studio with multiple projects and that's actually what i remember my what i spoke to you about um years ago when we started hanging out at monkey inferno is uh i don't remember which one it was blab bebo one of them like it seemed pretty good but like every business there was some problems where you're like people are coming but we're getting hacked or i don't remember what the problem was yeah or it was like kind of good kind of bad um and i was like dude just like just figure it out and i actually thought that you were for part of me was like oh sean's at this great place where he can do anything he makes money and he has an unlimited budget he can do anything i actually think that that hurt a lot of times and it would have been a little bit better if it was like look if you don't figure this out you're you're you're [ __ ] you're broke right yeah exactly i think you you called it for what it was like really early on you were like dude i think having everything right we had like a [ __ ] private chef we had the dopest office we had all the engineers we needed we had unlimited funding and runway we could just keep going and you were like dude it's gonna make you soft like don't you know having all this [ __ ] is like not good for you i remember you like pointing that out really early on and then also like just pick one of these and stick to it don't like don't get distracted by having a lab or a studio where you have all these different things going on and you're just dividing up your attention 20 here 30 here 10 here and uh like what if you just put 120 into like the one and you just found a way you know i you i remember you saying that stuff but it seems really fun and when it works it's like oh wow it worked and it's fun and that's what i'm seeing when i when i when i i mean i don't know these guys but from an outside perspective and i'm sure it sucks on the inside just like everything else has pros and cons it seems quite fun it seems really exciting to be able to win big and have multiple uh shots on target it seems really interesting um so one thing by the way one thing i think atomic did good uh that they changed the model so he was i told him i was like i told him about these problems and he was like yeah we're gonna do it differently he's like we're gonna only do one project at a time that team is do or die on that project he goes they have nine months to raise their their series a and if they can't raise their series a in nine months they're out like you're out of a job and he's like in reality we're gonna keep the good people we're gonna offer them a job on the next one but like it's not a given that like oh if this doesn't work no problem like just work on this other thing that we're doing and he's like that's going to have urgency that's going to have focus they're not going to split their time between different projects and he's like i'm going to be the ceo of of the project you know like that we're doing and the other big thing was they weren't going after consumer like we were doing consumer and like social apps which are you know lower odds of of hitting the lottery um whereas he was like yeah consumer's super hard you know it's just really hard to you know the consumers are fickle we're gonna do b2b and so that they started doing only b2b stuff for a long time and um and hims was the one kind of like consumer hit that they've had um the other things that they've had that have done okay are b2b companies which i think are a smarter model to do e-founders is a great example of one of the that's working in europe where it's like they only do sas and they really focus on problems that they know that are in the b2b space because their own companies have this problem so then they build a product for that and they build it make a company out of it they've had big hits like front came out of that and different things like that well rocket internet does it as well and they're they have their tens of billions of dollars with the value that they've created but the best example of this my favorite actually and i just realized this as we were talking is kevin ryan kevin ryan is someone who i admire and and i i joke that we kind of look like he's probably uh 30 years older than me but i tease that we like he kind of looks like i look like him we kind of look alike and he um he was the 20th employee at i forget what it was called but it was double click it was called doubleclick and it was sold to google for multi-billions and eventually became google adwords and adsense and he told me that he made around 20 million dollars when he sold it which was definitely a [ __ ] ton of money and then using that him and this guy named dwight would invest 300 000 and give a company six months to show traction and the outcome of their companies uh there's a a couple losers and a couple winners probably a lot more losers than winners but the first one is mongodb which is currently publicly traded at a 21 billion valuation the second one is business insider which is probably a bill it was sold for 500 million dollars probably worth a lot more now uh the third one is zola which prior to the pandemic was doing hundreds of millions of dollars in sales and i think that there's like four or five more that have been hits right and he told me i actually called him and i emailed him like every month for like three years to try and get him to talk to me and eventually he let me fly out there and meet with him and he told me that all he does is him and dwight i mean they're wealthy right so they can do this but they he they just come up with an idea and they just get a piece of paper and a pencil and they like write out the math and they're like oh that's kind of interesting all right let's try to find someone to do it and we'll give them 300k to do it now this sounds like a very simple process and it might be simple but it's still quite hard to pull off but they've done it and it's and it's called um sil uh silicon alley insider it's the name of his thing and uh you'll have to look this guy up it's really interesting i think that's jason calacanis thing that's not that's not those guys no it's it's they have the same name oh okay interesting um it's it's called uh wait is it called silicon alley insider uh it's called the alley corp sorry you're right it's called ali corp so so i think there's a business insider was called silicon alley insider interesting so so i think um so so there's it's just like accelerators right there's like a million accelerators in the world every college has one every little city has one and then you have y combinator that just like kicks ass and you know so what combination best sorry to interrupt guilt guilt guilt is the other one that he started right go ahead that's a bunch of hits so basically you have like it's not that is this model good or bad it's like how do you execute it and who are the people involved in it so like y combinator is an accelerator that is probably created you know i don't know 100 billion dollars worth of value now out of the companies that have come out of it um easily over 100 billion actually airbnb alone is 100 billion um so so y combinator is like the best and then you have tech stars and then you have like all these other accelerators that like have never had a hit and um so our accelerator model is good or bad like if you said it was bad you'd be wrong because y combinator is a hit but if you said it's just great and you can repeatably make success using this model no that's not true i think the same is true for studios and everyone is different because you have to make a bunch of choices it's like for example are you going to do multiple ideas at once or you're going to do one at a time are you going to have shared staff working across projects you're going to have staff dedicated to their one and they live and die with the one are you going to fund it indefinitely or you're going to give it a six month or nine month time period to to get to some traction and raise money from external investors or are you just going to let it run forever do you come up with the ideas or do you invite in founders and they spend some time coming up with the idea like an eir all right there's all these different differences that like there's all these like little choices that will lead to a totally different outcome it sounds like in that case they come up with the ideas and then they find an operator in jack's case he came up with ideas and he was the initial operator and then he hires a ceo um you know in xbus case they bring in an operator and they the operator comes up with the idea and so there's all these different versions of it and um you know a lot of it just depends on both luck as well as who's involved like truly great entrepreneurs and investors can have success where somebody else copying the same model that they have won't they won't be able to pull it off because they don't have the right judgment and that's why i think i failed and i think i didn't have the same judgment that these guys who have had success like with them with their model i think they were better at playing that game than i was it also helps to be wealthy i think and be able to write uh 10 to 20 300 000 checks and have the time to do it and so i don't want to dismiss that but a lot of them raise money like jack he raised money he raised uh i don't know like 100 million dollars or something from andrews and horowitz and others to fund his lab even though he himself was like you know you know doing super well he had sold the company to ebay he was like crushing it at paypal or whatever like or ebay when he was there um you know he sold his company for 75 million dollars when he was 24. well i'm not just i'm not dismissing any of their skill i'm just saying this is definitely like a after you get your hit it's a lot easier i'm not dismissing that at all it's like it's a lot easier to become a good golfer if you have some money to afford a fancy uh uh fancy clubs and a membership and there's a bunch of people trying to do this that don't have that right there's a group uh this guy bobby he listens to the podcast he's doing this for creators he's like all right we're gonna make a studio we're gonna just build products for the creator economy and i don't think they have a big track record or anything like that but that's their focus they're trying to do a studio for that i'm not saying it's impossible i know another group of guys this year another group of guys that i'm bet i would bet on that um the main guy is this guy kumar and uh if you should follow him on twitter he's amazing uh he's super interesting on twitter and facebook uh his handle is data raid i know who he is and he's just like really into all these alternatives he's a weird guy yeah he's a weird dude but he's really sharp and he's really out there different type of thinker and so he's like he's like really into like you know the the energy industry and so he'll build like little products for the energy industry that you didn't even know like there was a need for so i think this guy's going to do well because he knows where to sniff he knows where to sniff out some money because he's looking at problems that the average kind of engineer in silicon valley or new york or la they don't even know these problems exist they don't even know these companies exist and so um you know he's he was doing one for example like his friend is a lawyer and uh you know there's like all these like little rule changes in like your local regulation or your local law and he just made an alert system where it'll alert you about whenever this rule changes and uh he can go get a bunch of lawyers to sign up for these email alerts and it's a sas business that you know can do well or you know energy prices when they when they rise and fall um how you know how are you gonna track that how do you get how do you build a database of that that information so he's got all these like really random ideas that i think the average entrepreneur doesn't really even know about those markets enough to like to know those problems and therefore he finds kind of untapped opportunities well i think we should dive deep on this sometime like even more and i want to get jack on here and i would love to get kevin ryan on here um because i this sounds cool it definitely sounds like a rich guy's playground and frankly i want to do it i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like the days of the road

these guys applied very intelligently i gotta give them credit so basically they saw that we were trying to upgrade our stuff and they're like we'll do this for you we'll make it no hassle i'll come to you i will hook it up and a few people tweeted tweeted something like that at us and you were like kind of you know humoring it i guess and then these three guys are kind of like i think they're like college seniors or something like that i don't really know didn't look too far into it but they sent us a video they go watch here's what we're gonna do and they recorded a video and it looks like a casey neistat video like the quality is like that and the editing style and storytelling is like that there's a funny video it was basically telling us how to how they would pimp out our stream and uh they kept calling it like you know my first million to the moon and they're like we're gonna take this baby to the moon here's how we're gonna do it and so they did two things he he showed how

they do a random cookie drop so a different flavor or whatever and it sells out within literally seconds and they're doing 200 000 a week they're doing 10 million dollars a year dropping cookies on instagram and just instantly selling out and then they ship them you know a few days later they know how many orders they get and then they ship them out a few days later um kind of like you know nationwide or whatever and there's another one ally's banana bread go look at this banana bread dude just look at this banana bread i want to print this banana bread out and just lick the paper it looks so good and same thing sells wait wait wait wait wait wait wait dude check check this out so if you go to uh mycookiedealer.com that's the website okay click click instagram page are you on their instagram and tell me when you're on their instagram page i'm on it okay you see go scroll up to their profile and you see who where it says like the owner is this guy named juan diesel moore morel click it oh dude he's like a bodybuilder this guy is huge this guy is so big he looks like if you've ever seen an espn or whatever bodybuilding competition where the guys are like this crazy color of skin that nobody is and he's just humongous no i i can't tell if it's like the tan i think it's a black guy is he like he's so dark i think it's a white guy you know like the white guy black tan for bodybuilding well and then look at his wife it's insane this whole this guy's life is insane is what i can see from this i mean this guy's his steroids are you know as good as his cookies i would say that's what yeah i want the hgh drop this is awesome man this is cool okay so ally's banana bread so ali's banana bread so there's a bunch of these so ben is like d knee deep in this world of like instagram food brands that are basically they're kind of like drop shipping baked goods all around the country so they have them for cakes ice creams banana breads and they're just specialists and so there's a couple cool things that i wanted to bring up about this and i know you have some stuff on food too but the part that i thought was cool is so the internet is the internet is really good at doing this which is normal before the internet you would just go to whatever's like your local whatever so you'd find the best within your local radius of five to ten miles or whatever it is that's what you would go by but with the internet whether it's news or comedy or whatever the best thing can just get distributed everywhere and so the best brand wins on the internet and so this is why you see things get so big you know like facebook and other platforms because the best the best thing will get all the users and it's what's interesting is that these guys are doing this with food so if these guys really do make the best goddamn banana bread or best cookies or best ice cream they don't need a physical shop they could just through instagram alone spending zero dollars on marketing have customers worldwide like ali's banana bread literally ships worldwide and um so if you're the best at making something now you have a pathway to become like a multi-millionaire um where that really wasn't possible if you were just a local baker in whatever in cincinnati you know you were always restricted by however many customers you could get into your local radio so i thought that's pretty cool the second thing is if you think about this you know this is like a mix of a bunch of things that we've been talking about for a while so we've been talking about cloud kitchens so these are essentially like cloud ice cream shops or cloud bakeries they don't have like a physical storefront necessarily they're all in the cloud and you just order online the second thing is direct to consumer so they're going direct to their fans they're getting their fans phone numbers and so that when they do a drop they just text everybody like one picture of the new thing and then instantaneously people buy and i think that's kind of like amazing a way to go to direct to consumer you don't have to worry about getting on the shelf at you know whole foods or wherever else to to build your your brand as a cookie company or whatever and go ahead no keep going last one is if you think about it like you know who's going to be the next mrs fields or ben and jerry's or like auntie andy's pretzels it's gonna be one of these brands it's gonna be one of these cloud bakeries doing it on instagram building a cult following like these guys are doing and um and you're gonna see i predict you're gonna see just like um i forgot what was the name of that meme company that sold for like a hundred million dollars they had like they were the ones behind um daquan and whatever like a couple of the meme instagram accounts uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that was about eight months ago maybe yeah we talked about it on the pod it's like we'll pull it up just like what you see it's right there you see it i can't really i am gm media so so basically you know some brand that just owned a bunch of like meme accounts on instagram sold for like 100 million dollars i think if i remember correctly you're going to see the same thing in the food space you're going to see a bunch of private equity companies coming in and they're going to buy up you know alleys alleys banana bread they're going to buy up 1 900 ice cream because they're going to be like dude this is the next ben and jerry's and we're going to take this this thing we're going to put it on steroids we're going to advertise the [ __ ] out of it and then we're going to get it into retail stores on top of what it's already doing and so you're i think you're going to see a bunch of these if i could go invest in those four brands that we talked about right now i would go give them each you know 25k check because i think these are gonna get scooped up okay so let's break this down further i've thought about this a ton the reason i've thought about this ton is i i'm a media guy right by the way is my mic good yeah you're good all right i'm a media guy i love content and i've studied what goes viral and why for years and one thing that i've always been fascinated with is i've known people who have worked at thrillist and thrillas started as a food well they started as like things to do in new york but one of their biggest things is food and i remember when i started dating my wife she was from new york city and i hadn't been there since i was the first time i've been there was when we started dating 26 27 years old and i went there and i would see these long like i would go to like the areas that you see in movies where like the cute people hang out where they all dress like you know like they dress like right they go yeah like they just like for me that was like wow i feel like everyone looks like a movie star everyone was cool and hit by you know i don't i don't know madison square park or washington whatever those parks i don't know i don't spend a lot of time there but you know what i mean uh they would have the longest lines and i'm like what what are all these people waiting for and it was like the latest uh thrillers craze that went viral and so i i would walk or through brooklyn and everything and i would see these lines and i'm like what is going on and i would do research and i kind of broke it down into i like i've like studied this for a while and uh or not studied is the right word but thought about it a lot and i basically broke it down into the into a handful of categories and what it appears what what seems like what happens is people have a small store a relative like pretty like a corner store in hit parts of brooklyn or new york where there's uh people who share so like college kids mostly and they create one or two things that that thrillist or buzzfeed or someone because all those companies are located in the cool parts that i'm describing in soho things like that and one of these uh buzzfeed or thrillers folks sees it a whole bunch of college kids see it and then it creates a line and it creates hype it it becomes like a good business that lasts for three to six months and then it kind of like goes away and maybe like it still is a remainder but like still as a business but it mostly like is a hype cycle whatever and i was like what is going on and so i broke this down into a few categories and i want to go through these categories because i agree with you i think this is so cool and i've tried to break this down so first and these are like uh different ways to say columbus for virality yeah like formulas for food virality okay the first one is make a side ingredient so something that's normally a side ingredient make it the main thing so the best example of this is cookie dough there's a lot there's like this is a thing i saw in new york uh there was a line out a door the door for someone sold cookie dough as if it's ice cream so it's like sprinkled cookie dough then like ice cream flavored cookie dough it was like cookie dough is the main thing another one is cheese like people do like fondues they have like fondue bars something that's uh what else is a side ingredient that could be it i don't know if it's a side ingredient exactly but uh cereal does this too there's there was these like viral things there's like cereal bars all you do is it's just milk and cereal and that's it and you can come normally that's not a restaurant it's a side like it's like literally a side dish of a side dish and they made it the focus of the restaurant and that made the restaurant notable and remarkable for people to talk about and go to or an eye or a whipped cream like a a whipped cream store just like anything that is typically an afterthought that is a topping or a side to the main thing make that your thing okay the second one is doing the have normal foods but different colors a few examples rainbow bagels okay crazy popular they're they're hype i mean they're still popular but they went through a cycle the second one is rainbow rainbow kettle corn that's quite popular when i was a kid i remember a couple times buying green ketchup do you remember green ketchup yeah dude i love green ketchup it was just red ketchup but green right it was literally just the color looks different it's just the name just a normal thing but a different color and then the latest trend on uh uh or this year on tick tock was cloud bread which is basically you know everyone is baking at home now it's just bread that's kind of blue and white and looks like a cloud right and by the way your side thing main thing i got another example of that but you know captain crunch the crunch berries were always just the extra and then they came out with captain just just the berries just the crunch berries it was like way more popular yeah or like lucky charms with only the marshmallows yeah exactly so you you take the thing that's supposed to be the top yeah the topping the second the third string thing make it the first string thing right okay the third one the same thing but a different side uh different size this is pretty common so like huge pizzas that you can't fit through the door huge sundaes they call it like the kitchen sink everything but the kitchen sink in a kitchen sink or or sushi rito is another example have you seen sushi rito that's a chain right yep so it's just sushi that isn't cut so it's just a long piece of sushi uh another one uh i had a friend named seoul you probably know him and he created a kitkat bar that was the size of like a cake he he would make these things and so i've actually never seen this sold but you get the idea a kitkat bar that's that's like a the size of a loaf of bread in san francisco they have this place bob's bob's donuts or bob's whatever yes and they have this humongous donut it's like this donut the size of you know two of my head and uh and you could buy it and then you could try to eat it and you could take pictures of it because you're eating this enormous doughnut boom that's the whole book it's not special but i mean it becomes special it's just a normal thing but a different size okay or like in st louis the whole thing is this is so silly how this works and st louis our pizza is cut into squares right right right so it's around you kind of said one earlier about like sushi sushi sometimes it comes in these like boats or if you go to a beer place and they serve it in a boot or whatever it's like it can also be you know a punch bowl that's in a fish you know fish bowl or whatever yeah like it could be bigger and in a you know in a non non-traditional like the kitchen sink in a non-traditional container yes the same thing but different size okay or it could be miniature you know just something that you know whatever uh like white castle mini cheeseburgers uh okay so the the fourth one combine two things that are quite different okay so i've got a this is a really easy one there's a ton of examples the first one is the crow nut pretty easy right the latest trend right now on tick tock pancake cereal it's i don't even know what it is there's like recipe i don't even know what it is but it's i don't know okay uh look it up actually while we're talking to brayu it's probably it's probably just i i don't know probably pancakes and cereal okay no they uh they bake it they call it pancake cereal it really it's just probably normal cereal made out of like the same ingredients they just bake it at home and it looks like the shape of a pancake same with donut cereal but there's um uh do you know do you remember ramen burger yeah okay so there's ramen burger there's fairy bread you know what fairy bread is no what is that it's basically just bread with sprinkles okay so you're just taking two things that don't normally go together chips and you mash them just like a dessert burger uh right very simple or you can get a a cream cheese bell pepper sandwich right and the more um more unusual it's you know it's doritos locos tacos right it's uh when kfc came out with the fried chicken bun or whatever and i was like the bun is fried chicken um like you know there's the more shocking i would say the better in this case yes you just take two things you smash them together pretty easy relatively simple okay the fourth thing or the fifth thing is you make something that's normally a crappy food but you make it fancy so tater tots mozzarella sticks you add a fancy stick to them or you probably go the opposite way of making something pretty uh fancy and make it not fancy although that would might be gross but you get the idea and then the final one is you uh take um some type of food allergy but this one isn't actually that sexy if you take some type of food you just make something for food allergies so there's banza which is a chickpea pasta there's uh there's uh lou ellen's ice cream i think it's called in brooklyn it's vegan ice cream only vegan ice cream right uh or like oatly is like this right it's milk not made from cows boom this is now so popular that this almost can't go viral anymore but um maybe if you chose some category that's not not typical but it feels like a lot of these are now mainstream um at this point here's what i would do is i would open up this was what i was thinking about do i mean i would never i don't think i would do it but maybe one day i would want to actually it seems pretty fun is i would have a kitchen in new york and i would get it in a really high trafficking high traffic area and i would just every three months try to do a launch where i launched like a rainbow cheesecake or you know i don't even know i'm just making you're just making stuff up and then i would even what i would do is i would mix i would do a ton of stuff and then just post a picture and drive a little bit of traffic to it and see what had the the cheapest cost per click right yeah so so what you're saying is just reuse the hype cycle no embrace that the hype cycle exists and just make a kitchen that's going to rotate every month into a new crazy concoction and people will line up every month to go try the new thing and you'll build your brand as like willy wonka when he would create you know now everlas everlasting gobstoppers or whatever you know like he creates a new a new crazy concoction that you gotta go it goes a step further so do you remember cronut yeah so cronuts got popular in 2013 it was invented by a guy named dominique uh what's his last name i don't know what his last name is but uh a french pastry chef he's like a big name chef um but he made cronut because he likes he was like i just want to have fun and create something new and interesting all the time and this one just kind of hit he actually trademarked the name cronut and he is like a purist he's like an artist so he didn't actually want to license it to people but he easily could have made tens of millions or more by licensing that name to someone and so there's a step further so you create the food and you got to come up with a really cute name and you could actually get a trademark and and there's licensing deals there so i think this is super fascinating i think if someone invested one year of their life to do this and a hundred grand or less they could probably get one or two hits right um which may not be the right thing to do with your life but if that's you if you're like i'm doing it great great good it's definitely fun it seems fun but yeah it'll teach you a lot i think it'll teach you a lot about business and marketing to be able to approach you know food this way um okay so a couple other opportunities i see here so i mentioned i think you know investing or private equity i think will start to scoop up these brands i think that's one opportunity second one is i think somebody could could build a kind of guy fury of instagram food uh character who basically just goes and tries to find the next you know who really does make the absolute best like oatmeal or whatever right like come up with like you know go to every category and then just hunt for the best one ever and then you do the drop on instagram you know for that brand for that for that shop and maybe you you found you know the absolute best philly cheese steak in philly and then you uh you know you dropped that so i think somebody could create that if they were if that's what if they're foodie and that was their thing the other thing is a little more boring which is like we've talked about um cold chain 3pl so basically how the heck do you ship all this stuff um and keep it where it actually tastes good when it arrives you know three to five days later uh across the country how do you how do you make it work and so i think that there's just a bigger a bigger and bigger need for cold chain logistics um and and i think we've we've heard this a few times now and i feel like if somebody's working on that or somebody has one of those i would love to talk to you just to learn because i think this business is booming and i think more and more people are going to go into it okay do you want to hear one more food thing that we could to discuss do you remember as a kid seeing these books i'm pulling them up now called eat this not that no what is that okay so it was awesome i loved it i bought it once just because it was at barnes noble and uh it ended up like being like pretty amazing so google eat this not that it started as one book uh like almost like coffee table-esque book right and on the left side it says eat this and on the right side is not that and so for example um it started as just like a general a general one but then they eventually went to like desserts fast food all types of that all types of stuff like that and an example let's find an example one that i could say so it would say eat this arby's beef cheddar classic 450 calories 20 grams of fat not this arby's roasted turkey ranch sandwich which has 800 calories and so it shows two things that are quite similar and it says eat this one instead of this one right and if i want to say eat a salad don't go to arby's it's saying like if you're at arby's get this one not that one yeah or let's see if like they have like different den different denny's breakfasts or uh like ihop versus denny's or whatever eat this or uh yeah you get the idea right yeah okay it's are you looking at you google it yes it's pretty sick i it's been around since probably 200 uh probably 2002. i mean i think i bought this when i was pretty young um let's see there's a whole half a million followers on instagram which is like i think all these old like kind of publications like either magazines or or little brands like this today they're all just instagram accounts i think that's the way to like reinvent these wow okay so they eat this not cat eat eat this not that as of 2012 had sold eight million copies of the book right and then they spun it up into a magazine and wow it's freaking amazing i'm just pulling this up um here's what i would do right now today if i wanted to get popular on instagram is i would do i would do the same thing just for instagram yeah it's a whole eat this not that uh on instagram totally great and and the format is so good it's just a split screen so it has half the food item on the left and half the food item on the right and then it has the nutrition facts about why why one versus the other i think a lot of this stuff is super shareable on instagram and you would grow very quickly like i can see their instagram right now it looks kind of shitty like they're not doing a great job i think you could basically steal this concept pick a different name and uh grow a big instagram account off this oh yeah i was bored i would do something like this yeah and it's kind of a fun topic uh i'm i'm reading all about it now this is pretty amazing i hadn't thought about this in forever but anyway there you go i think uh uh if you did that for six or six or twelve months you get hundreds of thousands of followers on uh instagram um all right we'll switch off food let's go to something else what do you wanna talk about you want to talk about money real quick tiller money okay yeah what's this i have okay very fascinating do you you what do you use to track your money i don't use anything to track my money i use excel okay everyone says that oh i've talked to uh not everyone but a lot of people here's usually the answer right here i use mint or i use personal capital or i use i have man tia as well and what can i ask you why don't you use mint uh i used mints back in the day i mean i used mint like 10 years ago so it's just kind of like one of those things that i don't have a habit of going and looking at and i don't like looking at uh that stuff because it makes me focus on like you know expenses and saving money here and there and i just don't think that's fun i don't enjoy that so i'll i went and looked at a bunch of subreddits about money uh because i usually use personal capital and i don't like it for a bunch of reasons right now but when i asked like 10 different people how they track their money most who i ask maybe five or six use excel which is kind of crazy to me because how many how many accounts do you have that you need to track over 10 yeah yeah so it doesn't matter if you're wealthy or not wealthy most people like between if they have a wife or a husband you have like your checking account bank account your 401k your stock stuff uh maybe your home loan credit card credit card you probably have two or three credit cards so typically i imagine the average joe has 10 plus so it's actually a lot to track regardless of if you have money and everyone i've noticed or not everyone a lot of people have noticed use excel so i did some research there's this thing and it's not like i've discovered this i think it's pretty popular already called tiller money and all it is the landing page is beautiful but i'm just fascinated by this business all it is is a if you go to google sheets and you click tools and then add-on okay you'll see the ability to add plug-ins to google sheets okay tiller money all it is is a plug-in for google sheets that costs 100 i think it's 100 a year and all it does is it automatically imports your bank accounts and any other account into google sheets and templates that they have or you can just make your own template but i've never seen someone build such a sick and awesome business off of a google sheet add-on it's it's incredibly fascinating yeah this is good i like this um i think this is this of all the like kind of money manager things this appeals to me more because it feels like i'm managing my own money and uh in reality you know the thing i'm always worried about is data like i don't want my data on all these different services like i'm not going to try your new finance app because like i just don't want to link my bank account to all this new stuff but uh if they could do this where this was like self-hosted in some way like it's just a template um that'd be great it doesn't look like that's the case but it is sweet i like it so if you go to google sheets right now and you click add-ons on the top right once you're in a sheet you can see add-ons and i actually just realized i use a few add-ons the other add-on i use is called super metrics which is uh it pulls in data from sql and stuff like that i'm i bet you they do close to eight figures a year in in revenue but uh we've talked about plug-ins for wordpress we've talked about plug-ins for chrome google sheets plugins is another thing that is super super fascinating to me and i completely overlooked it uh it's so neat and so i don't know what else to say other than it's cool so you you had a thing that i thought was kind of interesting that was about open salaries what what is this and do you want to talk about this or or where do you want to go i'll let you lead a little bit but i'll i i it's so funny i'll i'll put stuff in here throughout like two weeks and three days goes past and i'm like wait did i write that or did you write that so all right so we'll do a quick we'll do it quick so so you put this thing on here i got kind of intrigued so you you open salaries what is it uh it's the idea that like today it's kind of crazy that we don't know what other people make and not in a gossip kind of way but it's really you know the company knows what everybody makes but the employees don't know and that actually puts the employees at a pretty big disadvantage you don't know when you're underpaid you don't know if there's any like systemic bias and let's say women or minorities are not getting paid as much as you know tall white males or whatever and so um it's kind of weird that this is this like taboo thing nobody talks about it you're not allowed to talk about it it's seen as kind of a faux pas but it would actually be to the benefit of any employee to know to have transparency at as to what people are getting paid and it can be anonymized but being able to see what what other people at your role at your company are getting paid and so you would put this thing on here that colorado was gonna say that hey from 2021 employers have to disclose pay rates and ranges for job posts um of any job that could be working in colorado including remote jobs which i thought was kind of interesting and then we have companies like buffer and whole foods have been doing this for a while buffer kind of tried to like make a name for themselves by being like the open transparent company we'll share everybody's salary and like literally you can like here's a link you can go and see everybody at buffer's salad whole foods let's do whole foods you can see people's salary uh you put that in there or a braided i don't know i haven't seen that one but i wanted to share a couple interesting things i i found when i was digging into this so first uh check out this spreadsheet of buffer salaries i just put it in the chat so you can click this anybody can google this and find it you can go and you can see that joel the ceo is making 280 thousand dollars this year and you can go see what the what his ea is making she's making 89 000 and you can just go down the whole company roster everybody's salary is public which i think is like pretty insane um but interesting then you have things like the google kind of secret spreadsheets i don't know if you've seen these but at big companies people are starting to like just make an anonymous spreadsheet and say hey put in your salary and your level and your your location here um so we can all like have more transparency you don't have to put your name next to it and um they circulated with inside company so microsoft had one google had one facebook had one and the google one the the so i forgot who was some woman created this and within two days ten thousand people had put in their information and now there's over twenty thousand people in the open google database and you can link can you link to that yeah it's right here um i have it at the bottom um so so so these are kind of cool and um and it's interesting how viral these go so then i was looking at levels.fyi which i know you know about yeah yeah yeah it's a place to go see like you can go and say all right i'm interviewing at amazon and facebook and they they labeled me an l5 software engineer located in bay area like what am i going to get paid how much is or i got an offer i don't know if that was a fair offer or a low offer did they lowball me and so you can go on levels at fyi and it's the same thing crowdsourced information about what you make at these different companies and levels if you look at their traffic they're getting about a million and a half visits a month and like there this thing is really elevated from a side project to something like pretty legit so they have like job boards now if you click at the top they actually have the thing we were talking about last episode a negotiator as a service so if you hit the top it's a sick little website where they have a little calculator that says you know what company where are you located how many years of experience here's what you're getting here's what we think you should get paid based on the levels database which is now in the i don't know tens of thousands of entries or something like that and then they basically say hey if you pay us 500 bucks we'll negotiate your offer for you we have former recruiters from these companies that freelance with us and basically you book a time you talk about your offer and how you're feeling about it and what you what you really want out of this and then we'll negotiate for you and they show all these like success stories of like this person at facebook got 20 000 more than their offer this person got 40 000 more this person got 10 000 more and so they're taking and they just take a flat fee of like whatever 500 600 bucks i think and um so i think there's some interesting stuff going on in this like transparency around what people are making and it really goes and like fits in my values where um i think it's crazy that people don't talk about money more i think it would help everybody if we talked about money more and it would be less like kind of taboo and less uh less like a big deep dark secret if people were more open about it and i think that's right can i give you a counter point for that go for it i thought that that was interesting and i'm not saying how i feel because i'm still thinking about it but leo i forget his name leo but he did it from buffer the co-founder of buffer who no longer works there so buffer started with this whole transparency thing um that was like the whole shtick and it worked out about everything users revenue salaries everything it was it was a stick that got popular amongst bloggers in particular there's this guy named pat and he has this blog called smartpassiveincome.com i used to read it when i was 15 or 16 or 18 something like that in high school and he would make money by creating books and doing a bunch of other side businesses and he would reveal his income every single month and other bloggers copied him and it was a really cool thing john lee dumas did it all these like really cool people did it buffer did it and that was their stick to get popular and it worked because the buffalo buffers product isn't really special it there's so many uh different versions and they did it uh leo uh leo said in an interview someone was like dude this whole transparency thing it's pretty cool like you guys got traffic and everything do you think that it would work and i believe i don't want to quote them because i i saw this a year and a half ago two years ago but something like this works now and it's great for us but i have a feeling when we get to 75 80 90 100 people it's not gonna work anymore and it's actually gonna hurt us big time and i forget exactly why but i believe steve man i'm getting all my names screwed up someone else had apple like a hedgehog apple said something similar he's like no the transparency thing it actually can hurt it hurts the company after a while we tried it and so i actually think that maybe this is good for startups but it kind of sucks after a long time because look let's say you own a small business that does 20 million in sales and you're the business owner and you want to pay yourself three million dollars a year that's pretty shitty then if you're a 50 000 receptionist or something but that's like your right to do that why would you want to share that with everyone yeah as the employer it's not great right buffer used it to get a bunch of traffic because there's it was an effective growth tactic for them hey if we're open about this we'll get a bunch of people asking what the heck is buffer and some of them will use it but uh as the employer it's not great as the employee it's great and so that's it depends kind of which side of the coin are you on also it depends how far you go the buffer thing where they write everybody's name and how much they make bit much but the google thing where it's like hey look there's thousands of employees here i need to know that within my level within my kind of area am i underpaid overpaid or you know somewhere in between um it gives people peace of mind and and it gives them you know an opportunity to get more sort of fairness or equity in terms of being able to negotiate with information information that the other side has that you don't have so i like it from the employee perspective and i think it's but i wouldn't go the buffer way of writing everybody's names down now at a small company cool that kind of happens but i thought that was i think it's kind of cool i think there's definitely interest around this so you know a couple little ideas of things that people could do so levels f dot fyi is cool is working um i'm surprised that somebody like you know our buddy andrew wilkinson doesn't go buy a company like this um it's it's kind of a n of one company it has like a unique data advantage it's in it does job boards which he loves as a business model on top of all this traffic that they're getting and it's kind of like a side project that's probably like you know reach the max of that of which you know the two guys behind it really can take it um the other ways that you could do this i think you could do this in any vertical so i don't know is there a level of fyi in the like hedge fund world or consulting or banking like if you're in those worlds and there isn't a tool like this you should just make the levels that fyi database for your industry nursing i don't know whatever the industry is that this product can work across those um and so i think that's cool even within levels somebody could go further and be like all right i'm going to take product managers or data science and really own that if they were somebody who has a big audience for that like if if that guy lenny um lenny who's got a big blog and kind of audience around product managers he could do this for product management and do it better than levels can generally so i think the levels concept could be exported and done in different areas when we first launched like maybe the first couple months of launching so we didn't have an audience so and i'm saying this so anyone could do it we didn't have an audience um i wrote a post called how much money do founders make because i was trying to figure out like do i pay myself do i not pay myself right whatever and if you google how much money do founders have in their bank account the hustle you might see it and all i did was i took a google form and i posted it on hacker news and it went to number one uh they eventually took it down because i think that goes against their terms of service like i have a survey but i got like three or four hundred replies and i asked people how much money they have in their checking account how much they have in their bank account how much they pay themselves how much do they have in illiquid assets i got 100 and then what their job title is and where they live and i got hundreds of replies and i published all the data and i took out any information where you could like learn about someone and people loved sharing anonymous information and they loved reading anonymous information like they loved like it was amazing and so i agree i think it's pretty sick and it was way oh there it is i bet you posted it uh it was way easier to get people's i'm not like literally getting their information because it's all anonymous but people were so forthcoming with us it was pretty cool and pretty interesting yeah i want somebody to do this with vcs um i think most people don't know how much vcs make and all the different people in the food chain like the gps versus like a partner versus like an associate or whatever and um i feel like somebody should like kind of crack that egg open and be like look here's the here's the numbers here's what it is and anonymize it um but give people some transparency into what what's really going on let's talk about this for a second so there's two companies that come to mind that are interesting to me when we're talking about this the first is pitch book you know what pitch book is yes do you pay for it it's so expensive no my sister-in-law works there though and so every once well she'll she'll be kind enough and let me ask her a question of like to look up uh no i don't pay for it because it's really expensive it's like 25 000 i think yep um so pitch book it's kind of like crunch base but souped up and so you pay 25 grand and you get access to like a lot of information about privately held companies uh the second well let's just talk about pitch book the reason it's interesting is they have a team of outsourced folks i don't know which country they're in but i think the philippines and they literally have like 200 people and and by the way pitchbook is a publicly traded company you can go and read about them they're owned by morningstar so you could actually go and see their operations and how they how they work they're growing like crazy they're have north of 100 million in revenue you can they have a team of folks and what they do is call vcs and they literally just ask them information or they call companies and they just ask them information and for some reason i don't know how or why people give them information and that's one of the ways one of many of ways that they get data the second thing is this uh business called is it called the org is that what it's called yes okay the org very interesting because in a nutshell the tagline is the org transparency starts here build a better organization with a public org chart celebrate your colleagues basically that's just kind of crap let's not let's not read their marketing yeah really what it is i mean i'm sure they do all that nonsense but it's a photo it's an org chart it's a public org chart yeah you pay money and you get access to people's org chart and this helps you know who to email to sell [ __ ] to right exactly uh and that's cool like there's no i don't know why they don't just say that but they've raised a lot of money like i think tens of millions of dollars it's probably gonna be a monster business and so i would do two things with the salary thing one i would actually hire people in the philippines or whatever and just hit it hard and just go out and hit it hard and i would trust that a lot of people would be actually pretty pretty transparent uh and the second thing is i would pay wallet kind of like the org and i would sell this to every hr uh department in the country so i have a friend that is doing this with shopify sales i showed him a way to roughly estimate how much a not roughly it's pretty good estimate how much how many how much sales a shopify store is doing and um what is that what can i get you don't have to save it true is it because you order from them and you see what the order number is that's one of the ways yeah and that's one of the best ways and so i showed him i said look this is this is useful people want to know what their competitors are doing and the second way is you look at the traffic uh yeah you still need a couple other pieces of information for example you need to know how much the average order is and things like that but um but roughly that that will tell you uh you know how they're doing and so now he emails me a report every month that shows me you know these four companies that i decided uh hey i want to track these four companies and emails we report this is their sales this is their social media following this is how many ads that they're running on facebook and um one other thing which is just like the month over month changes uh between those and i think it's a great idea so he was kind of looking for something to do i told him look i think this is a good pivot uh i don't know exactly how well he's doing i should really shout out the name but i kind of don't remember let me look it up while we're doing this how did you find this person he was in my mastermind let me see what his thing is called it's called okay dramatic pause let me figure it out and you came up with the uh with the uh i told him i was like look uh because he was like dude i'm good with data i'm interested in this kind of stuff um but i also like you know i also have a team in the philippines and um you know so so i really like this okay so here it is so the the website is shopsalesdata.com and uh i hope he gets a bunch more customers from this i hope he's still doing it um he still emails me my report i hope he's taking more customers right now but it's a monthly report of shopify competitor data in your inbox every month for 100 or something like that yeah this is great i mean you could do the same with um facebook ad accounts just like because facebook shows everyone their ads you can say you know email me my competitors ads every time they launch a new one exactly and so i think that there's like there's some good stuff in this kind of like data data-based businesses where you're just collecting data from public sources you're cleaning it up you're structuring it and then you're offering it as a service to a bunch of other companies okay you want to do a mini one do we have a mini one uh yeah let's do a quick one what else we got um do you have anything good of like your first week working at a real job it is was my first week and now it's in my second week and i'm sitting on a beach in hawaii uh so working doing it having a job rocks i should have done this years ago i love having a job um it's cool man hubspot announced that they had a billion dollars in revenue like uh run rate it's pretty amazing and so there's like two things this is like my first like real job uh or like a corporate job um i mean that's not exactly true like i would have friends like my friend neville who is like a works for himself he would be like hey you want to go hang out on a wednesday like at noon i'm like no dude i have a job like right so i treat like running my company it was 100 more more than a job it's two jobs yeah it's more than it's i would call it a nine to five i'm like yeah like i'm it was in fact way more than nine to five but i was like i'm like pretty straight like i get to work at nine i do my thing like anyway so i i tease about this but yeah first like corporate job um it's it's gonna slow down but like the amount of meetings is pretty crazy and i told them i'm not doing meetings like this anymore um because i'm gonna make stuff but i don't know how it's still crazy to me how people find time to get the actual work done yeah i uh i realized how that works which is just that managers don't get work done managers just go to meetings and then ics or individual contributors as they're known are the ones who actually like sit down and do work because they don't have you know back-to-back meetings throughout the day but i think even like your work is basically just communicating between people but my seven days of working has shown me that even ics have a lot of meeting yeah like they should they shouldn't they should not have that many they should have like whatever one or two or three a day but uh they should have like you know somewhere between three and five hours of uninterrupted time yeah like so is that a like i just don't understand how people so like i'm telling everyone that husband i'm like you don't no one talked to me for these hours i had i like like and i'm like this is i and i and i say i say it nicely of course but i say uh i'm doing this for the better of everyone like i'm gonna make good stuff so like let me go up my hole and you just just don't bother me all right what's been the worst part so far the meetings let's be um okay what what what me with the meetings boring or just the amount of them the amount and also like i didn't know what workday is and all this stuff there's just so much paperwork that i've always had people do for me that i'm having to do um what's the worst part uh you know like everyone's like is having a boss weird because i've never had a boss before no i think it's gonna suck after a while of course like having a boss might suck i'm so pumped i don't have to like i get to just shovel [ __ ] onto karen's plate that i don't like i'm like hey you know should we hire this person like i don't have to make that decision i love that i love that i think it's awesome um so having a boss has not sucked so far um i don't know what do you think would be the worst parts and i'll tell you if they are what was your worst part there are certain meeting types that you have to do that i just found like completely soul sucking one of them was called a calibration meeting it's basically like uh even just describing it you know gives me some pain here basically it's like you're trying to promote people but how do you know like if every manager has their own criteria for promotions how do you make sure you're promoting people equally and fairly throughout the company so you have to do these things called calibration meetings or you sit down and you basically say this person's up for promotion or they get they're getting promoted because of this this and this and then other person says well you know i i felt like they weren't uh they weren't great at this or they didn't do a great job with that project and you have to kind of defend them for me it was boring on two levels one first and foremost i didn't know anyone else in the company so i just sat there for three hours not being able to say anything because i didn't interact with any of these people i just got here i just got bought i don't know these people i can't give any input nor do i have any opinion on if the feedback is valid or not and the second thing i was just like wow even after all this talk like i still just feel like the person who's the most uh vocal and best salesperson is getting their way and the person who's not that great at talking is not getting their way so like we could have just skipped all this like it would have almost been better had we not gone into this room and said you sell your person and you sell your person and you debate this person it's like the better debater wins in big companies and i think that that's like really crazy well i think we do at our company all the time which is like if it will say i'll like if a meeting says for 30 minutes and and like in the meeting i'm like okay i said what i had to say i don't need to be here anymore i'm leaving or like it's very it wasn't considered rude to be like hey uh you need to leave now you're done uh it was like kind of a helpful thing and i'm still trying to figure out how to politely do that here i'm like do you guys need me here can i can i leave right or or i'll just say i'm out i've said what i need to say i've heard what i need to hear you guys can talk yeah um especially on zoom or whatever you just sort of like you hold up you wave and you click exit the second thing is hubspot is doing really well and just the software business and this sounds like just like like obvious stuff from anyone who's in software but i've never been at a company like this man if you figure out how to get a hav if you figure out how to reduce your churn to very little or or even positive so for every dollar someone spends it's above one dollar the next year um and you pick a big enough market it's just magical like just now i understand why people are saying like oh you know why is this company valued so high highly it's like well because sticky revenue software revenue so something like i don't know if hubspot would be considered this but something for sure where you're building an entire business off of the and you know that the switching costs are quite high um it's pretty amazing like software like just start a software company it's so much better than everything else like it's really hard and it's slog early on but if it really truly if you can get your churn to be right and you pick a big enough market it's just and you have a and you can figure out how to have a good marking machine which all this is like oh yeah if only you could do that like i know but like you can kind of figure it out actually i think giving it up if you if you give yourself like five years to figure it out i think you can um well i think all the things you're saying are true and they really just point to this one lesson i've learned the hard way over and over again which is it's much more important to pick what game you play than to try to be the best player at a game because if you pick the wrong game even becoming the best player still ends up in a small outcome or a really painful path but if you pick the right game to play and whether you become the best or not even the best but you know just kind of the top 25 percent um it's just so much better to win that way and in this case like we've if we've we talk about and we've done different types of businesses right we've done like i did social network i try to make a new social network it's the wrong [ __ ] game to play dude it's so hard um so hard so it's a low chance of probability of success you did a media business also hard hard you know higher odds of success but like lower size of the price if you get it right way lower size um ecom you know just a [ __ ] pain in the ass just tons of headaches all the time with your supply chain and logistics because you get real world products and you have to like ship them all around the world and you're gonna have customers who have returns and like things that just like are not as easy as software and so like we've and you know we talk about all these different you know doing a paid newsletter or whatever like there's all these different models and for my money by far the best one is to build a software business because a software business can scale a software business can like be improved over time and you know unlike e-commerce when you when you make a crappy e-commerce product uh you know you go make a better version the next you know it takes you six months to make it and then you make it and all those old customers who got the bad products still think you suck whereas with software you push the update and all of a sudden every single customer has the new best thing you know there's all these just tiny advantages and um software is the way to go but we i want to say something that david siegel so we had david siegel on last time he had a billion dollar or close to billion dollar t business and i go david why are you doing brick and mortar stores when he could be doing software and he said the right thing what did he say he was like oh it's fun i love selling product and i was like that's the best answer that is a wonderful answer and i think that like will i ever be able to start an enterprise software company i think that if i was going to it would either have to be very soon or even a few years ago like you i would you have to do it i think when you're like really like where money's the one number one thing it's like i got to get paid i got to get my hit and um in that case yeah i would do anything to make money but where i am now and where i think where a lot of people are is you really it's f it's i agree with everything you said but you have to add the and also not like passionate about but what what what excites you enough to that you're willing to get good at it over a decade right we'll flout your boat all right so let's take you okay uh you're happy at hubspot everything's great you're gonna be there for for 20 years we know that alternate reality you know we all know you're happy to hub spot you'll be there for two decades it's great uh it's you know sunshine and rainbows let's say alternate reality they fire you tomorrow you're gonna go build something else um where do you think you would go build would you do what you're would you go media would you go something totally different would you go software what do you think you would do everyone's gonna laugh at me because i say trucking but i would do some maybe something something in the agriculture space yeah i think ag tech is is ag tech is interesting uh i think that's the most interesting i had a great call with this guy who i'm gonna um we gotta have this guy in the podcast his name's uh uh his son's name is jordan i can't uh rob uh van trump it's called the van trump report so van trump report it's this guy who has a newsletter that does 20 million dollars a year in subscription revenue he's the only writer and he was telling me all about ag tech do you know what act tech stands for yeah agricultural tech and he was just saying all types of like what's going on and i think working with like middle america people who whether they're rich or not they're more humble and they create things that actually impact the world like get food to you i would do something in that space or i would start another media company but okay let's say you go into ag tech or and you're probably gonna be open and whatever you know you'll think of it then but knowing what you know now would you do media in agriculture would you do uh you know something with actual farms and logistics would you do technology hard you know trucking actual self-driving trucks would you do uh a job thing would you what would you what model would you be wanting to do in that space well okay so i don't like this question because it will change every single day you ask me but as of right now i would start a blog with in the ad tech space and then eventually i would turn it into a database kind of i like this this company the org uh i think i could create something like a database that's better um and yeah that's what i would do okay so nice i think that's what i would do as of right now that that fascinates me or i would create um do you know what tiger 21 is isn't that like a like a kind of a conference or club or mastermind thing or something it's like a club for people who have investable assets north of 10 million dollars and it costs 30 grand a year it's and they have like a thousand people who are subscribed and uh my friend joined and i looked at the back end and it was horrible and i was like oh i'm just going to clone that and what do they do with the with the members is it events or is it uh it's like both but like they create like um like little like safe communities where like you meet in groups of 10 and you kind of show off your portfolio and people criticize you and like try to def make you defend your position so you get better but it got bought by private equity so it makes a lot of money all right that's cool i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road less travel never looking back

In the late 1990s, the US government brought an antitrust case against Microsoft. The tech giant was accused of forcing PC manufacturers to pre-install Internet Explorer, cutting off competition from other web browsers (e.g., Netscape).  

The case produced hours of deposition video showing famed lawyer David Boies questioning Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. 

Trends analyst Trung Phan went through hours of this footage to uncover lessons from Bill Gates’ experience. 

In this episode of Hustle Hot Takes, he distills his findings into 5 anti-antitrust tips. 

These are timeless lessons for any high-flying tech CEO facing antitrust questions.

Hustle Hot Takes #2

Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a "short shorts" merch drop over the July long weekend. According to Trung Phan (@TrungTPhan), this is the perfect meme. And, in a hat tip to Musk, this video explaining why is 489 seconds long (420 + 69 = 489 seconds = 8 mins 9 secs). 

The "short shorts" meme is a culmination of many of Musk's most popular memes: 

*Merch drops (e.g., flamethrower, Boring hat)
*Trolling short sellers 
*Tesla car models spelling "sexy" (S3XY)
*The number 420
*The number 69

In the trading week since that announcement, $TSLA is up nearly 30% and Musk has surpassed Warren Buffet's net worth. While correlation obviously doesn't mean causation, the entire episode is a reminder that Musk is a meme God without peer.

yo what up episode 2 apostle hotcakes we're bringing back the ruffle and flowered hoodie popular okay so episode 2 we're gonna be talking about Elon Musk if you're gonna do hotcakes you gotta talk musk and today's episode is gonna be talking about the short first tweet which is Jess in might be squeeze but first of all let's talk about what is going on with Tesla and there's a lot so this time last year ExxonMobil the oil and gas guy Tesla today Tesla is worth 250 billion dollars excellent think about this look at this one that's Tesla that is mine Tesla was an eighth of the minds blown unfortunately okay anyways let's not talk about how fun rich I am let's talk about Elon Musk tweet from last week he tweeted out that he's selling limited edition short shorts and this is something that's been in the works for a while and we were gonna go through exactly what has led to these short shorts he sat in the short shorts when you go to the website is absolutely hysterical so you can read here is you can run like the winner in teen like liberace with our satin and gold design so actually on the back of these shorts it's supposed on se XY sexy and Ivonne musk has always joked that he named his cardomom s3 next why does he want to spout sexy sure enough that's what he's done let me explain to you why I think this is the greatest mini so it interviewed Yvonne tweeted that who controls the memes controls in universe and I mean this is just factually true if you control memes you control mind share and mind share as Leo sent an interception that's everything once you're in the brain there's you're once an idea has taken hold in the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate so you are loved because entire life is kind of me and I'm gonna walk you through why these short shorts might be the greatest ever so specifically what I'm gonna touch on are the shirts themselves the word short and the price tag that he put on the shorts 69-420 and I think I can convince you that this is like a mega mystery so let's talk about the shorts themselves for the uninitiated in investing in the stock market when you want to bet against the stock you sure dit so you should sell it I'm not gonna talk to the mechanics and what that means but just know that shorting the stock is betting against it and now Tesla is one of the most shorted stocks in the market and even though he doesn't deliver the profits you would expect from a typical car company he stole his stock price just keeps going up and up and up as I showed with excellent example the most famous short seller has been David I'd be former building there keep that in mind he runs a fun green light capital and in 2018 he compared has the two Lehman Brothers which was the investment bank that went bankrupt and ultimately precipitated the great financial crisis so what's so funny about the Einhorn situation when I'm home was a very vocal short seller of Tesla and musk was very well aware of this but musk had a good time with so we turn on the Einhorn actually the least must car and he came up to these bloomberg reported it of course when humoured reports this Elon the mean master is going to jump on it have a good time look at the first response here it's Elon Musk and he says tragic I will send irony box of short shorts to comfort him through this difficult time and this is where it gets really good that was an empty promise you won't actually reached out to chubbies the apparel company and they tweet a new out street on it fam and they prepared the box for short shorts and if you're thinking to yourself oh there's no chance that even I don't actually receive this package you would be mistaken so here's Dave Einhorn tweeting that he received shorts but he has also since then fallen out of the Billy ring so that kind of wraps up the short part of this short short name and now I want to talk about the 69 420 the price that you and how he has previously hinted at those names in the past which are incredible first let's talk for 20 in internet meme them for 20 refers to April 20th which is national weed smoking big but two years ago woody not must tweet it about the number 420 it was in reference to taking Tesla right at four hundred twenty dollars a share he said that funding was secured and that this share price was at a significant premium to the existing public stock market price so this obviously moved the stock quite significantly but it turns out you can't actually make these statements if they're not true and Elon ended up paying twenty million dollars to the Security and Exchange Commission Tesla also had she had said that Elon misled the markets now if you're thinking to yourself you know this is honest mistake maybe you own just a little bit excited and he had fundamentals around the number 420 that is just not true it turns out that Elon pick the number 420 in reference to the 420 meme and he did it to impress his singer or a musical artist girlfriend Grimes I want you to think about that for a second youhad must ended up paying 40 million along with Tesla for what was accenting inside pool on internet now that's the 420 part of the 69 420 price tag you hug wondering okay before funny part I get that that makes a lot of sense that tweet was pretty famous what does 69 have to do Elon Musk here's a little bit of detective work to identify why 69 matters that you don't musk other than the fact that's 69 it's just a hilarious internet Nene thing so Elon Musk was born on June 28th and 420 member we've just referred to national lead smoking is actually April 20th so if you actually calculate tell me these there are between those two dates you're gonna come to a pretty funny number sure enough the number is 69 there are 69 days between 4/20 and Elon Musk birthday June 28th and if you think this is just a coincidence I found that evil musk is not aware up let me point you to this tweet do I even have to read this I'm not reading it this is so good okay so what does this all mean means if you control the memes you control the universe and Elon clearly does you can see from this chart up productive times down first off Tesla is up the next day and just from my end as a student of you on this video is 489 second which is 420 + 69 and I'm just doing that out of respect for you thank you I'm student you are the meme God short shorts for everyone if you enjoyed this video please leave some comments below subscribe and now watch Elon Musk ask you to stop its mr. short shorts [Music]

you wouldn't believe it I mean you know a suit of armor $64,000 Rolex watch it was like incredibly rare tons of really expensive jul 2013 10 has created a monopoly around selling people's lost luggage how do you hear about this and tell us a little bit about it soare founder Sam actually came across this company he likes to research weird business models and kind of boring companies that are doing interesting things in the middle of nowhere this tiny company out in Scottsboro Alabama called Unclaimed Baggage they kind of have a monopoly on this market where they have strict they've stricking exclusive deals with almost every major airline in America and they essentially buy baggage that the airlines aren't able to find the owner of and they sell this baggage in a massive 40,000 square foot warehouse and yeah you find some pretty weird stuff there you find some pretty weird stuff you've got like pages and pages now they have like an online presence so people can actually go online and buy all kinds of things that people have lost unbeknownst to them their luggage is being sold out from under them and they probably don't even know that it is it's out there still which is probably yeah and takes off a lot of people but to be fair though the so the airlines do try really hard to reconnect the luggage with their owners I know they they have all these crazy matching software systems they use and in the end only a tiny fraction of baggage isn't actually able to be reconnected with with its owner I think it's something like point three percent of all luggage in America but you know understandably you know it is kind of a contentious thing too because they're they're selling really personalized from people suitcases and they have a process when a suitcase comes into the store they have a team that kind of goes through it and filters out anything that might be inappropriate or that they can't resell so they actually only end up selling about a third of the stuff that is in these suitcases the other two-thirds either gets thrown out or donated so don't don't tell us everything but give us a little teaser of some of the crazy things that that this this company has found and sold yeah you wouldn't believe it I mean they you know a suit of armor $64,000 Rolex watch it was like incredibly rare tons of really expensive jul 23 sinja larrya that people just never claimed that compact frogs in a suitcase the original original prop of the character hoggle from the movie labyrinth which is like this weird goblin character or whatever it is probably get slammed in the comments for getting that wrong live rattlesnakes in a duffel bag all kinds of very weird stuff that we'll get into in the article very cool no there's also weapons and all kinds of stuff like NASA products and yeah so yeah they not only sell suitcases but they sell they buy unclaimed cargo which can be anything like Freight cargo can be government property and you know stuff also stuff that's left in the overhead bins musical instruments skis surfboards really anything anything that people fly with is very hand for themselves and is the stuff reasonably priced and we looked online is to get a sense of what what they're selling you what they sell oh that yeah I think you know some customers have claimed that things are anywhere from like 20 to 80% below what you would pay somewhere else and it seemed you know from glancing at their their online inventory it seems their prices are pretty fair I think the real value out is you just you find one-off things that are probably pretty hard to find sometimes like that $64,000 watch I mentioned you know I think some some gentleman actually came in the store and ended up getting it for 35 grams so he he got a pretty sweet deal on that watch it was probably a you know it's a rare Rolex that he probably couldn't find anywhere else so it's kind of like eBay in a sense that you you get these really strange unique one-off items that you can't really sell anywhere else it's kind of like kind of like the world's best you know pawn shop or some tank without the bonding that's great well it's a another little subculture that you dive into that I can't wait to share with readers so make sure you guys open it up on Sunday thanks for joining the sack yeah see you guys on Sunday [Music]

it's like you know Martin Luther King's one of my heroes but he also cheated on his wife a lot I was saying I talked to this lady I met her at a conference and she worked for Google but or like big thing inside of Google what's called Google Labs or something where they'll do like a hundred million in revenue or something but they're like it's too small like it won't move the needle they just really yeah that's surprising I'm I don't believe that I'd love to hear which ones of these projects that they had got to do she told me that uh she's like it's like we don't know how big it can get so we're just gonna kill it and she also said that they had a hard time finding leaders because the people who they would have were people who had started companies in the past and they just paid them so much at Google that they were like like I don't go right here yeah there's a pretty cool story about have you heard about the Cisco spin-out spin in model no so so a lot of companies try to do these like innovation labs innovation arms innovation blah blah blah you know just a lot of it's just like kind of PR puff but the companies genuinely they do want to innovate right why would they not but it's really hard for them and Cisco is one of the few companies that's done this really well where they have incubated and they do what they call spin out spin in multiple businesses that have been worth over a billion dollars to Cisco and so I was like how the hell did I do that and what they have is they have this little group of I think for people who have now since left but they're this group of four that were there for god knows how many years fifteen twenty years something like that and they called them some nickname I don't know I'm gonna make it up called the M group or something like that it's at the em team and what they would do is they'd have some idea or they would you did that team would have an idea or the company would have an idea and they would spin out to this group so they were their own company they would get their own little office they would build this product they would they would build it up and Cisco would have the right to just rebuy it for like five hundred million dollars whenever they're ready whenever whatever they view it's ready and so there's a whole bunch of so that same team did this three or four times that same group of four or five people they went out built the thing spun back in and they did it again and again and now they've actually left and the that group of people I think they're just doing their own thing but if you want to look it up I should have looked it up before this but I didn't know we were gonna talk about it but who's on that cat table I think it's just those four people and Cisco itself or something like that I don't know how I don't know it's like works starting companies with a buyer in mind with well you are though you have the right to buy I have the right to buy back VC I forget who it was and he's like I don't really I typically don't invest in companies when they like havoc and exit plan in mine like because I want them to because I think that then they're not in it for the right reasons but he goes he goes one time I did do that I invested in this guy and he said this company is gonna buy us probably in 36 months because we're gonna build something they can't build and I'm gonna operate faster them and end up becoming true right all right so here's the article Business Insider article why cisco showered these three men with billions and of course it's like behind a paywall but the basis do we know them frame somebody Mario Missoula and now we I don't know them they're older they're all older they're not sort of I don't think they're in sort of like the same scene that we we roll in but but yeah it worked for a while and then now they they stopped doing it I think some companies have tried to replicate it but it hasn't worked for them I'm not sure exactly why but you know if you could figure out how to help big companies innovate there's obviously a lot of money to be had there so um before we get into this I gotta ask the listeners and you something so Jack our friend Jack Smith introduced me to this guy a few years ago and I don't even want to say with the services yeah but babe okay I think I could say a little bit there's a ride-sharing service one of the ride-sharing services and what this guy does is he had I think this is how he does it I don't exactly know but you can buy discounted credits right you know how I paid 20 bucks and I get $40 worth of rides have you done it so he showed it to me years ago all right this is like I don't know how long two years ago maybe he said it to us and I was like oh great I take rides all the time would love to then as I went through the website I was like is this like us a is this a scam I don't think so because Jack said he's doing any recommended it I've done it but then I was like is this gonna get my account banned like this is too good to be true so my skepticism went off iced I didn't do it I forgot about it and then he post about it in the you know private my first million Facebook group he said hey did you guys know about this is a really cool clever hacking system that this guy's created Jack loves those things that's tell me more about what's got your high here yeah so first of all Sean turn your mic up just a little bit I think yeah say something hold on just a little right abraao he's got to turn it up a little bit and put it okay I turned it up is that better much better okay so he asked his service now he's doing it for similar things and okay so Jack was like hey you should have this guy on the podcast and I'm like okay so pros this guy is a hustler he's doing amazing stuff and I'm pretty sure I think he's either said it or I figured it out I'm pretty sure the way he does it this guy's in India I think what he does is he has a network I'm like thousands of teenagers and kids and he just gives them a first ride on on on a ride service and he gets the $10 back like in referral and then sells it either that he's gaming the exists it's not as far as I understand it's not like illegal there's no like sort of illicit hacking everything he just says hey they have a referral system which is cool you get a you know every time you refer somebody to get certain amount of credits and what he realizes he can do cheaper maybe shorter rides in India and that will count as a new customer that's been referred and so he can give you in the u.s. you know your full credit for a lightweight right there and the arbitrage there's some money he keeps some money and we get a saving and then the ride the person who takes the ride he gets a free ride so it's like a win-win-win for everybody but the service and to add to complexity if you with Bitcoin you get a bigger discount and if you like do XYZ like it's it's it looks incredibly shady long story short it's interesting it's a cool story it's definitely it's not a scam but it's questionable about the ethics and so do we want to promote this or not um yeah of course I stopped promoting it I am interested in this guy's story and I think a lot of people be interested in it you can make your own judgement after you hear them out as to for promoting unethical behavior yeah but people call you for whatever I I don't think we're promoting anything it's one thing okay it's promoting if we say this is awesome go do this okay that's fair but that's an opinion right but I think the right thing to do is to say hey here's somebody who's doing something interesting they are they found a way to hustle and create you know create a business for themselves as well as value for others we should hear them out and then let people judge for themselves is this like past the gray area and not not cool for them or is this actually like you know fine and so I think I think that's we should leave that up to the listener but our job is to tell the story and also I'm curious so why not have a mom who cares a journalist alright well uh he's met he message to unite well we'll set it up I don't even know if he speaks English well enough I guess we'll find out right yeah we'll find out we'll bring him on so I had some other of these these are more like actual scams but I wanted to talk about them I don't know why I wanted to just tell you some things that I've seen okay so recently I don't know if you've seen on YouTube or if it's just in my recommendations but all day every day there's a live stream of shamov poly Hypatia who's kind of like a known investor early Facebook guy billionaire it's like Chamath talking about bitcoin and it has always like 40 50 thousand live viewers watching it at any given time and it says bitcoin giveaway Jamaa fit coin giveaway and what they did so what someone's doing which is just totally a scam they have a stream going they have a video embedded of Chi Minh talking about Bitcoin from like five years ago it's not Tremont's doing this by the way he's trying to get a cook and then on the screen it says Bitcoin giveaway send me your address and I'll send Bitcoin to somebody and I think they're just making money off the ad revenue of this live stream and it has like 40 50 thousand people I'm sure some of that spot traffic and some of it is real traffic but it's hilarious that somebody's doing this like a what a waste of time and B it's hilarious that YouTube allows this tomas trying to take it down but okay so that's one little thing I noticed here's another one you know when the US government came out with the kind of PPP like hey if you're unemployed or you're an employer and you have people you can get access to money so of course the Nigerian sort of scammers came out and they actually took out a hundred million dollars from the system I don't know if you heard about this they just filed as either unemployed people or or employers of unemployed people or sorry employers who pay the sort of Nigerian scam ring it's only what's it's called the 409 scam I think it's called is that the name of the program is that like the country code of so a lot of these guys are based on a Lagos Nigeria I think and I think and I believe that they're there because for some reason it's part of I don't know how it got embedded into that particular culture where they're where they it became a thing but I think I also think that there's a not really strict laws around like there's a lot of loopholes in law that you can not get punished so this guy totally scammed are these these group of people scammed out a hundred million dollars out of the government yeah the u.s. government well the US government was giving away money for like in a really intense two week three week frenzy abreu just linked some guy in from Wikipedia Emmanuel mudiay I don't know how you say his name but he sold an airport for 240 million dollars he didn't own this Airport which is crazy so there's that and that here's some other ones that I thought were interesting so you know super PACs like the political fundraising thing which sort of like gets around the normal donation limits for yeah it's like a it's like a it's like they like form a company or a fun and give money to the fund and that funds allowed to donate a larger larger quantity of money right so they're super PACs for every cause so my my friend who's my friend Jason had this hilarious idea he didn't do this but he was just like he's very politically minded and he hated super PACs cuz he's like oh god like it's the super PACs who get behind let's say the gun lobby or whoever that like fund these things that I don't agree with necessarily and I just think super PACs are kind of shady there's lack of transparency blah blah and then he sort of had this idea of like if you can't beat him join him so he was like I know what I'll do and I thought this is a hilarious idea he's like for every issue I'm just gonna spin up to super PACs one taking each side and I'm just gonna raise all the money again for both sides and I'm gonna take a cut for every issue he's like until they shut that super PACs and I thought that was a hilarious way to fight super PACs didn't uh do you remember at founders dojo where I used to work out of it was like this office that was kind of like Erlich Bachman on the TV show Silicon Valley I think Dave did something like this where he created a a donation thing who was running Trump versus Oba Trump versus Hillary and he created like D like created something where he was like pledged support to Hillary and then he also had a pledge of support for okay yeah exactly there's all kinds of crazy stuff I don't know I don't know why I needed to bring up a bunch of fake scams what what's wealthiest person who you know who got money off of like a shady way I gotta think about that do you have one I don't know if this is shady but I have a bunch of friends that have made a lot of money like 30 40 50 million dollars off of what I consider to be borderline unethical internet marketing practices like for example who have run call centers like you know how you get a phone call from like Marriott hotels it's not really from area it's like or you know if you I knew a guy who had a company hold on it's not really for Marriott and then what I don't know how the scam works so I get the calls all the time but they'll say like you know you won this you won like it's basically they're selling you travel packages it's like you were picked from a random drawing to get a discount on a all exclusive trip to sandals so that's not unethical it's just obnoxious and then I know a guy who made a bunch of money off a CO registration company so like when you sign up on Expedia they sell your email address to 18 other travel stuff and he was the middleman and he made like 50 million dollars embed it all on in the stock market in one big okay the closest the first thing that came to mind or the closest thing that came on I don't actually know this person but I you know no no the guy's kid and and this is the dad so there's guide intervene Jane who oh I know him CEO of this thing called InfoSpace back in the day and it like during the.com boom InfoSpace was like you know riding high and then you know sort of overnight InfoSpace crashes but he had sort of sold out or you know protected his own interest right before the crash and was like you know everybody lost their jobs in their 401ks and the company and this guy was like a billionaire and so that was sort of shady and then he started this thing called intelligent I think that's the name of it yeah and it had a similar outcome yeah Telly's is this like shady thing where you would sign up for a free credit check I think or it's like back you find information from public records about people or about yourself I don't remember exactly what the what the product was cuz I don't spend too much time you know like think about the stuff but basically there was this tiny checkbox at the bottom which was like cool you got this free credit check but then we're gonna charge you 20 bucks a month just kind of on subscription after that for blah blah some [ __ ] and so they were making millions and millions of dollars and people were all like wait what am i get I just paid like two hundred dollars this year for Intel yes what does that mean what is this and people kind of screenshotted the flow and showed how like you know size for font the the fine print was that you're gonna get charged for this thing and so that was pretty bad yeah that guy claims to be a billionaire yeah exactly he's a pretty like kind of crazy charismatic guy he's now got this like company that's about going to the moon like a rockets company and all kinds of stuff but he's definitely you know behind that smile there's definitely like some skeletons or some baggage like you know neither of those two two stories InfoSpace or I think it's called int Elias neither of those seemed like the most up-and-up companies well let's talk about some legit companies right after our podcast Monday I went and bought a car you committed I love it if anything take-take-take inspiration from the massive immediate action that that Sam and hopefully may take whenever we say we're gonna do something we just go commit and just do it right away yeah I uh like I made the decision Saturday I bought a car Monday I just went like I showed up to buy the car and I was like yeah I guess I'll take that one and they're like how do you want to pay for it house like oh I shouldn't even think about it and they just took a debit card right okay so so let's do some other companies or some other ideas that you got what else you got otherwise I have a couple we can do we did a ton of research that we didn't even get to last time so once you I pull I have our sheet up why don't you kick it off alright so I'll do one so this one actually comes also from Jack so this is sort of the Jack episode he's the guest but we don't have him here so he was talking a little bit about baseball cards and I know baseball cards are hot right now cuz Gary Vee he's been really pumping baseball cards and talk about baseball cards all and so baseball cards are like a collector's item they hunt they have value they appreciate overtime it's you know like many many goods of that kind now one thing that's a common problem for people who are buying selling and trading baseball cards is the actual receiving of that you know you receive a shipment you have to open it up you hope it's not damaged you have to verify that it's real and then if you sell it you got a sort of go through that whole shipping process right back to the other person hope that nothing goes wrong in the process and so for people who are collecting these as a sort of financial asset in some ways and they don't they're not like sitting there trying to carry them with them to school or something like that you don't need the physical card he was saying why is there not sort of a central repository where you can like a like a safety deposit a Fort Knox for for the baseball cards where basically you buy and sell it online but it never moves it just sort of exchanges ownership but it's all stored in this central vault where it's cooled properly so they don't degrade they're all verified by a professional there who is centrally located you don't have to deal with any of the shipping costs or potential issues there so I see the headline to you the Fort Knox of baseball cards yes I think is a pretty clever idea and obviously could extend to sneakers could extend to art could extend to other things maybe there's something that like this that exists I don't do baseball cards or art do you dabble with any of this stuff um I got into shoes after I learned about him we wrote about it on trends of about a year ago and I've since gotten into them yeah but not to the point of wanting to make money off of it but to the point of like spending $300 on a pair but I did do research on this and it seems as though there's not a great solution so Jack's on to something we wrote about this actually heritage auction house what I would do if I wanted to create this which I actually think this is a wonderful idea I don't I don't I certainly don't have time so I'm not going to but this is a great idea and what I would maybe do is contact a lot of the auction houses and be like what are you guys doing now right what why can't this work and or collectors you know high-end collectors people who have a portfolio of these things because I think it is a very small it's a small it's a nice community obviously dismembers leaves you think well just that's like a depends on your reference point right so it's like in all of society yeah it's super nice but in terms like how many people do you think are actively investing in or trading baseball cards right like is it in the tens of thousands people I'm saying like potential customers you have to convince to use your service hundreds of thousands hundreds okay that's it well I would I would bet it's lower like and the reason why is like for there's always a long tail of really casual people but of people who actively do it and have like some you know above let's call it $200 worth of value locked in it you know like Shopify has like 50,000 ish or it did two years ago when I looked at this maybe it's a hundred thousand now power sellers Etsy sort of in that same range twitch has like in be fifty thousand ish partners sorry I don't think there's a hundred thousand sellers I think that there's a hundred thousand people who are interested in transacting in this market right right and so I think you could get I think my point is that the kind of circle of influence is pretty tight here where the number of people you would need to convince and that you could go learn from to see if this is a real problem it's kind of small and that's great it's like kind of like online poker where you just go get these fifteen pros to do something and now they sway the rest of the casual community with them as like oh yeah that's the best practice that's how we do things now it's pretty interesting and I love it and I like its I wonder I would have to imagine this has significantly better economics or maybe not in storage so do you know how the companies like clutter are doing I always assume that those companies are on the verge of failure now I don't know if they because and I think Omni actually it's like everything's going great we keep raising money we keep adding high-profile people and we shut down like that's how these companies tend to go or they they break out you know but you know that public storage you know the company public storage is huge yeah it's the most profitable company on the stock market is that right by cool claim is that my margin so it like does four billion in revenue and like two billion in net income interesting yeah it's like the most profitable thing now they don't do what they don't do all this high cost [ __ ] that all the new startups do or they like want to bring you your stuff they just say like here's a room bring my stuff it's yours give us $100 a month [Music] but it could be a it's a really cool idea I that's my point and so also other thing I'm sure a lot of people know this but I was ignorant I didn't know this but these storage companies the real estate businesses yes but it's just a it's just a way to get profit to buy real estate a great book I read when I was in college that inspired me I was like on the verge of going down the real estate track rather than an entrepreneurial track or the sort of started B track and it's called confessions of a real estate entrepreneur it's an awesome book if you're a total newb and you're just curious about how the hell do people make money it's not about the terms and the tactics and all that stuff it's this one guy being like I wanted to make it real estate so then so he's like my first deal I had no money and I found this warehouse and then it negotiated this and he just walks through deal by deals for like ten deals of confessions of a real estate entrepreneur and one of them was about storage and you know the whole game with real estate is you sort of need to see value where others don't so other people look at this twenty five thousand square foot store warehouse and they say ok warehouses are valued at X dollars per square foot so this building is worth at why and what you need to say is hey if I subdivided this warehouse it's just tiny storage units and I add it all up now it's worth you know X plus y dollars per square foot is more it's worth more so I can go buy it I can actually pay more than that I next to me cuz I'm gonna I know I can get more value out of it than that person can because I know how to change use or add value in some way that's what we work did they took office floors and say hey what if he subdivided it and rented this out by the desk and so that's like a common real estate strategy that's what storage units are and if anyone listening to this I think some people will get mad at me I don't give a [ __ ] real estate has the highest ratio of rich and dumb people like right how do you what you what I'm saying wearily what you're saying it's got the highest ratio of low IQ rich people this very doesn't mean if you do real estate you're like here it means there are more wealthy people in real estate who are not superstar geniuses who you know work them storm'll working people like a normal smart rational person who obviously had some skills took some risks but there are more wealthy people in real estate that way if you just said hey Sean you know in the next 10 years you die if you don't get wealthy I'd be like cool go into real estate like that's my best path my highest likelihood chance of becoming wealthy is through real estate versus any other sort of venture yeah it's the highest the highest dumb people to rich people job I've ever seen in my life I love it ok so that's my that's that's Jack's Jack's idea which is sort of Fort Knox for baseball cards I like it what else we got um let's go to uh we're gonna talk about hey did we talk about hey I don't think we did we didn't go for it ok by the way this look at what I'm drinking here I drink these all day Heineken zero point zero it's called Heineken zero it's not nine out it's not the same it's not alcoholic beer it's zero alcohol beer I've been drinking these all day they're awesome wait what do you mean it's not the same as non-alcoholic difference I don't know the legality but the I drink a lot of non-alcoholic beer because I like beer the normal non alcoholic beer says it has less than 0.5% alcohol this has zero point zero and Heineken said that this is their fastest-growing category and you like it I love it I drink I'll drink for a day so what's in it that makes it taste it does it taste like beer or it tastes like something else it's a it's a they call it a malt and yeast beverage it's a unique recipe it has 0% alcohol is brewed with pure malt and special a yeast just like the original Heineken lager beer it has the same taste but without the alcohol that's hilarious they sell the same product with without the expensive ingredient in charge the same for it like here well let's give you less ingredients water malted barley hop extract and natural flavor that's all it is so oh man I love these I drink my crazy they're awesome okay we apparently we did talk about hay a little bit but what did you want to talk about uh I just wanted to sort of call out the the sort of marketing side of things of what they do so have you read the book rework which is there the 37signals book years ago but they basically say that like one of the marketing principles that they talked about is like to have an enemy right yeah I think there's a chapter called pick a fight and I want to read it so let me see if I can pull it up real quick hold on to give you two seconds and I don't know if you do this but I do it all but here's the here's the like summary of the thing okay so should I should have pulled I should have pulled up my book before I did this hold on okay so here's a section of it if you think a competitor sucks say so when you do that you'll find others who agree with you and rally to your side being the anti blank is a great way to differentiate yourself and attract followers for example Dunkin Donuts position itself as the anti Starbucks it it's ads mock Starbucks for using you know these fake Italian words you know instead of just saying small medium large or they'll do a campaign like they made a site called Dunkin beat Starbucks com where visitors can send e-cards with statements like friends don't let friends drink Starbucks howdy is another example it takes on the old guard of car manufacturers it puts old and old luxury brands like rolls-royce and Mercedes on notice by touting how it's a fresh alternative Apple jabs at Microsoft with ads that compare Mac and PC owners etc etc all these examples show the power and direction you can gain by having a target in your sights who do you want to take a shot at you can even pit yourself as the opponent of an entire industry Dyson Airblade starts with the premise that the hand-dryer industry itself is a failure and it tells and then positions to help as a faster more hygienic option I can't believe it's not butter puts in puts the enemy right in its own name having an enemy gives you a great story to tell your customers taking a stand always stands out people get stoked by conflict they take sides passions are ignited it's a good way to get people to take notice what do you think picking an enemy yeah I'm down I right now my enemies New York Times a little bit and basically the media and people journalists who say they don't have a bias button like they can't admit they do so yeah I'm down with that and with hey calm I call it hey calm I think it's working well I think that um so they picked who I think initially they picked just traditional email like Gmail as the enemy for being like cluttered you just keep getting spammed by random things email you don't want it's a headache you know now wait for the Apple and now they picked Apple and it was a way better fight to pick because it's a more novel story and it doesn't seem as self-serving as when they pick Gmail is the competitor and I like that I actually like these guys a lot and so I'm gonna talk [ __ ] about him a little bit but in general I really like them and I respect them but I do think that it's a little lame what they like some of these moves are a little bit lame because they also pick a fight with like main main mainstream startups about giving equity when they're like make millions if these guys probably make 10 million 15 million a year in profit and they're very very wealthy and I feel like it's a little hypocritical so they on Twitter people are calling this beef marketing so just have a beef with everybody just to keep keeping your keep your name relevant and there's always gonna be some people that agree with your side of the story so for example against the startup industry they are anti VC don't take funding be profitable which is weird because they've taken funding from Jeff Bezos right but on the whole they they don't play this or they are profitable and they don't play these sort of Raisa ABCDE like sort of get big big big IPO so they picked that fight they picked the fight of you don't need to work 80 hours a week 30s enough be productive just be smart don't kill yourself you don't have to be working the other day that they are working through the weekend resolve all the issues right but I'm saying in general they've I'm not saying these are correct I'm saying these are the fights that they they easily trigger people just like they triggered you just now then there's then they also do like they take summers off which is part of their kind of like don't be a workaholic thing and they have one more which is sort of like don't depend on any platform so like don't be don't be dependent on anybody and these funny I get in and I like a lot of their philosophy I just think it's stupid what do you make rules you don't I mean like when you make rules around something it's like dude not everything has a rule like a lot of time like you can't say that you are anti VC I'm not anti VC at all right I'm just like Pro like let's be logical and let's look at a variety of options right but that doesn't sell right so so if you just looked at it in terms of like if they if you just said they're doing all of this for marketing purposes if you if you believe that to be true then what they've done is incredibly effective it's sort of like buffer right maybe you don't agree that you should transparently put all your company salaries and revenue and losses out there publicly but if you looked at like marketing has been undeniably effective marketing the company no I'm on board I think look it's working for them I just think that some of their opinions are [ __ ] but I like them a lot and I think that it's incredibly effective for them so why don't you pick more fights that was kind of my takeaway when I saw this I feel like you guys could do way more of this I think we should and so like you can't plan right now so I just picked a fight with the guy today did you see my Twitter no I didn't what is it hold on one second economy yeah okay I'm looking at your Twitter right now so you picked a fight with this 2vd vld why it's about the person yeah so what is this tell me what happened my landing page they copy drugs completely and I just they're full of [ __ ] and I emailed them and tell them to [ __ ] off and they like try to justify it I'm like no you're lying like I just looked you up a web archive you just copied our page like I see when we launched and then when you launch you write word for word ripped us off that's okay so you picked a fight with them but that's actually uh if you look at like what the rules are of this game that's actually a bad fight you don't pick by example littler than you you got exactly well you said New York Times so first I was thinking cuz you guys have as a competitor like morning brew right so like they pretty similar pretty they're kind of similar size and that's one that could be more like PewDiePie versity series where the feud actually would help both sides grow so that's more like wrestling where you could be like cool I'm gonna take you you attack me this is just gonna generate a bunch of buzz it's sort of like that barstool color daddy thing where it's like both sides end up more popular and through the through the drama so that's one that I think you guys could do the other one would be more like against the mainstream mainstream media which could be New York Times now there has to be some level of authenticity to it so it's got to be something you genuinely do you believe like it could be the thing that like why are you guys pretending like you're not biased but that doesn't tell a great story about you guys and what you do it's not like you guys are like it's not that the value prop of the Hustle is to be opinionated clearly and be subjective not even try to be objective I don't think that's like what y'all do so yeah I think you got to pick a fight that a makes sense B is polarizing and C somehow tells the story of what also is all about by being the opposite of the thing you're hating on I thought about making front of the skin because I think they're like a joke but then I was like I don't know if I would win that fight yeah I don't know I think there's something here because I think in general you do have strong opinions about things but I don't see that come through via the hustle maybe intentionally maybe you've censored it maybe you haven't but I think no I'm not censorship how about this let me let me let me a small tangent something that I'm we're testing and I'm thinking about launching is I'm pretty obsessed with the idea of expert opinion as opposed to journalist opinion and one thing I'm testing is I built this network of like a thousand experts and every day we're emailing them stories and getting their opinion and we're gonna just publish their opinion we're not gonna touch it when I couldn't edit it we're just gonna say here's a guy see what they said right and that's interesting to me and I'm gonna get people to pay money for it yeah I think that's actually pretty dope private Twitter I saw the like mock-up you guys did I didn't love that but I love the idea of this because when I think about it this actually what I care about I care about what do the people who actually know their [ __ ] think about this and not the journalists with their opinion the editor with their agenda the journalists talking to an expert and then like siphoning off one quote and having that be you know that fitting into some narrative I just like let's say it's the like right now the NBA is about to resume and there's a big debate should they come back or should they not come back some of the players don't want to come back because of coronavirus some of the players don't to come back because it takes away from the black lives matter movement and there's all these ESPN Talking Heads that talk about this like there's literally this guy Brian Windhorse who's like you know the opposite of a basketball player he's like a short fat white guy who's never played basketball and he's always talking about what should happen what shouldn't happen and I'd rather just be like cool the the ping goes out to all the NBA players and here's the 80 responses we got back LeBron said this I don't know if is anonymized or if it's with their name but would be way more interesting to me it's like here's what they actually think yeah so that's what I'm thinking about building or that's what we're attempting to build and and in that case the enemy to me is clear it's just like journalism as a whole journalism because yeah what do you think about it like we don't need you a little bit phone is a journalist and I hate when here I I hate the fact that journalists journalism is a circle jerk on Twitter like they only want to impress each other they don't want to impress their audiences like you have to like what I tell our team I'm like guys we don't serve each other we serve our readers like we are their waiters we are their servants we exist to give them information and my team who has worked at a variety of places are like well that's so different than other places because it's all about how do we win awards or how do we do this for that and I'm like yeah that baffles me that that is the thing so that's our enemy for that yeah okay I like that I think that could be good cool pick a fight I like I have another random idea or thing to talk about so we both like this comedian Chris D'Elia and he was funny guy we thought he was great the bad I'll speak for myself yeah I don't know I don't know you felt but we thought he was hilarious whatever he's a comedian I thought he was the best I've seen him live a couple times and I listened to his podcast a bunch that's one of the few podcasts I listened to anyways last week gets exposed as sort of like a creep and so a bunch of people come out and say hey of course D'Elia was messaging me when I was you know 17 16 years old and asking me for nude pictures and all asbestos right so whole bunch people come out at once turns out Chris D'Elia is creeping around or allegedly creeping around and so this comes out he's sort of getting cancelled right now so two questions for you our question for you what was your reaction when that happened and then I have an idea based on that my reaction was if I was even bummed that he was accused and the evidence was damn strong prions oh I believe it to be true and in my head I think well [ __ ] you like you're here the worse so I feel pissed off because I I was a huge huge huge fan and I I don't know I'll still listen to his jokes but I will not like support him financially yes that was my other question well if you're listening to him you're still supporting him in some way I guess no but I don't know if I would pay money to go see him right so that's got my other question is and nobody really talks about this it's sort of like cool I'm a fan or you're cancelled but I think in reality you know as so many people this is you know two of my favorite comedians Louie CK and Chris D'Elia both came out to be doing really creepy messed up behavior but there's also people who are clearly still fans of Lucy kay they're probably not fans of what he did but they're still fans of him though so listen to his stuff they'll go to his shows and I was wondering how do you deal with that kind of like being torn between like well you don't like what they did and maybe you don't even like the person but you kind of like their art you know like I don't know people still feel like so like you know yeah I still watch The Cosby Show I listened to our Kelly I love Michael Jackson music here's my logic right here's here with great people people who achieve greatness who are like world-class at the crafts are nine out of ten times [ __ ] weird and hopefully only weird sometimes they're also bad people right and I just accept that like the people who I like are also good there's a great quote where it says like every great man's a bad man and in this case it is incredibly true we're like he's with all this great stuff he just has also done a ton of bad [ __ ] so I still like will absolutely listen to his stuff but I won't I think he's a piece of [ __ ] right isn't that weird that's I'm sort of in the same boat I don't know how to feel is that's why I brought it up cuz I'm not weird I mean if you like surely like there's some like like I don't know I don't even like it in political but maybe like chicken like chick-fil-a it's like dude my taste buds don't know that you hate gays right right right oh it's like I couldn't it's hard you know I could I could disagree with you I would still enjoy your stuff right yeah and I think I mean with with all with all that's coming out everybody's gonna have to figure out how they're gonna deal with this because your favorite something musician athlete comedian politician one of your favorites is gonna go down for being a total either [ __ ] creep criminal bad guy you know something's gonna come out and I think everybody have to ask themselves cool how am I gonna deal with that am I gonna still consume their stuff that I like or am I gonna protest it am I gonna think they're a piece of [ __ ] am I gonna be conflicted what's gonna happen it's like it's like you know Martin Luther King's one of my heroes but he also cheated on his wife a lot right oh that's like the rumor um so it's like what heard about that's really crazy apparently I just learned about this but like the FBI was tracking him for a while because he was seen as sort of like a potential enemy of the state and they like bugged his hotel rooms or whatever there's reportedly no one's seen this I guess but it's there's reportedly tapes of him sleeping with like 40 different women you know outside of his marriage and participating and you know some sort of sexually deviant activities but he's Martin Luther [ __ ] King right he's got like you know a day a day named after him and everything else yeah so that's what my opinion is just like everyone who's great is also bad in another person's perspective and you just you just got to take the whole person right okay so the idea I had off this was actually a WikiLeaks for creeps because one of the things that was really disturbing that came out of this was not just oh this guy I thought was cool light turns out to be not so cool and I don't like what he did it was like a lot of these text messages were from like 10 plus years ago and so and same thing with like a lot of people that get canceled like the Bill Cosby stuff a lot of that stuff I think what's happening like in that 90s or something like that and it takes sometimes decades for the stuff to come out and I think that's a shame because you know a the person sort of gets away with it and continues to harm other people or sort of you know be you know a menace in society is out on the loose as long as these things stay secret but I understand why people don't expose things and they get tied up and wrapped up in it and you know you can see the girls who came out and said something about Chris D'Elia their Twitter they're getting attacked by his fans who are like you know well why'd you why'd you send him the picture and like stupid stuff like that and so I think there needs to be sort of a WikiLeaks for creeps where there is a there is a way to dump anonymously evidence and claims against people and then there needs to be some sort of like verifying function like a set of journalists kind of like the people who went and studied the Panama papers and like dug into me to try to figure out which what's real what's not but like a guaranteed sort of anonymity layer so that you know information can get out faster what do you think of that as long as there's a trustworthy third party to verify I've been to it it's just so easy to accuse people of doing bad stuff totally and that's the reason this can't be a company cuz you'll just die of sort of libel and slander you know like because anything that turns out not to be true you get to get sued out of existence I think there was like a there was an app that used to rape guys I think it's called Lola or Lala I remember that this I remember that I my roommate was rated on it and it said like not just cheated on me and like small dick I was like oh dude that sucks like I'm sorry so yeah like I think you can't really do this as a company but I think for society it would be good if there's a way for people to be able to come forward about bad behavior better for a whistleblower network to come forward and not just about like how WikiLeaks is about sort of documents around certain things but actually around you know racism sexual harassment things like that I think there needs to be something like this obviously I haven't put a lot of thought into this I'm not an expert about the stuff but when I saw this ten years to come out I'm like something's broken yeah it is crazy that like Hannibal Buress joked about that Bill Cosby thing in his joke with something like what everyone knows this everyone knows this guy Harvey Weinstein everybody knew that like everyone we all talked about this we all know this it's like whoa what I didn't know this this is crazy like I wish I would have I agree with that I also think that there's a lot of room to deconstruct Wikipedia I think Wikipedia is I I'm like I wouldn't say I'm a hardcore libertarian but I'm libertarian or I tend to be on a lot of topics and I think that Wikipedia should actually the nonprofit or some type of like owned by the government and should be a good national treasure that yet the Department of Education should just own Wikipedia and fund it through yeah what does the brain look up the Department of Education funding and I bet that would cover you know ease easily what Wikipedia needs to stay around and it's doing a hell of a lot more than the Department of Education probably is will compete already and it might see a non-profit but I want to make sure it never goes out of business I think that Wikipedia is a treasure it's same with wicket I'm like reddit don't make money you don't need to make money well you just asked to put a little donation thing and just let us see your expenses and I'll just give you a little bit and everyone will it's like one of the few things where I'm like donation or government funding is the way to go right on okay I want to give people in the last four minutes oh my god Department of Education 68 billion in funding yeah they could afford to how much you think Wikipedia I don't even know I mean if you're if you have five billion page views a month how much will they say on their thing we need this much to survive I don't know what it is but it's like it's not work I don't think it's above two billion I don't think I don't even know later that what do you think twitch costs to run like I can't say okay if I heard just for the hosting like I'm ignorant I know nothing does it cost more than 10 million do you think it would cost more than 10 million a month yes can't say about twitch but I would just say I'm sorry Wikipedia you think Wikipedia cost 110 million dollars a month just in hosting I think it's probably about that that'd be my guess so they do $200 a year the AWS could just fund it okay this is powered by AWS it could be on every page powered by AWS free hosting that way Wikipedia's fundings around a hundred million year there it is okay so I let's give him one more idea before we go because we talked about a bunch of random topics today okay business idea so I just got my new house and I'm renting this place and as part of it you need renter's insurance and something like oh [ __ ] here's a task I don't want to go do yeah go get lemonade yeah I gotta go do whatever but I was thinking about it I was like in the guy who's telling me I need renter's insurance is the broker the agent who like rented me the house and I was like why isn't this just part of the lease where like you're like hey by the way check this box because you need renter's insurance to just do it through me and you have your register sure it's done and so obviously this guy's not an insurance company but what I think you could do is create a back office insurance company or the storefront is actually just all the rental agents and brokers that already are talking to the customer just signed the deal they're the ones trying to enforce these terms and force you to have insurance why aren't they empowered so I'll give you an example of this I have a buddy named guy gal great name [ __ ] top five name guy gal guy gal is his name that's great and guy has this company yeah Rhys I believe is the name of the company and what he does is he's like hey you know all these when you go to sell a house and the sign goes up and it's like Coldwell Banker or like yeah whatever KP homes or whatever it is it's like oh is the brokerage name and then like the agent is kind of like a very secondary footer thing he's like dude the the world is shifting where the agents really want their own brand upfront the agents are the one who go do the marketing to sales so what he did was he's like he goat and the broker takes a huge fee so when an agent gets their fee I think the broker should take 50% and so he's like look through technology I can make a more streamlined brokerage and what I could do is I can be a hit in back-office for any agent so you're the agent your name is Alex you know Alex from Perot well you could just be the wrong pero group and you could build your brand as the as the storefront forget Coldwell Banker you don't need those guys I will be the the back-office I'll take care of the legal compliance and paperwork that the brokerage normally does and I will only charge you X percent fee and it's much less than the fifty percent that goes ask you a call ball banker does Kalb a bigger does it but they are the back-office but they put their brand first and a broker can't Riedel I kind of put their own marketing front on top but it's not their core model and they take a huge cut so what this guy did what he did with rise is really smart he he targeted the top 1% of agents in every market he goes to them he said you're at top 1% you don't need Coldwell Banker you are the brand and he said bring your book of business to me I'll do the same work that they do for you with the lower cut and I'm gonna look you push a button your website gets split up automatically I'll take care of all your sort of technology needs and I take fifteen percent isn't fifty percent or whatever it is and so I think it's really smart model he's doing really was he doing I can't say but the company's doing well and I think it's a really smart model attacking a very big space which is this back-end brokerage thing for home sales I think you could do the same thing for insurance I think you could build an invisible insurance company and have the brokers or the agents be the storefront and just say hey you should just offer this to all your clients when they rent from you or buy from you but why wouldn't lemonade or all of these companies go to those guys and do this they could I don't know maybe they maybe they will I'm not sure but I know that compass kind of did this in the real estate space I know that there's this awesome company I really wanted to invest in called what is it called damn I forget the name but there's somebody doing this for business insurance where they where they're trying to be a back office as a service I've seen that I think there's more that I think there's more companies that can do this that are not doing this today where you empower the agent who is already at the point of sale and you give them a thing to upsell that gives them a little bit of money and it makes your customer acquisition free and you just need to provide the backend service for it so I think there's a whole class of businesses like this yeah I need to go and research all this I'm this in this interests me a lot I'm gonna go look up well banker I believe I see their signs don't even what they do entirely yeah deep dive it and deep dive compass cuz they kind of disrupted the family crush it all right I gotta run my computer battery's at 1% by the way Michael Bisping oh I Bri abrazos compass is BS Michael Bisping what's to come on the podcast you want um yes alone please be it'd be great down I'm gonna shut my computer I gotta go see you [Music] [Applause] [Music]

you know I think I've changed my mind I think that investing is [ __ ] stupid we had a friend is raising a fund right now you know I think I've changed my mind I think that investing is [ __ ] stupid I would have bet a thousand dollars you're gonna say stupid I would have been wrong cuz he's so [ __ ] stupid but like why is investing stupid I would love to hear why investing is stupid tell me if I am being like just a baby here and like but it's just like I just find this like financial arbitrage [ __ ] to be so boring and like meaningless okay and I watch the TV show billions and I'm like oh that's cool like they're doing all those big things it looks exciting and then I'm like well those guys are losers like they're not actually adding to I mean they're just they're wealthy and they're accomplishing dreams so I respect it but I also I'm like oh my god that's so soulless and that's what I think like a lot of like I've got friends that create these websites that like they're already wealthy and they're building these websites that are like they're just Hawking [ __ ] and they will admit that they are I'm like the [ __ ] the point of this and that's kind of what a lot of investing is but the friends Hawking [ __ ] that's different than investing right that's just like selling some degree for money right it's fun it's definitely from a similar yeah it's just like why like I like if you're already can if you already have a little bit of cash which if you're still trying to get your hair you know go go you got to go for it but if you already got a little bit of cash like do something cool and meaning so ok so here's here's I'll give you two to thoughts on this okay the first is an example that supports your case and then I'll give you the feel-good reason why you're wrong so the support your case so I mentor this guy who's 20 years old and he's at this point where like he tried to do some stuff I kind of didn't work out and now he's like [ __ ] do I need to go get a job I need to pay my bills I don't want to go move back home with my parents and so he's like he's like about to take this job and he's like should I you know leave this entrepreneurial path and go get a job because I you know I need to pay bills in two months and I don't think I can spin something up in the next 60 days that will get so profitable that I'll be I know I'll be able to pay my rent and I said you know I empathize with the problem but I said you know let's just slow down for saying before you go take that consulting job let's just let's just talk things through for a second so I said how much money do you need to live every month what's your burn rate two grand two grand fantastic and I was like so let's say you wanted a year of runway to go try some [ __ ] you need to come up with 12 months times 2 grand maybe to come up with 24 grand I said I know you do some investing in the stock market you're kind of a degenerate you know you like to pick stocks the attractive like Bitcoin and [ __ ] I was like because at the beginning of the conversation he's like you know am I good the thing that's going well is my investments have done well the things going bad is about to have to take this job for my my bills like well those two things don't add up I was like I was like do you have enough money in the stock market right now that you could just sell and you could use to live off of to chase your entrepreneurial dreams he's like yeah I could but then I'd have to sell and I don't want to sell cuz I'm getting you know good returns I said okay let's do the math real quick what do you think you could generate per let's take just a twenty four thousand that you mean I don't know how much what do you have you don't have to tell me let's take the twenty four thousand that you need how much do you think you could generate per year in return average he's like fifty percent I was like ok Minnie Warren Buffett you think you could do 50 percent a year but let's let's assume you're delusional number is correct and that you could do it consistently which is the hard part you could do it for one year for sure but consistently generate 50 percent so let's say you you do the Warren Buffett you you invest perfectly you get your 50% way above market return and you're 24 grand has turned into 36 grand now like fantastic congratulations you made $12,000 like you are still nowhere near where you're trying to get with your goals and if you and how many years would you have to continue to get this absurd return for you to be where your goals are I was like not that many but that would never happen you would never happen right you never get to 50% so anyways I was like you're you're talking about this year going and trading all your time for money at a consulting gig when instead you could just sell some of your stock get 24 grand of runway and you could live for 12 months and give yourself a bunch of shots on goal to try to build something that you believe in and you'll learn way more you'll have way more fun and you'll have way more upside than if you go take the consulting job so like you're crazy so he was of the mindset of well I heard that rich people invest so I want to invest and I want to get return I want my money to work for money he had kind of heard all these things and was in was investing for that reason so I think investing doesn't make sense when you have very little amount of capital overall and you're trying to go invest that capital and then you're trading your time for four dollars in other ways now the other so that's the argument for times when I think investing would be stupid is when you know if you take a normal return the amount of money that you're making every month is not every year is not gonna change your life and you're locking up money in the stable what's the second point cuz I think the second points gonna be better than the first point the first point that you made was that well only of us if you got a lot yeah exactly if you if you don't have a lot I'd rather you use that money if you're entrepreneurial if you're one of the five 5% of people who actually want to build a business or do something on their own you're better served investing in yourself and investing and buying your time back yeah and and and going taking a bunch of shots uncle now the second is is investing stupid well I think you're kind of right that it is not the most exciting thing but excitement is different for everybody but here's the cool way of thinking about investing like for anything to work you need leverage right so you were on the hustle but day to day you write zero emails probably you don't write the daily email you don't do the trends report this podcast is the most active thing you do for the Hustle is that correct it we could say yes for a sake of argument okay so first sake of argument your your argument is correct I'm leverage so your leverage because you got a bunch of humans doing work for you cool another form of leverage is media so people are gonna let we're gonna stalk for one hour and then this is gonna get listened to for hundreds of thousands of hours out there so media is another form of leverage and then the last one is capital capitals another form of leverage and so here's the cool way of thinking about it which is if you have capital investing is your way of allocating capital to things that are either a gonna return the most or be gonna like change the world in a way that you care about and so capital is your way of influencing the way that the world goes because you get to assign units of energy to different companies and causes that are that are gonna go do do do I get that I think that's a great point I think that with the what I'm completely burnt out of it's just lame-ass investments what's a lame-ass investment like you don't have to use a name if you want to kind of code name something like I've got a friend that gave a lot of money to some like an investor who's gonna buy a bunch of multifamily real estate and it's simply a like I've don't ever see this I don't touch it like that this is a 7% yes simply an asset class and it's just a thing on a spreadsheet and I'm like oh my god that's so boring like that like I just I can't decide if I'm being a little like [ __ ] hater or yeah but my or like when I have we have some friends who are buying companies and they just look for anything that like checks the boxes of does net churn this and is the acquisition cost this and that's it that's all I mean like mechanical yeah yeah and I get it and I'm like all right that's a great way to make money but it's just like so [ __ ] lame sometimes I'm like oh my god you guys like can you like can we please do something exciting so okay so here's the here's the rub okay let's say you don't invest you're gonna either a park cash and on the side and do nothing with it probably lamer than investing in it and having the cash grow or be you're gonna what's the what's door number see so what else would you what do what would you prefer to do with your capital besides invest or leave it in cash either start companies and even if that means I don't run them or that's investing yeah I'm not saying investing using I'm using investing because I can't think of a better word no investing is cool I mean investing is great but I'm just saying like arbitrage is again starting a company is arbitrage but I think you understand what I'm saying yeah I get where you're coming from I don't know I I just I just hit me last week where I'm like oh my god this is I don't want to talk about a carry fee ever again or I go like this is just so [ __ ] lame when like you see like like I think it happened when I was traveling I'm like I just see these normal ask people at the gas station and they're with their wives and kids and like they'd like I would I'm Way more fascinated by just make that person just a little bit happier or a little bit better not like how do I eat gout a little more profit out of this service do you thing I'm like it's like I saw these I remember be at this gas station and I saw this mom give her kid like a like generic coke and I was like like help this mother like Oh either afford or learn that this thing or that thing is now is like how can we help her make a better decision may be a better decision easy not how do I get five per second I think I actually understand what you're saying now which is it's not that investing is stupid it's not that putting money in some place and getting a return is stupid what you are starting to get annoyed over or tired of is the amount of the amount of your mental energy that goes towards thinking about how to reproductive devote mental energy and not we're just money go it's kind of like I get that money you gotta do something with the money might as well put in a place that's gonna grow might as well fund a company that's gonna do something but it's about mentally spending cycles thinking about how do I get 7% verse 8% versa tax-efficient 9% versus just mentally spending those same cycles thinking about something else if I kept reading a book talking to a person building something cool writing a song whatever it's gonna be is that is that more accurate yeah just like get out of this financial arbitrage circle-jerk and actually make a difference and have an exciting wonderful life you I vote myself and others I'm with you on that I'm with you on that I catch myself doing that all the time where I'm like how many hours is my brain spending on you know in this financial game and there's some so amount that's correct but it's very easy to slip into more than more than what you need more than what's adding value I love that TV show billions and I'm like oh man like Bobby ox raw rod this powerful billionaire guy he's going to war versus other people that's [ __ ] awesome I love that yeah he's an alpha and I'm like but he's also just a jerk-off who's just trying to like squeeze pennies out of this thing at that thing and it's complete nonsense right you know I mean yeah I think you know I think what also happens is important which is in your 20s you're trying to figure out what you like twenties in many ways about feeding ego it's like whether you're partying trying to make friends trying to date people trying to you know get your get your name on the map in you know your career or your industry I feel like a lot of people including myself their twenties are spent feeding the ego and then your 30s are spent figuring out that okay my ego is either full or it will never be full and I actually want to feed the soul in some kind of way actually become more conscious of how I spend my time and my energy and and then there's this constant push and pull of like maybe I just want to make a bunch of money like maybe I'm not ambitious enough well I think you can over money focus and there's like these debates that I have my head I sounds like you do too I think you could do both and I think that I guess the point is I'm beginning to realize I love the builders more than the alligators like yeah yeah yeah exhibit [ __ ] a builders over alligators all day okay yeah good that's a good that's a good way to end the podcast you [Music]

this was just like to me such a cool clever idea I couldn't find like their revenue I didn't have a chance to check but you can go on the site and it's like to call again I've been trying to find what are these deductions how do they work do I do I qualify now interesting market that I saw so my my father-in-law was like yeah you know with solar I was like I don't want a building he's like yeah if you own real estate you know you can depreciate the real estate you can do solar I was like I don't own a building so what do you want me to do here he's like well you know technically you could buy the solar for another building and lease it to them and then you write off your hole in your capex or whatever and so what I found was there's this business so if you ever notice there's a long way of saying never notice when you drive by schools that schools all have solar panels on top now and so if you see in California especially you go everyw middle school high school is just got solar panels all along the roof and the way this works I found out was companies like Chevron and Exxon or whoever they want so they want tax credits and so what they do is they go to the school say hey we will buy solar for your school and they buy solar panels for the school it becomes a tax write-off to them the school leases it from Chevron and so Chevron gets a monthly payment from the school and the school gets lower utilities without ever taking a dollar out of its pocket so I thought this is very interesting and it sort of I don't know much about this yet and so I may I'm gonna dig into this but it seems like there's a there's a business to be had for basically pairing up schools churches other types of entities that want solar they want a lower utility bill they don't have the money to invest to do this whole infrastructure thing and businesses which are looking for tax write-offs and just make it where you push a button the project happens and you receive your paperwork that says here's your deduction and here's your income stream coming from the lease so I think there's a business to be built basically pairing up the two sides of the marketplace a physical building like a school or whatever that needs that wants solar it doesn't to pay any money he doesn't to do any work and a company that's looking for tax write-offs that that's willing to go give that school solar in exchange for the tax write-off love it I'm gonna tell you something even some very similar as well and this is in the same vein of half very half-baked 10% baked 1% begged most highway medians and government property or public property has grass and the reason it the reason it has grass as grass is the cheapest way to cover land okay but grass is actually incredibly expensive to upkeep like if you're in a median you have to mow it like the way that the math works out it's something like I forget the exact there's there's math behind us but and then plus having to mow it and water it and do all this stuff it's incredibly expensive and in LA I have to remember the numbers but in LA I think that like 20 or 30 percent of all water went to watering lawns right and so what they did was they tested this out and they gave turf to their residents they just gave it away they go here right bull here will do it for you yeah and it reduced water usage a significant amount and I started thinking about it I'm like that's kind of interesting what if you just went to the government and you're like I'm we're just gonna let's let's just turf all the all the medians in America right and I cuz I heard that NPR they did this whole this whole this whole thing they're like about how bad grass is and I was like that's pretty amazing I gotta look into this and I have not looked into it so this I sound like there's a idiot this whole episode but let me give you one more okay so here's okay here's the general theme of these really random ass topics we're talking about is when you look around the world and is what I'm now training my brain to do when you look around the world and you see some item or object or patch of grass just think to yourself how did this get here and what you realize is there is a business underneath every single thing like this is what going back to when we said you know in offices you got that poster about like the kind of HR hazards or whatever like the super stupid labor law poster you have to in your office I think it's a huge business that's a heel is this I was blind to this right I just saw this poster I didn't ask how it got there I didn't ask why it had to be there why every office has this but whoever asked that question realized there's an opportunity here and they started laminating these posters making fifty million dollars a year giving you this annual poster that you have to update in your office so that's the the test for the for the listener is start to look at the world and say how did this get here who wanted this here what is the economics of this again oftentimes the that that's a good great point Shawn a lot of times when people they don't think about that stuff and it what if you dug deep a lot of times you could realize that there was some bureaucratic decision that was a horrible decision right yeah and there could be opportunity could be a totally so a lot of times there's like a scrappy entrepreneur who comes up with something cool like that side business other times it's like well why did you guys decide to like make the screws five inches instead of six inches it's like because like the six on the keyboard was worn out right right alright so here's another example of these like hidden in plain sight businesses all right you go to a you go to a airport you take a flight you go to baggage claim okay cool night nine times out of ten your bags there now the other ten times out of the out of a hundred or whatever you know your bag is lost and they recover it but there still ends up being this point three percent of luggage that's never claimed and point three so it goes to ninety-nine point seven percent of luggage I believe is gets claimed and so point three percent of luggage is just unclaimed baggage so I saw this business called unclaimed baggage what they have done is they went and they partnered with every airline and they said to we will take the unclaimed baggage because they have some protocol like I don't know what it's like after 21 days if no one claims it now we're just stuck with this and somebody was like hey that is not that's a suitcase and that's some stuff inside yeah so they were like David seen the 16 minutes episode on this it was like I'm not serious Alabama Birmingham Alabama I believe your play there based somewhere random it's the yeah they have a physical store in where's yeah Alabama Scottsboro Alabama yeah I know this company well I love it so you can go to their website unclaimed baggage calm it's there's things as the nation's only retailer of lost luggage that caught my eye anytime you say only that means I locked up an exclusive on this I'm so happy that I can be the only player which means I'm gonna extract a lot of value here so what they do is they donate a bunch of stuff that they get into bags to charities cool there's a feel-good component to this they take orphaned bags and they recycle them they sell them or they donate them and those three combined or a business and so this was just like to me such a cool clever idea I couldn't find like their revenue I didn't have a chance to check but you can go on the site and it's like to call again unclaimed on cane bag it's like you'll buy this there's a Rolling Stones collector's limited edition leather motorcycle jacket for five hundred dollars up on up for auction on this thing what's it called uncle unclaimed baggage unclaimed baggage calm well we could find this out I I remember sixty minutes but it did a big like expose on the a while ago and it was like oh uh they they have like tens of thousands of square French right yeah they're huge huge facility there the other one that's like this which i think is more popular people know about this more is the group that takes the okay you go to a hotel you use you know two squirts of shampoo out of the mini bottle and now there's still three squirts left and then you check out and they can't they don't want to give that empty half-empty bottle to the next guest so they ditch it and so some guy was like wool that's a lot of waste of plastic and shampoo and so someone started going into hotels and partner and said I will take all your used shampoo bottles conditioner bottles body wash whatever and so they built a huge business just recycling this I love that they take it they reuse the goods they donate certain things to charity and it's such a good business it's like doing good while doing well and I think those are great I love that here's why I just googled so Doyle Owens is the founder of Unclaimed Baggage he's he's dead now he died recently and if you google I'm he's just like an old Southern right white looking to I mean just a normal ass looking dude and a guy who watches Billy Madison three times a day well the reason why I like him is because or I like this is because I think that people tend to overcomplicate things and like I'm very passionate about the mission of reducing waste just like just like the idea of don't consume what you don't have to consume and just don't be wasteful I was raised Catholic I'm like this idea of like gluttony and like waste it just says it's in my blood I hate it this guy this is like the definition of just like turn and into gold of just like right she's just like it's a super simple it's not fancy it's an Alabama which you know I'm from the south so but no disrespect to the south but like people look down on that because I think they're in Silicon Valley but they're special and he's just that this guy reduced waste significantly and got very wealthy in the process right loved it and created he probably created maybe thousands of jobs for like low-income people this guy's the best I love this if you have if you know about a business like this I'll call the hidden in plain sight you know super simple ideas just things that when you look around the world most people just take them for granted and then somebody out there's like no wait how did this get here who picks this up when it's done what's the business of that tweet those at me I want to know what other businesses are like this out there did you joint did you make a life to get them do you make that term up no I think they use that term for like serial killers that are just in society so like that's where I've heard it it's like for criminals in

they average 62 million queries per day I have no idea I mean what do you think Google's queries per day probably like like 5 million okay let's start with go okay I've I was on the James Altucher podcast James was here with us a few weeks ago James is like a like a dork nerdy guy I say this would love I like him a lot he's like a nerdy guy libertarian guy libertarian audience and I can't decide if this whole privacy stuff that we're talking about so hey calm female service launched a few days ago a few weeks ago a week ago yeah its premise is like we're gonna one of its many promises is its on privacy okay and so I'm really into this privacy thing the founder of Pandora told me that he is seeing his customers who are Middle American people actually care about privacy and when I was on my trip I saw DuckDuckGo billboards everywhere for those who don't know duck taco it's a google competitor it's a search engine and they it's all based on they don't track you which like ruins the business model have no idea how they make money but no no it doesn't so their thing was like it's not no ads so they still do search ads but they're like look when you search for you said you're gonna go buy a new car when you go search for you know Mercedes versus BMW or whatever you're gonna search for they'll serve you an ad they just don't need to know that you're sampar that you live in this place that you have life you know they don't need the personal data for the ads to still be effective because search is high intent they know what you're looking for so they can serve you of relevant ad and their insight was the slight drop off you get by not personalizing is not so bad if that can become your value proposition that hey we're not using personal information to serve these ads okay so I just sent you their traffic go to DuckDuckGo comm slash traffic so here's my question to you first of all we're looking at a hockey stick we're looking at anomalous and 10 2010 they're at you know this is this is queries per day or this is average yeah so they average 62 million queries per day I have no idea I mean what do you think Google's queries per day probably like like five billion I mean a braid see if you can find let's see if you can find Google's careers today so we can put this so 3.5 billion off ok ok yes go ahead Google or duck duck goes that fifty fifty sixty million a day so there I don't even know what's that like three percent the size anyway DuckDuckGo what do you think about that I I personally love this and what I want to know from you is do you like duck oh and do you also think this privacy thing like building products were the main feature or values in like or like the main thing the brain stands for is privacy do you think that's gonna be it I think it's a hit I used to think the opposite I used to be of the camp that was like look people don't give a like if you just say yeah sure in theory people want privacy if you offer no privacy or privacy but when it comes down to products they're like oh this is a free good thing and I have to give up all my data alright here you go and so I used to think that people in practice who are willing to easily trade privacy and I think that's still true on the whole but if you said yes where is the pendulum swinging and so I think the pendulum is swinging more towards people caring about privacy because every these things stack up right so as you you know the more paranoid you get the less lack of trust you have in the system and of the of the big companies it doesn't matter you don't have to know which one is the straw that breaks the camel's back maybe it's the fake new stuff on Facebook maybe it's when your information gets breached for the 35th time and you get an email saying hey sorry your personal if I might have been leaked like you don't know where it is but these things just keep happening and to the point where I believe people care more than they did before and they'll continue to care more that's that's number one number two you have to do it on a global product like a product everybody uses cuz it's still a niche audience alright like you said Google is about 50 times the search query size then in DuckDuckGo up so like 50 to 1 and so you need a product that's used by pretty much everybody for that those ones to add up and be a big enough market for you so I wouldn't do it on some niche products like oh you do you know some niche mailing you know hmm MailChimp software thing cool I'm gonna make a privacy focus version it's like no that's that's a nisha of a niche well if it's about ego stream it works like hey calm I caught hey calm global write emails everybody yes it is global but like you don't need that many users to build a billion-dollar company totally what I'm - that's was saying though you need but you're only gonna get the sort of 2% let's say that value privacy enough to make a change and so you know like superhuman did the same thing email such a huge market cool we'll go get the 1% 2% who are willing to pay 30 bucks a month for a free instead of free email I think this is anything happening here I pray you how old are you 27 you're a little old for this question the zoom ray just five years ago no it's a generational thing I want to know do the 22 year olds give a about this because the way that the Zoomers the way that they live and think is really about getting coronaviruses the privacy of their data they don't care about their body they're a pretty conscientious group of people I think I don't know I would I want to know how they think but that was my question okay so here's another private here's another opportunity for privacy that I'm interested in do you know that when you go to Safeway so in California we have Safeway in the South you've got Kroger and the other South you've got Publix what else is there Albertsons Albertsons okay so when you go to your grocery store like your major grocery store you enter in your phone number to get a discount right what they do with that is they understand your buying behavior and they'll show you they'll send you stuff in the mail or they will just learn about inventory whatever and this is incredibly effective so effective at there's a famous story about a woman being a sixteen year old get a woman getting mailed stuff to her dad's home saying like baby supplies and the dad was like right my daughter 16 she's not pregnant what he talked about turns out she was pregnant and they knew it because in your party yeah yeah month you know what to buy anyway when you go and buy that ship did you know that you can submit like a request and they'll send you all of your do-not-track requests well that you could do it do not track and they can send you everything you've ever bought oh that's pretty cool okay alike so what what would you do with that data yeah I think that's just an interesting thing you could do in general like a mint calm style I think you could say hey what's your phone number okay then you go request it on behalf of the customer and you give them cool visualizations about their spending patterns over time and other products they might like but I don't what do you what I want to do with that data if I was the company or if I was myself what do you think if you're trying to build a business I would go figure out other areas where this sort of like linking and tracking will work and so so a lot of people have already done this right like the ad market it's kind of like porn where porn innovates first okay a close second or third might be the ad market so you know FERC on who was kind of my co-founder CTO of my previous company his previous company was an ad tech company and they one of the versions of their app that they made so the companies called app lovin and so initially the premise was what apps are your friends loving we will recommend those apps to you and so it was like if I know what apps you have and I know that you're my friend cuz you're in my address book then it can tell me that sampar loves this app I thought it was a play on McLovin no it was I don't know maybe that was a side benefit cuz every love super bad but won it but then all kinds of little edge cases started them up so they would you know record they would tell me that you love Grindr right like so so first it's like not everybody's app behavior they want to be transparent to their friends or their contacts and I think there was one really horrible case where this so then they switched us trying to do this for app installs so they're like okay if I'm playing a game and it's awesome I'm sorry forget about it's awesome I'm playing a game and they want you to download that game because they get paid nine bucks if you download the game they would show my face from your address book as hey Shaun's playing candy crush right now tap here to play candy crush to and that was like a super effective ad unit like there were like printing money and I think something really bad happened where like the CEO of Expedia or something like that got an ad that like his deceased wife was playing this game or something like that like someone from his address book who had this app was shown to him and he's like what the hell is this and so he got back to them and they had turn it off and they would they did a similar experiment around location-tracking like have a life 360 thing so yeah you're really careful with these like data oh let's use data to give you information about either yourself or others you can get the situation like the dad who finds out a 16 year olds pregnant yeah I long story short privacy okay I have a privacy idea for you I love a privacy idea for you so I just because I've become like I like the older I've gotten I've gotten like more libertarian and like the government like mentality well there's two things are happening there's people who bring on a libertarian which is like eff the government and if the man in general and then there's people are becoming more nationalistic which is like it's us first them and us first them mean sort of keep them out and raise us up and I think in both cases you see this sort of like retreat in both cases it's sort of it's not like a shelter in place physically but it's a shelter in place sort of psychologically behaviorally where you reduce your like openness and your spread you know in your behaviors and your data in another way so I think people in general when times get a little crazy people there's a flight to safety and I see I think you see this with investing I think you see this with the way people act to behave so I think that more people do it when they're when times get turbulent now a privacy focused idea that I had the other day so moved into this new house need to get internet set up oh gotta play the Comcast game Comcast comes over and of course you know Wi-Fi doesn't really work great in my house so I was like okay I need to invest in good Wi-Fi because not having good Wi-Fi is like not having water to drink and so I'm like looking for these like euro these kind of mesh networks that you use in your house I just thought one give you more coverage so I just bought euro but I was talking to FERC on and I was like I think euro sucks well I hope it doesn't sock cuz I just bought it but but the idea that I was thinking about was you know how when you what typically happens you have your Wi-Fi router and then on your laptop you'll have like a VPN so a lot of people have VPNs VPNs are more and more popular some people have it for work some people have it to hide their traffic as they go bootleg movies on the internet and they don't want it to be sort of traced to them and so VPNs are kind of complicated like to set up like you got to download one you don't know if it's malware you're setting it up average person doesn't know what the hell VPN is I was asking done a ton of research on this market well the idea was actually why don't you build VPN into the router so you never need to download anything it's just VPN by default and it'll thing into the hardware itself and so you actually the the value prop of the router is this is secure internet and and so there so he so forgot of course like you know there's people doing this and so I can't say I'm the first to have this idea but he was telling me about a couple companies to check out if you're interested in this so next DNS is one of them ubiquity is another one and so he was showing me a few of these that today are still kind of like you kind of need to be a developer to know about these or be like know how to configure them to set them up and so I think if somebody takes the euro level of simplicity and design but they make the value prop hey your your internet search traffic your whatever you're doing on the Internet is private if you buy this box instead of that box I think hard thing behind that the hard thing about these comfort of all the VPN businesses I did a wrote about them because I think that it's gonna explode and they already are exploding but a lot of them are based in Panama because of the privacy laws there and a lot of them are notoriously scammy and weird they're also ridiculously profitable like I talked to the one guy he had one it made twin a million dollars a year in revenue and like a hundred million in profit like right stupid but euro do you remember you know euro got bought by Google I think Amazon I think Amazon it like got acquired for nothing these companies are so hard to make money because it costs so much money right yeah I think hardware is hard everybody knows that like ring doorbell you know it gets a billion dollar outcome but like I don't think it was like ultra profitable at the time I think it was strategic the reason it got bought but the reason I think Wi-Fi router is interesting because Wi-Fi is like email it's like Google search it's a thing that everybody has every every physical place has a router and so though 2% of that market that cares about privacy I think it's still a big market and I think I don't I don't believe that it's so hard to make money because again you like with this Comcast box that I have here I gotta pay these guys 14 bucks a month just for this router to sit here it's no way this router is worth more than like 50 dollars but they're gonna make money on me you know they'll break even in five months and they know I'm never gonna like get rid of my router and so so yeah I think that there's something interesting there yeah also those guys [Music]

how many emails do I send a year maybe six or seven hundred million the best business to start is something that solves your own problem and so for me I was using MailChimp I've used convertkit I've checked out a Weber check one I found him way over expensive I found him way over complicated to me like 45 minutes to set up MailChimp email and so I was like I just want something more affordable and simpler and that's why we built Sun Fox and I think that's something where I'll keep working on it forever with the team I think what's interesting is trying to think about what's gonna happen in the next six months to six years and then how do I be a little bit ahead of everyone else so if you think about it let me ask you soon do you think there's gonna be more or less content creators in the future absolutely more so I think you know the one problem that I notice with all the channels like YouTube or Instagram or tic toc or any of these is that ultimately they are incentivized to get you to pay to talk to your audience why because they have to make money and so email is the only channel I've ever found that can scale communicating with an audience that you can fully control and so I think if San Fox becomes the number one place for people to grow their audiences one I want it for myself number one and two is just a really big and interesting opportunity to work on so we send how many emails do I send a year maybe six or seven hundred million I don't even know to be honest I'm appSumo probably has a similar amount of emails like hundreds of millions of sends per year well I pay I think I pay 10 or 15 grand a month to send those is it done right I don't really know I think what there's two things that are more interesting to me one I've been focusing more on the total audience that you have available because email isn't is a component of your audience right so you actually have like hustle on Facebook hustle Instagram hustle YouTube hustle podcast and your total active audience and there's overlap that number I'm actually more fascinated with and the second thing with email I think the metric cost is one thing but I think that we've said said you said said Fox was trying to make it cheaper because you're bored of them I don't like the portable yeah Laura for you yeah because we have teens how much is that to cost ascend like for us mentally it I'll tell you if you take point zero zero zero two and then times about how many emails so the thing that MailChimp and convertkit and all these guys so point zero zero two times your number so they make money if you don't send emails because they make money off your subscriber of course and so the way that's so send Fox is free and then we're a one-time payment because most people don't actually email and so we're trying to fix that and work through those kind of challenges of people but the other thing I think people need to think about in terms of growing their community or starting a newsletter like if you don't have one start it today you send Fox comm number one but the second thing is the number that's the most important is not your email list size it is your active email a size so it is the amount of people within three months that have open and clicked your email because you know I've had hundreds of thousands for all I think in my total lifetime of okay dork I've had a hundred and seventy-five thousand subscribe to the newsletter my active audience is only 55 think about that yeah and that's what we do too but we turn people every three months like we sunset them like when we send them an email and be like hey you're gonna get we're gonna take you off this list what percentage is it I don't know off the top of my head to be honest with you but I know that like one I could tell you this though so like our open rates really really high right now it's like fifty five percent and I think the average person saves two years so you could somehow figure out what that is yeah but but like like if we don't get them on the hook right away then they're never gonna get on the hook how do you gonna hook your welcome email needs to be really good your Thank You page after they sign up needs to be really good you know this this is what you dude here's the thing I'm still learning well you had this even your unsubscribe page needs to be great which you didn't you have a really good unsubscribe yeah but I gave up on that one I think the Thank You page and you're welcome thing or like the two of the most neglected pieces of marketing yeah I call them like you have to make the Forgotten parts really good so like your Thank You page your welcome email your unsubscribe page just like little Easter Egg like that that needs to be good but to make him good yeah well our so I get accused of stealing CD babies email welcome email which I didn't even know what that was but then when I saw it I realized oh yeah I can I totally understand why people see this I think I steal that stole that but my welcome email was a like a really detailed welcome email that it was like really long and explained what happened when you signed up and it was pretty funny and like if you google like the hustle welcome email a lot of people wrote about it people seem to like that so just like being creative and writing long-form content about what happened after those types of things when those people signed up it works pretty well but with so let's say like convertkit let's say convertkit is doing twenty million dollars a year in sales which chimeric it's awesome because i like the guy who started it I like convertkit and they reveal all their revenue numbers if they're doing twenty million in revenue like you said that you try to make cent fox more affordable I have no idea how much do they actually charge thing to or how much are they what's their cogs in order to send all those emails Oh point zero zero two it might be point zero zero zero one five times how many subscribed how many emails are sending a month the profit is all in the people who don't email it's basically I think of email marketing companies is very expensive hosting you're basically paying a lot of money to host zeros and ones and digits that don't cost anything and so I think one importantly if people are businesses like that's a really interesting business to start it's also interesting business to disrupt like I think sub stack is done amazing with it coming at it from like hey emails actually free and we're gonna make money on the subscription part so you don't have to pay for email anymore same with send fox it's like it's mostly free and we're gonna be focusing we're focusing more on like youtubers and podcasters so it's like who are the audiences that aren't really emailing enough or don't know how to email for this specific type of audience I think a market for that is musician spans I think there's a huge like if you look at them money where musicians make it is in concerts and they're horrible at notifying you when they're coming into town well if you any type it type in right now I was typing some no dude relax but yeah I think musicians I mean I think the point though you have to serve a customer that I think you have an understanding of I think a lot of these want renews out they're like oh yeah let me go help musicians I'm like one I don't know about musicians I'm learning to play piano it's right here but the point being is like I think we it's not that you shouldn't go outside of your comfort zone I just think there's easier ways of success and I think more too many people make it too hard on themselves and it's just like going to your own problems or going to problems of people around you that you have easier access to what about have you been looking into amp for email yeah some of this stuff I mean I also you know there's also talk about hey emails dying and all this stuff I'm like people using it left and right I've seen amp where it's like a little bit more of dynamic and faster loading emails I think the most important thing about email is not necessarily the layouts and all that stuff I think the most important thing is how do you build a relationship where people are expecting your email we're like if I stopped emailing or the hustle didn't come they're like something is wrong with my day and until you could say that point you're you're probably worrying about the wrong problems yeah I mean that's the hard part obviously that's like how do you create I mean that's just about creating good but I still think the whole amp thing is actually super interesting what what I'm working on is a few ways to hack it because I'm I kind of am obsessed with like storytelling in email and so what can you like if you think about what is a Jif to me a jiff is a moveable image that has no sound well so is most of the video that you use on Instagram on Facebook it's just audio or it's just a video with no sound like because a lot of times you don't even click like listen you know I'm saying and so what I'm interested is how can I use amp to tell a story in an email in a video format or like all these other hacks like that that's incredibly interesting to me I think there's something there with that the thing that we've been doing with sin Fox that we've been building in is there's kind of like two major components that I think are lacking an email so number one is how do you build in like what the hustle and morning brew hobb which is building referrals so we've basically built that in so anyone can have their own referral engine within emails that was a huge pain in the ass for us I know so we built it and it works and I'm doing it on ok so if you gotta send Fox a comp slash Noah you can see how it looks or sign up for yourself and it's built in for free I think the second thing that we're observing so what everyone wants is like do I grow my audience and how do I send consistent emails because if you're not sending something weekly you get forgotten and then this age of attention we're all fighting for it and so we built this thing called weekly newsletter template or week I think their branding it's smart campaigns and so the idea there is that we suck in all of your social information and we look at what's most popular and then we basically just like we recommend like hey here's the three things that you should email your audience this week and so that's what I do every Wednesday I just pull my two of my favorite things and one of someone else's to try to spread joy and love and build relationship with people I don't know yet [Music] [Applause] [Music]

what is my unique strategy or what is my strategy of doing that I think where I've been very successful is I just do a lot of stuff and eventually something works I think there's a few things in marketing I'll say three things that I think are simplistic simplest you know world but number one how about just singular goal Facebook did it appszoom accom has done it and I think with even recently with my dork world and helping people overcome fear and start businesses I'm kind of like having a bunch of goals I'm like here's our tick-tock goal here's our Instagram goal here's our email list goal here's our organic traffic oh here's this I'm like what is our most important goal and as I just even pick one for some period of time and so I think I've come into that realization like let's just pick YouTube and just be okay with that and guess what that'll rise all other ships so don't be ignoring the ignorant of those other ones but just focus on one second thing is that as I was doing a lot of this content recently which has gotten me really fulfilled and it's it feels good feels great is youtuber okay dork calm mostly YouTube mostly in YouTube world the second thing that's been most critical and this is really hard because everyone does it says they do this or wants to do this but doesn't who who is my audience who is the audience that I really want to be helping and communicate with because on one hand I want to I want to connect with like nine figure CEOs and ten figure CEOs and I you know I actually don't think there's a lot of content of how to go from seven to eight or eight to nine and I can share how we do it but that audience is really small and they don't really know as much help and so we've realized like our audience is dudes 25 to 40 that have tried to start a business that haven't been accessible that are afraid of failing and need a little bit of help and so I think the second part of marketing that I've gotten revisiting is Who am I really trying to talk to and what are the words so like here are some words that we've even identified that our audience resonates with rat race freedom so I'm like really alright self-doubt so those are some of the things that I'm thinking about in the third part that we're we're thing anything that's applicable for every businesses what is your unique strategy of success like so with that we have two parts one what's our core messages that we're this is YOUnique like bread and butter that you will know I was like what through meat about this and he's like what did them it you have so many messages just pick three so I was like alright challenges to overcome fear million dollar weekend and behind the scenes of Annie figure company that's the three that we're gonna do and that's it and then the the second part is they say that again so those three are the three what does recently let's take a step back so one what's your goal pick one goal number two who is your customer number three what is your core messages that people know you for so for me those are the three that I'm gonna be known for challenges which I always tell people do the coffee challenge which is take it ask for 10% off when you buy coffee you're gonna be afraid you're gonna learn about yourself and you're gonna grow secondly is behind the scenes of any for your company so like how do you like that there's not a lot of people that have that experience and I can do that and the third part is how do you actually get a million dollar business or $100 you know a million dollar business start in a weekend which I've done many many times and I can share which is unique and then the last part of this marketing equation that I think I'm exploring and revisiting around all these things is what is my unique strategy or what is my strategy of doing that I think where I've been very successful is I just do a lot of stuff and eventually at least something works but I think I will be even more successful slowing down being a little more thoughtful with these things and so our unique strategy lately has been do the fast stuff but on lower risk items so basically tweet and Instagram and LinkedIn post everything like throw it all out there unlimitedly and then based on what works a lot aligning to our core messages that's what will go deeper and that's what will write a blog post about that's what will do an interview about that's what we will do a YouTube video about and so it's just having a higher likelihood of homeruns and how would you hi Sean the mic like you look like a therapist yeah really feel you're almost 40 I'm I look and feel 32 but I'd say I'm about in physicality in our society 38 and that physicality in our whatever traditions of 38 ok cool even years I am 32 and I look and feel 38 so you do look 30 a bro I'm trying to go the other way so and I would love so if you were 21 again 21 no network no name-brand you're starting up from scratch and you don't have to go the same pathway you went I'm curious you know if you had the luxury of picking any path now that you know of so many more paths and you probably knew about when you were 21 what path would you go down honestly I think I copy my path which would be what so you're 21 what do you do I'll tell you exactly what I did I didn't know what the to do so I wouldn't tried a bunch of stuff out to figure out what to do I think the only I think one question is what Delta would I have chosen and I'll tell you exactly what that was so at 21 I didn't know I didn't know what a BS was I got it got it from Berkley I was like Oh bachelor science is cool everyone kind of follows a stream right like when you graduate from college which I think less and less it becoming important everyone's like oh get a job go to Intel go to wherever and I was like ok I guess that's what everyone's doing but I've always wanted to start my own company I didn't know what to do and so I think the two things that I did really well when I had that day job at Intel was I use that as my investor and the two things I'd recommend is that I started a lot of businesses so if you're like I don't have any idea two things you can do one go to San Fox comm and start a newsletter and send an email once a week for 365 days or for 52 weeks that's number one or number two go on YouTube take the rhein holiday challenge and post a video on YouTube for 30 days start there the second thing that I did is that I connected with people very aggressively and I asked anyone I knew for anyone that they knew that was really smart that's how I met Tim Ferriss that's how I met Orin Hoffman dave McClure James Hong Max Levchin ramit sethi I basically put on events I hosted lunches I organized conferences I didn't know anyone but I wanted to bring smart people together so if you don't know any smart people find one smart person say hey you should meet this smart person and then just go and hang out with both of them guy and girl guess what you coulda done zoom if you're in remote country or if you don't have any connections I think one of the ones I've really observed lately every person I've hired that's been the most impressive has done two things they've offered something for free to a value that I've wanted and they did it without asking and those people live in the most impressive and guess what now they're like hey I want to meet this person I want to do this thing I want to grow here and like that most of them are now working with me and so I think I would have that was something very early on I was very aggressive on meeting people and just trying to build my brand in terms of career I think the two thing one thing I did very well is I was really great about following my curiosity and things I was really excited about so I really loved Facebook and I really love the mint and I was like I'll do whatever it takes to work there um I think the only difference I would have chosen is find someone 10 to 20 years ahead of me that I think is doing the things I would would like to do in 10 to 20 years and be obsessed or aggressive in figuring out how to make them excited to want to be a part of my life so I had one guy dug her she was my boss at Facebook and it didn't really work out as well for as a mentorship but it's nice because like you can say oh that's how you do a relationship oh that's how you do a career and it'll shortcut it you just have to figure out the real most important thing is how do you get them to give a about you and the best way to do that is help them with whatever things they're working on so you want to hear something crazy Shawn I don't know if you know this but I don't know if Noah knows it but I launched my I created my so my company which is a it's an okay company it's been good for me it started because Noah had a blog post about organizing conferences and I was like I what was it called it was called like how I made how I made 90k hosting a conference of something was that it Noah mm-hmm I made a coordination conferences because I I didn't know I was gonna make money to him yeah so I saw that and I was like well I had a book club at the time and I was like well I didn't mean I've been hosting these meetups but I don't make any money from it I should like make money off this thing and so I started my come and he have made millions of dollars personally off conferences because of that blog post and more importantly or maybe not more importantly I've met I met actually all three people in this call and most of my friends and co-workers do because of that blog post because of that blog post I meant Neville because of that blog post Neville the best man my wedding I met because of that Katrina so so what you're describing of what you would do and how basically you describe like hosting events and which is similar in the same vein as posting content I did the same thing and it made me millions of dollars and I met all my best friends that way awesome I mean I think the only other thing that I was doing at the time that I think everyone should do so number one build your brand in some way even if you're not trying to be a personal brand I think practicing writing is a skill you can use in sales you can use development you can use in design you can use it almost literally forever I think the connections very valuable literally probably the reason I'm a multimillionaire is because I've been able to meet and help people and connect people connecting and meeting but the third thing was that I was starting a lot of businesses and I think what's beautiful is if especially earlier in your life your cost of living is sodium low and my cost of living is still damn low because I'm I haven't grown up in some ways and I'm maturing in certain ways that it's so low that you should take a lot of risk very early on in trying a lot of things out so I like when I was working to Intel I was doing this college consulting I did a thing called ninja card comm I was putting on these conferences that I charged for and then I was working at mint I started doing the Facebook apps like it all plays games and I started making a lot of money but now I was working at morning I was working on weekends I was working at lunches we're working at nights I was working I kept going and I kept trying a lot of me and eventually after probably two and a half three years good to know four and three or three years later my side hustle finally became my main hustle you [Music]

and I think I've I've chased opportunities to make money which have been fleeting they've been profitable but fleeting and I think when you're in your 20s you should do those frankly you should just do the things that are like hot and exciting if you think want to make money and then in your 30s you start reflecting more like Wow mortality is real what's really important and I think you'll come back to finding how do I work on problems and things that I want created for in my own world know what's going on sampar um in meetings all day and I'm heading out to California in four hours so I was just I haven't been on this podcast in a minute because I was in Austin I drove from California to Austin I hung out with Noah Neville and a bunch of people and now Noah is coming to Malibu or I'm coming to SF for a month and then I'm gonna go to Malibu for a month where are you staying in San Francisco Andrew Chen's house oh that's right you told me I I've decided that I'm gonna get rid of my apartment in San Francisco and I'm gonna live in different cities for one or two months each I we're copying each other Sam you went bald so I went bald you're I'm moving places so you're moving places I need to get glasses a dog yeah well yeah you know uh I need a few things your funding we we know each other well but can you tell the listeners who you are what is up you sexy listeners Noah Kagan I'm a cyclist I'm a chess player lately I'm making a lot of content on YouTube about everything I'm learning at appSumo calm that's youtube.com slash okay dork I helped start appSumo Khan which is the number one site online for software deals and hate figure company been around ten years I was number 30 at Facebook number four at mint calm and then the two other things that I like working on and playing with business-wise ascend fox.com which is a free email list for content creators and okay dr. calm which is my said about overcoming fear starting and marketing startups and no one I have known each other for six or seven years oh wow now we're you're well I think you're five or six years older than me we're very similar personalities we're a little crazy we have a bunch of different ideas would you say that's accurate yeah I didn't like you for a long time why so sometimes you'll hang out with Sam if you guys have hung out or had the chance to you know the same he's like how much what are you making doing this one thing and it's like it's like someone asked you like how big is your like dude I don't know you and you're asking a really personal kind of aggressive it's almost it's like to the level of transactional that's just a little too much versus what you'd expect from a friend and I think sometimes it's interesting to observe the people or companies that were jealous of or the companies were reacting negatively negatively to and really trying to understand that and our first experience I think if I recall you wanted me to come speak at the hustle no III what it was yeah I wanted you to speak at an event and I you asked me to write a blog post for you and I wrote this blog post and then you didn't publish it and I was like what the [ __ ] there was just weird vibes I was getting from you and so it didn't make me excited to want to do anything and then you sent me like a nutribullet or some kind of item and I was just like this guy weirds me out I don't like how he's behaving and so over the years though I've started to appreciate your quirkiness and it's probably like me I'm sure some people listening to me with like I don't like the style I think the point for everyone is not to just go and accept everyone and love everything but to observe our jealousy observe a negativity observe our criticism and think about what we're trying to really say about it ourselves or learn about ourselves I think one thing I would say about you Sam that I've appreciated is that it's interesting to observe the people in life who get what they want because those people you don't see all the things they're not getting and I really respect with Sam how persevering you are I think there's a lot of times where I'm like oh yeah this guy is gonna go there's so many people I'm like oh they're gonna quit soon and I definitely you know the hustle wouldn't be anything without effort and I think without you just kept going and won't stop and I think more people have to some people like well I don't have that I'm not saying power or not no kickin I'm not it's like yeah you're yourself which is even better and it's just finding the things that you'd never want to give up on so find your hustle find your appSumo find your okay dork calm and just find something you'll never quit on and then go for it that's one thing I definitely appreciated watching your journey from afar you said you didn't like me or I rub you the wrong way were you saying that begin then you said jealousy you're saying because you think I was jealous of you or you jealous of me or not at the time I just found you kind of I was uncertain of your motive I did it spinning like six years so I'm not just exact sure I don't you know I do have I do spend most of my days thinking about you hmm I think everyone's favorite story is themself so if you ever want to talk to someone be like hey you know what I noticed about you and they're like what but I think feedback is a whole nother thing we can talk about that I think I just had a weird vibe and I didn't know what your intentions were and I think what was interesting is like other friends of ours were like oh yeah he's a good dude and he is but I was like I guess I'm missing something so let's uh we're gonna talk about business in a second and I think this is kind of an interesting conversation because but I think that what has brought us to be friends is our mutual friend novel Medora who is both of ours best friend he was the best man at my wedding and you have a wall you have a brother but he probably had it not been for your brother he probably would be in that category for you as well and so it's interesting how like like you could we both see how we're loyal to one person and that brings like good qualities out of each other I think Neville said I'm his number one I know if you talked to him recently well we can fight over that what he says in bed to both of us he's like no I never said he said I was ever one but I know we both we're both loyal to similar people so let's talk about let's talk about different interesting companies and businesses that we're both looking at because we're you and I are the same and that we're both like pretty big schemers and not that we do [ __ ] all the time but we both like like like to figure out how things work what are you looking at like you're really interested in the email space with sin Fox I'm interested in that as well what what interests you about email like why are you like cuz AB sumos pretty successful you don't have to start new [ __ ] if you didn't want to why are you choosing sin Fox I think choosing it one of my favorite books around the words that you use is the dali lama's art of happiness and i love that you were chose alright because i don't have to do anything I want to do things I don't need to do stuff I want stuff and I think it's interesting for all of us to be aware of that and it must stay everyone I think what in my life I think one of the things that drives me is curiosity and I think in terms of business like if people out there you know listen to this and say hey I want you my business started the best business to start is something that solves your own problem and so for me I was using MailChimp I've used convertkit I've checked out Aweber check one I found him way over expensive I found him way over complicated to me like 45 minutes to set up MailChimp email and so I was like I just want something more affordable and simpler and that's where we built Sun Fox and I think that's something where I'll keep working on it forever with the team I think what's interesting is trying to think about what's gonna happen in the next six months to six years and then how do I be a little bit ahead of everyone else so if you think about it let me ask you soon do you think there's gonna be more or less content creators in the future absolutely more so I think you know the one problem that I notice with all the channels like YouTube or Instagram or tic toc or any of these is that ultimately they are incentivized to get you to pay to talk to your audience why because they have to make money and so email is the only channel I've ever found that can scale communicating with an audience that you can fully control and so I think if San Fox becomes the number one place of people to grow their audiences one I want it for myself number one and two is just a really big and interesting opportunity to work on so we send how many emails do I send a year maybe six or seven hundred million I don't even know to be honest I'm appSumo probably has a similar amount of emails like hundreds of millions of sends per year well I pay I think I pay 10 or 15 grand a month to send those is it done right I don't really know I think what there's two things that are more interesting to me one I've been focusing more on the total audience that you have available because email isn't is a component of your audience right so you actually have like hustle on Facebook hustle Instagram hustle YouTube hustle podcast and your total active audience and there's overlap that number I'm actually more fascinated with and the second thing with email I think the metric cost is one thing but I think though you said said [ __ ] you said said Fox was trying to make it cheaper because you're more affordable I don't like the portable yeah Laura for you yeah because you're not seen how much is that to cost ascend I like for us really it I'll tell you if you take point zero zero zero two and then times about how many emails so the thing that MailChimp and convertkit and all these guys so point zero zero two times your number so they make money if you don't send emails because they make money off your subscriber of course and so the way that's so send fox is free and then we're a one-time payment because most people don't actually email and so we're trying to fix that and work through those kind of challenges with people but the other thing I think people need to think about in terms of growing their community you're starting a newsletter like if you don't have one start it today you send fox comm number one but the second thing is the number that's the most important is not your email list size it is your active email a size so it is the amount of people within three months that have opened and clicked your email because you know I've had hundreds of thousands from I think in my total lifetime of okay dork I've had a hundred and seventy-five thousand subscribe to the newsletter my active audience is only 55 think about that yeah and that's what we do too but we turn people every three months like we sunset them like when we send them an email be like hey you're gonna get we're gonna take you off this list what percentage is it I don't know off the top of my head to be honest with you but I know that like one I could tell you this though so like our open rates really really high right now it's like 55 percent and I think the average person saves two years so you could somehow figure out what that is yeah but but like like if we don't get them on the hook right away then they're never gonna get on the hook how do you gonna hook your welcome email needs to be really good your Thank You page after they sign up need to be really good you know this [ __ ] this is what you did good dude here's the thing I'm still learning well you had this root even your unsubscribe page needs to be great which you didn't you have a really good unsubscribe path but I gave up on that one I think the Thank You page and you're welcome thing are like the two of the most neglected pieces of marketing yeah I call them like you have to make the Forgotten parts really good so like your Thank You page your welcome email your unsubscribe page just like little Easter Egg [ __ ] like that it needs to be good but to make them good yeah well are so I get accused of stealing CD babies email welcome email which I didn't even know what that was but then when I saw it I realized oh yeah I can I totally understand why people see this steal that stole that but my welcome email was a like a really detailed welcome email that it was like really long and explained what happened when you signed up and it was pretty funny and like if your Google like the hustle welcome email a lot of people wrote about it people seem to like that so just like being creative and writing long-form content about what happened after those types of things when those people signed up it works pretty well but with so let's say like convertkit let's say convertkit is doing twenty million dollars a year in sales which converts awesome because i like the guy who started it I like convertkit and they reveal all their revenue numbers if they're doing twenty million in revenue like you said that you try to make cent fox more affordable I have no idea how much do they actually charge think - or how much are they what's their cogs in order to send all those emails Oh point zero zero - it might be Oh point zero zero zero one five times how many subscribe how many emails are sending a month the profit is all in the people who don't email it's basically I think of email marketing companies is very expensive hosting you're basically paying a lot of money to host zeros and ones and digits that don't cost anything and so I think more importantly if people are businesses like that's a really interesting business to start it's also interesting business to disrupt like I think sub stack has done amazing with it coming at it from like hey email is actually free and we're gonna make money on the subscription part so you don't have to pay for email anymore same with sin Fox it's like it's mostly free and we're gonna be focusing we're focusing more on like youtubers and podcasters so it's like who are the audience's that aren't really emailing enough or don't know how to email for this specific type of audience I think a market for that is musician spans I think there's a few like if you look at them money where musicians make it is in concerts and they're horrible at notifying you when they're coming into town well if you already type it type in right now I was typing some note dude relax but yeah I think musicians I mean I think the point though you have to serve a customer that I think you have an understanding of I think a lot of these want renews out they're like oh yeah let me go help musicians I'm like one I don't know [ __ ] about musicians I'm learning to play piano it's right here but the point being is like I think we it's not that you shouldn't go outside of your comfort zone I think there's easier ways of success and I think more too many people make it too hard on themselves and it's just like going to your own problems or go into problems of people around you that you have easier access to what about have you been looking into amp for email yeah some of this stuff I mean I also you know there's also talk about any emails dying and all this stuff I'm like people are using it left and right I've seen amp where it's like a little bit more of dynamic and faster loading emails I think the most important thing about email is not necessarily the layouts and all that stuff I think the most important thing is how do you build a relationship where people are expecting your email we're like if I stopped emailing or the hustle didn't come they're like something is wrong with my day and until you could spit that point you're you're probably worrying about the wrong problems yeah I mean that's the hard part obviously that's like how do you create I mean that's just about creating good [ __ ] but I still think the whole amp thing is actually super interesting what what I'm working on is a few ways to hack it because I kind of am obsessed with like storytelling in email and so what can you like if you think about what is a Jif to me a jiff is a moveable image that has no sound well so is most of the video that you use on Instagram on Facebook it's just audio or it's just a video with no sound like because a lot of times you don't even click like listen you know I'm saying and so what I'm interested is how can I use amp to tell a story in an email in a video format or like all these other hacks like that that's incredibly interesting to me I think there's something there with that the thing that we've been doing with sin Fox that we've been building in is there's kind of like two major components that I think are lacking an email so number one is how do you build in like what the hustle and morning brew hobb which is building referrals so we've basically built that in so anyone can have their own referral engine within emails that was a huge pain in the ass for us I know so we built it and it works and I'm doing it on ok so if you got a sin fox.com slash Noah you can see how it looks or sign up for yourself and it's built in for free I think the second thing that we're observing so what everyone wants is like how do I grow my audience and how do I send consistent emails because if you're not sending something weekly you get forgotten and in this age of attention we're all fighting for it and so we built this thing called weekly newsletter template or week I think they're called branding it's smart campaigns and so the idea there is that we suck in all of your social information we look at what's most popular and then we basically just like we recommend like hey here's the three things that you should email your audience this week and so that's what I do every Wednesday I just pull my two of my favorite things and one of someone else's to try to spread joy and love and build relationship with people I don't know yet how many people are working on sin Fox I think there's two developers one designer David is the GM maybe like six so hey you see Hey long obviously you saw that so for those who don't know hey calm it's a new email service it's pretty neat I don't know if it's gonna be big but I definitely I think it's cool that they are trying that I think I think it actually will be big but that's the irrelevant what that company did it started by 37signals they have a team of like 50 people and they make money through Basecamp I think right that's their main thing and they've used all they've used all those profits to fund hey which I don't know how many engineers they had on that probably a lot actually it's pretty robust already at my company what I'm trying to do we're taking all of our profits and we're launching more stuff how are you figuring out how much are your profit to allocate to these side projects like send fax and like these new products so the way that we've approached it recently is a little bit more structured look away that the question that we ask is basically two things one can we make our money back within 18 months 18 months so will we make break-even money back sick 18 months and secondly is it at least a seven-figure decision so is it at least if it's not a seven-figure opportunity we won't do it the reality is the majority of the money is best spent into whatever is making the most me from a capitalist standpoint some of that time stuff the short term versus long term and so with sin Fox right now the number we made our money back immediately because there's only one developer part-time and one GM and then as it started becoming more profitable it was like alright well let's keep it let's make sure it's a seven-figure business and now we're focusing on because we know it's an opportunity we're saying how do we get this to be a you know 150 100 million dollar business or whatever yeah go we're more focused right now on building our goal there is active audience so I think one thing with company metrics is how do you line your customer success to your company metric success of your company Northstar so percent Fox right now we're at a million active audience meaning of all of our subscribers we reach a million active customers through them and so if we can grow that number to three million that's our goal this year then all of our customers is more successful and then we will be subsequently more successful so how long has it been how long have you had people working on it for about two years I mean what's fascinating at this just is a quick side note Sam is that there's a debate internally not debate but there's discussion internally that if we would have spent all the money and time that we built on sin Fox and King sumo and Hall drop and meet fam and all the things we've done just on appSumo the main thing would it have been a hundred million dollar business today and their likelihood is yeah well that's why I'm asking these things says I'm going through the same process for I'm like man I got this cash cow and a lot of people listening they also have the same thing where they have these companies but like we're [ __ ] degenerates and we can't not make [ __ ] well our strengths our greatest strengths are generally our greatest weaknesses so our greatest strengths for I don't know I won't speak for you my greater strength is igniting like I go and start somethin and I'm like really quick and I'm really fast my greatest weakness is is like consistency I always think of it as like oh I'm a great igniter but I'm not a great consistent source of fuel and so you have to find that balance of who is your fuel so for me Amon is fuel David over at Sand Fox is fuel and then I can go focus on the igniting part and I think that's where you can find success in life which is what are you [ __ ] amazing at just do that stuff and it's hard because we feel guilty or we feel weak and but it is finding the people that I can compliment you on those others there's other sides but take it another example like like the to my to my ferret examples that everyone knows is Netflix and Amazon how many revenue streams does Netflix have a lot no [ __ ] one what the Netflix has one monthly subscription no Netflix yeah but I'm saying Netflix is worth two hundred billion dollars from one $9.99 a month subscription so Amazon on the other hand is worth a trillion and they've got in terms of significant revenue streams probly like three or four and so I think there's many different ways of eating a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup I think you have to kind of figure it out for yourself what style of business so for me with with mine I literally I thought about this this morning might might my ambitions and enjoyment and fulfillment come from like promoting dope stuff which we do in appSumo sharing what I'm learning while doing that which is happening on YouTube and my podcast no kicking presents a podcast and then three making things that I want for myself which is sin Fox and I'm like can I just do this till I die or maybe I'll do this so if I can live forever and I think that's what we're all we're all striving for so Sean is joining us now Sean just got out of a can you say where you were Sean something more important than this depends what this is gonna air but but yeah I was yeah I got pulled into something very interesting but I will share probably from now got it okay so uh tteyuu [ __ ] man right now I know so we're talking to Noah about well you heard a bunch of different stuff no can I ask you I did a pod recently where I talked about delegating and hiring like a CEO and general managers can I've learned how to do this through reading a few books I learned how to do this from talking a David Howser who were friends with I learned how to do it through talking indirectly like learning from you on how to do it like I would talk to a mint I would talk to you a little bit about it I talked to Neville what was your process like for doing that because you have three or four how many GM's you have or whatever you call them I think there's three GM's right now so there's Hall drop there's appSumo and then there's a send Fox David does send Fox and King sumo I think what's actually interesting taking a step back how many CEOs do you think there are an Amazon CEO title or job people who were CEOs and their own businesses that are now running divisions of Amazon yeah exactly and so the people that want to start their own businesses if you can figure out how to and align their incentives and their motivation within your business is how you create a trillion dollar business and so this examples of this by the way there's Alibaba rocket internet has done this wonderfully it sounds like you're doing it well who else has done it well Amazon has done it well there's way more where they cut a bit of a company I'm obsessed with his coke coke family the Koch Industries they've done that okok I always call it [ __ ] but I get corrected fit it's coke who cares just call them rich the old white fox no I don't know their [ __ ] but III think in terms of delegation leadership I actually think one of my superpowers is just like observations of greatness so here's something it's like [ __ ] cares about no I think what I would do is a listener and this is what I still do this day I'm almost 14 I still do this any time you notice anything impressive reach out to the person that's it and over your lifetime figure out how the [ __ ] do I get around that guy or girl and I think that will lead you to an easier six chances of greatness because it's a lot harder to like go out and try to like date and find people just from the ground up it's much easier if you're like man like you know the people I worked at Facebook honestly the best ever literally the best ever and so it's like oh [ __ ] any in figure out I haven't able to keep around him because we had a falling out obviously but it's like alright how do I be you have more of that so like Garrett Garrett's the lead developer on sin Fox he built a wordpress plugin that i bought for like a hundred dollars like six seven years ago and then I said hey can I pay you like 25 30 bucks an hour to fix it and he was so impressive and he did it for a year and I told Chad my business friend I was like dude this guy is [ __ ] fire and I was like we just need to hire them full time to let him do whatever he wants and pain whatever he wants and it's pretty much what we've done now he works and send Fox and his output is remarkable and so I think with GM's and things like that I'd say ultimately it's like you want to find the people that blow you away but those people basically you want the people who want to run their own businesses and then two things you want to give them a challenging goal and then you wanna give him some boundaries and then leave him alone and that's the simplest and most complicated thing to do can you elaborate on that more because so I've hired a president of my company and it's pretty great because like I get just all the [ __ ] I don't want to do he likes to do so it works out well where I struggle is I still like get into it get into his way I'm like hey this sucks you need to fix it this way this way this way in this way are you doing that with your people so let me correct you they're not my people the people who you work with yeah I think that's a big difference and I know it might sound like oh it's no but I think I never see employees and ever say it's mine is there the technicality do I own more of the business yeah but I think if you want people to be leaders they have to lead and they can't ask for permission to do it you know a lot of times one of my favorite lines that I've been saying in the company lately is people ask me something I'm like who's in charge I say this a lot I probably say this at least once a day my who's in charge they're like me I'm like yeah damn Rand it's you don't [ __ ] look at me I don't know and so I think the more that you the way I've been looking at myself lately with the team as where's my excellence and where can I do me the best job of coaching and I hate when I heard that because when I've heard that I'm like what are they coaching and so let me be specific so with Dork like I've hired a team of four people to help build out my brand and to help spread the message of overcoming fear and starting businesses and they're these these people went through the gauntlet to get the job I'm clear on where they want to go I'm very clear on where they personally want to go and so my job is to help them get what they want and it's got like the gym run roam quote if I can help them get what they want I can get what I want and so I think I learned this when I got rejected from Microsoft as a job I had an internship and you know any intern you get the job guaranteed you know about that most times when you intern you get the job your dude I was like the one of the few that didn't get it it's like damn I'm an underdog man I'm still [ __ ] fighting and but I did learn something in the job interview that I never forgotten he's like here's the best way to lead I'm like tell me in best way to coach he's like you give him the football you tell him where the end zone is you say hey here's the boundaries to get to the end zone how you want to scores up to you and I think what I've learned really well over the past two years is I don't you don't want to be a seagull you know seagull theory no I'm coming we're just chirping at them yeah you come in [ __ ] and fly away I was doing a lot of seagull theory for for a few years did you coin that or is that a thing I mean that your with it your phrase yeah all right cool well I didn't I don't want to be [ __ ] on people and flying away I think it's like how do you lean in sheryl sandberg style and step in to these challenges and be because I think what I always admire is solution thinking right like am i coming and complaining and am I being more problems when I bring more solutions so in turn anyways in terms of coaching like with a man who's running a sumo especially lately I feel like more of an advisor in a very effective way and I think it's a really fine line because you don't resent man so Amy wants to do this one thing recently and I'm like do I just let him do everything and resent it like oh [ __ ] you man I totally disagree with you or do I say no Ayman do this thing you must do it my [ __ ] way it's the Noah Kagan way my dad used to say this one little kid he's like my way or the highway I was like dude I am eight years old like I don't know what you want for me and I don't think you could be either way of those I think it needs to be somewhere in the middle where I don't want to feel resent it I don't resentment towards Ayman I don't want it to be a dictator because then the the the the worst thing I think you could do is is it hiring someone is demotivate them that is probably like one of the dirtiest things you could ever do to anyone is like demote and I've done that twice to a man and Chad and they both said it to me and I felt really bad about it I felt really like I I don't want them working for me I don't want them I want them waking up thinking about it and loving it which is what you want from a lot of people in the team and so I think with Eamon ultimately it's saying like how can I like a lot of times we have goals he has boundaries budgets and then the question I ask is how can I be most helpful and so really kind of coming from that approach because at the end of the day if he's driving the results I don't give a [ __ ] how he plays the game at the end of the day as long as the scores looking good it's within the boundaries I think yes I'm a student at the moment first what's up Noah everybody for joining late I've been following your blog for a long time I remember you you wrote a bunch of [ __ ] that was like you know I walked away from a hundred million bucks or whatever it was I don't walk away I got fired but yes yeah you know my million-dollar mistake or whatever it was but I and I've pointed to a bunch of your tools and so I just want to pause for a second say one of the ways I got good at marketing is by stealing your [ __ ] and if somebody out there wants to get good at marketing especially content marketing go read the stuff about how you built mint and you know just how you built your own personal brand just go observe the meta of what you were doing look at some of the spreadsheets that you linked out that's actually pretty useful and there's like a fine line usually between like I always have this like big skepticism when somebody spends so much of their time telling me how to do something I'm like well how much of that time much of your time are you actually spending doing that thing are you even are you one of those people who you get rich teaching other people to be rich type of thing and you know the thing I liked about you and and a few others that we revote for on this podcast is know there's some people who actually have done it they've actually grown [ __ ] from scratch to scale several times they felt they probably fallen over and failed a couple times but they just like to talk they like to share and they like the feedback loop of sharing out that knowledge and those experiences and they're legit and so I would say like go back go to the archive I don't know I haven't read any of your new stuff but go read the archive the og [ __ ] because it was really good thanks broad yeah I mean I think one of the things I'm doing recently in terms of marketing I think overall you know when I fill out my fellow applications like I was filling out I'm signed up for relationship therapy start next week she's like what's my occupation and I always write engineer because that's what I always dreamed of being but I'm not I don't think I'm smart enough so I faced it this when I was filling it out I deleted that and I was like marketer marketers can always seems like a therapy starts here you wrote engineer you're not an engineer what let's don't forget to relationship so anyways I think what I've accepted it's not that I've ever been a marketer I've just I'm a promoter of greatness and I'm looking for it and I'm sharing it and I'm exploring it in myself I think the thing that I've done recently that it's a simp it's marketing 101 is with my youtube that's that's been like our big focus so I think the two three there's a few things in marketing I'll say three things that I think are simplest simplest you know on some real-world but number one how about just singular goal Facebook did it apps to Macomb has done it and I think with even Riesling with my dork world and helping people overcome fear and start businesses I'm kind of like having a bunch of goals I'm like here's our tick-tock goal here's our Instagram goal here's our email list goal here's our organic traffic oh here's this I'm like what is our most important goal and as I just even pick one for some period of time and so I think I'm coming to that realization like let's just pick YouTube and just be okay with that and guess what that'll rise all other ships so don't be ignoring the ignorant of those other ones but just focus on one second thing is that as I was doing a lot of this content recently which has gotten me really fulfilled and it's it feels good feels great is youtuber okay dork calm mostly YouTube mostly in YouTube world the second thing that's been most critical and this is really hard because everyone does says they do this or wants to do this but doesn't who who is my audience who is the audience that I really want to be helping and communicate with because on one hand I want to I want to connect with like nine-figure CEOs is in ten figure CEOs and you know I actually don't think is a lot of content of how do you go from seven to eight or eight to nine and I can share how we do it but that audience is really small and they don't really know as much help and so we've realized like our audience is dudes 25 to 40 that have tried to start a business that haven't been accessible that are afraid of failing and need a little bit of help and so I think the second part of marketing that I've gotten revisiting is Who am I really trying to talk to and what are the words so like here's some words that we didn't identify that our audience resonates with rat race freedom so I'm like really all right self-doubt so those are some of the things that I'm thinking about in the third part that we're we're thing anything that's applicable for every businesses what is your unique strategy of success like so with that we have two parts one what's our core messages that we're this is our unique like bread and butter that you will notice I wear a meat about this and he's like what did that you have so many messages just pick three so I was like all right challenges to overcome fear million dollar weekend and behind the scenes of an eight-figure company that's the three that we're gonna do and that's it and then the second part is they say that again so those three are the three what does recently let's take a step back so one what's your goal pick one goal number two who is your customer number three what is your core messages that people know you for so for me those are the three that I'm gonna be known for challenges which I always tell people do the coffee challenge which is take it ask for 10% off when you buy coffee you're gonna be afraid you're gonna learn about yourself and you're gonna grow secondly is behind the scenes of a need for your company so like how do you like that there's not a lot of people that have that experience and I can do that and the third part is how do you actually get a million dollar business or $100 you know a million dollar business start in a weekend which I've done many many times and I can share which is unique and then the the last part of this marketing equation that I think I'm exploring and revisiting around all these things is what is my unique strategy or what is my strategy of doing that I think where I've been very successful is I just do a lot of stuff and eventually something works but I think I will be even more successful slowing down being a little more thoughtful with these things and so our unique strategy lately has been do the fast stuff but on lower risk items so basically tweet and Instagram and LinkedIn post [ __ ] everything like throw it all out there unlimitedly and then based on what works a lot aligning to our core messages that's what will go deeper and that's what will write a blog post about that's what will do an interview about that's what we will do a YouTube video about and so is just having a higher likelihood of homeruns and how would you hi Shawn the mic like you yeah you really feel you're almost 40 I'm sir I look and feel 32 but I'd say I'm I'm about in physicality in our society 38 and that physicality in our whatever traditions of 38 okay cool years I am 32 and I look and feel 38 so you do look 30 a bro I'm trying to go the other way so and I would love so so if you were 21 again 21 no network no name brand you're starting up from scratch and you don't have to go the same pathway you went I'm curious you know if you had the luxury of picking any path now that you know of so many more paths than you probably knew about when you were 21 what path would you go down honestly I think I'd copy my path which would be what so you're 21 what do you do I'll tell you exactly what I did I didn't know what the [ __ ] to do so I wouldn't tried a bunch of stuff out to figure out what to do I think the only I think one question is what Delta would I have chosen and I'll tell you exactly what that was so at 21 I didn't know I didn't know what a BS was I got it got it from Berkley I was like Oh Bachelor so has this cool everyone kind of follows a stream right like when you graduate from college which I think less and less is becoming important and once I go get a job go to Intel go to wherever and I was like okay I guess that's what everyone's doing but I've always wanted to start my own company I didn't know what to do and so I think the two things that I did really well when I had that day job at Intel was I use that as my investor and the two things I'd recommend is that I started a lot of businesses so if you're like I don't have any idea two things you can do one go to San Fox comm and start a newsletter and send an email once a week for 365 days or for 52 weeks that's number one or number two go on YouTube take the rhein holiday challenge and post a video on YouTube for 30 days start there the second thing that I did is that I connected with people very aggressively and I asked anyone I knew for anyone that they knew that was really smart that's how I met Tim Ferriss that's how I met Warren Hoffman dave McClure James Hong Max Levchin ramit sethi I basically put on events I hosted lunches I organized conferences I didn't know anyone but I wanted to bring smart people together so if you don't know any smart people find one smart person say hey you should meet this smart person and then just go and hang out with both of them guy and growing guess what you coulda done zoom if you're in remote country or if you don't have any connections I think one of the ones I've really observed lately every person I've hired that's been the most impressive has done two things they've offered something for free to a value that I've wanted and they did it without asking and those people live in the most impressive and guess what now they're like hey I want to meet this person I want to do this thing I want to grow here and like that most of them are now working with me and so I think I would have that was something very early on I was very aggressive on meeting people and just trying to build my brand in terms of career I think the two thing one thing I did very well is I was really great about following my curiosity and things I was really excited about so I really loved Facebook and I really loved mint and I was like I'll do whatever it takes to work there um I think the only difference I would have chosen is find someone 10 to 20 years ahead of me that I think is doing the things I would would like to do in 10 to 20 years and be obsessed or aggressive in figuring out how to make them excited to want to be a part of my life so I had one guy dug her she was my boss at Facebook and it didn't really work out as well for as a mentorship but it's nice because like you can say oh that's how you do a relationship oh that's how you do a career and it'll shortcut it you just have to figure out the real most important thing is how do you get them to give a [ __ ] about you and the best way to do that is help them with whatever things they're working on so you want to hear something crazy Shawn I don't know if you know this but I don't know if Noah knows it but I launched my I created my so my company which is a it's an okay company it's been good for me it started because Noah had a blog post about organizing conferences and I was like I what was it called it was called like how I made how I made 90k hosting a conference or something was that it Noah mm-hmm I made a coordination conferences because I I didn't know I was gonna make money to him yeah so I saw that and I was like well I had a book club at the time and I was like well I didn't mean I've been hosting these meetups but I don't make any money from it I should like make money off this thing and so I started my come and he have made millions of dollars personally off conferences because of that blog post and more importantly or maybe not more importantly I've met I met actually all three people in this call and most of my friends and co-workers do because of that blog post because of that blog post I met Neville because of that blog post Neville the best man my wedding I met because of that Katrina so so what you're describing of what you would do and how basically you described like hosting events and which is similar in the same vein as posting content I did the same thing and it made me millions of dollars and I met all my best friends that way awesome I mean I think the only other thing that I was doing at the time that I think everyone should do so number one build your brand in some way even if you're not trying to be a personal brand I think practicing writing is a skill you can use in sales you can use a development you can use in design you can use it almost literally forever I think the connections very valuable literally probably the reason I'm a multimillionaire is because I've been able to meet and help people and connect people connecting and meeting but the third thing was that I was starting a lot of businesses and I think what's beautiful is if especially earlier in your life your cost of living is sodium low and my cost of living is still damn low because I'm I haven't grown up in some ways and I'm maturing in certain ways that it's so low that you should take a lot of risk very early on in trying a lot of things out so I like when I was working to Intel I was doing this college consulting I did a thing called ninja card comm I was putting on these conferences that I charged for and then I was working at mint I started doing the Facebook apps like Italy's games and I started making a lot of money but now I was working at morning I was working on weekends I was working at lunches we're working at nights I was working I was kept going and I kept trying a lot and eventually after probably two and a half three years good you know four and three or three years later my side hustle finally became my main hustle did any of those like I have we actually have a good friend encore I don't know if you know I'm Sean but me and no I do who did the same thing about the online he did like the Facebook apps and Facebook games and when I think of that [ __ ] I'm like dude that is just some scam e get-rich-quick [ __ ] is that an accurate assessment of what those were and because I was a little bit I was too young to be doing that [ __ ] in 2000 in ten or whatever became popular I wasn't interested in the internet was that is that an accurate assessment of what those were uh I think what's interesting is like how do you become a part I think what's weren't shown about the Facebook games besides whatever people spam or not spam it's like how do you be around the tidal waves so I think where I've been very fortunate and lucky is that my career either I'm an ambulance chaser or I'm like a visionary or maybe a little bit of both where like I was in the Facebook game world I was in personal finance world I was in social networking world I was in SAS world with sumo I was in e-commerce world with you know some of a Shopify and lately I'm back in the content world and I think what's been the beautiful part about that you know in an AB Summa but in the software world which has been amazing I think the amazing part about that is that it's opened up a world where my life is more rich not rich even monetarily just like rich like fill it fulfilling because of all these really cool people I've gotten to connect with like I got to meet this guy Nick Nieman and I'm gonna talk with him on Friday about videos and then I've got to meet this guy Xavier Mercedes who lives in Austin who came over and showed me how lighting like okay look let's switch lighting here let's switch lighting here and I think what's amazing is try to figure out which category is gonna either be big or which category you're interested in and then how to interject yourself in that conversation so you're like well no I'm not a developer I don't have any commerce products to start guess what start a [ __ ] YouTube channel reviewing this products or start an Instagram account where each day you just post hey here's my favorite ecommerce probably here's why or start a newsletter on Sun Fox calm like hey here's my weekly e-commerce product of the week and email that company saying hey I just promoted you this week one of the easiest things that anyone especially early on can do is flatter people Jett legitimately don't just [ __ ] and because it's obvious but just flatter hey I love your stuff that's an easy way to open the door and then do what you can to start helping people and so I think what I've been lucky and intentional about what am i curious about and what's becoming more popular and how can i connect with people that are inspiring me I would also say like sama I wouldn't call those that that Facebook game era because there's a whole bunch of other friends that we have that started or like kind of caught their first big wave on when Facebook platform opened up like the very first episode of podcasts Uli so he caught his big wave was he made a Facebook app called superlatives and it was about you know saying which of your friends most likely to end up in jail or goofy stuff like that or you know I know some of the Lowell apps guys listen to this and they were yeah they were you know the fastest growing company in the world at the time probably like you know oh my god you know you'd launch a product and get to ten million users in a day and that just breaks your mental model of the world and so I think two things hey you're right that the people who go there were the type of people that sniffed out interesting spaces before they're proven out so if you're that type of person you're gonna end up in a lot of those types of situations the second is you get this crash course on hyper growth and marketing in a way that's like you can't learn like this guy who the guy who sold tbh to Facebook recently oh yeah yeah this thing out yesterday that was like it was good first-time social app founder he's like oh we're gonna build a platform for intellectual conversations it's like you know I get 23 users and five percent retention and then he's like by the fifth year that same founders like alright let's just have people vote on who's hot and it's like result 10 million users 40% retention it's like you know it's very true it's like the only way to really ever get good is by putting yourself out there so when you're saying go start a YouTube channel or somebody goes and has to build a Facebook app and you see that the apps that grow are the ones that tap into people's core needs like they want to know about their friends they want to take quizzes about themselves and learn you know goofy personality quizzes and it's the person on the sidelines who's like oh all that stuff's dumb and what they're missing is that they don't sort of figure out you know at the end of the day you get rewarded for giving people what they want not what you want people to want and then the second thing is that if you really want to get good at anything you got to be in like the eye of the storm and these new platforms are these areas where there's a lot of growth a lot of action happening that's where you sharpen your skills so you you know you might not have ever made money off the Facebook games right like you got a bunch of great users and now I made I made money well you might have made money I think the question is if he I think you need to pick are you trying to make money trying to learn because I think sometimes when you're young you're like well I wouldn't make money off this person looks like well maybe there's a lot more long-term dividends by just trying to focus on what you can learn but the work but also wouldn't you say like I've seen this in my life sounds like you were in the same work it's when you're trying to make money that you end up learning because you're trying to do something hard and you have to learn the hard way like what actually works and what doesn't the first is if you just say I want to learn a lot of times people take a very sort of passive or intellectual approach to it now that's different than saying I want to make money so I take this job at Intel that pays me a guaranteed six figures or whatever it is you may not learn the most doing that path because you're not actually challenging yourself in the same way but what I think the two things I would highlight there is a I think there's passion or interest or curiosity and then I think there's opportunity and I think I've I've chased opportunities to make money which have been fleeting they've been profitable but fleeting and I think when you're in your 20s you should do those frankly you should just do the things that are like hot and exciting if you think want to make money and then in your 30s you start reflecting more like wow mortality is real what's really important and I think you'll come back to finding how do I work on problems and things that I want created for in my own world and for you that's what that's helping people sort of overcome their fears to start businesses that there's a one step removed from that no it's exactly that it's like I want to be on the ground level helping people overcome fears start businesses and marketing in businesses I love seeing the underdog succeed I love seen like this guy ali abdullah is a popular youtuber I love seeing companies like meat fox who got promoted appSumo and now they have a business around it or a phone wagon is a popular once a day for doing phone calls and that guy Ali he's great he's a I think he listens podcast but he's a doctor right he's a doctor youtuber or is that yeah he's so I mean he's so impressive he's like you know people like I don't have enough time this guy's a full time professional doctor making 3d high quality YouTube videos every week and he engages an audience and he's put you know it's just very genuine I really enjoy can you spell his name a li a B D a al you know and I think it's interesting is that you have to think about on the reverse of that how do you become someone that people want to meet how do you make things or do things that others want to connect with and I think we're like oh I'll just do stuff and hope for what happens this guy looks amazing I just love dough like I just did a quick google did oh you did is just dope I love this guy he's just like I found him because he blogged like hey here's some cool [ __ ] I found this week and our podcast was in it and so I was like okay who's this guy who's giving us a shout and then I checked out his YouTube channel and I was like wow this guy's amazing well I think that's something that even in my newsletter every week now we have an S section where we prune other people I think the more that you can go and this is one of the things it's like stupid obvious but no one does it it's like go help a bunch of other people and there's a good chance that you'll be able to connect and get a lot of things you want like well I heard a quote yesterday and I got to go in four minutes guys the quote that I heard yesterday that was like really powerful to me was uh it was like your rewards in life will be exact proportion to your contribution that's interesting I don't know if it's true though because I feel like I you can definitely make money by like some [ __ ] Facebook like a fleeting app you know what I mean but I definitely think it's a way to live by but can can I bring something up within the last three minutes so it four weeks ago or three weeks ago Sean told me about a book called happy body and I told I was with Neville Noah last week or two weeks ago and I was like yeah I Sean told me about this book I'm gonna buy it and Neville was like oh I have it upstairs let me go get it for you he gave it to me then he gave it and then Noah was like wait what's this book and I think he added a buying I've been doing those exercises in that book I feel great have you guys been doing that so basically just got the book yesterday so I have no idea what you're talking oh my god basically I'm what I'm realizing and is I on this podcast said I had scoliosis and I had like 30 or 40 people reach out to me say they also have scoliosis and so then I started doing this book to help fix it it's been awesome I've my back feels so much better you get edges your back feel better Sean I never had back pain so I what it's not my I wasn't doing it for that I just like I read the philosophy and I was like oh I vibe with this like this makes sense to me I don't feel like I'm being sold to I think this this seems like one of those like fundamental truths about the way your body works and how you should like sort of tune it and so I started to like it but I haven't been like doing all of those actually I've been swimming a bunch but like I haven't been doing those exercises in but yeah if your back hurts give it a shot you know like back pain is one of those like you know quality-of-life ruiners if you have it and so you know you just gotta try [ __ ] everything if you have back pain well Noah was talking about getting older and trying to feel younger and before this podcast he took his shirt off and showed me his body and that's what we do that's what real friends do but golly this thing has totally made a difference we aren't getting I'm not getting pay to say this but that shit's awesome right so no let's ask you then what is been the the best either decision purchase change like that has lifted your quality of life on a day-to-day basis that you've done you know in the that comes to mind recent memory take a minute you could think about it yeah I think they're probably about I'd say three and then I got a jump off so number one buying my Tesla I think it's not about the Tesla but I think it's about I think I we're conditioned that like in materialism is evil and I think it's more about is there ways that we could use money to make our lives better so I think that's been really powerful for me to like wow really enjoy something versus getting the cheaper like me I like Miatas and having me out in the backyard but it's like nice have something amazing and I wonder what else in my life gonna have that would be amazing and that I can also be amazing because I think it's something to say about what is your stuff say about you the second thing I would think about is journaling right so I've been using Bare app I think one of the you guys asked for three business opportunites one of them is technology advisor there's so much new tech new cameras new everything like I think you can go make a lot of money coaching people well but they're bare dot app or bear app notes I really enjoyed every literally Journal five days a week and it's been really helpful to understand myself better and learn my interests and motivations and fears and all this stuff and then that those two have definitely been powerful I'm trying to think of the third thing that's really and I think the third thing that for me is really changed my life is observing where I'm living and how much my space affects my energy so I've been renting Airbnb ease and I'm gonna be moving because I'm like you know there's something there about your space and how much it can impact you professionally and personally guys I gotta go I love you guys Thank You Sean let's stay on but Noah let's come back again and actually talk about some business stuff because that's awesome I also wanna do the other thing thank you have a good day guys you too yeah thanks Sean but you want to talk about anything Noah said Sean you know a lot of it was really relevant to me because I think the things he's talking about like the thing he spent like I don't know 15 years doing now he's building up this audience this like putting out great content that's gonna help people and like distills down his wisdom like okay I learned something too active me trying to teach it to somebody else will help me learn it better I think that's the vibe I get from him that's what I want to do that's what I find in most enjoyable my life anyways so personally I thought that stuff was interesting if you're not trying to be a content creator I don't know how useful that part will be for people but honestly these are pretty universal like just like tactics to get [ __ ] done and get [ __ ] out there and like be an action person and so yeah I like I like his message around being an action person I wish we've gone into ideas cuz I think he's a kind of idea starter like he said and so maybe what we do is we have them come on and we do just ideas that we could even release this as a double episode you know sort of ideas plus interview to our sort of session well he's coming he's moving to San Francisco for a month I think next week he's staying at Andrew Chen's house and we definitely could do that I one thing here I'll actually bring up something that he mentioned that is not related any that self-help stuff which I enjoyed but what kind of so he talked about his space and buying a nice car so I think I just spent three weeks in living in Austin I think I'm gonna give up my place in San Francisco I'm gonna spend four to eight weeks in different cities and see what happens so I'm gonna buy a car I don't know what type of car I should buy but I'm gonna buy a nice car and I'm gonna drive all over the country that's great and so to the listeners but I want to ask your opinion on that but also to the listeners if you want to rent my apartment I'll give it to you for six months it's 4k a month I live in Glen Park it's a lovely neighborhood and it's furnished and I have a gym here a home gym a really nice one so you message me on Twitter if you want to rent it otherwise I'm gonna give it up and I don't want to sighs dude you should charge a premium this is rents sleeping sambars bed for 8km unthe actually you know get that good good yeah no there is no pre maybe I should [ __ ] I just blew my yeah - except for guys who's willing to except for I know I I wasn't gonna make money on it I just you just cover the expenses I Austin is amazing more people should I don't know what sometimes I'm Michael it's over there so a couple years ago I made a decision to do something similar where I was like I was sitting in San Francisco but I was like why am I just here all the time like life is so big the world is so big and so so I told my girlfriend at the time I was like let's go you know now my wife but at the time we were just dating I think and I was like let's go live in South America for the next six weeks and like I'll just work from there but like let's just go pick a cool city that we are not gonna live in long term and I want to move but I want to go live there and I was like wait a minute I can live there without moving and the way that San Francisco works is like an arbitrage where you can Airbnb your house or your apartment and you could make more you could literally live for free somewhere else in the world you know get free vacation so that's what I did it went for five or six weeks we lived in Buenos Aires Argentina and and we just lived there like a local not like exact year what year was this expat but it was better than crap wasn't a vacation it wasn't like go sightsee take a bunch of photos and leave after five days it was like okay we're gonna live here like what's the coffee shop we should go to how do we get groceries and like that was just a way better experience I was like I'm gonna do this every year but then one year was like oh we're getting married and then I had a kid now I don't know what I'm gonna do it so wait but you did do it I did do it for one year and I plan to do it again this year now that my my child is a little bit older I think we can go do it now cuz she's almost a year old so I'll do it again so my logic is I'm only going to go to places I could drive to for two reasons one Corona and two my dog who I considered part of my family I he's old and I would not want to leave him behind and I don't know if you can bring a dog you could probably bring a dog to some European countries but like in a lot of places they have like a three-week quarantine you could get to Canada you could get to Mexico that's cool well so I would move to Mexico City in a heartbeat no have you been there I've never been but everybody who I know says the same thing it's like amazing it's amazing like I remember I was there when Trump was just getting elected and he was talking about the wall and I was in like a hipster neighborhood and I asked my barber I go what do you think about this trunk I tell my wall he goes I don't give a [ __ ] about what he says like I want he goes yeah build the wall that will keep you guys or coveted this is amazing here do not try to go to America and I was like oh man you've just broken all these stupid stereotypes I've had in my head thank you so and and so yeah they're gonna need a wall to keep me out of Mexico City because that place is lovely it's oh I would totally want to live there the Mexicans were awesome people I love the neighborhoods but Corona I'm nervous about Corona at the moment yeah Corona and before this it was what's it called Zika which I can people didn't really care about but Zika scariest [ __ ] especially if you're like we were gonna have a kid we knew that and Zika like basically you could become a carrier for a year or so and pass it to your baby so that was like a scary this that's what that killed it one year and now Corona it's like I don't know what I'm gonna do it but I'm gonna do it I think I'm gonna do Canada because I trust the Canadians around Corona where Vancouver Vancouver or somewhere remote who knows cuz like but like why would you do remote Canada when it's like the same [ __ ] it's like Montana is that I also don't I also would go to Montana Manset Montana it's cool too but you know I don't I don't mind that that's a change of pace what car should I buy should I do this in a f-150 truck should I do this in a Subaru that I like put off-road tires on what should I buy I thought about at rasuluh well that doesn't come out till 2020 water and I want to leave in August you could do you could do that as a Tesla SUV or you could do the f-150 I think that would be hilarious although that's kind of cramped and not the not the most ideal y know an f-150 is for you can get a four-door but a cyber or Tesla would be [ __ ] horrible wouldn't it for a 3,000 mile trip why cuz like wouldn't you have to pull over every every 300 miles for an hour the superchargers are pretty fast and it goes like I think the the new ones are whatever girl like 600 miles or something crazy it's interesting maybe I would do that yeah do it definitely do it in something that is not your usual well that's what Noah said that inspired me I was like I'm not gonna penny pitch I'm gonna buy the nice [ __ ] that I want waiting for you just waiting for somebody to be like you know what's cool buying cool [ __ ] that's right that resonated with me too I'm always doing like penny pitching [ __ ] so I need to step that up you want to go over anything else I have a bunch of ideas that I added to the thing but I feel like we should just do like an episode about it like a full episode about those ideas so I think we should keep this one kind of Noah and then yeah I have a bunch but it would be like an hour okay I have a bunch too they range from interactive email to I have a bunch of ideas around privacy stuff that fascinate me a ton and Korona stuff someone's got to create the organic label but for like is your restaurant Korona clean oh yeah like the it's like the you know the health score but like this is difficult at around Korona hygiene yeah that's I'm gonna bring up what are you gonna bring up okay I'm just gonna read you some of my quick notes that I had here one it's called Scott Galloway being super wrong another one I know exactly what you're going with that and I'm very interested another one is scams that I found interesting and I have four examples of scams that I found interesting another one is WikiLeaks for creeps because Chris D'Elia turned out to be a creep and then another one is how the 37signals guys are marketing their new thing hey calm I think it's pretty interesting how they're going about that and then I have a bunch of startup ideas that are around one is around baseball cards one's around yeah we got a bunch of ideas so we

you know I think I've changed my mind I think that investing is [ __ ] stupid okay let's jump right in people been craving a brainstorm and we're gonna give them a brainstorm can I tell you one thing really quick before we get to the brainstorm yeah let's do it okay so I'm gonna go buy a car in about three hours and I'm gonna live starting August I'm gonna live in a new city each month for 12 months and it's gonna be I'm looking for a list of happiest cities so okay how about let me know well I've seen that once before and I think it was like you're talking about us only right I think like Switzerland or Sweden is number one or something yeah I would go to Canada I want to go to Mexico City because I love it but the corona thing I don't think is under control there at least to drive there I wouldn't to drive through those cities in order to get there so where are you starting do you know number one I think it's gonna be Provo is it called Provo or Provost what's called probably Utah Utah the Mormons like are definitely the happiest so I'm gonna go and hang out with them and and then I don't know I got a plan it okay well I think that's good you should figure it out as you go and somebody somebody tweeted this as a reply because I think you mentioned this maybe on the last one and they were like dude you must have the coolest wife who's just dad to do all this stuff they're like you think we need to get her on the pod so I have two questions for you about that eh what's her reaction to your you know life plans like this like crazy life plans is she does she feed into them does she pull you back a little bit and say hey here's what's a little more realistic is she just down for whatever like what's her what's her down yeah she's a little more conservative than I am but she's down but does this seem like a crazy idea this doesn't seem like a crazy idea at all I don't think it's crazy necessarily but it's an orthodox right like most people don't do this let's say it's unusual I don't think it's crazy I think it's good here why I think this is weird if I told my wife if I said well now we have a baby so that's probably his place when you were childless yeah yeah I if I had said hey I want to move every month to a different City she would have been like why are we doing all this like no let's not do that like okay you wanna go on vacation let's go on vacation I think that would have been a reaction no we're really pushed for it if I was like I need this she would have done it but it helps that I don't have kids and we know that we're gonna have Sara's 27 so we're gonna have kids in three years so we're definitely like let's just party right yeah that's good Sonny's a year older than me and so for day one it's been like yo buddy I'm on the clock let's do this okay so that's one thing that's one question and then the second question is does she listen to the podcast yeah yeah she does so alright nice that would be interesting to have wives come on because they have to deal like how do they handle like Sarah it's a handful for her to work with me for sure like because I'm so crazy we should do a crazy happy hour episode one time right night happy hour episode not crazy like I want to do a wild [ __ ] all the time but emotionally I'm just like [ __ ] nuts I think a lot of people who create stuff are so she does have to put up with [ __ ] she's patient so it's good my wife is goes crazy on the miner and is down for the major and what I mean by that is like if I if I suggest something that's a minor change or inconvenience or or setback she overreacts and then if I'm like like she was pregnant and I was like I'm gonna quit my job we're gonna have no healthcare I'm gonna go do this crazy thing it's super high risk high reward and she was like okay yeah I believe in you and so like on the major things she's like the switch flips in her head and she's like okay I gotta be super resilient now wait did you just reveal something no this was before oh and when she was writing it before before we had a baby cuz I was like look I'm gonna sell this company or I'm gonna end the company but one of two ways we're not gonna continue this as is like I'm gonna go for the sale hard for 30 days which is too short and if we if we get a term sheet we get a term sheet if we don't get a term sheet I actually want to just go do something else that I think has higher upside and that'll mean no salary no healthcare no nothing and if this doesn't work out well and you moved I mean you I feel like you bought a house and moved on a whim yeah I did that too okay let's jump it let's do some of these topics what do you got what do you wanna start okay let's start with duck duck okay I've I was on the James Altucher podcast James was here with us a few weeks ago James is like a like a dork nerdy guy I say this would love I like him a lot he's like a nerdy guy libertarian guy libertarian audience and I can't decide if this whole privacy stuff that we're talking about so hey calm female service launched a few days ago a few weeks ago a week ago yeah its premise is like we're one of its many promises it's on privacy okay and so I'm really into this privacy thing the founder of Pandora told me that he is seeing his customers who are middle America people actually care about privacy and when I was on my trip I saw DuckDuckGo billboards everywhere for those who don't know duck taco it's a google competitor it's a search engine and they it's all based on they don't track you which like [ __ ] ruins the business model have no idea how they make money but no no it doesn't so their thing was like it's not no ads so they still do search ads but they're like look when you search for you said you're gonna go buy a new car when you go search for you know Mercedes versus BMW or whatever you're gonna search for they'll serve you an ad they just don't need to know that you're sampar that you live in this place that you have life you know they don't need the personal data for the ads to still be effective because search is high intent they know what you're looking for so they can serve you of relevant ad and their insight was the slight drop off you get by not personalizing is not so bad if that can become your value proposition that hey we're not using personal information to serve these ads okay so I just sent you their traffic DuckDuckGo comm slash traffic so here's my question to you first of all and we're looking at a hockey stick we're looking at anomalous and 10 2010 they're at you know this is this is queries per dare this is average yeah so they average 62 million queries per day I have no idea I mean what do you think Google's queries per day probably like like 5 billion I mean a brief see if you can find let's see if you can find Google's careers today so we could put this so 3.5 billion off ok ok yes corrine Google or duck duck goes at 50 50 60 million a day so the I don't even know what's that like 3% the size anyway DuckDuckGo what do you think about that I personally love this and what I want to know from you is do you like deco and do you also think this privacy thing like building products where the main feature or values in like or like the main thing the brain stands for is privacy do you think that's gonna be it I think it's a hit I used to think the opposite I used to be of the camp that was like look people don't give a [ __ ] like if you just say yeah sure in theory people want privacy if you offer no privacy or privacy but when it comes down to products they're like oh this is a free good thing and I have to give up all my data all right here you go and so I used to think that people in practice were willing to easily trade privacy and I think that's still true on the whole oh yes where is the pendulum swinging and so I think the pendulum is swinging more towards people caring about privacy because every these things stack up right so as you you know the more paranoid you get the less lack of trust you have in the system and of the of the big companies it doesn't matter you don't have to know which one is the straw that breaks the camel's back maybe it's the fake new stuff on Facebook maybe it's when your information gets breached for the 35th time and you get an email saying hey sorry your personal if I might've been leaked but you don't know where it is but these things just keep happening and to the point where I believe people care more than they did before and they'll continue to care more that's number one number two you have to do it on a global product like a product everybody uses cuz it's still a niche audience all right like you said Google is about 50 times the search query size then induct echo up so like 50 to one and so you need a product that's used by pretty much everybody for that those ones to add up and be a big enough market for you so I wouldn't do it on some niche products like oh you do you know some niche mailing you know MailChimp software thing cool I'm gonna make a privacy focused version it's like no that's that's an issue of a niche well if it's about ego stream it works like hey calm I caught hey calm Global write emails everybody yes it is global but like you don't need that many users to build a billion-dollar company totally what I'm - that's was saying though you need you're only gonna get the sort of 2% let's say that value privacy enough to make a change and so you know like superhuman did the same thing email such a huge market cool we'll go get the 1% 2% who are willing to pay 30 bucks a month for a free for instead of free email I think this is anything happening here I pray you how old are you 27 you're a little old for this question the zoom ray just five years ago no it's a generational thing I want to know do the 22 year olds give a [ __ ] about this because the way that the Zoomers the way that they live and think is really [ __ ] about getting coronaviruses the privacy of their data they don't care about their body they're a pretty conscientious group of people i think i don't know i would i want to know how they think but that was my question okay so here's another private here's another opportunity for privacy that I'm interested in do you know that when you go to Safeway so in California we have Safeway in the South you've got Kroger and the other South you've got Publix what else is there Albertsons Albertsons okay so when you go to your grocery store like your major grocery store you enter in your phone number to get a discount right what they do with that is they understand your buying behavior and they'll show you they'll send you stuff in the mail or they will just learn about inventory whatever and this is incredibly effective so effective that there's a famous story about a woman being a sixteen year old get a woman getting mailed stuff to her dad's home saying like baby supplies and the dad was like right hey my daughter sixteen she's not pregnant what he talked about turns out she was pregnant and they knew it because in your party yeah yeah month you know what to buy anyway when you go and buy that ship did you know that you can submit like a request and they'll send you all of your do not track request well that you could do it do not track and they can send you everything you've ever bought oh that's pretty cool okay I like it so what what would you do with that data yeah I think that's just an interesting thing you could do in general like a mint calm style I think you could say hey what's your phone number okay then you go request it on behalf of the customer and you give them cool visualizations about their spending patterns over time and other products they might like but I don't what do you would I do with that data if I was the company or if I was myself what do you think if you're trying to build a business I would go figure out other areas where this sort of like linking and tracking will work and so so a lot of people have already done this right like the ad market it's kind of like porn where porn innovates first okay a close second or third might be the ad market so you know fir Khan who was kind of my co-founder or CTO of my previous company his previous company was an ad tech company and they one of the versions of their app that they made so the company is called app lovin and so initially the premise was what apps are your friends loving we will recommend those apps to you and so it was like if I know what apps you have and I know that you're my friend because you're in my address book then it can tell me that sampar loves this app I thought it was a play on McLovin no it was I don't know maybe that was a side benefit because every love super bad but won it but then all kinds of little edge cases started [ __ ] them up so they would you know record they would tell me that you love Grindr right like so so first it's like not everybody's app behavior they want to be transparent to their friends or their contacts and I think there was one really horrible case where this so then they switched us trying to do this for app installs so they're like okay if I'm playing a game and it's awesome I'm sorry forget about it's awesome I'm playing a game and they want you to download that game because they get paid 9 bucks if you download the game they would show my face from your address book as hey Shaun's playing candy crush right now tap here to play candy crush - and that was like a super effective ad unit like there were like printing money and I think something really bad happened we're like the CEO of Expedia or something like that got an ad that like his deceased wife was playing this game or something like that like someone from his address book who had this app was shown to him and he's like what the hell is this and so it got back to them and they had to turn it off and they would they they did they did a similar experiment around location tracking like have a life 360 thing so yeah you're really careful with these like data oh let's use data to give you information about either yourself or others you can get the situation like the dad who finds out a 16 year olds pregnant I long story short privacy okay I have a privacy idea for you I love a privacy idea for you so I just think it's just because I've become like I like the older I've gotten I've gotten like more libertarian and like [ __ ] the government like mentality well there's two things are happening there's people who bring on a libertarian which is like eff the government and if the man in general and then there's people are becoming more nationalistic which is like it's us first them and us first them main sort of keep them out and raise us up and I think in both cases you see this sort of like retreat in both cases it's sort of it's not like a shelter in place physically but it's a shelter in place sort of psychologically behaviorally where you reduce your like openness and your spread it you know in your behaviors and your data in another way so I think people in general when times get a little crazy people there's a flight to safety and I see I think you see this with investing I think you see this with the way people act and behave so I think that more people do it when they're when times get turbulent now a privacy focused idea that I had the other day so moved into this new house need to get internet set up oh [ __ ] got to play the Comcast game Comcast comes over and of course you know Wi-Fi doesn't really work great in my house so I was like okay I need to invest in good Wi-Fi because not having good Wi-Fi is like not having water to drink and so I'm like looking for these like Eero these kind of mesh networks that you use in your house I just thought one give you more coverage so I just bought euro but I was talking to FERC on and I was like I think euro sucks well I hope it doesn't slash because I just bought it but but the idea that I was thinking about was you know how when you what typically happens you have your Wi-Fi router and then on your laptop you'll have like a VPN so a lot of people have VPNs VPNs are more and more popular some people have it for work some people have it to hide their traffic as they go bootleg movies on the internet and they don't want it to be sort of traced to them and so VPNs are kind of complicated like to set up like you got to download one you don't know if it's malware you're setting it up the average person doesn't know what the hell VPN is I was asking I've done a ton of research on this market well the idea was actually why don't you build VPN into the router so you never need it down anything it's just VPN by default and it'll thing into the hardware itself and so you actually the the value prop of the router is this is secure Internet and and so there so he so forgot of course like you know there's people doing this and so I can't say I'm the first to have this idea but he was telling me about a couple of companies to check out if you're interested in this so next DNS is one of them ubiquity is another one and so he was showing me a few of these that today are still kind of like you kind of need to be a developer to a know about these or be like know how to configure them to set them up and so I think if somebody takes the zero level of simplicity and design but they make the value prop hey your your internet search traffic your whatever you're doing on the Internet is private if you buy this box instead of that box I think hard thing behind that the hard thing about these compass so first of all the VPN in businesses I did a I wrote about them because I think that it's gonna explode and they already are exploding but a lot of them are based in Panama because of the privacy laws there and a lot of them are notoriously scammy and weird they're also ridiculously profitable like I talked to the one guy he had one it made twenty million dollars a year in revenue and like a hundred million in profit like right stupid but euro do you remember you know euro got bought by Google I think Amazon I think Amazon it like God acquired for nothing these companies are so hard to make money because it cost so much money right yeah I think hardware is hard everybody knows that like ring doorbell you know it gets a billion dollar outcome but like I don't think it was like ultra profitable at the time I think was strategic the reason it got bought but the reason I think Wi-Fi router is interesting because Wi-Fi is like email it's like Google search it's a thing that everybody has every every physical place has a router and so though two percent of that market that cares about privacy I think is still a big market and I think I don't I don't believe that it's so hard to make money because again you like with this Comcast box that I have here I got to pay these guys fourteen bucks a month just for this router to sit here it's no way this router is worth more than like fifty dollars but they're gonna make money on me you know break even in five months and they know I'm never gonna like get rid of my router and so so yeah I think that there's something interesting there yeah also [ __ ] those guys this episode is brought to you by what do you got okay here's something interesting I saw the other day all right so by the way this Costco for services that I bear you put freaking awesome but go ahead yes okay you wanna do that one let's do that wow I don't know anything about it I pray you got a problem I want to hear but you keep doing what you're doing then we'll do that one okay all right so the one I was gonna say is much more pouring it's so it's about tax so I've been getting into tax stuff now because when you get a little bit of money you're like oh [ __ ] why am i paying so much tax is there a way I think rich people avoid this how did they do that I need to learn their game and so I was learning about like a what are legal sort of tax avoidance tax shelter strategies how do you you know avoid paying forty eight percent tax which is what I ended up paying a lot of stuff in California here and so so one of the things that I learned about was so there's solar credits right so Solar is one of these things that the government subsidizes so if you have a building you can buy solar and you can take a hundred percent of the installation cost as tax write-off so I was like okay that's cool but okay where am I gonna put that on my house I don't know and I don't really dude solar I'm so ignorant when it comes to taxes so when you say right off that just reduces that just increases your income yeah like let's say you make a million bucks if you're gonna pay you know 40 something percent 43 to 48 percent tax here in California cuz it's let's say it was all ordinary income and and you're in the highest tax bracket so you're gonna pay all that in tax now you know if you're if you have certain business expenses or personal losses or tax offsets you can reduce your your overall tax burden so instead of paying 400 grand in taxes you pay 300 grand which saves you a hundred grand so you gotta buy the damn thing you still gotta buy the damn thing but but if you if you need a thing or you like with solar so this is where I'm getting at so typically with solar it's like oh well I need power anyways I'll save every month on my monthly bill and I can get a tax write-off today so there's a good investment right I'll take 100 grand I'll put it in alright 100 grand immediately on my taxes so it's sort of like I got the thing for free and then I'm gonna get a lower utility bill every month after that right so that's the theory why don't but you get it for free I kind of I'm so stupid I don't know I'm gonna spend an extra hundred grand but immediately by spending that I can write off the hundred grand off my taxes so yes I had to take another hundred grand out of pocket but now I have to pay a hundred grand less in taxes right so you can see how it offsets your tax but no you don't pay a hug god we said I think I just I'm so fearful of something like such a [ __ ] idiot I don't Stu I think I don't think you might could be wrong too but I don't think you you spend a hundred grand less in taxes you spend a hundred gram times forty three percent like no it's like a hundred grand less it's not let's say my total tax is if my total taxes do was four hundred grand and I have a hundred thousand dollar offset you know a deduction that I could that I can make so you take my total tax bill four hundred thousand and you reduce it by a hundred thousand so now my total tax bill is three hundred thousand that's how it works for sure okay okay so anyways I know nothing so I've been trying to find what are these deductions how do they work do I do I qualify now interesting market that I saw so my my father-in-law was like yeah you know with solar I was like I don't own a building he's like yeah if you own real estate you know you can depreciate the real estate you can do solar as I kind of owned a building so what do you want me to do here he's like well you know technically you could buy the solar for another building and lease it to them and then you write off your hole and your capex whatever and so what I found was there's this business so if you ever noticed there's a long way of saying if you notice when you drive by schools that schools all have solar panels on top now and so if you see in California especially you go every middle school high school is just got solar panels all along the roof and the way this works I found out was companies like Chevron and Exxon or whoever they want so they want tax credits and so what they do is they go to the school say hey we will buy solar for your school and they buy solar panels for the school it becomes a tax write-off to them the school leases it from Chevron and so Chevron gets a monthly payment from the school and the school gets lower utilities without ever taking a dollar out of its pocket so I thought this is very interesting and it sort of I don't know much about this yet and so I'm a I'm gonna dig into this but it seems like there's a there's a business to be had for basically pairing up schools churches other types of entities that want solar they want a lower utility bill they don't have the money to invest to do this whole infrastructure thing and businesses which are looking for tax write-offs and just make it where you push a button the project happens and you receive your paperwork that says here's your deduction and here's your income stream coming from the lease so I think there's a business to be built basically pairing up the two sides of the marketplace a physical building like a school or whatever that needs that wants solar it doesn't to pay any money he doesn't to do any work and a company that's looking for tax write-offs that that's willing to go give that school solar in exchange for the tax write-off love it I'm gonna tell you something even similar as well and this is in the same vein of half very half-baked 10% baked 1% begged most highway medians and government property or public property has grass and the reason it the reason it has grass as grass is the cheapest way to cover land okay but grass is actually incredibly expensive to upkeep like if you're in a median you have to mow it like the way that the math works out it's something like I forget the exact there's there's math behind this but and then plus having to mow it and water it and do all this stuff it's incredibly expensive and in LA I have to remember the numbers but in LA I think that like 20 or 30 percent of all water went to watering lawns right and so what they did was they tested this out and they gave turf to their residents they just gave it away they go here bull here will do it for you yeah and it reduced water usage significant amount and I started thinking about it I'm like that's kind of interesting what if you just went to the government and you're like I'm we're just gonna let's let's just turf all the all the medians in America right and I cuz I heard that NPR they did this whole this whole this whole thing they like about how bad grass is and I was like that's pretty amazing I got a look into this and I have not looked into it so this is what I sound like there's a [ __ ] it this whole episode but no let me give you one more okay say here's okay here's the general theme of these really random ass topics we're talking about is when you look around the world and is what I'm now training my brain to do when you look around the world and you see some item or object or patch of grass just think to yourself how did this get here and what you realize is there is a business underneath every single thing like this is what going back to when we said you know in offices you got that poster about like the kind of HR hazards or whatever like the super stupid labor law poster you have to come in here I think it's a huge business that's a Hellmouth I was blind to this right I just saw this poster I didn't ask how it got there I didn't ask why it had to be there why every office has this but whoever asked that question realized there's an opportunity here and they started laminating these [ __ ] posters and making 50 million dollars a year giving you this annual poster that you have to update in your office so that's the the test for the for the listener is start to look at the world and say how did this get here who wanted this here what is the economics of this again oftentimes the that that's a good great point Sean a lot of times when people they don't think about that stuff and it what if you dug deep a lot of times you could realize that there was some bureaucratic decision that was a [ __ ] horrible decision right yeah and there could be opportunity could be a totally busted so a lot of times there is like a scrappy entrepreneur who comes up with something cool like that sign business other times it's like well why did you guys decide to like make the screws 5 inches instead of 6 inches it's like because like the six on the keyboard was worn out right right alright so here's another example of these like hidden in plain sight businesses all right you go to a you go to a airport you take a flight you go to baggage claim ok cool night nine times out of ten your bags there now the other ten times out of the out of 100 or whatever you know your bag is lost and they recover it but there still ends up being this point three percent of luggage that's never claimed and the number point three so it goes to ninety-nine point seven percent of luggage I believe is gets claimed and so 0.3% of luggage is just unclaimed baggage so I saw this business called unclaimed baggage what they have done is they went and they partnered with every airline and they said - we will take the unclaimed baggage because they have some protocol like I don't know what it is like after 21 days if no one claims it now we're just stuck with this [ __ ] and somebody was like hey that is not [ __ ] that's a suitcase and that's some stuff inside and yeah so they were like David seen the 16 minutes episode on this it was like I'm not serious Bama Birmingham Alabama I believe you're play there based somewhere random it's the yeah they have a physical store in where's yeah Alabama Scottsboro Alabama yeah I know this company well I love it so you can go to their website Unclaimed Baggage comm it's there's things as the nation's only retailer of lost luggage that caught my eye anytime you say only that means I locked up an exclusive on this [ __ ] I'm so happy that I can be the only player which means I'm gonna extract a lot of value here so what they do is they donate a bunch of stuff that they get into bags to charities cool there's a feel-good component to this they take orphaned bags and they recycle them they sell them or they donate them and those three combined or a business and so this was just like to me such a cool clever idea I couldn't find like their revenue I didn't have a chance to check but you can go on the site and it's like to call again unclaimed unclaimed bag it's like you'll buy this there's a Rolling Stones collector's limited edition leather motorcycle jacket for five hundred dollars up on up for auction on this thing what's the call uncle unclaimed baggage unclaimed baggage calm well we could find this out I I remember sixty minutes but it did a big like expose on the a while ago and it was like oh uh they they have like tens of thousands of square French right yeah they're huge huge facility there the other one that's like this which i think is more popular people know about this more is the group that takes the okay you go to a hotel you use you know two squirts of shampoo out of the mini bottle and now there's still three squirts left and then you check out and they can't they don't want to give that empty half-empty bottle to the next guess so they ditch it and so some guy was like wool that's a lot of waste of plastic and shampoo and so someone started going into hotels and partner and said I will take all your used shampoo bottles conditioner bottles body wash whatever and so they built a huge business just recycling this I love that they take it they reuse the goods they donate certain things to charity and it's such a good business it's like doing good while doing well and I think those are great I love that here's why I just googled so Doyle Owens is the founder of Unclaimed Baggage he's he's dead now he died recently and if you google I'm he's just like an old Southern right white looking to I mean just a normal ass looking dude and a guy who watches Billy Madison three times a day well the reason why I like him is because or I like this is because I think that people tend to overcomplicate things and like I'm very passionate about the mission of reducing waste just like you just don't like the idea of don't consume what you don't have to consume it just don't be wasteful I was raised Catholic I'm like this idea of like gluttony and like waste it just as it's in my blood like I hate it this [ __ ] guy this is like the definition of just like turn and [ __ ] into goal of just like right she's just like it's a super simple it's not fancy it's an Alabama which you know I'm from the south so but no disrespect to the south but like people look down on that [ __ ] because I think they're in Silicon Valley that they're special and he's just that this guy reduced waste significantly and got very wealthy in the process right loved it and created he probably created maybe thousands of jobs for like low income people this guy is the best I love this if you have if you know about a business like this I'll call the hidden in plain sight you know super simple ideas just things that when you look around the world most people just take them for granted and then somebody out there's like no wait how did this get here who picks this up when it's done what's the business of that tweet those at me I want to know what other businesses are like this out there did you joint did you make a life to get them do you make that term up no I think they use that term for like serial killers that are just in society so like that's where I've heard it it's like criminals in some way but I don't know yeah it's a phrase do Doyle Owens is this guy's name who started Unclaimed Baggage I love this guy Doyle I hope you listen to this he's dead sorry I said you know dad I'm looking at his obituary he's dead damn this guy is [ __ ] awesome don't no one go into this market I want this family to be I love this family three seconds of silence for Doyle [ __ ] there's a big New York time this is I got to cover this on the hustle this is a super interesting story an example of this that you guys covered on the hustle is the mannequin lady in Oakland yeah takes you know I guess either used or damaged mannequins out of stores cuz again what are you gonna do with this hunk of plastic like who needs this mannequin and she's just got a warehouse of mannequins and then ships them out and makes it killing so so there that's another example of these Oh like these are parts of the world that you didn't realize are businesses all right Aubry you give us Casco for services what are you thinking here so this is kind of like a pin duo dual thing right so yep shop in bulk you get a discount so this is a two-part thing so what you would do is you would go to these companies SAS companies to say looking Adobe and say hey what kind of tears what kind of pricing you know discount per tier would you offer let's say hey if I can bring a hundred customers we can offer 10 percent discount five percent discount of our normal prices the second thing would obviously just you know have a website where people can kind of create groups and claim that discount right you can call them pods clusters let's say you got a 10% discount for 50 people the website will show hey 40 people already in this pod ten more you guys get to clean this discount yeah what you're describing is group buying and it could be great a few companies that do something similar to this are app sumo stack social I think does it they're they're good companies I know and then there's a new one called um is it called secret or ghost you know talking about Sean no ghost is like a blogging platform so I think it's called secret or something like that anyway it's called secret I think I'm looking at them I was gonna partner with them in some capacity it's an interesting business model that a lot of people have tried founder's card is another one that's like a probably a twelve million dollar a year business it's it's an interesting business no one has actually made this scale wonderfully and I talked to um I'm gonna name drop a little and at the backstage of hustla con we had the founder of we were not the one that's in the news but the other one Miguel is his name and he and what they did with they I don't remember how many tenants they had maybe fifty thousand at the time and he said they launched just like rewards card where they got group discounts and he said no one used it and that shocks me because what you're describing Abreu I'm like yeah ever you want to save money of course you're gonna use that but for some reason people don't do it I don't know why businesses that have made this work in an indirect rate way are RetailMeNot they kind of make it they made it work a little bit I mean it's that company sold for like a billion dollars I think I mean it was a huge exit or maybe it's still independent but large business what do you think Sean I like group buying I have a friend who taught me a lot about group buying car he was telling me a lot about group buying companies everything was fascinating but I don't retain any of the I didn't retain any of the information so we're gonna have to ask him to come on and explain some of these group buying companies alright let's move on to the next one I have some other interesting things first did you know Jeff Bezos was adopted yeah by keeping that keep it dead I don't think he was adopted as an orphan I think his like mom remarried you know his dad left or his parents got split his mom remarried and as does he have it so talked to his normal I don't think so because for Father's Day he posted like this is my dad and so I don't know that's like a well I read his bio he considers his Cuban father which I think is a step like he's a Cuban guy as his dad dad his real dad yeah and I just thought was crazy like imagine adopting the wealthiest man in the world Steve Jobs was adopted I too and then he met his birth father at a restaurant and his birth father didn't know that that was oh I didn't know that I am a pianist and then when he went to the restaurant and he saw his birth father Steve knew whose birth father was and the birth father goes oh my god Steve Jobs is at my restaurant I cannot leave this and like flipped out over it I don't think he Steve ever told him he was his son that's amazing I didn't I didn't know about that okay I have another company that I think is cool I want to talk about that's it you're just gonna save Jeff Bezos that's the whole subject I just thought imagine adopting someone who became Jeff Bezos that's crazy okay let me tell you a quick tip that is a business Companies House that's the name of it and then there's the equivalent of Australia did you know that in Australia in many of the countries in Europe if you're a privately held company that's above like 40 million in revenue I think you have to submit an annual report yes I didn't know that I went to the Australia's version and a British I'll show you the version it cost $5 per port it's called Companies House for Britain it's completely free I just like looked up all these cool companies and you can see how much like dividends they make right if my friend started this in in Great Britain also called due diligence this is called do deal is his company and I think it's like a massively last I checked it was like a massively successful company and I was like how are you getting all this private company data he's like oh it's just like you have to make it available here so what we do is we just aggregate it present it make it searchable and I was like oh my god like you know Jesus how you know hey I wish that existed in the US and B what a simple beautiful business to do I'm looking at the amazing did you find anything interesting from these or did you want to shout them at his cool tool so what was the one I'm gonna check out the Australian one it was what house company house that's Britain it's free I don't know what it was just easy to use like am i I know it's not Companies House is easy to use the Australian one it's not easy it was called the Australian AAS I see Australian Securities and Investment Commission I guess that's their equivalent of the SEC right and it cost money so I looked up a research business that was similar to mine and I was curious and the founder just pays himself ten million dollars a year and it's in there I just looked at the financials it's pretty big it's called them you probably notice a BIST world yeah yeah yeah it was well I didn't realize that's how big 100 million so you don't wanna million idea is and these might this might exist already but you can build a layer on top of these just to make them more user-friendly searchable it's sort of easy to use clean up the data in some way and those can be pretty pretty awesome businesses import genius is a great example of this you know publicly available customs data that they make a it's not even that easy to use but they make an interface that makes it very sort of simple and easy to find the data that you're looking for and so you know if there's some entrepreneur in Australia who wants to take ASIC and make it more of a consumer facing website or maybe that exists but that would be a cool opportunity what else so I saw this company I liked called a line I almost hesitate to even talk about it cuz I'm like very interested in it may invest may use it may like the teeth thing not the teeth thing it's it's pretty cool so you know how lambda school sort of popularized income share agreements they you know basically I train you you go get a job you have to pay me back out of that sort of like a novel way of doing student debt so income share agreements are getting more popular as lambda school has sort of proven that they work so all the lambda school clones I don't think they've proven they've worked I think that they're proven that some people are interested in them and what income share agreements yeah I'm critical of them yeah I don't really know why you would be critical and why are you critical first of all I don't I think that the bootcamp idea is just unrealistic okay but that's different that's not as different I don't know I I'm not well-versed on it yet so I don't my opinion is I'm skeptical which is okay here's what I think is in that here's what I think is a very valid skepticism of it hey you're making a you're making this sound like a totally new thing this is just a different form of student debt like I go to school and then when I graduate I have to pay back X dollars for my education that's student debt that's how an income share agreement works and that's also how student debt works so a lot of people who are like uh you know student debt evil student debt big problem in the country income share agreements novel disruption and really they're both just debt instruments that work it has that different I didn't have student debt luckily but but you know I friends who are still sort of you know paying that off and so so anyways I think that's the valid that's the valid criticism which is this is not that different the income share is not that different you know the one difference would be with student debt you owe it regardless of whether you get a good job or not for income share agreement you only owe it if you get a high paying job so the incentive is kind of a line for the school to train you up and help you get a good-paying job which is your goal as well as a student so I think that's a that's a fair counter but but anyways my point is it gives your agreements whether you like them or not they are getting more popular they've sort of worked non-existent five to ten years ago and now they're getting more popular and it's a financing instrument and so what a line is doing I think the websites hello align calm they basically made like sort of a stripe for income treatments so it's just a way for anybody who wants to set up an income share agreement to do so with like sort of one line of code type of thing they take care of the whole income share agreement process so let's say I which is true I have ideas for new education models new schools new ways to teach people and help them earn more money I could now shut up and set up an income share agreement website like without having to do any of the sort of Finance you know compliance like all that work that I would normally need to pay a bunch of lawyers and spend a bunch of time doing now I just get it out of the box so it's like when Twilio made SMS you know an easy thing to use out of the box or talk box made it easy to use video streaming or stripe made it easy to credit card processing now these guys did it for income share agreements which i think is a very clever niche how big are they what's the attraction any brand new i think they're an early access right now i'm on board with that i don't think i would invest because i'm not investing in i don't want to invest in private companies right now because i have i'm just a [ __ ] but I'm just [ __ ] fearful at the moment I've been the stock I'd rather be the stock market but that's cool I would put I would I would put I would I liked it enough that I would be close to putting my money where my mouth is on it right I don't think I would invest either but I just think it's cool that somebody built this and also I think it's a good example of identify nice trend a lot of people do this when BOTS started getting more popular they're like cool here's a bot maker or voice you know echo gets echo gets big and people start buying a bunch of Amazon echoes and then people made it easy to make voice apps using things like voice flow I think you want to be on the edge where is this a trend if it is a trend I can spin up the super simple website the more service like you know oh maybe email marketing is gonna be a big let me build a really easy way to email a mass list and track the opens and whatnot and sure eight times out of ten that trend is is gonna be is gonna fizzle out or end up being much smaller than you think but being early really matters in these spaces and so I think that's cool here's another niche thing that I thought was cool it's something called agent fire so this is a website for a real estate agent it's like a Wix or a Squarespace specifically for real estate agents so it's like push a button here's a real estate agent website this company is doing a hundred thousand dollars a month and what's interesting is that there's a guy you should follow his twitter handle is vin rob VI n RB and it's guy Robin Vander Heiden and what he's doing is he is I don't know I've met the guy yet but his claim is I help people productize their service so here's what happened he request oh my god somebody was making a service to do this for agents like you pay me X dollars I'll build you an agent website and what he helps them do is turn that into just a specific standalone SAS product they'll just let an agent do it automatically so now there's no human service in the loop and he hosts a bunch of he tweets out a bunch of examples of profitable niche services that have turned into products and so I thought this is kind of a goldmine of like cool little ideas and hacks an agent fire which is the one which is one of these which is a guy who was doing this as a service turn it into a product now doing this is amazing whose many requests like I mean you said who he is Rob is this guy raising money I don't know he's based out of Singapore everything about this I'm interested I'd like to ask guy I think people should follow him because he's tweeting out gold and he's only got you know two thousand followers so most people aren't looking I love Rob I'm following him now alright let me wrap it up at the one thought yeah we've talked about we've had a bunch of people on here or investors and we had a friend is raising a fund right now you know I think I've changed my mind I think that investing is [ __ ] stupid I would have bet a thousand dollars you're gonna say stupid I would have been wrong cuz he's so [ __ ] stupid but like why is investing stupid I would love to hear why investing is stupid tell me if I am being like just a baby here in like but it's just like I just find this like financial arbitrage [ __ ] to be so boring and like meaningless okay and I watch the TV show billions and I'm like oh that's cool like they're doing all those big things it looks exciting and then I'm like well those guys are losers like they're not actually adding to I mean they're just they're wealthy and they're accomplishing dreams so I respect it but I also I'm like oh my god that's so soulless and that's what I think like a lot of like I've got friends that create these websites that like they're already wealthy and they're building these websites that are like they're just hawking [ __ ] and they will admit that they are I'm like the [ __ ] the point of this and that's kind of what a lot of investing is but the friends Hawking [ __ ] that's different than investing right that's just like selling some degree for money right it's fun it's it's definitely from a similar yeah it's just like why like I like if you're already can if you already have a little bit of cash which if you're still trying to get your hair you know go go you got to go for it but if you already got a little bit of cash like do something cool and meaning so ok so here's here's I'll give you two to thoughts on this okay the first is an example that supports your case and then I'll give you the feel good reason why you're wrong so the support your case so I mentor this guy who's 20 years old and he's at this point where like he tried to do some stuff I kind of didn't work out and now he's like [ __ ] do I need to go get a job I need to pay my bills I don't want to go move back home with my parents and so he's like he's like about to take this job and he's like should I you know leave this entrepreneurial path and go get a job because I you know I need to pay bills in two months and I don't think I can spin something up in the next 60 days that will get so profitable that I'll be I know I'll be able to pay my rent and I said you know I empathize with the problem but I said you know let's just slow down for a sec before you go take that consulting job let's just let's just talk things through for a second so I said how much money do you need to live every month what's your burn rate two grand two grand fantastic and I was like so let's say you wanted a year of runway to go try some [ __ ] you need to come up with 12 months times 2 grand you need to come up with 24 grand I said I know you do some investing in the stock market you're kind of a degenerate you know you like to pick stocks attractive like Bitcoin and [ __ ] I was like because at the beginning of the conversation he's like you know am I good the thing that's going well is my investments I've done well the things going bad is about to have to take this job for my my bills oh hey well those two things don't add up I was like I was like do you have enough money in the stock market right now that you could just sell and you could use to live off of to chase your entrepreneurial dreams he's like yeah I could but then I'd have to sell and I don't want to sell cuz I'm getting you know good returns I said okay let's do the math real quick what do you think you could generate per let's take just a twenty four thousand that you need I don't know how much money you have you don't have to tell me let's take the twenty four thousand that you need how much do you think you generate per year in return average he's like fifty percent I was like ok Minnie Warren Buffett you think you can do 50 percent a year but let's let's assume you're delusional number is correct and that you could do it consistently which is the hard part you could do it for one year for sure but consistently generate 50 percent so let's say you you do the Warren Buffett you you invest perfectly you get your 50% way above market return and you're 24 grand has turned into 36 grand now like fantastic congratulations you made $12,000 like you are still nowhere near where you're trying to get with your goals and if you and how many years would you have to continue to get this absurd return for you to be with where your goals I was like not that many but that would never happen you would never happen right you never get the 50% so anyways I was like you're talking about this year going and trading all your time for money at a consulting gig when instead you could just sell some of your stock get 24 grand of runway and you could live for 12 months and give yourself a bunch of shots on goal to try to build something that you believe in and you'll learn way more you'll have way more fun and you'll have way more upside than if you go take the consulting job so like you're crazy so he was of the mindset of well I heard that rich people invest so I want to invest and I want to get return I want my money to work for money he had kind of heard all these things and was in was investing for that reason so I think investing doesn't make sense when you have very little amount of capital overall and you're trying to go invest that capital and then you're trading your time for $4 in other ways now the other so that's the argument for times when I think investing would be stupid is when you know if you take a normal return the amount of money that you're making every month is not every year is not gonna change your life and you're locking up money in the stable what's the second point cuz I think the second point have to be better than the first point the first point that you made was that well only of us if you got a lot yeah exactly if you if you don't have a lot I'd rather you use that money if you're entrepreneurial if you're one of the five 5% of people who actually want to build a business or do something on their own you're better served investing in yourself and investing in buying your time back yeah and and and going taking about shot uncle now the second is is investing stupid well I think you're kind of right that it is not the most exciting thing but excitement is different for everybody but here's the cool way of thinking about investing like for anything to work you need leverage right so you were on the hustle but day to day you write zero emails probably you don't write the daily email you don't do the trends report this podcast is the most active thing you do for the Hustle is that correct it we could say yes for a sake of argument okay so first sake of argument your argument is correct I'm leverage so you're leverage because you got a bunch of humans doing work for you cool another form of leverage is media so we're gonna talk for one hour and this is gonna get listened to for hundreds of thousands of hours out there so media is another form of leverage and then the last one is capital capital is another form of leverage and so here's the cool way of thinking about it which is if you have capital investing is your way of allocating capital to things that are either a gonna return the most or big and I like change the world in a way that you care about and so capital is your way of influencing the way that the world goes because you get to assign units of energy to different companies and causes that are that are gonna go do do do I get that I think that's a great point I think that what I'm completely burnt out of it's just lame-ass investments what's a lame-ass investment like you don't have to use a name if you want to kind of code name something like I've got a friend that gave a lot of money to some like an investor who's gonna buy a bunch of multifamily real estate and it's simply a like I've don't ever see this I don't touch it like this is a 7% this is simply an asset class and it's just a thing on a spreadsheet and I'm like oh my god that's so boring like but like I just I can't decide if I'm being a little like [ __ ] hater or yeah but my or like when I have we have some friends who are buying companies and they just look for anything that like checks the boxes of does net churn this and is the acquisition cost this and that's it that's all I mean like mechanical yeah yeah and I get it and I'm like all right that's great way to make money but it's just like so [ __ ] lame sometimes I'm like oh my god you guys like can you like can we please do something exciting so okay so here's the here's the rub okay let's say you don't invest you're gonna either a park cash and on the side and do nothing with it probably lamer than investing in it and having the cash grow or be you're gonna what's the what's door number see so what else would you what a what would you prefer to do with your capital besides invest or leave it in cash either start calm and even if that means I don't run them or that's investing yeah I'm not saying investing I'm using I'm using investing because I can't think of a better word no investing is cool I mean investing is great but I'm just saying like arbitrage is again starting a company is arbitrage but I think you understand what I'm saying yeah I get where you coming from I don't know I I just I just hit me last week where I'm like oh my god this is I don't want to talk about a carry fee ever again or I go like this is just so [ __ ] lame when like you see like like I think it happened when I was traveling I'm like I just see these normal ask people at the gas station and they're with their wives and kids and like they'd like I would I'm Way more fascinated about how do I just make that person just a little bit happier or a little bit better not like how do I eat out a little more profit out of this service do the same like it's like I saw these I remember be at this gas station and I saw this mom give her kid like a like a generic coke and I was like like help this mother like Oh either afford or learn that this thing or that thing is now is like how can we help her make a better decision maybe better decision easy not how do I get a 5 per second I think I actually understand what you're saying now which is it's not that investing is stupid it's not that putting money in someplace and getting a return is stupid what you are starting to get annoyed of or or tired of is the amount of the amount of your mental energy that goes towards thinking about how to reproduce a where do you devote mental energy and not we're just money go it's kind of like I get that money you gotta do something with the money might as well put in a place that's gonna grow might as well fund a company that's gonna do something but it's about mentally spending cycles thinking about how do I get 7% verse 8% versa tax efficient 9% versus just mentally spending those same cycles thinking about something else if I kept reading a book talking to a person building something cool writing a song whatever it's gonna be is that is that more accurate yeah like get out of this financial arbitrage circle-jerk and actually make a difference and have an exciting wonderful life yeah both myself and others I'm with you on that I'm with you on that I catch myself doing that all the time where I'm like how many hours is my brain spending on you know in this financial game and there's some so amount that's correct but it's very easy to slip into more than more than what you need more than what's adding value I love that TV show billions and I'm like oh man like Bobby ox raw rod this powerful billionaire guy he's going to war versus other people that's [ __ ] awesome I love that yeah he's an alpha and then I'm like but he's also just a jerk-off who's just trying to like squeeze pennies out of this thing of that thing and it's complete nonsense right you know what I mean yeah I think you know I think what also happens is important which is in your 20s you're trying to figure out what you like twenties in many ways about feeding ego it's like whether you're partying trying to make friends trying to date people trying to you know get your get your name on the map in you know your career or your industry I feel like a lot of people including myself their twenties are spent feeding the ego and then your 30s are spent figuring out that okay my ego is either full or it will never be full and I actually want to feed the soul in some kind of way actually want to be more conscious of how I spend my time and my energy and and then there's this constant push and pull of like maybe I just want to make a bunch of money like maybe I'm not ambitious enough well I think you can over money focus and there's like these debates that I have my head I sounds like you do too I think you could do both and I think that I guess the point is I'm beginning to realize I love the builders more than the alligators like yeah yeah yeah exhibit fucking-a builders over alligators all day okay yeah good that's a good that's a good way to end the podcast I put if you if you listen to us meander through that last five minutes hopefully either with some value in the end [Music]

she had she was about five feet tall her hair was down to the ground she had this like majestic chestnut hair that was just hey Zack welcome back hey Brad so this week you have a really interesting piece about a female entrepreneur who's one of the pioneers of the franchising business model not many people have heard about her how did you find out about it so her name's Martha Matilda Harper and she was kind of she created this phenomenal business and long before Ray Kroc McDonald's and the whole franchise model took off she was kind of one of the early pioneers in this space in the late 19th century and her story was kind of forgotten and it's for for many years it's a footnote in history until this woman Jane Jane a historian resurfaced her story in the late 90s and early 2000s and really made a push to get her more into the spotlight but even now today I think relatively few younger people know about her and she's just got kind of a very interesting story so tell us a little bit about her business and how she found her niche yeah so she she started out of life in the mid-1800s in Canada and she was kind of born into a lower-class family at the age of seven she was sent away to be a house sterben by our family and for 25 years she was house servant and eventually she served at the house of a physician who studied a hair follicle science and kind of some of the early science of hair hair treatments and he bestowed upon her this this hair tonic and she took that with her to Rochester New York and eventually found her way into certain circles saved a little bit of money and launched a successful franchise of hair salons at a time when it was very difficult to even launch a single business a female entrepreneur she ended up growing this into a chain of 500 stores and was was in spirit and inspired many other women to fall in her path a lot of the franchise owner she hired were other a woman who who didn't come from upper-class backgrounds she empowered a lot of people with similar backgrounds to her and gave them some freedom to run their own franchises she sounds like a really inspiring story to any anything you want to share just any fun details about the business and in the in the hair salon industry that she was was created with yeah so she she actually invented a number of things like the reclining shampoo chair a sink with a little hole cut out for the neck just little things you see in salons today that you don't really give much thought to but unfortunately she didn't secure the patents to a lot of these inventions so it was very difficult for her for a woman at the time to get their name on a patent but the other funny detail is if you if you look at there's one old kind of iconic photograph of her that exists she had she was about 5 feet tall her hair was down to the ground she had this like majestic chestnut hair that was just like a flowing mane like something like nothing you've ever seen and that was actually her greatest marketing asset is that she'd serve for these high-class woman is a house servant they would always ask her about how she how her hair was so nice it was like this incredible head of hair she had and she used that to sell her tonic to start her business and that was kind of one of her one of her chief marketing licenses use what you have your advantage and she certainly did that well there's a lot more to this story you guys are going to love this one please please make sure you open your emails on Sunday and thanks again for joining us Zach thanks you [Music]

Will Snapchat lose to Facebook and Instagram? We don't think so - Snapchat is becoming a platform for mini-applications similar to Wechat. Snapchat already has an app integrated into its platform called Headspace, an app for meditation. With our futurist like an explanation on this situation, we expect Snapchat to become a popular platform for more mini-apps in the near future. We think this is just the beginning of Snapchat mini-apps and Snapchat is being forced to make big moves to compete with Facebook and Instagram.

snapchat sort of in a position where they have to become a platform to compete because Facebook and Instagram have sort of just declared like did you see today snapchat did a like I do they're like Developer Conference thing yeah tell me about that thing that they introduced so they introduced us a few things and they were like hey you know last time we introduced games and games are doing great and they were talking about just kind of hyping up games to get more people to build mini games on snapchat but they introduced other things called minis and minis is actually I think a bigger move by them so minis are basically the mini applications built into snapchat what they're doing is they're copying WeChat which is the big messaging app in China we chat has like a million little apps built in like oh you need to pay your bills you just do it through WeChat and how do you do that well there's this little mini website but the you know the utility company makes that'll just pop up in your WeChat and you hit pay and it's paid or you want to do this you want to buy movie tickets together you do it within WeChat like we don't do that in iMessage we don't do that in facebook Messenger but that's what all these companies would love to bid love to be WeChat here in the States so snapchats taking a big stab at doing that and they announced like so for example one of the minis is headspace so you can do like sort of a quick meditation with anybody else on like one of your friends from snapchat they did a movie ticket buying thing they did you know so they did several of these and just not again I don't know how the Sox drive but what's interesting here is that snapchat sort of in a position where they have to become a platform to compete because Facebook and Instagram have sort of just declared like we will steal your we took your mojo already and if you come up with some new great mojo like guess what you know Evan Spiegel you're the head of product at Facebook actually whatever you come up with we are gonna put in our apps as soon as humanly possible so their only strategy they have basically two core strategies one is maybe they can create snap classes these like AR glasses and they can just sort of get off the cell phone game and get into the glasses game before anybody else so that would be like a snap mini website they call them snap minis and what they are are little mini websites that that can pop up and be a little like utility things to do inside snapchat besides message each other now the second thing is becoming a platform because Facebook and Instagram don't do a great job of letting other companies build on top of them people distrust those companies they've built apps on top of Facebook and messenger before and gotten screwed and so they don't have great ecosystems so snapchats kind of pushing their chips into the middle of the table and saying come build on us we'll treat you better than those guys will and you kind of leave it you kind of believe it because it's really their only way to compete with Facebook and Instagram so they kind of have to actually honor this so anyways a quick idea so in general I think that being early to these platforms in these app app ecosystems is a good thing there's been several snap kit apps that have been like number one and number two on the App Store's so they've gotten a ton of distribution from it what's a snap snap kit is basically the tool set that snapchat gives you to build build stuff so it's like okay snap kit will say you want to access their bitmoji cool snap kit lets you just type one line and you get their bitmoji character you can do stuff with snap kittens their camera with all their lenses I'm doing this course with Goggin and things we talk about our inflections so what are what our inflections and there's a variety of styles of inflections there's technology inflections which is like basically like oh my god the Internet is now in everyone's house that is an inflection there's an opportunity there or a belief inflection is like wow people really don't trust the media what can we do to help or people are afraid to be in groups of thousands of people how can we fix it what we are seeing right now is a technology inflection or a platform inflection is the detection yes and this is it this is like when so Pandora the music company Tim told me that the company was around for three years and it was doing horrible and he said they heard about the Apple Store for some reason Steve Jobs reached out to them and said you guys might be a good like place to put your here and once that happened he was cool and this I don't know if it will be but this is potentially one of those yeah these are asymmetric bets [Music] you

and that changed the trajectory of his life where Silicon Valley starts calling them and you know and evolve flies them out to San Francisco and wants to invest in a like that so so snapchats kind of pushing their chips into the middle of the table and saying come build on us we'll treat you better than those guys will and you kind of leave it you kind of believe it because it's really their only way to compete with Facebook and Instagram so they kind of have to actually honor this so anyways a quick idea so in general I think that being early to these platforms and these app app ecosystems is a good thing there's been several snap kit apps that have been like number one and number two on the App Store so they've gotten a ton of distribution from it what's a snap kit app snap kit is basically the toolset that snapchat gives you to build to build stuff so it's like okay snap kit will say you want to access their bitmoji cool snap kit lets you just type one line and you get their bitmoji character you can do stuff with snap kits their camera with all their lenses I'm doing this course with Goggin and we talk about our inflections inflections there's a variety of styles of inflections there's technology inflections which is like basically like oh my god the Internet is now in everyone's house that is an inflection there's an opportunity there or a belief inflection is like wow people really don't trust the media what can we build help or people are afraid to be in groups of thousands of people how can we fix that what we are seeing right now is a technology inflection or a platform inflection yes and this is it this is like when so Pandora the music company Tim told me that the company was around for three years and it was doing horrible and he said they heard about the Apple Store for some reason Steve Jobs reached out to them and said you guys might be a good like place to put your here once that happened he was cool and this I don't know if it will be but this is potentially one of those yeah these are asymmetric bets sure maybe most of the time these platforms either don't work out or there's nothing cool to build and you'll waste you know a month of your time or you might catch a wave early and you might get to the top so for example the very first episode of this whole podcast chain is with Tsui and so he talks about he was working at Microsoft and he realized he wants to quit and go start a company quits he moves back home with his parents for like two weeks and the fruit and the first two weeks he's kind of bored and the day he quit basically Facebook did their developer conference and said hey we're making Facebook platform anyone could build an app on Facebook now so he goes home and he's like all right I don't know if there's gonna be a business I don't think so but he's like I just need to start programming in just to get my you know get get the rust off and so he builds a Facebook app that was stupid it was like a superlatives app like which of your friends is most likely to end up in jail or whatever boom goes viral you know he ends up with tens of millions of users and that changed the trajectory of his life where Silicon Valley starts calling him and you know Duvall flies him out to San Francisco and wants to invest in a suit like that so he took a bet on the sort of day the platform launched if I'm a board developer today or I'm somebody who's got you know the ability to code and you know a weekend I would be building something on top of snap kit the thing I would build is actually so I think what's hard is when you want to build something that gets the user to leave snapchat and come to your app so you kind of have to build something that can actually do the whole experience should just be on snapchat and it should not compete with what snapchat does so here's the idea okay yes I call it cameo kick so basically I think you could build the app cameo on top of snapchat so you were basically the cameo Kate would just say cool I want to buy a snapchat from one of these celebrities and I'll pay you right here through snapchat and then I want to send it either to myself or to my friend on my snapchat list so basically imagine I it's your birthday coming up right when's your birthday it's in a few days yeah you actually bought me a cameo you had Gilbert Godfried call me a right so I did that last year but but this year I could do it through a little new invention of mine so basically I would go in snapchat I would open it up I would see a list of influencers that are that have snapchat which is like every celebrity in the world I would request a video and I pay right there and then you would receive a snapchat from either from me or from them in your inbox and the whole cameo experience could be built on top of snapchat without having to have separate websites separate apps all that stuff and you compete with cameo very quickly so I think that's a very simple idea that could monetize on top of snap get [Music]

[Music] all right we're on the eighth episode of strategy podcast we're here with Jai Kisan who's the co-founder and CEO of movement watches Jake movement is an accessories company that sells fashion items that shouldn't break the bank is that a good way to describe it or is that bad way to describe it no that's a great way to describe it we've evolved since - you know we started with watches we start with six watches at our core price anywhere between 95 and hundred dollars kind of comparable to those 300 the 500 dollar price point watches and then you know the goal was to continue to build a lifestyle brand and you know grow into other accessories so now we have everything from watches men's women's to sunglasses to jewelry and one of our most popular products as of late is actually our blue light blocking ever school buses everyone stop in front of their screens all day and I think a lot of people least me I had some trouble you know falling asleep or sleeping in because I'm staring at screens all day we have nothing else to do and these truly fill they filter out this is kind of a what you call it is me selling a little bit but like this is a little shameless but shameless plug but it is the cool thing about him is like everyone has it the device on their screen or has an option on their screen to block it but it actually distorts the color so for us it filters the color so if you shine blue light in it just blocks it and filters it so graphic designers or gamers whatever it is like you're able to continue to you know do what you do without affecting kind of your civvie powders but anyways that's that's been blowing up for us right now so and the goal is is to clean it to continue to branch out into other accessories and really be a truly a lifestyle brand who bought like who buys the bula except I feel like you know whatever I talk to people from LA I'm just like and he's telling you about stuff and I'm like everything you just said is very la when I talked to Nick who's a mutual friend of ours who runs thrive market you know he's like yeah I'm taking beehive you know pollen shots yeah it's a blue light blocker la or am I just missing I think it might have started as la it was kind of like something people like to wear and be fashioned for it even if they didn't have prescription eyewear but I think given the world we live in today its accelerated the need for them and and and truly there's a there is a benefit to it I mean I was you know there's proof there's there's data backing it so I think what maybe was somewhat of a fashion trend has now turned into a real utility that is helpful yeah I live in LA you know oh wow so maybe it is LA I don't know but it's doing well for us I think around the nation in globally so gotcha okay let's get started with like the beginning of movement watches would love to start like I know you guys launched on IndieGoGo but even taking a step back from that you know you're the youngest e-commerce entrepreneur that's super successful that I've ever met before you started movement watches you dropped out of college you were 20 I already dropped out of college in the year $20,000 in debt and then you decided to start watches is that right yeah debt so debt was to partially credit card debt so I wasn't about I think it was like six seven thousand dollars a credit card debt funding my lifestyle more so and movement partially like I was still in college and I had it stopped working at the time to put all my energy in the movement and so I was in debt to you know I had eighteen months of like interest-free credit card debt so I maxed those those out for samples and everything else and then well you know as well I had received money from kind of family and friends for a previous business that just ended up crashing and burning it was it was doing well at it's at its peak yeah I had I needed some capital continue to kind of grow it and then yeah left me in kind of a place of you know I don't think I ever some of the money came from my parents so I've definitely return that money since hood but yeah it was it was largely kind of credit card and family and friends with you so that's so quick I feel like you rarely hear about had a success that you've had and actually stood like you know legitimately you have a story about credit card debt usually it's all these like guys who sort of had you know who had like dads we're millionaires and sort of like we're able to fund their own success for the money because they had all these amazing connections you built movement or you started movement watches actually swiping your own critical yeah being like yeah I need to pay for samples yeah from me to it was like back against the wall it's [ __ ] insane yeah your back is against them I mean like you chose to make your back against the wall like you're swiping the credit card ordering samples of watches yeah because and you're like giving up your work opportunities and indeed I'm dropping out of college from this business you chose to put yourself on your back against as well yeah yeah that's a lot of [ __ ] it's all it's all you have this starting off right like for me my dad you know had a business was was you know kind of middle-class and and but during the last you know recession that we were in completely business went out when you know the closes doors after 20 years and lay off his employees etc and ran through you know their savings so I saw financial stress from them I was supporting myself in college but grand I had kind of planned on dropping out regardless I wasn't doing much in college because I had my previous business before movement that I was hoping was gonna be you know the big winner and then when that went under it was kind of like okay I have an opportunity to fund another business using my credit card you know that I currently have let me let me go big and honestly my mentality and maybe it was a little overdramatic but or maybe not it was I'll go get I'll go work anywhere if this doesn't work out I'll go pay this off but like and I think people who have their back against the wall typically end up succeeding because it's sometimes it takes that to like really figure it out and grind and put in the extra energy and you may try tentative as you know you may try 10 different dings and only one works out but like that one thing may be the difference so yeah give me a poor and hungry person in any day of the week versus like a rich server grant like 400 person who's gonna want to like succeed and has a lot more like at stake basically yeah but like it's crazy that you're like I funded my business on a credit card like everyone's like founded by business with the millions of dollars I had I founded my business with andreessen horowitz money no one's like yeah I funded my business with this Visa card but I have the same credit card that you use to buy that stuff yeah I don't have it anymore but what a great card I mean so you launch like you know you get these samples you've got six watches you launched on IndieGoGo that's how you sort of get the business started yeah so so back then it you know I think I needed some I mean I knew I needed a source to to you know Drive orders I knew I needed capital to continue to go forward we needed at least like 15 grand to actually place the first pio so so it was like okay we need at least 15 grand and and that was that was the small goal that was like if we do that we may just give the money back because yeah is it really worth it and then of the day to you know move for a week so we ended up doing like 15k the first I don't know 30 days of the campaign it was a 50 day campaign and then and based off of like IndieGoGo at the time their algorithms etc we got featured on the homepage and then went from we did another 30 K that day and then just filed off ending around 300 K in pre-orders gotcha so your mentality was look if we only get 15 K in sales over 50 days we're just gonna cancel this whole project give everyone their money back and go do something else cuz that's just not where the business but potentially it was like it does this even back out yeah so you do 15 K the first 30 days and IndieGoGo features you on the home page and you get another 30 K as a result yep and that's that which are going on were you in touch with them to get them to feature you or did they just like their algorithm was like these guys should get a home page for today no so that was that was you know we again being kind of dropouts in college we were or dropouts of college we were just kind of studying the platform yeah we knew that we knew that like there was algorithms that we had kind of figured out how they worked and some of them was like you know as the campaign is ending it gets pushed to the top of a page or you know if a campaign gets a certain amount of funding percentage-wise they get pushed if you send enough there's all these hacks like I was big the word growth talked to me back then was like I mean that was like I loved and breathed that right it was like that's what I lived by today growth hacking isn't always scalable to some degrees it can be but like at some point it was like okay I need to figure out different ways to scale the business for back then grows out I was a growth hacker yeah I mean it's still like it works when you're going from like zero to one right it doesn't work when you're going from fifty million hundred million like there's no tiny growth happening you figured out we like back in 2002 third mm yeah so in 2013 they exist I think they still exist in 2020 yeah that'll get you from like you know fifteen thousand and thirty thousand or fifteen thousand percent our use are you really running paid like you know today when people run Kickstarter campaigns and I see a bunch of Facebook ads saying hey go check out this Kickstarter campaign and were you running paid ads behind this IndieGoGo campaign was this all organic back then it was large that we were paying certain publishers certain like blogs to post about us so we had blogs like cool material and then I basically I again found a some sort of software that was allowed me to kind of reach out to editors basically it aggregated I type in the topic at aggregate articles across the web and then it gave me the editors email and I exported him to an excel and sent a personal email with their name everything so tooth to tooth to 200 people I ended up getting 15 or something of them the post about it which was great playboy was one of them I was like okay I'll take it whatever and and then those gave us kind of momentum and that combination with like kind of a few other strategies read it was a big one we we were banned from reddit actually we got kicked off a reddit there's I created about a hundred different reddit accounts we had a proxy which hides your IP address so we would log in using different IP addresses posting without different IP addresses and then upvote and then you gain momentum and then once he got in implementing you just skyrocket they call that astroturfing one of the subreddits we did was called shut up and take my money so it was literally hey here's a product I want these are consumers who are looking to buy something yeah and somehow the detectives have read it traced back something yeah there's a thread somewhere it's great and has a ton of up boats but there's a thread about how we movement Astroturf thread it and so now there's a love-hate relationship I have with reddit but anyways that was I don't know if you can still do that today but that was like a big piece of like organic traffic basically this is back when you're still running an IndieGoGo campaign you're you're trying to get ready to post about you guys so people will click over to IndieGoGo and start funding pretty much up do you think it was still like a viable launch strategy today like I feel like in 2013 everyone was talking about like I go to Kickstarter once a week and sort of look at the new projects I feel like now a bunch of people been burned by King starter and probably IndieGoGo because they're just like I placed an order for something I ordered a case for my iPhone X or my iPhone 10 it didn't get it didn't get shipped to me until the iPhone 11 came out and now this is your IndieGoGo and Kickstarter as big as they were back then or like how do you feel about that yeah I don't think you have like the big the big big winners at least that I know of otherwise because I don't hear about him anymore right and people have been burned by like the coolest cooler and stuff like yeah ship but what I would say is like you know I would rather than looking at us as like you know an example of how we did it right that was 2013 and as we know like technology and the world changes so quickly I would go and find people who have successfully funded in the last you know 12 to 18 months and if they've done it then I would say that there could be an argument to still maybe go get friends and family money or maybe before you even go out and do that it just use it as like a platform to get cuz regardless there's still millions of people that are using any gogo and Kickstarter yeah so regardless there's still an opportunity to get you know your product in front of faces for generally free so I'd argue like it's a good marketing tool whether you raise 300 K or you raise 50 K or 20 it's theirs I still think there could be a benefit to it now with Facebook and everything else I don't know how like you know the market that got the marketing stack and how it integrates with with IndieGoGo or Kickstarter but I would again if I were starting over I would look at someone who's recently funded and just kind of reverse I mean worse engineering again growth hacking reverse engineering those are the two things like I take a brand and just completely reverse-engineer IndieGoGo reverse engineer so yeah I would do this gotcha okay so you think that they're still viable strategies well did you realize once you were on ad to go that you had found a product that was gonna be big and scale or did it take some more time like you know with Native in the first two months like we were seeing a cost of customer acquisition of under $2 for the first two months and I was just like this business is gonna work I don't have the plug I haven't made the product yet that's great enough to drive this tribest business but I know this business is gonna work because people are buying this stuff at $2 like it cost me $2 in advertising to sell this product like that's phenomenal like it doesn't happen today I knew instantly that the business would work and it took me a little bit of time to reformulate the product and really get my product market fit and see a ton of growth when did you know that movement watches is gonna work did you like was it the day you're on the homepage from you just did another $15,000 it's [ __ ] great or did it take some more time yeah I think there's different levels of what what's working right I think yeah when we did when we got on the homepage at that 30k in a day I said okay this is this is real now that's real money this is real let's think about this but then you know you have your cube for holiday you know numbers you start seeing what you remember there was a day where we had like a $25,000 you know day and that for at that time it was like holy [ __ ] that's huge and we've skin since then but like there's just there's just you have days I'd and and every each time you're like you're just really a ting like even what you're thinking about it and like the expansion of kind of where your business can go yeah you know campaigns over you realize hey look we're gonna start this business we're definitely not refunding people's money we're gonna actually ship this product we want to make it look what are the Jimmy operational you know when we launch native the first time we placed we we were supposed to pick up stuff that our manufacturer we used a freight forwarder to like drive a truck there and pick it up they were supposed to arrive on a like a Tuesday they didn't come on Wednesday did in come on Thursday I got dispatched another company gonna pick up the deodorant so we had our amount of manufacturer and the first guy picked them up and we'd already cancel that order so I was like wait are Germans are on a truck as like is this manufacturing just long time supposed to get all these deodorants and to run the wrong truck and I was like holy [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is happening do you guys have any of those operational because you guys aren't making it stuff in the United States or are you making in the US no we're making it now we're making it overseas in Asia have you dealt with Asian you know manufacturers and shipping things on boats or air freight like are there operational challenges right out of the gate yeah I mean I think they're just a learning curve I think more than anything we had a three PL so we had a third party you know kind of helping us with our fulfillment and they they took on a lot of like the logistical kind of stuff in terms of kind of importing I think I think they might have even been the importer of record if I'm not mistaken but you know was a long time ago I don't remember us having anything that was like a major issue per se fortunately but it was more of just a learning curve and figuring out you know what what the best way to do it what the most affordable way to do it I think a lot of times you just pay a premium because you don't know better and then it's we ended up starting to ship ship bibo and then you have to you know kind of build that into kind of your timeline and then you also hear like you know well is the condensation like while going over the ocean like ruin the the watches in the boxes so there's just a lot of like logistical thing you have to keep in mind and think about but we've never really had a major you know stopping block or yeah exactly yeah was it difficult in finding the manufacturer like I would imagine or was it look was that easy look you just go to you know the sheds in whatever fared they're like okay there's four hundred watch manufacturers or is it like really hard to find that kind you know you could you certainly could go to like a fair and manufacturers again we thinking of flying to China for us when we were just getting started to get some something sampled I didn't have the credit card credit to do that so we ended up we ended up going on Google and doing some research and finding a manufacturer that kind of or consultant who knew different manufacturers and we worked with him initially and then I think once you really start to get going like once our indiegogo attention then you have other manufacturers who may be a little bit more legitimate a little bit more reputable start reaching out and I don't think it was until err maybe almost our third year maybe our second year where we actually flew to China and met with different manufacturers and in the watch world there's like middlemen so like for us we have we're not middleman but we have a the movements inside of our watches you know we have a quartz my o2 movement from uh super watches so my Oda it's there in most like quartz watches so they're incentivized to go and introduce us to the best manufacturer so they went and kind of you know pulled us into the three top manufacturers and kind of got a see who was vibing with our business at the time and who believed in us and and and kind of went from there and if you had to switch to manufacturers since you started the business like from that IndieGoGo campaign to today have you been like I went from here I still not be on this facility so I went to you or you still with the same guy yeah so we have no we're not with the original we have multiple manufacturers you know prior to move on the bottom acquisition we had multiple manufacturers I think for multiple reasons you know some manufacturers are better at Purdue you're saying you know different things I think it's always great to you know whether you want to leverage them against each other not to be not to not to bully them but just simply to make sure that they're being giving you the best price and so there's like there's there's benefits to that you know some some manufacturers can only do a certain amount of production and so just it's keeping them you know responsible for you know what they're doing and motivated so that they don't take advantage of you in any way post Movado I'm not ready to talk about this have you moved manufacturing in-house like is Nevada doing a manufacturing or are you sort of stone all doing the same thing to do more with your own independent contractor so no we're still doing the same Amana there's you know they do Swiss and etc but I'm pretty sure that for us at least we we have still third parties and I think largely the the the you know fashion watch industry courts you know movement is all you I don't think it really makes sense to go and yeah open up your own fact release to my knowledge so okay so you're launching a brand its 2013 IndieGoGo campaign successful look what is it what is your revenue look like in 2014 you know six years ago or 2015 yes a year so the first three years I went so first year we ended at about a million with including the the IndieGoGo yeah and I don't think we did much it was like blogs it was uncrate you know we were paid the money I spent was like get on Craig uncle material you know figure out you know those type of things more so than rev-share to developing commission type of opportunities so it was pretty organic which was great so you're not we weren't paying for unquote you were like hey I'm Craig we'll give you 15% of sales no no uncrate there's a few so a few publishers I'm Craig you pay you know Aflac then it was like seventy five hundred bucks for a feature but it would return you know largely a large amount of orders so those are like big opportunities that no longer exist but also they were like unknown opportunities so it's kind of navigating a sea that no one knew like where to go it's growth exactly so net so that so now it's a little bit more everyone is look knows and has seen you know us for me undies are you guys on all these blogs so it's it's saturated and it doesn't just business and perform like it once did but it was largely blogs and and and then some was working on it as well we did a big like refer-a-friend we really really encourage our our team to or another team but our customers to refer their friends for credit or discounts and then one of the biggest things we did back then was like every 500 likes on Facebook we did we gave away a free watch and then it got too much so we did a thousand and that was our fastest growing platform Facebook and that was just you know we were like okay we have 500 new people to like us yeah there's at least one person's buying a watch from that it's worth giving out a watch and people just went nuts about that and we just scaled through that so that was that was your one your two we started to play with Facebook YouTube we did seven million and that that was like the rocket ship is where I think we were getting like $10 cpas for a hundred dollar watch and that was when it just they just took off and then so yeah three we did thirty is 2014 yeah so year one year one was a million to seven to thirty to thirty and it goes from blog to Facebook to more Facebook blog to Facebook to a lot more Facebook and then after probably thirty it was like how do we diversify different acquisition channels we don't want to be solely bet on on Facebook what if we get saturated what if CPMs go up uh blah blah here we are today yeah I remember when we were like the first time they did raise money we went to like one of our investors was putting on some sort of like marketing Day show and we went there and there were Facebook reps and they're like yeah on Instagram we're allowing certain vendors or like certain businesses to advertise and one of the first businesses and I was like how the [ __ ] did you guys know do you know that like you were one of the first businesses that get special access I think we did know that we so back in the day I was like I mean I was running it out the gay and then we worked with kind of a freelance consultant and then we ended up hiring in-house but it was like you know anytime there was a beta because we saw the success and I knew I knew Instagram was going to be huge because I used it as a consumer and the numbers of its growth so we were like get us on the beta get us on the beta I was we were really lucky for two reasons there was we worked right next to the the Facebook LA office so we basically just kind of bear-hug Facebook and like we made sure that that was like a network that we'd stay close to and I'm friendly with a bunch of people over there just in the sense of like you know not not that we were getting necessarily special kind of you know special service but it was just being able to talk to them more frequently about what was going on before we had like a small business rep in Texas and that was just you hear from him once a month and it just it was like you know surface level stuff so yeah it is weird that like Facebook is sort of outsourced so many of your representatives like I think it's an Austin and they're like you know even if you're spending you know ten million dollars a year they're like here's some rep in Austin that like I'm gonna give you great great feedback you really have to network your way within Facebook in order to get the right people under account yeah definitely I think they're I think they're doing the better job but I don't know I mean we've been we've been we bit we're now leg and we're close to them so we've been in the network so maybe we've been you know working with certain teams just because of that but we also have spent as you guys I'm sure a significant amount of money on Facebook so yeah yeah once we were a part of PMG base on PNG Rapstar account and so like you know we were no longer yeah so I'm not sure what's happening last to you yeah they have different they have I know they have different set there's like a growth like a like it's like a growth so it's like brands that are in the ten millions Plus and spending you know millions on Facebook and then you have like yeah like the the big guys who are you know big Forbes whether it's exactly exactly yeah and look you know you guys never raised a dollar you guys are funding this on credit cards and then once you sort of hit that 7 billion dollar range I'm sure you're profitable or breakeven and sort of fund a you know did you ever did you ever think that you should raise money did you ever try and raise money or were you like no this business is working I want to control our own destiny let's keep it all out yeah I mean there was there's always a an internal kind of discussion at me and Kramer my co-founder had about do we raise money why would we raise money everyone else is raising money why are they raising money does it make sense like do we need to grow faster than we're growing and and you know there was a time when we were strongly considering at a later stage to go and raise money to help kind of with expansion and growth and you know that and that you know fortunately for us it was kind of right around the time when we started talking with Movado and that just made so much more sense for us base you know the the synergies in terms of brand and and just like you know where we wanted to go they already largely knew when what we're able to support and help us so that made more sense than doing it ourselves and raising capital and deluding ourselves but it was tough I think back then the dialogue wasn't as it wasn't as there wasn't you know guys like me and you and others who were talking about like you know state staylene you know look what happened and there wasn't examples of the bonobos in and you know I can't even think what's other companies that just there's brand lists there's a what was the one that just came out the other day anyways yeah Cass look at Casper's IPO right yeah 400 million they raise four hundred million dollars yeah yeah look there's a ton of this company we work a brand blue aprons a great example there anyways probably more more so more of them than less of them right like I've turned out to be failures unfortunately and largely not not because they're necessary about business just as they raised that it crazy multiple that they can't you know kind of get you know run from so anyways that wasn't as apparent and we just kind of like we networked with a lot of people and that was the one thing because we didn't go to business school I wouldn't say that like from the finance side of it like that's not where our specialty is we were like bran builders and scrappy and entrepreneurs and kind of seizing opportunities and and you know enjoying the process so we talked to a lot of different founders to to had raised money and to be frank like a lot of them were kind of not happy and said stay away stay away and it was just weird that every time we talked to someone who we idolized in terms of the business that is yeah all over the news and gets all the press would be like don't do it if you don't need if you're making money don't do it Bubba blah and now I mean I think that just makes so much sense for so many reasons and you know from from and we talked about this even you know offline all the time but it's just like in terms of brands being able to acquire you for for a you know reasonable number like the second you go and raise money you may out email price yourself for so many you know brands and you just cause complications for you know you may be growing an unhealthy business which will hurt you in Milan yes but there's a day that that all sort of comes back and haunts you right like you could rate you could be celebrating I mean like yeah we just raised it you know I I think I mentioned you before II when we were raising money and we talked to a fund they're like we'll put in three million dollars at a 30 million dollar valuation or 30 million in a few million dollar value pair so I was like I could get a 30 million dollar valuation for 300 from this person sitting across the devil from me right yeah look that doesn't make sense they they're very honest about it they're like looking 300 you're gonna have to work here for five more years and build a 600 and I was like that's I was like five to ten years I have no idea what the world is gonna look like five or ten years from now I don't know if I've the capacity to work that luck you know I don't know if I can maintain this 800 million dollar business and the three million dollars just doesn't seem that interesting yeah you know what's crazy is now I also like when you're looking when you're starting to look at companies when I see a bunch of ads like in the subways of New York City or on Billboard's I'm just like I don't know if that no longer like holy [ __ ] that brand is awesome when I see stones happening at the end of quarters like at the end of March or at the end of June I'm just like these guys are looking to me quarterly numbers that they're you know that are that are required by their board yeah and so he's seeing how businesses are sort of building themselves specifically because they raise a ton of outside capital instead of trying to focus on building the best pasilla and I feel like the reason might be and and I'm not sure about this but like you know I think that the VCS who had a lot of experience in tech like tech needs capital often right not only is it not always as much capital as some of these tech companies have received I was just looking at Shopify I think they've only raised four before kind of before they went public it only raises like 130 million or something like that which isn't really a time honey any gray is like 60 and so Shopify is now worth seventy four billion dollars raised at like a 300 400 million evaluation and honey I think race sixty million and sold for four billion so even those companies honey raised less money than like Casper above us or guys which-which again it's like I think it's just because VCS wanted scale they wanted growth versus having a healthy brand really focusing on a consumer and like if it's resonating it's resonating you can't force it and I think that that's where people got you know people can you can force people to buy someone you can spend a lot of money you spend a thousand dollars for something to buy a watch if you bought it right like that's possible to do but it doesn't back out and that's what they were doing on you know blue apron or Casper and etc and and now the mentality has shifted I mean I hear it just from like my network that like you sees are looking for more profitable businesses and they're you know it's it's it's a total mind shift and it's funny because like back in the day I remember talking to some of the bigger like bigger funds and just just networking not even looking to raise but we talked about our business and kind of get laughs that it's like not I'd left that like it's just not it's not a real business it's not gonna be can't scale this business blah blah blah and so I don't know I wrote this article recently his name was and he's like the reason that glossier and a way of working is because they don't have any competition as opposed to like the caspere's of the world that have a ton of competition and I'm like are you [ __ ] insane you think a way doesn't have any competition in [ __ ] luck of course they're just like less competition I'm like they do a great job with branding they do a great job with marketing and they're out hustling people building and and like being operationally efficient as opposed to the casters of the world that weren't operationally efficient and burned a ton of money yeah it is insane how DC's don't get direct-to-consumer even though it's been around for so long and it puts so much money into it yeah I think they're I think you're building yeah right I think and I hope that they're starting to in it and and they're you know I think it maybe not the biggest ones because they're looking for big opportunities but some of some smaller you know VCS are look are happy with the smaller exit right like yeah they're okay with that but I think the B C's that we were talking to back in the day are you know have huge funds with with businesses like snapchat and so forth and it's a big it they want a billion dollar evaluation type of a billion dollar exit is kind of what they want when you think about it so did you like had that mind that might have already shifted by the time or was that still like I feel like that's a pretty new mind I'm not even sure like you sold the business in 2018 I'm not sure that might exist in 2018 I sold my business in 2017 I'm positive it didn't exist in 2017 in 2017 people are like why are you selling your business why do you raise more money and really grow this thing I was like we're doing tens of millions of dollars in revenue we're doing a million dollars in EBIT a month at this point like it is a [ __ ] real business and I don't know how much longer I can keep continued its growth trajectory and I'm not sure I can do it by myself you know had that mind shift mindset shift into profitability by the time you sold your business or was that still a year away I mean sorry thing were we always profitable are you saying just no no I'm saying DC's DC started thinking about profitability in I actually think one of the big or bigger articles that came out I think you were in it as well jason delray from yeah I don't know what a publication yeah yeah recode yeah yeah and he published and it was like me you too big acquisitions who and he kind of the writing on the whiteboard shadows and I think it might have been least as well he goes these companies you know either raise very little or are profitable and you're seeing acquisitions successful everyone's successful in that position right employees get money we get money like the you know the choir is happy like it's across the board it's a good acquisition and he kind of says is this the future and I think that was probably right around 2018 and I think you started to see a shift when but no bus you know kind of get got we got written off by by Walmart and you start to just see kind of a trend across the the the kind of industry but yet your point I don't think it was I don't think it was adopted you know widely until probably more recently than ever yeah yeah the talk didn't you know folks that he mentioned that article yeah anybody okay let's go back a little bit more to like movements growth you know from one seven thirty you're focusing on Facebook you diversify acquisition you know I've seen you and Cramer on television more than I've seen like no guarantee basically you know sometimes I watch TV and during commercials I'm just like I recognize Oh first stores are all consumers towards building pop-ups on TV it's just direct one time I saw you I think I saw like maybe Hubble contacts yeah and then me and I was like okay it's just us now I know some of the channels you know Instagram like influencers would like I think it was a Kim Kardashian at one point I've seen you run TV ads where are you spending money you know today over the last couple of years and how do those things that like you know does TVs still back out does it look do you know a native we never could afford influencer ads with Kim Kardashian's like major celebrities do those things back out or is it like Alert sort of test and learn process we were influencers I don't know if there's a Yelp that's good that's actually a great question I know there is definitely databases full of like you know ability to reach out and give him formation and feedback and engagement metrics so but in terms of like you know how was the experience in the back out like did they do they work with you well like it didn't really yeah at least didn't when we were doing it our first the biggest one was Kylie Jenner for us that was like early early on and that was back in the day we're like you know a lot of Instagram influencer marketing was backing out especially people like like Kylie who this was like yeah maybe it was 2015 that we did it maybe 16 so it was early on in the company today though it's spread out I mean you know we still do Facebook we do still do TV podcasts Instagram obviously I think we might still do some Pinterest and we've tested it anything from like snapchat we've done tabouleh back in the day so it's really like I mean ah I guess my strategy was you know you want to you want to figure out the right marketing mix and test into it any of an influencer you have like different tears right you have the kylie jenner's of the world and then you have people who maybe have 10 million or less who are who are influencers but that's that's kind of their their their getting product and that's kind of their main source of revenue or their a fashion you know or youtuber and then you have maybe below a hundred thousand or somewhere around there may be five hundred thousand who could be micro right yeah so we so there's like we're always testing we're always trying to figure out well you know where are we spending the most efficient dollar is it doesn't make sense our you know is that is the amount of sales that we're getting in one channel like the incremental revenue we're getting they're like what does that actually equate to and so we're just trying to figure out like we're always testing and that's what we've kind of built that in-house and that's yeah I think what's made us special is that you know if there is a marketing channel that comes around like we can identify it and apply kind of our methodology to it in it and it's a very agile you know methodology versus just you know buying TV even though buying TV the way that we probably do versus buying kind of national broadcast is different but it's a little like buying on Facebook or buying on tabouleh or snapchat any of those or Google or very or more or more similar I'd say than buying kind of paid media yeah it's crazy like marketing is really a living organism like you can't be like okay Facebook works it's gonna work for me for her you have to like diversify and like maybe Google works for ear and then it doesn't I remember snapchat worked for us for a while didn't work for us after that yeah but you really have to diversify those marketing channels pretty quickly and like constantly be testing them to be like it's a working hour if not even Facebook but you know which has been look Facebook has been a behemoth obviously in digital advertising probably since 2014 today Facebook is like right now Facebook is very different than oh my you know two months ago like if you talked to like Facebook just returning earlier today and they're like you know we're not in from advertising cuts you know Expedia that a CEO of Expedia was like we spent five billion dollars a year on advertising usually this year we're gonna spend 1 billion and we've already spent a ton of that it's because like you know kovetz going on and so these began crisis have come down yeah I wanted omen influence our advertising because I feel like you guys were one of the earliest guys to do that you talk about 2015 2016 is it just a lot of like well one can you talk about the most you ever paid an influencer like well I'm curious what is the most you've ever paid it was definitely in this it was it was somewhere around for a single post it was close to like yeah like $150,000 okay yeah maybe but that was early on and yeah that was a that was again different I'm like I don't think that we certainly want to do that today unless it was like you know there was someone who's we're gonna be ongoing working with the brand or you know collab or whatever the case may be but so yeah that was that's a big chunk of change why would you do that today is it because they're like the numbers we're backing out in 2015 and don't necessarily back out look in 2015 people saw that they were like what is this I want to engage with this while in 2020 they're like this is an ad by this influencer or something yeah I think I think it's a combination of all the right like back then it was first off the engagement wasn't you know repressed they you could so you were getting more engagement you're getting you know more impressions right if she had 50 million followers or whatever it was back then you know majority of those people probably saw it Facebook was you know the post four chronological or whatever it was and you so that was that and then also just she wasn't posting a ton of ads right she wasn't Oracle you know collaboration so I don't even know if she was posting much about her own stuff at the time so this was just it was just the right time right place and I think today even remove her you know any huge person you know with 50 million or more followers like I just don't I don't think the engagements there like people just aren't seeing the post as much as they once were and even if they do they're just I mean it's it we're just we're just you know used to it by now to see you know unfortunately you know it adds you know they're just even if they're even if they're you know as authentic as possible and they really use the product and they love the product unless they really back something personally and are like you know they're they're a partner like I just don't necessarily see it backing out like it once did so but you know there's arbitrage elsewhere always right like maybe you take stalks that next place maybe twitch right which is a big place that we're trying to figure out especially with those blue light blocking glasses like yeah you know the gamers are farther it screens yeah and they have I mean we you've seen like the trends about the ninja ninja gamer and then there's a bunch of them that honestly I feel like the average person doesn't know much about but it's this underground world that's just absolutely booming yeah are you already advertising and take talk right now I don't know that we're do we have a tick tock account we're creating videos we're playing with it I created I finally created a tick tock just to figure it out I've now I now understand how something can get the amount of views it does and I don't know if it's all 100% authentic but nonetheless people are seeing it there's there's a lot more opportunity for the average person or or to growth act let's call it tick tock then there is Instagram today in my opinion I think you can get a lot more impressions on tick tock for free and I see them doing some paid stuff and the great thing about their paid stuff which I don't think we've gone into yet but they're paid stuff looks very it looks like a regular post so yeah you have to almost double take and it's there it says if you have to double taking oh that's an ad so they do a great job their ad units is what we call them or her you know really gray but we are doing some stuff on Twitch but that's not that's I don't think we're actually paying like twitch commercials as much as we're working with individuals on Twitch kind of yeah does any marketing channel represent more than like 25 percent of your marketing spent like its Facebook more than 25 percent are influencers I think Facebook still the majority uh still the majority yeah but just I feel like it's pretty common for most e-commerce friends but yeah I mean Facebook is just like so good at what they do yeah we can create demand yeah and the better the better that you do at Facebook the better that you are at Facebook the the you know you get more learnings from like what creatives working what ad units working your certain audiences so just I mean you ran it yourself right for so long as well so it's just I think it's it's yeah it's the the scary thing is when you get too deep in it and and Facebook starts dictating you know your your business a little bit based off of like what's selling on Facebook too much and you become reliant on oh well this ads working for this specific you know watch or the specific you know sense of deodorant and yeah it's not necessarily working so it's a balance of like is it the ad is it so there's there's there's a I don't know it's it's it's still relatively new you know comparison the TV or anything else so yeah yeah I mean it's both native it's both our greatest strengths and our greatest weakness like we were great at it it was minting us a ton of money and it was scary as hell because what does this change what he longed to do categories are they gonna go as well as deodorant in yeah he's really terrifying are you guys more male or female focus I have to imagine male we launched it a few years female I think maybe 2016 show so about four years now but it's it's actually closer it's actually closer to 5050 now I think in terms of product if I'm not mistaken we have a look we have a lot of female buyers who buy for you know whether it's you know boyfriends or whatever that you know the case may be so it's yeah watches and it watches even sunglasses or can be you know great gifting items so we do get a lot of gifting I don't know I don't know if I don't have deodorant as much a gifting it's actually more than like q4 is our slowest quarter yeah like you know we are able to say hey this pack of like you know healthy freedom products yeah it works I mean it's not as good as surprisingly okay and or watch it's still the majority of your business right now I would have to imagine sunglass watches are still majority sunglasses law I'm just kind of secondary so sunglasses and if you if you combine sunglasses never scrolls they're definitely you know a growing kind of segment of the business but watches are still the majority okay let's fast-forward to 2018 you're now talking to Movado what is the firt like is the first conversation with Movado face-to-face is it like it's like email is it like when the first time you've met them face to face is in LA or wherever they are I have no idea time we met them and I think they came to us I want to say we I think they came to us we we had met with them or no we had talked to them we had a kind of a mutual contact we had talked to the CEO you know years before just more so just you know again I think you just want to if there if there's a way to work together one day partner if there's a way that you know just just keep the dialogue open like you know here's what here's who we are and what we're doing and then we ended up kind of getting in contact when we were you know contemplating it do we raise or yeah you know what's what's the case and maybe there's an opportunity to work together or partner and they were interesting interested in acquiring us and and then it was like well okay is that the right thing for us movement the company the employees and and then as we you know went further we're just like this makes so much sense they have you know infrastructure that again complements like what we do today what we where we want to go in the future they have experience in you know obviously manufacturing and other categories so I think they came out to us if I'm not mistaken either they came up to us or we went to them because I think it was it was supposed to you know we needed to make sure that people didn't see us you know meeting their employees or our employees so so they definitely didn't just come in the office out the gate if I imagine correctly I think it was it was like initial kind of meaning somewhere off-site and then I can't remember where it was a little bit there in New Jersey yes there in New Jersey and then they have an office in New York as well gotcha how often they evolve they have offices all over the world actually and I believe in Switzerland as well and well before all of this I was probably was out there too often maybe like three or four times a year which wasn't which wasn't too bad and then that we make a trip like last year I went to Dubai for a big conference in Switzerland for a big conference so yeah it wasn't it wasn't all that it wasn't too much but definitely yeah I had never been New Jersey beforehand so this was you know four times in year after it was and the vibes a little I now have my favorite hotel restaurant you know oh here's this uber driver that I recognize again process you know can you tell me a little bit about you know what is going on through your head as well like you know when you're when you haven't raised any money but you know and you're you in credit card debt when you started a business by the end is the number that you sold for public were not public the number we sold for it was public so it's can you imagine can you talk about that Network yes it was a hundred million dollars and then there was one million dollars and then there was like an earn a component but for us the process took about like 75 days I believe from like initial kind of conversation so what went fast because yeah again we were contemplating well do we raise money what do we do and yeah and this was you know we I mean everyone wanted to move fast so it was like a 75 day process of from initial I think phone call to you know you you know hired you know banks to kind of help you with the process and then you meet you know these parties meet and then there's due diligence kind of that they go through on your end and and then it's just kind of figuring out you know any questions that have essentially because they need to be comfortable with you know the business and questions as well so and were you comfortable I'm sorry do you think that the relationship that you had had for a few years these guys was helpful for us I never had a relationship with P&G or almost nearly any of the guys who were talking to us until we were selling the business was your relationship with Movado you know that was built up over time important to that or do you think it would have happened anyway I think it was important we didn't have we didn't have it's not like I hadn't you know met or talked to them much so it was like you know it was just an introduction that kept us top of mind it's a more superficial relationship yeah yeah yeah and I'd say that you know I'd say that I would recommend for entrepreneurs if they have if they know who like a strategic is that they think that you know they could get acquired by and complement that business and help that business and vice versa I think it's worth you know figuring out a way to get in touch with that person and you know you know you obviously you're always scared cuz it's competition like they could acquire you or they could you know they're all these companies are big enough to go and start their own version of it right so you you want to you know you want to just have a conversation it's like you kind of you know dance around a little bit and be you know you want to create an authentic relationship without sharing too much of the business but sure you know he was he was always that you know again he was a great you know the conversation we had with him was really great it was just you know an introduction time who we were what her story was dropped you know kind of what we're doing now it was really just interested in who we are what we were doing and wasn't trying to like you know get information or anything that was just a very and we had conversations with different people over the years and I actually have friends again who are in certain businesses who make it a point to be really friendly with like Sur and they send them product unsolicited with a note right like and they in it and it could you know I think I think I mean we're all humans right I think if you get for some people who are really trying to reverse engineer that exit like I think yeah if you have a relationship with someone who is in the driver's seat of making that decision and they're familiar with your business it's going to get them more excited about the business so versus just having no clue and then one day getting a call saying hey this is my business like it's at that point it's probably too late so I do think it's probably a good idea that you know yeah it's sometimes it works out yeah yeah absolutely and like this personal relationships are so important I remember like you know getting along with somebody who you might work for or work with it's so I remember when you're trying sell native there was a guy that we were chatting with and he's like I can tell you're not serious about selling native online how could you pop loose that we're doing tens of millions of dollars in revenue millions of dollars in Ubud ah he's like because you don't own native come and I was just like I don't know I was just like you don't know what you're talking about and this is like the CEO of that company and we're sitting around like a dinner table probably 10 people and 15 people his senior executives are my bankers and I'm like you don't know what you're talking about it's like there's just silence in the room yeah I was just like you have no idea what the [ __ ] you're doing with e-commerce silence and just like and like afterwards our banker the bankers and I would sort of just walking around San Francisco he's like that was the banker was like that was a really awkward conversation and I was like yeah I don't know what else to say this guy doesn't know what the [ __ ] he's talking about when it comes to e-commerce he's totally he has no business in cars he's trying to tell me about my injury I'm not trying to tell about his but I know what he's wrong and it gets me really excited afterwards I love like afterwards he takes me out like you know he and I go to dinner one-on-one and he's actually great and like he and I grew up watching like infomercials feather and that's how we got good at marketing and I remember like talking about like the rotisserie chicken and like the Ron Popeil mystery chicken I love it I love the guy and I remember him saying he's like look there are probably three people I would trust to take up my business and you're one of them boys and I was like you know it sounds like you guys don't get along good in reality and sort of appreciate what it takes to be a good owner and I really enjoyed them but in like those personal relationships and who you're gonna work with are so important I especially post-acquisition right like that the day you signed the docs it's great but like you're gonna have to work with this guy you're still at movement watches for you of you know it's been a year and a half since you've got to go along with that person stuff no absolutely they get on that so you saw the business you know all this money you go from in 2013 be a you know using your Chase Freedom Card to now having you know what he's like you know what do you do with the first thing you buy what do you do with all this money I think that was it it takes time to like settle in and I think for me at least like trying to figure out like what what you're supposed to feel when you you know sell your company you know it's obviously bittersweet because that means it's not yours anymore and and you know like you're waiting for this day to have you know kind of have the financial you know freedom so to speak that you want and but you're not gonna go immediately and buy out like it's not like you have a house lined up to buy tomorrow and even if you buy a house tomorrow like it takes another few months to like get settled in and like I'm 28 years old so like you know I live by myself so it's like what do I do I really want to go buy a house so it's it's and it's figuring out just like what life's like and and and taking a breath and not going in and trying to invest in a bunch of startups right away so for me it was like you know I think eventually that my biggest purchase was you know a condo that I mean it's a 1500 square foot condo so it's it's great for just me right now especially in quarantine but I did that but yeah it's like you know and then it for me it's it's like you know helping my family out and it's figuring out you know how I'm gonna you know invest you know the right way and and and so forth but I think the biggest balance is just like for me at least and I mention this a little bit before we started recording was just kind of like you know ultimately it's like what makes me happy was like what I was always in kind of searched for and like building a business having a financial a big financial outcome was like always something that I thought was something that was gonna make me happy and and doing and I think it's a component of it I don't I think if you're on if you're unhappy in your life before and you sell your company it probably is gonna just magnify those issues even more versus like I think I was like in a pretty good spot but this is giving me like I can't really be complaining about you know my financial situation so it's just figuring out like what do I live for outside of just work and and money like what are my hobbies or what what makes what what makes me happy and I think fortunately that can be my focus right a large piece of my focus which I'm super fortunate about but it's it's I think it's taken a couple years to like and I'm still working on but it's taking a couple years to really figure out things that make me happy and like keep my my brain kind of you know I'm stimulated etc what are some of those things the one I mean the number-one thing and I think has to come out of just like working out for me I think that like if I work out and eat whether it's cardio anything if I get a good sweat in and I instantly feel better that day like whatever I eat later I could eat like [ __ ] later that day whatever it is at least I got that workout in and like yeah you know and was moving and you just it just you feel better about yourself it's it's known to give you you know you're sure you're you know endorphins etc so I think that's a big one meditating has been big you know even if it's ten minutes a day or even a couple times a week that's been great you know I think those have been people I think relationships I really realized like okay like you know you you have this financial outcome but like and it doesn't need to be just like love relationships but just friends and general it's like one of my favorite things is like going on a trip with with buddies or doing stings for you know my family whatever it is and it's like those are things that make me happy so you know I'm on a road to still figure out I think my biggest thing in life to be honest is just to figure out it's a pursuit of happiness what is it that you could be happy with 100 K or 50 K you're like I think that's great that's fine it's just figuring out what is it that makes you happy and I think everyone's kind of in the race to you know make money because you need it to survive and and once you have your I think you're kind of the your life you know your regular finances you're kind of you know necessary finances in place I think it's then figuring out you know the things that make me happy I'm talking about working out right like working out anyone can do and sure and you know everything else I'm talking about there are things that people can do so it's just I'm just I'm fortunate that I'm able to take a step back and really kind of focus on it though yeah we met a few times in person certainly I think every time we get brunch in LA I'm always like amazed at how you know self-conscious you are about that happiness for me I was always like okay great being being wealthy is gonna make me happy no it absolutely doesn't you're absolutely right and like I would you know everyone says being rich doesn't make you happy and I feel like no one told me as I didn't believe it yeah you're right it's all about like what's inside of you but you happy not necessarily like it's just yeah and it makes it easier don't get me wrong like if you it like if you want to go take a trip or buy something but like I think I realized that like having a big TV or having a nice you know MacBook or iPad doesn't those things don't don't those don't make my happiness levels for the moment I open it I get this joy and then it's instantly gone pretty much after that but like experiences experiences are like number one yeah I think I think health mental health you know your body keeping those like at an all-time high and then experiences that ultimately like yeah like you know if I just try and look back on my life if I died tomorrow like if I look back on my life like what would I be upset I didn't experience or do or experience with certain people right like I have so many I think I'm also excited the fact that like just going through the journey a movement like these people I've done it with like you know especially early on like I have great relationships with those people I'm like and I want to make sure that like as people leave or like you know as the company changes that like keep I still maintain those relationships with those people and that's super important to me as well so yeah yeah the the people that I worked with the native or like my best friends yeah and you're right it's certainly a life is a lot easier but it is crazy where you're like man I really want this thing you end up making a purchasing decision to get it or you get invited to this thing that you've always wanted to get invited to it you never wear and get invited to and you're just like oh this is not gonna make me happy and you're just like [ __ ] I got ya and it's hard to also like mentally like you know I buy something and I'm like yeah you're right moment of joy would you buy it then all of that is gone instantly and you're like okay here's this other thing you know but you have to be like you know what I think this thing is gonna bring me two seconds of joy I wasn't worth it I thought with Justin Khan on Twitter he's he's [ __ ] like you know everything he says I'm just like I want to be like this guy he has a ton he has a ton of money and he's like I'm trying not to buy anything cuz i buy this $10,000 I'm just like afterwards I'm not happy about it again that's like crazy that that's so true yeah and it happens to everybody yep I did it for the first time I bought like a really like I bought some off-white is what I did that was my let me get let me just see I had to do it because it and I and I swear to God I haven't learned it once it's still in my closet not even because of the krona just because I was like waiting for the right time and now it's I'm just like okay I'll never do that again so yeah it seems once you have them you're just like I have no idea why yeah yeah you know you're like an investor an advisor at least for a bunch of direct-to-consumer businesses I know like Skyler I think is one of them that's go and I are both in yeah yeah yeah what do you think happens to direct your consumer you know Casper happened you know this darling of the direct consumer of this that sort of didn't go anywhere our voices had to do a recap you know brand 'less went out of business Cove it happened we work happen all of a sudden people are focusing on profitability in the next five years of direct consumer are people building more natives and movements or movements in a where are people still going to the you know vc-backed outcome or are they just built like you know what happens in the next five years I think for GBC businesses I think it's it's gonna be a more friends and family like you mean you may need more capital than a credit card you know to get it going but I think people are gonna be you know how more you know relatively bootstrapped or you know profitable kind of conscious businesses and I think it's still very possible and honestly mostly companies that I invest in are either they're either profitable or like very very very close to it and the only reason they're not is because they're growing so you know aggressively etc that it that it makes sense they're kind of on that that fence but but yeah I think I think again I think there will be some interesting potential businesses that come out of Co bid that aren't necessarily due to see or may need that may need capital to grow and maybe still you know chasing a big you know exhibit but I think in terms of like the direct to consumer brands I think it's I just from what I've seen the ones that are the healthiest and an able to I mean this is a good example this is the most radical thing that's ever happened right and I think pretty much our lifetime or parents lifetime and their parents but in terms of like who can you know weather the storm right now are people who you know I think it's people who have good businesses that are profitable and can stay afloat and and if they need to be more leaning they can be more lean but if you already if you already raised at a certain multiple like the difference between getting back to that environment you know could take years to get back versus a bootstrapped profitable company who maybe it adds another unit have two years to kind of your exit or wherever you want to whatever you wanted to get to but at least you can you control your business you maintain things like you stay lean and it just adds a little bit you know longer to kind of you know your timeline which i think is fine and it's not the end of the world by any means yeah couldn't agree more with all that all right really check really appreciate your time you know you said one of the things that brings you happiness is relationships I feel like the first time you and I met was I forgot we're in Santa Monica you and I were running through one of a few bootstrap is mister or like you were running one of those and I was trying to become and I always admired that and like you know inspiration from the way you built movement and like every time you and I I remember unite connect was in all of the business that you were building it was in all the way you were thinking about it I remember when you're thinking about selling your business you're like I'm gonna go and like I haven't told my parents I'm gonna tell my parents super excited I'm gonna have this financial safety because of me and I was in awe of not only the way you were thinking about about how humble were this relationship there's one that brings me a ton of happiness and I love connecting with you every time we do I feel like you know you and I are kindred spirits that want to build profitable businesses if that are willing to do that that are like you know independently that like are independent minded and sort of ignore the Silicon Valley ecosystem a ton of money and you know I've had great outcomes and we're both like happiness and like I've realized now that certainly doesn't come from financial success and I'm trying to figure out you realize what it is tell me Oh Cheryl sherry good I could have said it I could have said a better more yeah please couldn't have said it better man I appreciate it it's always been a joy to - you know hang out and to talk with you I get insight from you all the time as well so I totally appreciate it and thank you so much for having me on this podcast I haven't done a podcast you know in a while that I can remember so I was excited about this one so and wish you the best of luck with it [Music]

birthday's in a few days if anyone has anyone thinking alright if someone's thinking about you what should they do just buy me that cake what is milk bar is this a brand of cake yeah Chang David Chang he he started the like Momofuku bars and they decide to open up a dessert area and now that's spun off to its own thing called milk bar and they make trendy cakes I ordered one the other day it's pretty good how long does it take for it to get to you a week oh man see that's the problem not I'm never a thoughtful a week in advance I'm like day of I'm like I'm gonna do something but I need something that can get done that day it looks delicious Boston yeah you're in Austin okay I've been in Austin for three weeks now I want to come home on Saturday Austin is lovely it is a great place Sean is like is everyone in San Francisco gonna leave no everyone services not gonna leave I'm little definitely some people are leaving I'm looking at so I have a place in San Francisco I pay like five grand a month or something four to five grand a month and I am live it's like a thousand or a 100 square feet with the garage I'm live in a place that's probably $3,000 a month and it's like a 2,000 square foot house with the backyard and like furnished what am i doing yeah but the thing is you can go even further with that because like when I grew up I lived in a whole bunch of different countries I lived in Indonesia I lived in China and there it's like you know go to Indonesia you'll live like a king you can go live in Bali on the beach with a cook and a driver for the same amount you're paying in Austin right so this kind of this arbitrage of like cost of living it really never ends so be careful yeah I'm just it's making me question my life I look on Zillow all the time at for buying a home in San Francisco and the prices are dropping like crazy it says the 130,000 tune does not cut off of everything are you gonna have to cut on your house hopefully not if you're if you're the buyer listening to this I'm not taking one penny less than asking that's my position do you have someone who's gonna buy it now no no I don't know I haven't listed it yet but soon good and so your friends do a lot of friends leaving San Francisco I have friends who were already in the process of it this just kind of accelerated it so some people just lifestyle wise ready to go some people when they're like well if I'm not working from home and commuting I don't need to be here so yeah definitely this is accelerated people out but it also feels like things are opening back up so I think that you know things can change people can feel differently as soon as life gets a little bit back to normal you never know what what people will feel like so we'll see you as things open up I am very eager so you want to start you want to talk about some interesting stuff yeah you got one yeah I got one so I know I get a get past media but I just I love it so much okay so Jeff Bezos Bezos Bezos Amazon guy he owns Washington Post and a few years ago he goes you know I'm gonna buy and I'll let the editorial do its thing and whatever else I'm gonna stay out of it but I kind of want to take your guys's they built it on technology to publish their articles I kind of want to take that make that like a huge business and a lot of people try this and never very rarely works but what he did was or he didn't do it but he was somehow part of it they've created this thing called arc publishing and it does a couple things the first thing is companies like me pay money to use it but it's really interesting that you and I have talked about this idea but what arc publishing is doing is to go into companies like BP the oil company that has two hundred thousand companies and they are saying hey BP you have you know two hundred thousand employees we're gonna help you publish newsletters and articles and stuff to your to your employees which you already are but we're gonna help you organize it make sure it's read things like that and they're saying that in the next year or two they're gonna hit a hundred million in revenue watch me which means I bet Washington Post probably does maybe five hundred million in revenue in total but 100 million in this enterprise SAS revenue would be worth more than Washington Post it is and I wanted to get your opinion on a that's a cool idea that you and I had been noodling with for a while and they're just executing on a really interesting way and B the idea of branching out from your main thing to doing more and yes like something totally unrelated things in some ways it's totally a stupid I mean so there's an argument to be made like this is just a stupid idea never do it there's not even to be made that a lot of people do it successfully so what's your take on this so first this I've never heard of a park so this is my first time hearing about it just to clarify they give other brands or other companies the tools that Washington posta they sort of productize their own toolkit but is it always like the use case you talked about like BP want has 50,000 employees wants to publish internally or is it also external publishing I think that they're still trying to figure it out and I think that they're building it for a variety of reasons at first it was just for publishers and then B they closed this deal at BP and they I think to them they're like huh maybe that's the way that's the right no I there's something to that because you know when I started the podcast I used to go to this podcast studio before you guys built a dope studio in your office I was going to this like kind of rent a studio by the our place and I was talking to the guy who did it and he was like they had a sports radio station on 20 seven sports radio station and then they were like well we know how to build the studio we built one for them what if we turned a few conference rooms into broadcasting booths and we did probably offered it to podcasters these hipsters and SF they love this [ __ ] and so they didn't say by the way in San Francisco there there are no they they're basically the only one and truckin inside yeah and so I went there and I was like hey can I get 11 a.m. tomorrow and he was like no were booked up from 11:00 to 3:00 on my [ __ ] who else who are the podcasters using this and he was like oh this is Facebook they was like Facebook he's like yeah they have an internal podcast that they do for their employees because Facebook has I don't know tens of thousands employees maybe 50,000 I don't know but they have managers who come in and record a podcast about managing at Facebook and it gets distributed only internally and I was like I never heard of a internal only podcast that a company was doing but of course you know makes sense people want it put out content training you know different things like that whether it's in text or audio form that was my first time hearing about these like internal publishing systems that I had never really considered and that's what they need to create a lot of this stuff like hey everyone so here's how we're addressing this situation here's what we're gonna say here's the words we're using yadda yadda yadda or we're quitting this product here's why yadda yadda yadda but here's how to use the internal software yada yada yada it's a great idea I think and you and I had discuss a slight variation of this but I want the listeners to tweet at me and tell me and I always hid the idea when people say like oh I can't do this it already exists but I just want to know does to success who is solving this problem yeah okay we've talked about a few variations of this so let's go over them so this is all in the bubble of the theme of what I'll call I mean I want to say internal publishing because that sounds lame as [ __ ] but basically intra-company stuff so I'll think of a good name in a second but basically we talked about QA starting All Hands software because you know big companies do all hands for their whole employee base also individual company you know divisions will do all hands for their group and what you need there is video streaming you need chat or QA functionality but it needs to be private it needs to be internal it needs to be behind a wall that nobody else can get to this so a lot of people already have video streaming services out there but that's for mass you know it's like YouTube it's twitch it's things for to go get a big audience but this is for a select audience it's a little bit different so we talked about that one we talked about when we were we were going over Hemingway and how it makes you a better writer we were saying what if you could do this for internal your emails inside a company but also just a MailChimp for your company so how does somebody get the word out within a company how do they make nicely formatted easy to read you know company announcements and bulletins that come with the kind of tools that MailChimp has like tracking opens and clicks and that sort of thing so that's an internal MailChimp internal podcasting what these guys are doing is basically internal you know Washington Post which is like a whole bunch of different features and functionality they have but these guys have you know broadcasting like live streaming they have blogging they have are you reading though the website yeah I'm going through their products they have a huge set of things busily everything you would need to make watch Nepos so I think that's just an interesting thing to think about what if you took the best-in-class products that people use to publish and broadcast to large audiences and you said how do companies need this just for internal broadcasting internal announcements I remember my brother-in-law he owns Jim's yeah I'm like 50 Jim's and he was like yeah dude I just need an easy way to mass text all my employees on a text list the kind of numbers for the day and any key announcements about what we're trying to do he's like you'd be surprised it's really hard to like get this stuff set up and get this make this a part of the onboarding of my company so that yeah everybody knows they should join that's the SMB like this business version which it also is a good idea and then the second thing you talked about is you know when do you when do you do this when do you take your eye off your core business and how do you expand into other lines of businesses I think that's you know generically a hard thing and it's a case-by-case thing you have plenty of examples where it worked and it becomes a huge business unit it let's call AWS being the best example of this where Amazon takes its own sort of server and compute system and services system and makes it available to any company and now AWS brings in you know tens of billions of dollars a year and so that's like the best-case scenario and then you have a probably you know hundreds of thousands of other examples that you could come up with where somebody does this it doesn't take off it becomes a distraction etc etc and you guys have considered this too so how do you how do you guys think about this yeah so when we consider everyone says the same thing we go well Amazon did it let's just make AWS for them and I'm like well you have to understand that Amazon did it like ten years into the business when they were ten thousand employees and throwing 250 people at that problem is ain't no thing and so at my company's like yeah okay I could hire a person like I have no problem a couple people like doing it but you do need to get like your main thing right first that said I struggle with it because I have a TD and I want to I want to do this [ __ ] so it's hard I don't know what like twitch I bet twitches in the same boat they're big enough and they can have these same projects and a lot of the infrastructure that they probably are built on I bet they had to make a lot of it from scratch after so I don't know I don't know so twitches ten years into the business and you're right they invented essentially the best-in-class let's say live video streaming at scale where you can have a hundred thousand people all watching one channel with low latency and it doesn't fall over and broadcasting around the world nobody else really had that problem so nobody else built a solution and so you could imagine that twitch could say hey we could make this available to others and that they could spin it out as its own business unit and I think that might be a good decision right because you're taking an asset you've already have that you were something that you've refined that sort of battle tested and brandable right like your sales pitches hey we use this for the biggest live streaming network you know out there but at the same time it's a distraction and they wouldn't have done it your one two or three they you know could do it at year ten because at that point your core is stable it's not going anywhere it's not gonna die and so you know I always make these analogies and I don't know if my team really likes it but I always talk about like you know the startup is like a baby and like with a baby a baby just they need to eat they need to sleep they need to poop and nothing else matters like you don't need to teach baby calculus right now you don't need to you know do all this other stuff and but as it becomes a teenager or gets ready to go to go off for college you know you don't have to watch it so intently you don't have to worry about is it gonna you know keeping the baby alive every single day that's the main objective of early stage but as you get later stages you don't have to worry about that which lets you why don't they like that's a good analogy why don't they like it I think it's cuz I'm always like right now we've got to keep the baby alive and it's just like sort of a dark a darker hue talking about it like I did this with one of our companies in the idea lab I was like we had one company that was already mature it was already profitable making millions of dollars and we had this other project that was totally unproven and so anytime you had to decide where do I spend an hour it always seemed like a good idea to spend it on the thing that's making millions in profit never to spend it on this super speculative thing but if we did that we would have never invested in the new thing and so I made a decision I said hey we can't have the baby and the teenager in the same room because they have totally different needs they need different type of care and you know one will always look feeble and weak compared to the other but that one that's people a week today has the most growth potential and so we need to be investing in that too and so let's split these two companies up and let's spin them out what about you do you think you are like me where you have a TD and you like starting stuff or are you the opposite where you like to run it I have a TD in the sense that I like I am attracted to doing a new thing I'm attracted to new strategies new ideas but the second your question was do you like to run it or not run it of course in my ideal world I don't have to run it somebody else runs it takes the idea to fruition and I get to own the whole thing but in reality I found that that is much harder to implement it doesn't mean it's impossible much harder to implement yeah this is an interesting discussion I was reading about a Copeland about the Koch brothers you know that is I know the Koch brothers I saw you putting this in the Facebook group that you were you were sort of summarizing what you had learned what is the TLDR so all I know is Koch brothers super rich old white guys that I think support like you know the Conservative Party so what do we know besides everything that you've just said is the stereotype about them that 99% of people think it is about them and the reason I wanted to read the book about them was it was just interesting but what I learned is they're far more rich than that not in terms of money but they're much richer character they kind of get pegged now I'm not saying that they don't do evil stuff but they get pegged as these old white guys who control the conservative party in reality they're quite libertarian and they actually give money to all types of charities I mean they give a lot of money to gay rights organizations because one of the brothers is is gay they give a lot of money to prison reform because they don't want people to they think the criminal justice system is screwed up and they're very principled and it just so happens that the Republicans definitely do a lot of the stuff that they want to give money to but they go across the board there and the way that they got started was the father started an oil company and that oil company was somewhat successful like it was making thirty million dollars a year in American sorry in today's dollar in profit so like successful very successful but the 31 year old brother Charles took it over with the father died and turned it into the largest privately owned business in America mm and so he took something that did 30 million dollars in profit to now probably like 10 billion dollars a year in profit and got out of oil what did they do with yeah was that they took their 30 million they they owned owned an oil refinery and they did a combination of things including so the thing about oil is it goes through this tower and oil turns into gasoline but then but then the left or sub turns into kerosene and the left over stuff turns into Vaseline and the left over stuff turns into propane and so they just started like selling all the leftover stuff and they took those profits and then bought different companies so they you know Bounty paper towels they make those a lot of the paper that newspapers printed on they make that a lot of it's called what's that gore-tex is it called gore-tex what's like it's like a loo and lucre is it lucre that's the material that Nike makes shoes out of that's really strong it's like that plastic they make they they make that so they just make stuff that originally started as oil but now it's expands but it's still like making stuff and their operations are basically this like let's just like start a lot of start or buy ton of stuff and it all served with one thing and that's kind of one of the reasons why I'm interested in this topic I like that a lot it was just a great description and B that totally changes my like kind of like expands the stereotype I had of the coke brothers in my head you know I never brought bothered to sort of look under the hood and be like what is this what how do they get rich are they really just the sort of evil manipulators of the conservative party type of thing or is there more depth to it so that's kind of a chance well I'm not saying that well I don't think they are evil I think that they do some things that they're some of the things they do a lot of people particularly liberal people strongly disagree with but take my who Michael Moore I don't think they're evil I told you about my friend my friend who I'm like this guy's gonna be a billionaire he's like 22 years old I'm like this guy's gonna be a billionaire someday he he interviewed with the Koch brothers to be they're like head of investments or something like that and he was like pretty far down the interview process and I was like dude do you feel like you know a certain type of way that it's you know the Koch brothers or whatever it was like he just laughed it uses like his money green okay money's green thank you that's all I care about he's like I so ruthless about the way he he looks at these things I find it hilarious and ultimately he didn't do it because either a they didn't offer enough or B I think they're based out of like Kansas or Nebraska or something Wichita Kansas Wichita he was like yeah I don't know if I want to live in Wichita for X number of years to do this so he pulled up well if he got offered and he didn't take it he's an idiot but I'm sure he'll figure out his way okay that's that's pretty interesting I like the anything else all the Koch brothers otherwise I like that that's sort of I would say that's the Billy of the week then in this case yeah I'll finish it up with I'm reading Co Klan and so that is a book that has a it's it's clearly trying to be negative about them it's still a great read and then there's sons of Wichita which is their biography which tries to be objective and then there's another book called it's it's it's either called one of them is called good prophet and then the other one is called market based management but good and describes the Koch brothers management philosophy and it's incredibly interesting nice okay I like that yeah I just start reading a lot more recently and it's like the best decision I made which sounds like stupid it's not even like worth talking about but the reality is there's probably a lot of people like me who like to read go through these phases where you like intensely read and then like don't read anything for two years and if you're that person like just do it go back to the reading thing it's great I just did it and I don't regret it at all I'm reading this thing called the happy body which is like really interesting it's about the these guys who study weight lifters they base their like you know what what should you strive for with Fitness and they're like well you should strive for these like three or four things that you know you don't want to be a bodybuilder where you're just strong but you're slow and you're inflexible you don't want to be a baby where you're super flexible but you're weak you want to be X and they start to outline it and there's all these little tests and so I'm always doing them and making my wife dude I'm like okay stand against the wall standing up the wall raise your hands above your head and I'm gonna count the points of contact against the wall okay here's how you are in terms of you know body Makena your alignment or your posture or whatever it is so there's all these little tests which is makes it a lot more fun to read then si this are you doing this because you feel like you're getting old I'm doing it because it came recommended I think somebody somebody said this is a great book and then the other thing is I'm I basically believe that everything that there's sort of common knowledge about food and fitness is just so like confusing and [ __ ] and like contradicts itself so so frequently that I'm looking for better like source material like not sell me a fad diet or new you know p90x um this book reads almost like a textbook and I find that a lot more appealing because I don't feel like I'm being sold to some program or some you know diet and products and [ __ ] like that so alright I got two ideas for you that are both based on zoom actually I have a better idea let me go to the better idea first okay so did you see today snapchat did a like I do they're like developer conference thing yeah so they introduced us a few things and they were like hey you know last time we introduced games and games are doing great and they were talking about games to get more people to build mini games on snapchat but they introduced other things called minis and minis is actually I think a bigger move by them so minis are basically the mini applications built into snapchat what they're doing is they're copying WeChat which is the big messaging app in China WeChat has like a million little apps built-in like oh you need to pay your bills you just do it through WeChat and how do you do that well there's this little mini website that the you know the utility company makes that'll just pop up in your WeChat and you hit pay and it's paid or you want to do this you want to buy movie tickets together you do it within WeChat like we don't do that in iMessage we don't do that in facebook Messenger but that's what all these companies would love to bid love to be WeChat here in the States so snapchats taking a big stab at doing that and they announced like so for example one of the minis is headspace so you can do like sort of a quick meditation with anybody else on one of your friends from snapchat they did a movie ticket buying thing they did you know so they did several of these and she's not yet I don't know how the socks do it but what's interesting here is that snapchat sort of in a position where they have to become a platform to compete because Facebook and Instagram have sort of just declared like we will steal your we took your mojo already and if you come out with some new great mojo like guess what you know Evan Spiegel you're the head of product at Facebook actually whatever you come up with we are gonna put in our apps as soon as humanly possible so their only strategy they have basically two core strategies one is maybe they can create snap glasses these like AR glasses and they can just sort of get off the cell phone game and get into the glasses game before anybody else so that would be like a what snap mini website what do you call it they call them snap minis and what they are are little mini websites that can pop up and be a little like utility things to do inside snapchat besides message each other now the second thing is becoming a platform because Facebook and Instagram don't do a great job of letting other companies build [ __ ] on top of them people just trust those companies they've built apps on top of Facebook and messenger before and gotten screwed and so they don't have great ecosystems so snapchats kind of pushing their chips into the middle of the table and saying come build [ __ ] on us we'll treat you better than those guys will and you kind of believe it you kind of believe it because it's really their only way to compete with Facebook and Instagram so they kind of have to actually honor this so anyways a quick idea so in general I think that being early to these platforms and these app app ecosystems is a good thing there's been several snap kit apps that have been like number one and number two on the App Store so they've gotten a [ __ ] ton of distribution from it what's a snap kit app snap kit is basically the toolset that snapchat gives you to build to build stuff so it's like okay snap kit will say you want to access their bitmoji cool snap kit lets you just type one line and you get their bitmoji character you can do stuff with snap kids their camera with all their lenses I'm doing this course and a lot a lot of things we talk about our inflections so what our what our inflections and and there's a variety of styles of inflections there's technology inflections which is like basically like oh my god the Internet is now in everyone's house that is an inflection there's an opportunity there or a belief inflection is like wow people really don't trust the media what can we do to help or people are afraid to be in groups of thousands of people how can we fix it what we are seeing right now is a technology inflection or a platform inflection detection yes and this is it this is like when so Pandora the music company Tim told me that the company was around for three years and it was doing horrible and he said they heard about the Apple Store for some reason Steve Jobs reached out to them and said you guys might be a good like place to put your [ __ ] here and once that happened he was cool and this I don't know if it will be but this is potentially one of those yeah these are asymmetric bets sure maybe most of the time these platforms either don't work out or there's nothing cool to build and you'll waste you know a month of your time or you might catch a wave early and you might get to the top so for example the very first episode of this whole podcast chain is with Tsui and so he talks about he was working at Microsoft and he realized he wants to quit and go start a company quits he moves back home with his parents for like two weeks and the fruit and the first two weeks he's kind of bored and the day he quit basically Facebook did their developer conference and said hey we're making Facebook platform anyone can build an app on Facebook now so he goes home and he's like all right I don't know if there's gonna be a business I don't think so but he's like I just need to start programming in just to get my you know get get the rust off and so he builds a Facebook app that was stupid it was like a superlatives app like which of your friends is most likely to end up in jail or whatever boom goes viral you know he ends up with tens of millions of users and that changed the trajectory of his life where Silicon Valley starts calling him and you know Duvall flies him out to San Francisco and wants to invest in a man [ __ ] like that so he took a bet on the sort of day the platform launched if I'm a board developer today or I'm somebody who's got you know the code and you know a weekend I would be building something on top of snap kit the thing I would build is actually so I think what's hard is when you want to build something that gets the user to leave snapchat and come to your app so you kind of have to build something that can actually do the whole experience should just be on snapchat and it should not compete with what snapchat does so here's the idea okay yes I call it cameo kick so basically I think you could build the app cameo on top of snapchat so you were basically the cameo Kate would just say cool I want to buy a snapchat from one of these celebrities and I'll pay you right here through snapchat and then I want to send it either to myself or to my friend on my snapchat list so basically imagine I it's your birthday coming up right when's your birthday it's in a few days yeah you actually bought me a cameo you had Gilbert Godfried caught me a [ __ ] right so I did that last year but but this year I could do it through cameo gave a little new invention of vine so basically I would go and snapchat I would open it up I would see a list of influencers that are that have snapchat which is like every celebrity in the world I would request a video and I pay right there and then you would receive a snapchat from either from me or from them in your inbox and the whole cameo experience could be built on top of snapchat without having to have separate websites separate apps all that stuff and you compete with cameo very quickly so I think that's a very simple idea that could monetize on top of snap kit what else what are other ideas that can monetize and I think that you I'm sure a lot of people have spotted this but you you're the one who told me about it so I'll tribute the genius to you I think that's a great idea this is a good spot buy you what else which one bet that one just now yes besides um besides cameo kit a cool idea so ok so here's another one so here's an idea well what you said about paint paint your bills that's great like your utilities and like roommate stuff right yeah pay your rent I think is a easy one because younger people who split rent they could use snapchat or snap cash to just do it and so that's kind of interesting I don't know exactly how much that's in but that could be a problem that you solve I think that you could if you're a food delivery company you should probably get on this because one of the little fun things I've been doing another birthday thing instead of cameos somebody on my birthday just sent me food via post mates because they know where I live and so they just ordered me food and just showed up in like door and they just said you know like this is from this person and I was like oh that was great that's like a $20 gift that is awesome and took them no effort and so that's my new hack I just sent people post mates just for fun as gifts and so I think you could do something like that but here's another one I saw a company that's called moonshot very very fun company idea what they did was they're like hey all everybody's working from home which is cool and convenient in some ways but the one thing you really miss is the sort of camaraderie and interaction with your core lives and what would tell the readers or listeners and me what can I go to find that because I just searched moonshot and I'll see it searched moonshot escape room so what moonshot is it's a virtual escape room that happens over zoom so it costs I think I think it's like 300 bucks to do the experience but it's great you know that as a team-building experience is nothing team you know companies will easily pay for that for their four groups of you know 10 to 12 employees to get together and do something and so I I do escape rooms all the time with my team I think is really fun way to you know go out and do something and so this is done all through zoom they built the whole experience digitally and I'm like oh this is really smart because you know escape rooms are actually pretty good businesses in general but this takes out the one biggest cost of escape rooms which is like you know the rent and the person the human being you need to like facilitate a whole escape room doing this on top of zoom is a really smart idea in my opinion this is great I don't know I don't know if that could ever be huge but it could be good I'm looking at it now it's what what's reason is that the company owns it I have no idea how did you find this this was on product um and then it got shared because again this was sort of remarkable people hadn't seen something like this so people started sharing it it went kind of viral yeah okay it's I mean you know so so here's another one in the last three months that we've been sheltered in place how many zoom birthdays have you attended none have you none what oh my god I've had to do five of these things including my own I believe oh my god son tonight mr. Furth what was your birthday now my birth is back in April but but but basically oh wait you know I didn't give you anything I'm sorry it's all good don't worry about it but in fact I usually hate my birthday because I hate you know believe it or not even though I have a podcast I like plaster my face everywhere and the cover art I actually hate when the when the attention is on me and it's like this forced fun things I was actually happy to skip my birthday but over this quarantine period I've been to so many zum birthday parties because people can't celebrate through you know the normal means now I think this is gonna last very long you just have more friends than I do yeah well you know that's what that's what I do but I don't know I don't think it's a last very long but if you could find some way to do celebrations over zoom if you could find a way to move I have one more tea my co-workers getting married on Saturday they're twitching twitch streaming I don't know what do you call the word they're streaming on twitch the wedding oh nice yeah so I don't know how long some of these last I think the the cameo on top of snapchat and I think the escape room over zoom I think that's more here to stay i don't think the birthday stuff will last very long but i like the idea of building stuff on top of zoom and a top of snapchat especially now that people are celebrating occasions and looking for ways to socialize remotely i would do uh rent payment easy no that's the first thing I'm focused on great idea that's a good one you want to do one or two more sure you got one or you want me to do it um yeah I had one let me only no I already I kind of like I did the Koch family and our publishing kind of it one it kind of fell into each other did we talk did we do a recap of death caught what's-his-name liquid death we did not do a recap no yeah what do you think about that okay so two weeks ago ten days ago we had this guy named Mike and he's heard liquid death its bottled water I had a lot of people have handy what message up can't water message essence say they think that the water was bad yeah yeah and I think the idea is kind of cool I don't I'm I liked him a lot I think that guy's a winner I think he's a winner too and I went into the thing being like I think this idea is kind of dumb we had talked about it before was kind of dumb and I came out of it being like maybe I'm shake this guy up to see if I can invest in this company and the reason why is sometimes it really just is that simple so he's taking a mass product like bottled water or canned water is a mass product water is the like you know the definition of a mass consumption product then the second thing is if you just did anything different in the water space and it latches on with any small percentage of that population you're gonna have a meaningful business and I think he's doing something very different compared to how the other brands are approaching it and I really do think this is gonna be a successful company especially once I met the guy and I was like oh this guy's a winner and he understands what this is and what it isn't and that makes sense to me yeah I would like to see how he operates I would he's the type of guy who I would be a little bit I would be a little bit nervous I wanted to know him more because he seems like a guy that is a little reckless and that could be both good and bad and that's a good call because he was talking about the previous company he built the the brandy company that he built and I think he's a great starter and he saw the opportunity he starts it he has a vision for the brand and what the cult what the culture wants now in terms of the blocking and tackling that it takes to just operate for like seven years straight probably not the best in that other company he kind of he was kind of vague about him he's like I parted ways with those guys it's all good terms you know I still have my shares what basically it was like okay thanks thanks for the creativity bud we'll take it from here it seemed like it was kind of that I could totally see that happening again with liquid death a person I admire once wrote that being artistic is the exact opposite of being of making money and are basically artists and capitalists are the opposite and I haven't decided if I fully agree with that but I tend to I Sam closer to agreeing with it than I am not agreeing with it and that artists are the opposite and that doesn't mean they're good or bad you know I I think a lot of art you should give a [ __ ] about the money it's it's great because it's interesting I don't care if it's if it's expensive and sometimes when people are artistic I think okay you're cool I don't think that you can make a peanut like run a company that has to make and save money right yeah I think that's probably true that you know if you have an extreme strength in one area you probably don't have the extreme strength in the exact opposite sort of skill set area what I hope for is you have to be just good enough to be dangerous in the other area so like okay you're super creative and you can you can build brands you know do you have just enough of the operational know-how and discipline to execute on this like you know Sophia Amoruso shoot when she was on she was like too clearly a great brand builder she did it with Nasty Gal she did it with a girl boss Elvis called to get a girl boss well she's a marketer he's definitely a marketer and she and she I think it's I think it's a little more the marketing in the sense that it is marketing but I guess it's like to identify what's in the soul of the customer and then be able to build a product or brand that taps into that and so I think she was doing a great job of that I think this guy Mike is doing a great job of that you know with Nasty Gal she didn't manage the other side of it and you know the train went off the cliff and and so you know you have to know enough for that or you hire people that that complement it in that way and if anybody has any wants of reading something about this I just read this blog post that was called pioneers settlers and town planners or something like that and it basically talks about like in any given company you have three types of people you have the pioneers who are gonna you know they want to go preach new land they want to be the first ones there and live off of you know what they can hunt they can kill and they keep and then you have sort of the settlers who follow in right after and they start to set up the you know the the very basic systems for life to continue and they're not just looking for the next thing like the Pioneers are and then you have the town planners that can organize like at large-scale systems and so none is good and bad or cool and not cool it's just a matter of like knowing who you are or knowing where you're at as a company and then making sure you have the right type of person leading based on what's needed if you need innovation you need a pioneer if you need operations you need more of a town planner coincidentally I've read at this article today called managers the difference between managing and leading and the idea was like people who are leaders are great and chaos and they don't really they're like very comfortable chaos they're very comfortable with ambiguity and that's important and people who are managers are all about creating something sustainable that can operate each and every day effectively and I'm for sure the leader for sure not the manager and and so I actually read something like that today so we're similar yeah right right on okay a couple other quick things that are that are kind of interesting so I want to get your opinion on this just give me a dumb or awesome the websites called human IPO app these guys are doing a very fancy branding around an old idea so what it does is I can go I can go do a human IPO so I'm Sean I go public I get a stock ticker which is like you know SHA or whatever and I basically IPO off a share of my time so I can option off up to 500 hours of my time you can book from me at a certain price and then if people think hey you know this Shawn guy he's on you know he's on the way up his time is gonna be more valuable in the future I'm gonna buy a unit of this guy's time I can either hold it and trade it later at a higher price or I can I can I guess use it to like book an hour of my time so this is the record on the website now it's incredibly interesting tell me what you think of it for sure interesting for sure innovative in a while and whoever invented this is a nerd and I [ __ ] love those types of people logistically I just don't think it makes sense because well so I can buy Brian's time well so if it was I'm looking at this right now I don't understand why they call it like it's they're really just rebranding just like expert networks and consulting like it's just like dude something screwed so I think clarity FM it's the same thing definitely cool highly unlikely to work right that's what I think I think this is like an art project that's me this is I don't know your how did you find this I saw it on my think product hunt and I was like yeah I've been following I think I talked about to some of the previous things I've been following these personal I SEOs personal personal coins that people are creating in the cryptic note this is not crypto but it's the same idea and I think it sort of has the same pros and cons I think it's like kind of exciting in a way to like bet on people and I think it's kind of lame in the way which is like what do I get I get an hour of their time like no on this you have like this guy I just clicked on you have to buy a hundred hours of its time at $250 an hour so what does that mean turn is that way as a 25 grand or turn 50 grand I didn't hear exactly you said but you have to buy a hundred hours from him at Tutor and $50 so that's 25 or 25 grand yeah so I but like I don't think like if I was this guy and I just sold a hundred hours of my time I have a feeling that I would bail on a lot of that yeah so one one piece is are you actually going to fulfill the second is so what am i doing it's actually basically like a freelancer selling blocks of design time or programming time or consulting hours or whatever it is okay that's cool maybe first really special unique people that that works I don't think this is that interesting over all the ones I think are more interesting are the ones where you actually get a piece of their earnings over the next X years let's never do that a million years I know but some people would some people would say cool I'll take you know it's like people who raise money for their company right they're selling off future earnings for capital today and some people might want instead of doing it for your company you might do it for yourself so I think it's interesting I want to see somebody like I'm gonna sign up for use case I wanna but do you know these guys can you introduce me can I be what are these people that they that can I sell hundred hours it seems I does seem interesting I'm just just from like a like an like an innovation perspective like it's just so weird and interesting I would love to I would love to try this I like it cool okay so that was the that was the last one I wanted to do do you have any other stuff you wanna go over or anything else on this list interesting I could talk about any of this stuff yes but I don't want to talk about it today Oh on here you have what is happiness and I'm I I want to learn all about that I also want to learn about hyb which I think I know what it is but I can't want to save it because the happiness thing was interesting to me in that happy book I haven't pulled up on my Amazon I am going to probably read that whole both of the next two or three days but that is interesting and I'll tell you why it's interesting is I'm obsessed with my posture right now because I've got one like strong and fit over the last three months and that's wonderful but I have scoliosis my like my posture is horrible and it's making me nervous because I'm like what's the point of getting strong if I'm like crooked and not healthy and I've looked all over the place for like good scoliosis workout routines I'm and I just want like a just something just like a posture doctor right and it's kind of interesting like a like a posture doctors kind of cool to me and yeah I thought about that I went I went for a run the other day and I was like I think I don't know how to run I think nobody taught me how to run and then I started running a certain way and then I got out of shape and I think I just run like [ __ ] and I know I don't swim the right way or there's like a better way more efficient way to swim also and I'm like I need to I want to clean all these up I want to clean up running I want to clean up by by walking you know cadence or whatever you call it and then also my swimming but yeah I'm similarly obsessed with these things and you know you've been getting jacked which I think you know props to you for doing every time you send me one of these videos you know Sam sends me these videos that are like it's not nudes but it's definitely more than what it's like more than friends less than lovers we're somewhere in between there and he says we did it and you've been getting checked and it's kind of amazing and you know so so that's you know props to you for actually doing it it's been a big change I basically like just I don't I don't know if I do a diet I just eat me and only three green vegetables and I just don't eat breakfast and I move every single day I don't know this it's been easy but it has been awesome amazing but you know what sucks it's just sitting in a chair it totally [ __ ] you up and so this is my warm I got body doctor like I'm like a posture doctor and like I just I want to be more like a wild animal in this in this book the happy body there's this picture of this like inversion chair I don't know if you've ever done one of them I will have I think I've never done one but when I saw it I was like well here's the thing here's the thing I'm I have to buy because I think I need to I think I need to do this I think I'd wing what did they see that inversion chairs are good yeah I just hang I have a bar and I just hang from my bar yeah but you need to go the other way you need to you need to hang from your legs and so you're back decompresses that's what they basically say it's for is to decompress the spine it's kind of long all right cool let's let's get out of here but now we're just talking [ __ ] cool thanks for listening share this with your friend you need to just go on your if you have a Facebook page or a Twitter or an Instagram you need to just screenshot our podcast and then just say this is the best podcast I listen to and just post that and you can tag me that's also great but even if you don't tag me definitely post it if you're not going to post it delete your Facebook delete your Twitter delete your Instagram because you're not using it right that's what we need from you go post it and if you do it it's will call this game 50/50 do that and tag me and Shawn and you will either get a shirtless picture of me or Shawn or a third party oh okay how could you resist all right excellent let's get out of here [Music] you [Music]

out of just that group of friends I think there were probably two or three companies that have reached over five hundred million dollars in valuation and I would have been investing when they were like under five all right let's talk about angel investing so my angel investing life started truly about six years ago seven years ago when I first moved to San Francisco so I moved to San Francisco I get a job as a product manager at a and an ideal lab called monkey inferno so p.m. kind of a boring job p.m. but not at a boring company this was a very interesting company was a company that builds companies an idea lab and I was the only product manager there was only product guy everybody else was an engineer and I'm making $120,000 a year and so I don't think of myself like an investor right 120k living in San Francisco paying california taxes you're not like rolling and money at all I had a little bit of money saved up from my previous company but again I didn't think of myself in as investors so the first thing was the first lesson of angel investing was think of yourself as an investor because those first three or four years I was in San Francisco I had the opportunity I was doing mastermind dinners I was organizing dinners and my friends were the founders of other companies and you know if I had just stopped working on my company if I had stopped quit my job and all I did was just write 20k checks to all of those friends it might have been I might have needed 250k but I would have turned that into you know at least five million dollars just off the success of those friends companies and I was helping them and I thought a lot of their ideas were good I thought a lot of them would succeed I remember I talked to the founders of calm early on when calm was struggling they couldn't even raise their next round you didn't know what was gonna happen it was just kind of Alex toiling away and I remember thinking hey this guy's like really committed to this and this guy's really creative and I think he's right about the world like I think he's right that a lot of people will want this a lot of people will want to have more calm in their life and I think people or people will meditate and you know there was a obviously it wasn't clear-cut but I would have been on that company and I would have been on six or seven those companies and several of them did really well calm now as you know a multi-billion dollar company so out of just that group of friends I think there were probably two or three companies that have reached over five hundred million dollars in valuation and I would have been investing when they were like under five so the lesson I learned four years later was why the hell was i investing these guys companies I believed in them I had access to them I just didn't think of myself in his investor the excuse I gave myself was I didn't have the capital but the real the reality was if you are creative enough if you're resourceful enough if you're persuasive enough if you're determined enough you can get capital you can get any resource you need and so that actually brings me to my first angel investment so the next company I got really excited about fast forward four or five years I'm still don't you know have you know millions of dollars in the bank to go write these checks and I see this company called lambda school and I had been thinking about a product like this or a project like this to go do myself and when I saw it I was like whoa this guy's doing a much better version of what I was thinking might might work what's something I thought about doing so I started calling the guy start talking to him and I told him you know I want to invest in your company which was true not a lie I did one invest in his company but I didn't tell him I've never invested in any company so I definitely withheld that and I said tell me about your company I want to invest and he started sent you know sharing his slide deck sharing the materials and I'm like you know I have to find a way to invest this company I thought to myself okay I need to invest 25k in this company okay no problem I can sell a stock that I own or I could say I could just take some of my savings and do this one company was never gonna be a problem but with angel investing you need a portfolio of companies because you're investing in early-stage startups this is extremely high risk of failure so in a portfolio of 10 companies you would expect some kind of distribution where you're gonna get four or five of the companies to go to zero you know two or three of the companies to return somewhere between 1 and 3x and then hopefully you know you end up with one or two companies that actually break out and do 10x plus ideally you get to something that does a thousand X plus or 10,000 X plus those are the early investors in uber for example so anyways I always knew I could invest in one company but I never you need about 30 bets to really be you know an angel investor to have a poor enough of a portfolio we give yourself a chance to succeed so you know I was sitting there doing the math and I said if I need to invest $25,000 in 30 companies I need $750,000 I didn't have that so that's why I didn't think of myself as an investor but what I did was very smart I kind of give myself credit on this one when I knew I want to invest in lambda school I said okay how do I get the money to invest in this and so I talked to a friend and I said who I knew invest and I said hey at this company that I think is really great I want to introduce you to them and in general I see a bunch of companies that are really interesting and I know you like to invest do you want to do a deal where you know I can sort of be a scout I can be a sort of a venture partner an entrepreneur who can help you with your investments and we can set up a deal so here's what you know the first deal we set up was cool any deal we invest in I get 10% carry meaning I don't have to put any capital in I take zero financial risk and I get 10% of the upside after he's paid back his investment so it's not huge returns right like Sequoia Scouts Sequoia is one of the biggest venture capital firms they had a scout program and they gave 50% to their scouts you know they were extremely extremely generous or 45% something like that so this wasn't that but then again Sequoia didn't pick me they didn't even know who the hell I was so I took what I could get and I realized in order to get in to get companies if you talk to one company they want and they usually want to know what other companies have you invested in and so I knew I needed to start building a portfolio of labels so a bunch of logos that I could point to and say yep I invested in that company I invested in that company and that company you would be in good company if you were with those companies right that's the core idea so I said let me start building this portfolio this guy's willing to put up all the cash I get a piece of the upside let's do it so we wrote the check into lambda school and I'm very grateful to him for you know bankrolling me in that and I think it was a you know fair enough deal so we invested when it was you know it was still a pretty expensive deal because by the time I organized this the valuation had gone up about three x's so I lost a 3x returned just in the time it took me to to get you know sort of a backer and on the deal if it was just my own money and I could have invested after a first phone call I would have but anyways it's gone up about ten times in value since then it's that that investment which is illiquid but that's the sort of paper valuation of that company today so that was the first dip in my feet in the water and I said alright that was good and I made a deal with myself which is cool I'm gonna try to invest in about five to ten companies per year this is what I might my goal was I said but you know I think five is the right sweet spot and unless I'm you know if I have free time I'll go to ten a year but I'll do five a year and whether it's my own money or other people's money now I'm thinking of myself in his invent as an investor so that'd be the first thing I would say to you guys is if you ever want to invest if you ever want to be an angel investor and play this extremely high-risk high-reward game of startup investing the the number one advice I would give to you is don't wait till you're rich to do it because at that point you know the financial returns it'll just be a part of a broader portfolio it's not gonna be that exciting but if you really want to do this I start thinking of yourself as an investor from day one and find ways to access the capital there are ton of people out there with capital myself included who would love for you to be bringing them deal flow and would happily give you carry on any deal that they invest in I remember there was a guy named Suroosh who is a 13 year old kid living in Canada and he used to use our product we built this website called blab it's like kind of this zoom type of product he used to get blab all the time and he was like he came to me and he said hey I want to I don't remember what our arrangement was but basically I told him I said you want to learn about this stuff I want you to go scout out three companies a week email me the best one you know the best one that you saw and why you think it would be a good investment why you think would be a bad investment in your kind of overall recommendation and one of those companies now several years later he's I think 20 years old now so seven years later the very first company he sent me is a company called ply board that just raise money at a 1.1 billion dollar valuation he brought that email back up to me emailed me again being like hey why didn't you invest in this thing I told you to I was like I know you're 13 I didn't believe you but yet there's a bunch of examples like that where you can bring deals to other people and if they invest you can get karey and you could bring it to multiple people so you don't have to be exclusive with any one person you could say great these five people all agree that if I bring them a great deal they'll give me a slice to the upside great you could you could do that with five five different more established investors in any given time okay enough on that [Music] [Applause] [Music]

and what that means is that you need every company you invest in to be able to get to about 100 million a year in revenue what do you look for when you when you talk to the founders you know how do you make your decision if you're gonna if you're going to make the investment or not so here's what I said I said you know there's a million intangible signals that you're thinking about and going over but really you know it boils down to the following does this person know what the hell they're talking about when I talk to them do I get this sense of confidence and certainty that's not about the style of the speech but that the things they're saying actually makes sense and when you push and probe a little bit you can tell that they've already thought through those things they have a thoughtful answer about it and they know more about the subject they know but they know if so much about the subject which is what you should expect from somebody who's building a company in a space the next thing I think about is are they an executor or just a talker of course you want an executor are they all in on this or are they doing this as a side project do they have a habit of quitting projects or habit of splitting focus like you know I don't want somebody invest in to go have a podcast and go speak at conferences and do all this other I mean some people get caught up in that and there's a reason I started this podcast after I sold my company not during the last thing I really think about is are they in touch with reality or they a delusional optimist what what I mean by that is do they actually understand the main risk and challenge of their business so like have they correctly identified what the big challenge is to make their their vision come true and are they thinking about you know do they appropriately assess that risk there's a lot of people who don't have a credible view of reality they're out of touch with reality you know you bring something up that's a risk they they just don't think it's a risk and I think that's that can be a very very big problem and so you know the overwhelming feeling I get when I walk away from those conversations is either wow this person had a lot of clarity and quality of thought about their business or they don't and I basically just don't invest if they don't have clarity or quality of thinking around their business you know the other thing that I sort of think about is you know what have you done in your past so a track record of doing interesting and unique stuff does tend to carry forward throughout your life and so sometimes somebody has zero experience in a given domain but I look at their background and they also went into other things with zero experience and came out six months later as a winner as it being a leader in a space and so I think that looking at somebody's track record for success is obviously a good sign just because they don't have it doesn't mean it's it's a bad it doesn't mean you know you eliminate them but it is obviously a huge huge factor if you can do it and the other thing is you know the question I got no this will be the last thing on angel investing is what are the type of returns you're looking forward some people think and Sam often talks about like he loves great businesses that are like the hustle so this is actually a good example so when Sam started the hustle I had an opportunity to invest Kassam was a friend and at that point I had learned invest in your friends think of yourself as an investor but I went to the hustles office which was this like you know tiny rinky-dink place and they sat me down they walked me through the vision and I thought to myself this is totally gonna work and I totally don't want to invest am I thinking was I don't think this type of business will generate the type of returns I'm looking for so what do I mean by that angel investing works best when you put small checks into many companies and you're not looking for what the sort of median return is but you're looking for what the maximum return is you basically need two or three winners in your portfolio to make everything else a rounding error and what that means is that you need every company you invest in to be able to get to about 100 million a year in revenue 100 million a year in revenue is a hot there's a billion dollar company and this isn't about greed it's about the risk and reward profile the risk is so high that you need winners to pay off so so well to justify the risk that you're taking because you're taking both you're taking risk and in liquidity right a startup that you invest in is probably not going to be liquid for seven to ten years and so if you have a liquid if you have an illiquid investment that's extremely high-risk you need to pay off to be huge to make up for those two downsides I'll give you an example with lambda school I realized pretty quickly I was like okay so it sounds like the average student is worth what you know $25,000 for you okay so you need 4,000 students in a in a year to generate you about a hundred million dollars okay four thousand students I believe you can get there that's not a crazy number that's not four hundred thousand so there's not four million students four hundred thousand I think four huh I think four thousand students will take you up on this offer at the time that I invested I think lambda school at that time had graduated maybe 81 people total you know there wasn't anyone wasn't four thousand but it was clear to me that four thousand was an achievable number and that four thousand would get them to the point where they're somewhere between fifteen hundred million dollar revenue business depending on what the value per student was was going to end up being and so that was believable and that that alone was enough justification to say write the check in addition to Austin's an incredible founder he spoke very clearly about what he was doing there was clearly evidence that their approach was different than other people's approach and might get a different result than what other people other companies in the space have gotten for example most of the coding boot camps were in person and lame to school was online most of the coding boot camps were in a very short period three to three months and lame the school was like a nine-month program and what ended up happening was that most online learning things had like a 95% dropout rate people did not complete the course and lambda school had like I don't know what the exact numbers were but eighty to ninety percent of people finish the program and eighty to ninety percent of them got jobs typing jobs and so I was like whoa they've you know those are amazing signals and I believe that they can get to 4,000 students I believe they can give that experience to 4000 students which would get them into a hundred-million-dollar year range so that's what type of returns you look for and so I assume that in a batch of 30 companies three of them will drive 95 to 99 percent of all the returns I hope that in the end this Nets out into you know I put in let's call it 500,000 and I I basically quadrupled to 5x my money over the seven-year period and so you know five hundred thousand in and let's say at five exit that's 2.5 million at out and you know this is not like the biggest craziest life change ever but there's a chance it's much more if you hit one of the real winners then you know I've seen a $25,000 check turn into twenty five million that can happen but you you know I would say the average or they sort of expected return of what I would call the minimum bar of success as to four or five X my money over a seven-year period which Nets out I think to like I don't know like a twenty percent IRR or something like that [Music] you [Music]

Due to the coronavirus, for the first time ever, sports stadiums are filling their seats with cardboard fan cutouts to combat the effects of lockdown on the sports industry. It is a bizarre sight to see cardboard fans in place of real ones, although, it is a great way to still let people participate and support their favorite sports teams even when they are not physically there amidst the coronavirus.

it's kind of just a fun thing that you can do in this moment when we're all kind of desperate for fun things and I mean hey everyone I'm here with Michael waters one of our staff writers welcome Michael hi so we're I'm excited about a story Michael found this week is about cardboard cutout fans and in a moment we're like lots of people are returning to business as normal sports leagues are finally starting to announce plans and starting to play games again but mostly in empty stadiums and Michael's got an interesting story about how they're going to cope with the loss of ticket revenue and also try to sort of add some color to the stadium's on TV that they show their game son tell us a little about how you found the story Michael yeah so I think like a lot of people I came across a few anecdotal cases of different sports teams in Germany in South Korea putting up cardboard fans in order to fill the stadiums and like my immediate question was who are the people who are actually supplying these cardboard fans and why and who's buying them and that leads me down a very long journey through the world of cardboard fans and I'm not sure if everyone's familiar but the way the model of this works is basically that a fan of a sports team will buy will take a photo of themselves and then submit it to the team and where the team does is they'll partner with a startup company to print out your photo on cardboard and then put you up in the stands and it's like a photo from your torso up so you have these very funny-looking cardboard cutouts of people like smiling or cheering just kind of like frozen in different stadium seats throughout the world and what I realized as I started reporting this is that I kind of expected this to be like a one-off novelty I assume that just a few sports stadiums would actually be doing this but it's actually spreading throughout much of the world lots of major teams and a lot of small teams in particular are getting in on this and there they're about like four or five different companies throughout the world especially in the UK that are basically the brains behind creating cardboard fans and they're partnering with different especially like smaller teams to print the fans to create like an online portal and people are buying them and they're so far most of the like most of the cardboard fans that exists are based outside of the US especially in England's premier league they have a number of teams there that are doing cardboard fans but so far there's one soccer team in Auckland called the Oakland roots that is in the process of rolling out their cardboard fans system and they're partnering with a UK company to do that and the way that they're approaching this for instance is partly to recoup revenue but it's also a way to sort of showcase their community of fans in this moment when everyone is a part and so they're a pretty small team they have a stadium of like five or six thousand people that usually sold out pre-pandemic and their aim right now and they just launched this project last week is to start filling up their preseason and their regular season games with that fan community from Auckland that kind of made them possible the first place and so they're even donating like a portion of the profits to local racial justice causes and when the cardboard fans are all over they're gonna try to create a collage of all the different thousands of people who submitted photos of themselves and had themselves printed on cardboard and try to put that up around the city is sort of this like odd perhaps representation of this moment but also just of the community of people who kind of showed up and got through it very cool no the Oakland roots is the name of this team and they're a minor league soccer team that was this story that stood out to me the most in your piece just because if as you said that it's sort of representative of the local community of people that have rallied behind this for this team so what's in it for the fan is it basically just our way of extending a little bit of help to the team in this time it's partly about supporting your favorite team but I also think that in a lot of cases these cardboard cutouts are gonna be placed in TV viewable seats and I could get to this later but whether you actually see yourself on TV is kind of difficult but the idea is I mean if you've ever gone to a sports game in general I think a lot of people will go back and watch the highlight reel to see if they can see themselves I am NOT a sports person but when I was a kid I went to Fenway Park in Boston a few times and like I would always watch ESPN the next day and I would just try to get a gun to myself and I task like one of my parents or someone who didn't show up with like trying to find me on TV and so this is like this is more of a guarantee that you'll actually see yourself because not all the stadium seats are gonna be filled with cardboard cutouts and so the cardboard cutters that do exist are gonna be prioritized in TV viewable seats in a lot of cases I'm obviously a very seemed a team and yeah but I did mention that whether you actually find yourself as difficult because um a lot of cases you're not like the companies that are doing cardboard fans are not going to send you individual photos so it is up to you to seek yourself out on TV and to watch a stream but I do think I do think an element of this is definitely we want to support our team but it's also I mean it's also kind of just a way to connect more broadly with the act like the participation of sports and of being a sports fan and it's kind of just a fun thing that you can do in this moment when we're all kind of desperate for fun things and I mean I like looked around and talked to some people and so for instance there's like a woman in Australia who submitted a cardboard cutout of her dog for a rugby game recently and then I also spoke to a man in the UK who sent a photo of his late father who was a big fan of one of these teams in order to have him be on the broadcast and so there's definitely an element of like haha why not but there's also I mean really real sentimental value and this for a lot of people very cool well I'm gonna let you go because in about a half an hour we were gonna tune into a British soccer game where you have bought a cardboard cutout of your father who's not a fan of this team but just as part of the process of importing this you're gonna see if you can find him on this televised broadcast right yes yes I'm not optimistic about this at all but obviously as a journalist I have to go through with this work and I have to watch this game and try to find him and the photo I took of my dad he has a little sign that says the hustle on it which is literally just printer paper that I printed out but it would be really cool if I could got a screenshot of that so if any of you happen to watch this game and you see a 67 year old man holding bustled please let me know that's good alright we'll see if we can find him and if that anecdote makes it into the story it might actually end up getting cut in a fantasy alright thanks Michael thank you you [Music]

[Music] all right welcome to the new episode of the exit strategy podcast we're here with Chris Davis from week great Chris super excited to meet you you and I have never chatted before which rarely happens to newcomers industry super excited to get to chat today yeah now excited to be here and looking forward to it and super good to connect so loot crate is a subscription box to geeky products for $20 a month or around that price point is that a fair way to describe loot crate or is that completely that's I mean that's kind of the origins of loot crate and one of our products now but you know we've gotten into you know it's 25 different subscription lines bunch of different price points and offerings but the original concept was $20 comic-con in a box all the best products across pop culture getting 40 to 60 dollars a value for that 20 and and in this really curated experience so that's the origin but it's evolved quite a bit yeah is this one of those instances where like the origin is still the bread and butter of the business like a native deodorant is the bread and butter of the business or is this the place where the origin is like you know ancient history like Amazon like okay yeah we sell books boom sell everything else do you know it's so far bigger all largest product line and really have that holistic I anything across gaming film entertainment yeah genre deal yep gotcha and when did the business launch what did you guys like actually start the business we launched it in 2012 and actually launched a dentist at a startup weekend in Los Angeles and had gone to a bunch for fun and it was like this there's no better place to launch a new company then Startup Weekend what happened to sort of like do you go on on stage to like pitch the business or like what does it Startup Weekend it's literally a two-day hackathon I met my co-founder there so we you know had everything teed up launched it and business took off kind of from day one there and we were shipping a product 30 days later did you come up with a concept during the hackathon or no that came in with the concept which one - okay but are you watching 2012 I've done a bunch of research about Luke ray I'm a huge fan of the business by 2016 you're doing a hundred million dollars in revenue now we're doing 100 we're doing like a hundred and seventy million revenue 2016 yeah a hundred seventy no you're number one on the fastest o on the list of fastest growing e-commerce companies by Inc I read that in 2014 two hundred thousand subscribers 2016 you've tripled that you have six hundred thousand subscribers not a percent so tell me how the hell you built a business to do a hundred you know twenty twenty twelve ecommerce is not what it is today I was in ecommerce in 2012 you were at you're trying to buy Facebook Likes which meant nothing when you post it on your page on Facebook there were still a bunch of people who are like actively engaged on that today if you do that zero people respond like how do you build a business with like you know I we interviewed the Hubbell contacts guys and Jesse was like ask Jesse how would you spend your first you know that with $10,000 is like Facebook Instagram Instagram what did you do in 2012 so yeah we you know primarily didn't do any of the kind of traditional paid Facebook until 2014 really on the on ad side we were our largest channel was Influenster and really like all the new YouTube celebrity folks coming up my brother had been early to maker studio and launched the channel doing video and sketch comedy my co-founder Matt had worked and managed much those guys so we immediately you know you mean that first weekend we're already pulling in some of these large creators with big followings and so we're closely there and then scaled up we were originally with any paid spend on Facebook for the first two years was on building that our pages like yeah and do it all that yeah and then Facebook was like none of that no more that so yeah we were you know that was yeah Facebook and some of those channels were really pretty small for us until a couple years oh yeah Facebook didn't have like an ad so in 2012 you're buying YouTube influence or you're getting YouTube influencers to speak about the product yeah exactly you know traditional kind of performance affiliate deals in agreeing some of them we integrate actually in is gave a qui to some of the larger ones that we want to be a part of business for a long time but yeah it was you know the product was super compelling and shareable for that yeah and so integrating the business from day one and so we were yeah we were distributing product they were you know opening each month and sharing it with all of our subscribers yeah and so like you know today I I look when I was running native at a really difficult time getting influencers to do any pay for performance or like affiliate they were all like no no no no you need to give us X amount of cash before we do this thing and we don't care how many sales we get look some people would wasn't true for a hundred percent of the cases but it's true for ninety percent of the cases back in 2013 2012 2014 are people still doing paper performance uh totally and I think obviously there was that time - all the ncns were scaling up so there was like you know as a mix of like there were now these professional ad sales teams coming out a big media companies manage these guys yeah it's charged massive amounts of money that weren't economic yeah but a lot of I think they also charge more for products that weren't on brand so when you're doing like a big CPG integration you're gonna and brand on the other side if you're brand they like to work with we were network directly that way are you still doing a lot of like paper pay-for-performance type of deal build score is it now generally sort of shifted to we're a brand as well we have to pay you up front we've done both I mean we've spent and I think it comes down to it was everything from you know PewDiePie who's number one yeah and so I think we've had flexible approaches a lot of it comes back to just that cack math of we were doing it's up we had five or six hundred active influencers so we had really great data on view through click-through conversion rates so you could almost yeah people wanted flat fee payments you could calculate what the equivalent would abandon so yeah just a discipline approach there but yeah we weren't it changed quite a bit into 2015 2016 and I think the markets even shifting again now with a lot of the ncns dial yak and now the CPM is on YouTube coming down in the last couple months and so I guess to quote one is do you how many people does it take on your team to manage five or six hundred look you know influencers that we had one Kurt yeah yeah how big is that team that team at that time when it was it kind of it pekes been for us which was in 2016-2017 was five folks folks managing 500 people yeah cuz yeah well some of its high touch some of its low touch and so you know we use basic CRM to communicate and there's a lot of automation game product out and we try to make the deals simple enough in her people enough it wasn't yeah taking that touch to attend the day these are folks that we want to make sure we had had people available to talk to yeah and what were the types of look did you guys test offers with the influencers and if so what would the offers that worked yeah I mean it was really the pretty basic they should be able to have a discount code for their audience for rewarding him there and really unboxing and showing the product was always the winning approach you know doing a little pre-roll or mid-roll ads it does it it's not nearly as effective same thing with podcasts which is I think a very similar marketing medium like having somebody open talk about the products be genuinely excited always worked the best for us yeah it's crazy how much authenticity still gets through with like um you know paid influencers its look somehow you still can't fake it no I mean as a marketer you're like you don't want it to you know as a consumer you know is the marketer sometimes you're optimistic this you know less authentic more scalable approach is gonna work but it never does yeah but you know what I'm watching Game of Thrones I'm like okay all of these guys are Duke like oh my god there's this epic battle it's gonna like Westeros forever and whoever dies is gonna die but they're there's no off like I know what's going on there's no authenticity and yet I mean like you know it's so engaged and what an influencer is like popular product versus genuinely excited about it it's so clear I don't know I'm not sure if they're not as good actors or if it's just like you know human beings have sort of been like have their own my detector and why big things we can figure it out and that's I think the influences they are the ultimate entrepreneurs these guys had no startup capital and build an audience of millions so their currencies always been being authentic and yeah that fanbase so we found over time was they were never willing to sacrifice that authentic genuine relationship with their viewers on behalf of some brand who's gonna come and go oh I think it makes the unit really well when they do because you know their their main currency is being you know trusted by their fan base yeah and so are you still working with any of the influencers that you started working with in 2012 like has anyone lasted eight years yes I'm have some I mean a lot of those folks have shifted their approach and and of course this will move now you know some people are twitch exclusive some people are it's been really to watch the evolutionary but yeah we're still working with folks from from back that era and so like 2014 year of 200,000 subscribers 2016 600,000 subscribers at what point do you fund rates we so we had taken a really small seed check 25k right when we launched and then we didn't raise again until we heard one hundred and fifty million dollar run rate so we bootstrapped through you know that whole period until 2016 sorry I my internet cut off a little bit you took a small seed check did you say was $25,000 yeah we did a 25k sea check right when we launched with a couple guys out of LA Nick Groff Dave Waxman and then and didn't raise again until that series a until the series a in 2016 yeah so yeah so you're profitable you're profitable at 200,000 subscriber look cuz you're burning there's no way you just print $25,000 over four years you must be problem we were operating essentially it just yeah just below and at breakeven so we're reinvesting everything yeah and how many people are the team before you raise that series a we're it probably 60 70 folks at that point okay I know you look tell me what's going on in your head like you know when we like when native was doing well like I was like this can't be possible like I can't believe that we didn't have to raise more money in order to build such a big business and I also felt like everything was held together with duct tape because I was like I don't know when like you know water stuck in water we're gonna start leaking on this ship and I really don't know when like torpedo is gonna hit the ship and just blow this whole thing apart never happened I'm like I was consoling we worried about that what is going on in your head when you know you're doing a hundred million dollars in revenue you've raised $25,000 and like at the time like you know you were not you are not Casper mattresses in bed but not not as like Casper everybody knew about it was like this dtc doll a loot crate wasn't why wasn't it and what's going on through your head I mean so we were I mean I think we're doing the right thing we were marketing to our audience which is a different segment so we were very focused on our consumer and so that we were there I think for us is you know it's a physical distribution business they're crazy chaos every day so we were used to at like that that intensity level being a hundred percent direct-to-consumer though we did control the whole funnel so as long as we had scaled up different leadership in another area so everything was working we controlled fulfillment at point we were working primarily with third-party manufacturers on products and so you know the complexity scaled up yeah month to month and so you just got used to you know more more of that craziness but no a lot of it was just like you said heads down if there's a problem solve it and then yeah really just scaling up you know capabilities across all those areas is there like um is there that you know for me I felt both terrified and invincible which is really weird dichotomy right by God to be you feel like nothing can ruin this but you also feel like everything is gonna ruin this you do have that feeling or were you just like I'm in the weeds I don't really have time to appreciate what's going on on a like you know on a month on a corner over the corner so well I mean that feel like you said that feeling is there depending on when things are going really well when they're not well you're in that rapid growth mode there's a lot of things going really well but behind that there's all the things that you're trying to keep moving forward so we had you know port strikes and product recalls and like all kinds of crazy problems that come up to feel very existential in the moment that you just you know try to try to have some like perspective on after the fact but yeah you're you know cortisol levels spike yeah where you're just like there's a port strike and like you know for for a long time like when you're growing up and you see something on the news or you're like there's a port strike you just like whatever just okay now all of a sudden you're like you dump get back to work I need to ship this product like can we cuckoo can we call it the port just get our prize it's like you really go does back-row Venza got okay Chris we're talking about port strikes and existential threats you're feeling invincible and beautiful at the same and then we were talking about like the boxes and like what you sort of had in the boxes you had exclusive you'd like Star Wars boxes halo boxes you were doing your licensing IP is that correct so initially we were working primarily with third-party manufacturers and then we scaled up our own internal product capabilities later so we were basically going out and saying what's the coolest product yeah that no one knows about finding it and then working with you know 200 plus suppliers to create something each month each box had four or five items and really we said we could you know buy anything across the entire licensed product landscape so we were buying books apparel collectibles you know early I even shipped some DVDs when I was still thinking so I was like anything that needed to be out there we would go and find and then partner with companies to produce and then you ultimately got to exclusive products is that right like at some point you were like making products other people have that you had exclusive products very early even we were working with third parties to produce exclusive products for us and which is a big part of the in the license product space they'll do an exclusive variant that shows up if it's you know think about a collectible something like that so we would produce we work with other companies would produce exclusive product with them so did you have to go to a Lucasfilm to try and get that exclusivity or those licensing fees or did you just go to this third party manufacturer and that sort of had those already so that was that was kind of Phase two for us where we actually started taking direct licenses ourselves at the beginning we'd go and find somebody that already had that license and work with them on a product and then over time we got to a big enough scale where we started to take more that in in-house directly gotcha okay all right so let's look rewind or fast-forward again to 2016 you raise a Series A it's 18 million dollars it's led by upfront is that right yeah and who's the partner on the is it more stuff than somebody else Greg that Nelly okay and then you've got like III read that you also have like Robert Downey jr. in the round as well or like it is Ventura yeah exactly this venture arm came in and often co-invest with upfront those guys that's great and so ultimately how many people like putting the money to get to 18 million dollars up front was a large jack I think there was five or six other investors alongside up okay gotcha and then I read somewhere that you're still a fifty look you were the 51% shareholder or something to that effect after this round of capital between you your co-founder and all these guys you still a large chunk of the shares is that correct yeah but you my co-founder myself and then my company equity yeah because we didn't really we hadn't raised before so we common still had a large portion of the company yeah and so tell me a little bit about how look what made you raise and yeah tell me what made you rates like how do you go you you went from zero dollars to a hundred sixty million dollars in revenue in four years which is like you know which is insane especially those four years when like targeting is what it is but it's Eve it's absolutely more insane the idea that you did it with $25,000 what ultimately makes you raise money so I think you know we spent a lot we actually kept very disciplined folks on that single lootcrate product for the first three and a half years and really refine the model we did a ton of user testing and the actual like product experience got dramatically better over time so we got to a point where we thought it was you know we needed to start expanding out into essentially different fan verticals and so you know also one to start taking in licensing in-house which comes with a lot of upfront commitments and guarantees and just a lot more upfront investment and then we were working on a bunch of vertical expansion so we had you know the major league baseball and NBA teed up to launch a sports vertical and and then really we had one engine one stop for engineer to two hundred thousand subs and you know we were trying to get a lot more complexity the model need to build that yeah warm around custom text so just investing in data science team and Janene team and then a lot more in house probably development folks um we just were kind of gonna go to this when you have 600,000 subscribers you have one engineer no 7007 that I put we had five or six engineers and you having to take on more the development early but up through 200,000 we were just leveraging a lot of the existing depress software I think it's a good lesson for a lot of DC folks just like you know especially where shop fights today versus where it was then you really can get to a pretty massive scale before you need to invest a lot in custom development and so you know we were when we when we raised it was say hey we think there's you know in the two hundred and sixty billion dollar license consumer products basically there's a lot of there's a lot of room to scale and grow and if we're gonna do that we need to raise you know more capital to to invest in that in that and then really you know ramped up yeah and you're not on Shopify back then right you like Shopify isn't what it is today you're sort you're building out your own custom tech exactly yep we were using we're currently and charge fire Leon and a bunch of these like basically built for enterprise software companies that we were gonna pack it together and then why 18 like how did you get to eighteen million dollars you know uh a hundred seventy million dollar a year business can get I can raise way more than that but I can't imagine you would like I can't imagine that it's hard to find investors and I can't imagine that was hard to raise more money than that why did you choose eighteen million dollars well I actually was not it was not an easy time to raise back if you remember 2015 2016 there was you know challenges of China there was a bunch of large econ companies that have had some challenges and raised big rounds so it actually was not a particularly easy time to raise and we raised actually on we did 18 and a half of equity and fifteen of debt at the same time so the total raised up one was like thirty 33 million in an accommodation of debt equity so blamin so we need we did bring in more capital but what actually was not the easiest time for for econ raises just because I think a lot of you know fab had had some child there's like a bunch of yeah there was a there had been a big in 2013 2014 a ton of investing to the space and I think some folks have gotten burned there that's crazy how like how quickly people forgot right if it was there people forgot about fad 2015 20 2015 start to raise by 2018 you were back in it right like we're like great let's write huge checks to every single direct-to-consumer business over capitalize that and we'll like you know we'll hopefully we will pay for this later or somebody else will pay for cycles are like seventeen Spanish flu that we're repeating go bid this is like oh yeah I forgot what happened 24 months ago like I've got milk in my fridge that that's bad old you know my god that's crazy all right so you've raised thirty million dollars or around thirty million dollars between equity and debt at that point and then business gets much tougher yes yeah I think tell me like yeah tell me what happened like what happened like ultimately like you know the wheels start falling off but tell me how things went from 170 million to the wheel starting to fall off so I think the it comes out of that we were raising to launch and expand both the team internally and then the product offerings and a lot of our own capabilities all the same time I think big lesson was just like execution risk at scale becomes much more real and we had a lot of concurrent bets out that we're straining business so yeah I think we when we raised we definitely ramped up burn ramped up marketing spend ramped up all that I think we went from you know just a couple product lines to a dozen different tension lines very quickly and so had challenges around inventory and forecasting so we're assuming like our core business could continue to grow exponentially at the same time as we're marketing other product lines it didn't that didn't work as well we then built out like these brand teams and we're trying to distribute purchasing and PNL responsibilities to folks that hadn't really had to do it at scale before so we had some margin compression like there was all these little things that kind of chip away and then on top of that you know I think the actual product offering itself well that was was doing very well you just we basically were scaling op X and and team Sizemore quickly the business had been growing and so you know burned through cash to quickly and and so then we you know kind of had to go into a pivot mode where we were you know then less of a growth orientation and more of a you know efficiency profitability orientation plus we had a large outstanding debt facility which creates a whole others that I can you know of complexity so so let's start first with just like a shift from going from no burnt and starting to burn money from a mental perspective is that difficult to do I look at native you know we didn't burn money and then all the sudden we had you know I was constantly worried about running out of you know we'd raise $500,000 we were sort of operating like you guys were I was like if there's a big if something goes wrong or if we make a big mistake or if I make a big mistake myself I'm not sure the business can afford it and like once we had P&G is backing it was hard for me to mentally shift it to the phase where I could be where I was like you know what we can afford to make a big mistake now and I think as a result of not being able to take advantage of that balance sheet I made a mistake by not taking advantage of it was it difficult for you to make that shift for being like cash flow neutral to burning money mentally or were you just like hey I know how this works and I know we raised this money we're gonna put yeah I think you know it's there's like the basic operating metrics so you're like you're kacct LTV ratio less stuff so you're tracking a lot of those operating metrics closely so you can feel good about the investments you're making you when the burns there I think just the complete report and complexity of above that larger nor we had 300 full-time employees than another 250 temp warehouse folks that point so just there's a lot of scale and a lot of burn Wow you did your own concealment yeah we were yeah the hundred thousand square feet in LA where we're doing fulfillment and so there was and it's also a bigger ship to turn so I think there was just a number of of you know we it just it's it's difficult to in multiple modes at once I think we'll get into more kind of as we talk to challenge but like growth lean efficiency cost-cutting it's hard to be with mine that's the same time and I think as the leaders you scale your gets bigger you're in more markets you're more channels you have more product lines you're really handing off responsibilities and so those areas and you're you're choosing where you're focusing and so it's yeah there's just a lot more to manage yeah and so you're starting your like creating a bunch of new boxes and you must be skilled Morgan's plan at the same time in order to try and grow that but like you know continue that exponential growth where are you spending marketing dollars in 2016 to 2018 you should sort of trying to grow is it have you shifted from YouTube to Facebook or is it still primarily yeah so we I mean we had a big belief in a lot of these organic channels so one and really driven by my co-founder or Matt we had a big social team and we had social channels for a lot of our different subscription lines we had a lot of art you know 30 40 thousand pieces of organic content crated by our community and really had a whole engine around you know working with the community and reinforcing that we then had a big investment on the influencer side still we were spending a large amount of money by then in on paid Facebook you know Northey million a month and then we were doing direct response television we had a big big investment podcast we were we've done probably 70 different conventions which is a unique part of our industry you know for the first couple years we actually a modified school bus that we would drive around and be our booth in the these conventions so that was the in-person piece of it yeah and then tons of CO marketing so we were working you know we had Marvel and a crate we would be working with Marvel social team to post any of our you know manufacturers and suppliers that were in the box that month we'd be Co marketing with so we we had a whole co-marketing a partnership set of channels as well that we looked at but really kind of thinking about you know what are the proprietary marketing our streams we can own it or not we're not gonna be you know put a bid against everybody on Facebook or Google yeah and then having those really be kind of scalable predictable channels alongside those and so when you're starting to negotiate like well let me start with another question or 20 just 2017 and 2017 do you grow beyond your 2016 numbers or is there contraction no that's what we started to pull back beginning in 2017 at that point yeah I've got to and so 20 looks sort of the peak is 2016 2017 ish P from Marvel and sort of working on exclusive products does that do and you're like sort of working with Marvel and not manufacture for that licensing does that licensing make up a significant part of your cost of goods sold it's it varies a bit but yeah it ends up being you know the average licensing rates or you know 10 to 15% on cost of goods so it ends up being GATS material to margin yeah yeah yeah I think everyone's always curious when like a plushie doll comes out I'm always like how much of this money goes to Luke George Lucas the Lucasfilm and how much of it goes to you know Harry Potter of you versus like natural person manufactured a horse a little bit yeah it's a ten to fifteen percent six percent across yeah every if you're you know if you're Star Wars you get you know if they're like 18 percent 20 percent sometimes but yeah that's alright that range yeah and it sounds like there is a one huge mistake that where like there's a one big thing that you point to you're like this is the mistake we made that sort of made us pull back on the business it's sort of like a bunch of little Nick's now as you're expanding your expanding channels you're expending the technical offer you're distributing P&L responsibility from yourself to other managers and all that chips away a little bit to ultimately like cost you the growth trajectory that you sort of want to be on totally I mean I think the other big thing is once you you know once you have capital partners in the business then you know there's a lot of alignment and you know getting everyone on the same page to get things done and especially with debt if you you know if you're missing your covenants your default on your loan you know yeah lenders are it's much more of a scaled t2c company problem but yeah you know debt has very different dynamics than then equity and so we were dealing with a lot of of complexity on that side of the business that you know it was definitely impacting focus on the other side the business we really just decide we gotta we have to we have to cut back costs to get to a sustainable level and so look was your cat going up a lot at this time was this more of an effects problem or was this of we're spending a lot of money on marketing problem okay it wasn't in cat had been fairly stable I think there's definitely like increasing costs and some of the like you know the bigger channels like Facebook things like that that everyone was seeing around that time is more dollars moving there but this was definitely you know more of a kind of a structural business issue gotcha and so ultimately tell me a little bit about the dynamics with debt like what was you know I understand it they're like you know equity is very different debt equity sort of along arrived and gets paid when you get paid a debt you've got not only to pay them on a monthly basis but also covenants where they're like you have to hit certain metrics otherwise you're in default of our obligations was it like where's the debt it's tough to deal with were they constantly calling you and being like hey you're not also like did they fit like you said you would raise fifteen million dollars in debt do they think that there were fifteen million dollars in assets if they foreclosed upon business or if they took possession of the business that they would get their money back you know you didn't it doesn't get to that level really quickly folks are trying to work through just like what's the plan right so without we worked through it for quite a while and ended up refinancing them in 2018 and a lot of it is just you know that trying to align you know we were looking at bringing in new new capital at the same time as we were cutting costs yeah try to achieve profitability so we're out trying to raise equity with you know top-line not growing the way it had been so it what it does I think you know the more complexity in the capital structure it the you know more misalignment there could be just in like near term and medium term objectives you know and so yeah you know there's a learning curve there and figure out you know how to manage those those aspects and it's taking up a lot of your heads face it's like it sounds like it did because you sort of you have to like not only do you have to manage the equity guys you got to manage the deck guys you're gonna refinance you wanna fund raise again sounds like the dead guys like it just sounds like it would take up all your mental energy is that right or is this sort of like is this so I'm focusing on this one day a quarter sort of type of thing or is this uh actually this is bothering me every like there's a little thing in the back of my head that I'm always thinking about it's not going away slash I'm thinking about a full-time once a week no it's yes you know for you know probably two years it's about 75% of my time right and I'm really letting the kind of yeah managing all that everything surrounding that all of the complexity generated by you know figuring out 75% is in a state amount of time insane no for sure and that's why I think yeah it is insane about time but it is that point you know that the you know the reality and the you know and the most important thing that I can do we had a great team of operators in place too but yeah it was you know I think the lesson to a lot of folks is is you know I think everyone's probably seeing it now with kovat and just strains on businesses is that like margin of safety and risk management which a lot of those of us had like you know dive headfirst into these businesses are Pro risk I think you know the risk management side something I've become a lot more is if advising folks and helping people out it's like just give yourself a lot of margin for error because if you don't you end up you know having to spend an enormous amount of time on things aren't driving customer value aren't really in like the core drivers of growth of the business yeah absolutely look um when native first raised capital we raised $50,000 within like the first three or four months of launching the business and I talked to my brother about it he actually ran a mobile gaming company then licensed a lot of IP so they created like a Harry Potter game Marvel game Star Wars game Family Guy game and so I was like you know we've raised this $50,000 he's like I would never write you that check and I was like why wouldn't you write that track he's like fifty thousand dollars you get one swing at the bat and if you don't like Miss that swing you're out of money and your business is over and so like nobody wants to put in $50,000 bank account you're gonna make a mistake in that 50 thousands gone quickly if you've got $300,000 you can like learn from that mistake and swing again and made me one more time before you're sort of out of money totally Mike well I think if you like and you probably dealt with this quite a bit but I see it all the time as you know especially we have inventory too and you're launching something new a lot of people get overly optimistic about like the first run and you're like why did you just put 40 of your 50k into inventory you haven't sold yet you know I think if you're like that cash might be the last cash I ever get so I proved something out you would you know think very differently about where you put money yeah point you know for us you were just in time inventory so look if you bought it you're dieldrin on Thursday we would actually make probably the next again on Friday and ship it to you Monday or Tuesday so we're like the number one need we had for a really long time as customer service cuz people be like I ordered with you which is completely fair for us we were just like this is the only way we can afford to grow the business because if we start like putting 40k of that 50k into inventory you know about 10k is barely gonna last like three days but like you know we're running ads some random expense comes up there's this other thing that we didn't realize that we had to pay for and now we're broke no I think no yeah as a DC company not having inventory become something that you're that kind of controls your uses you're making lets you be a better you know D to C business where you can really be customer centric work on the product do all this if you have you know three times the amount you sell at a month sitting and what you start having to discount it ship it out sell it we don't want any so I think really tight inventory management lets you stay customer centric in a really healthy way that boy and like to be honest as soon as we expanded into brick-and-mortar stores it was a revolutionary change in the amount of inventory we had to hold we went from holding like you know small like you learn from holding six to seven figures all of us have eight figures of inventory and like you know the first Pio from a company might be three million dollars so you better have three million dollars of inventory sitting in your warehouse or anything ship to them and that was like I mean that's a great problem to have don't get me wrong and given a much smaller scale you're just like how am I supposed to have this much inventory that just sounds impossible and I think right now for walnut we did a big retail rollout all the forecasting and demand and planning is even you know shot it's just so different and so far behind well you know we can do in the DC side that it surprised me at first but ya caught with your pants down it's complete garbage hundred-percent retailers to give us forecast like how much that he did or they're building their own forecast like you know retailing would be like you think you're gonna go we're gonna need this and we don't believe we don't know we don't believe that you know what is going on in your own store we've got this don't worry about yeah so what did you do with extra inventory it sounds like you know creating these boxes back in 2000 2016-2017 I'm sure you had overly optimistic you know at least once you were overly optimistic when you're DT only how do you discount it so that product into every product and every month every box was essentially exclusive right so we weren't able to resell them so we spun up a much bigger econ business for customers so we you know wait 90 hundred twenty days and give customers access to products things like that but in general like you know the better experience is just for the product to be gone when it's gone and to be executed so you know we found ways to work through it but yeah you got to be creative you know yeah and so then like in 27 2016 2017 when you're burning need what is like the peak burn and then what happens at the end it's like it sounds like the creditors at some point are like look we need to be really like recaps ya know I think we everybody kind of realized we needed to get the business record needed to get and then it was going to be a more challenging raising like series B think that that would be challenging given you know the changes we had to make the business to get to profitability and so you know we cut you know if you think that from Pete we're kind of a you know six million a month of monthly op ex by the time we ended up having to file and 2019 we'd cut down to a million five so we did massive structuring and brought in some really great restructuring advisors and stuff like that to help really think about you know hard decisions but I think it's gonna be really relevant for folks now and something I learned through this was like you can do a lot more than you think you can and giving yourself that flexible if we had done that earlier again we would have had a lot more flexibility so went through a very long process of just kind of rationalizing the cost structure gotcha okay so if you would if you thought if you would like cut you should cut out the ex earlier it's basically like if you have to redo it you'd be like in 2016 let me start cutting up X significantly right away well I think yeah it's you know I think it's very you know when you're in a growth mindset it's a company that's important but when you're it's hard to be in a growth mindset and in a cost rationalization mindset at the same time yeah and so we were trying to do that dance for a long time where we were where I think you know a healthy dose of pain upfront get you back so you can get back to that growth mindset and keep everybody lined yes I think it's difficult to be into two differences as an organization at once and you know you kind of you always want to be a growth-oriented I think it's a company but sometimes you know it's you just got to make bigger harder choices faster sure and so tell me you like I like tell some of the like effects things that you were able to cut to go from six million in op ex 21.5 I mean four and a half million dollars in our backs a lot I'm sure there's like you is it I'm sure there's a lot of things right I'm sure some is personnel I'm sure it's like you know I don't look you know like your office space or you need a thousand square-foot shipping facility some is maybe reducing the number of boxes you have what are some of the things that you focus on backs yeah so you know we looked it areas where we could you know cut where Aries Marcia so we moved to a 3 PL in 2019 we built out a much bigger team in the Philippines on the customer support side because we were getting 350 thousand tickets it's a month and so we kept our core team here in the US and then had a team there just talked meant going back and just you know talking to Oliver enterprise software vendors and really squeezing those prices down because those can inflate quickly you realize you have you know a hundred and fifty users of something that actually only 20 people are using so I think we kind of across the board we had great a head of Finance who helped lead all that just like you know down to the line-item everything was you know everything was an option and we pushed and cut and and you kind of go through the whole business and you look for opportunity and how long does it take to go from six to 1.5 is that like a like two two and half years two years yeah okay gotcha yeah and then ultimately you file for bank robbery organization is that correct yes yeah and that happens in 2019 so that happened last year exactly yep in August of not sure look I honestly I think there's gonna be a lot of companies that are facing that this year as a result of kovat as a result of dtc financing drying up as a result of poor people focusing on profitability tell me what that process one in part entailed well like how hard is it to go through that and what happens at the other side but from my perspective at what I would imagine is the equity shareholders are wiped out the dead holders now become the equity holders they've got to put in more attached to recapitalize the business well I think that's what happens but tell me what happened with you guys and sort of how you went through that process totally so I mean you think your high-level overview is pretty accurate there's chapter 11 chapter 7 we went through a chapter 11 process which is where your restructuring and really trying to figure out the best way to you know you have creditors like trade creditors you have your actual senior lenders and subordinate lenders all that stuff so you're you're really trying to go through a process that maximizes the value to creditors when you're going through that and so for us we're just the point where we had you know in 2018 spent more money on kind of legal and professional fees that we had on sales and marketing and you just get to a point where you can you can't grow and muscle your way through it and so you know at chapter 11 restructuring is the yes approach there and so with that went through that in August and you know as part of that went through essentially an auction for the business at that point where the largest creditor you know bid and acquired you know acquired the business through that process it was fairly quick in October is when they the acquisition happened fitters at the table a lot of other folks looked at it but yeah the way the the credit bidding and all the stuff works you know it's primarily the large creditors that have the best shot of the deals yeah and and then but the actual process itself like you know the Delaware Court is actually you know they're they're supportive of employees and of keeping the business up and running their goal is really to like you try to facilitate a fair process and keep the business operating so it was yeah I think from my kind of my my my expectations of the process to kind of how it's all played out it's been really smooth and the business is growing again and it wasn't it's obviously disruptive but it definitely is set up in a way that you know keeps keeps things from falling apart while you're going through the restructuring itself okay I won't ask more questions about the restructuring but before I get there do you still spend 75 percent of your time focusing on like your cap table and your lenders or is it now like you're spending more of your time in the business no I mean I think now you know it no we're that's all done yeah that was done when essentially is the business is coming out of the out of that acquisition process in October so a lot of it's just been getting rebuilding customer trust getting products out you know the last year is we were really getting constrained financially started to have some delays we the whole time through the whole process we made sure that there wasn't a big impact on the customer experience but that last like six months were straining to get a product out there were delays things like that that we have been focused really on since then turning the customer experience piece which for which gets lost in all the short company building running pieces has always been the you know the goal so it seems live in focus there gotcha like during bankruptcy basically was just hard to meet not only the financial obligations of their debt holders but also just like customer expectations as you're running the business of getting a product out on time and so you're trying to sort of turn that ship around and say hey consumers we're on in this now we're gonna ship our stuff on time we're back yeah that's really the even more so the pre-bankruptcy piece once you're in bankruptcy and you have the definite ancing then you can operate much more normal course your vendors have protection and everything else so that was really when we filed it in August is when we turned kind of all the operating teams to focus on let's get all these products that are late in and out and try to get back to some kind of normal operating case and just so people understand dip financing it's like debtor-in-possession finance thing which means that like a lender is gonna fund you to continue running the business through bankruptcy and as that happens they get like a day of the first mean position because they're basically like this is post bankruptcy and we're giving you money in order to continue your business yep uh-huh so how much is ever in possession financing do you get to continue around business so we had it was I think publicly ten million dollar facility that came in when we were doing that and so that came in and allowed us to do handle a ton of this the stuff that I kind of backlog of things we needed to handle and so what is the tablet and what is a cap table I won't talk about the business as well sort of post bankruptcy you're seeing 20/20 but what is it a cap table look like post bankruptcy so you had up front and Robert Downey jr. and 15 million dollars in debt imagine a fraud and blabber down here now sort of wiped off the cap table and the guy who is her largest lender and sort of put in more money in the debtor-in-possession financing is now your largest taps like the largest equity holder on the cap table yeah the group the group that did the acquisition it's basically a reset of the entity and all that right so that that group the there's essentially there's the old an old company in the new company and then that whole new company everything transitions there and then how do you remain incentivized because like you know there's that old company and you were like this you know you're the CEO of that old company that's here with a new company and like do they negotiate with you to give you an equity stake and incentives as well it happened I mean to in a lot of these cases that you know they want some continuity and in leadership and yeah so you know most of the folks at the company today or folks that were the company prior to the bankruptcy yeah I and we're you know I early team back now my goal has really been to make the transition as effective as possible yeah and work with the team on that I care a lot about the brand and want to to survive and be strong and so I think you know I think that's really been the focus is can we get get like let everybody get back to like a normal operating environment which is all I think the team is really you know we have big chunk of the company is in design and product development and you know people want to see sound like a positive story tied to the the products we put out in the world yeah well one I certainly think looking you know you've been working on the business for eight years I can imagine there's an incredible amount of like your own personal sweat blood and tears built into it and I think a lot of times people get lost on that like I don't even work at native today and I still think about it on a daily basis I'm like this is what I beat this is Howard you know look whatever it like tweet about it and tweeted me and they're like I'm trying it like okay if you don't have a good experience let me know I'm like actually I have no financial interest in this and if you tell me you hate it there's not anything I can do about it either yeah but there is a certain there's a lot of like personal like loyalty to the brand and especially if you've been doing it for eight years totally and I think the customers that are still with us from there I mean there's just a lot of you want to see it do well and you want to see it you know be something that the people love yeah and so what is working for the brand today like we're like what you know you must have cut down on our backs significantly and you know you've probably retooled marketing where you're like hey Ivan some of the influencers that years ago you're still using but at that Facebook that's when is it a million dollars a month any longer what is working today in order to grow the brand again so I mean a lot of the same traditional DC channels are still working well I think you know the dynamics shift you know depending on what's going on you know I think we've seen like on Facebook for example the last 60 days costs come down but in general it's manageable right I think all the same best practice for us it's kind of like if you're if for our product it's not something that is a consumable that you need it's something that you want and so having trusted brands and partners tell you that this is something that you should have yes your influence or things like that is still a great channel that works and I think a lot of its just figuring out the unit economics but we're seeing you know all the same channels that work before work well we're not really and some of our like higher cost channels like remnant television things like that we're not we're not doing anything there but we're looking our most efficient channels and our best channels Facebook included and leaning into those and being disciplined and you know I think again the the actual underlying market dynamics that made this work well which is you know there's a million different Marvel T's on amazon.com and our core demo is not going in to target to buy a Marvel t-shirt that at like curated collectible consumer products perience had it really shifted throughout the eight years we've been running the business and so you know once it was kind of liberated from a lot of the you know the the corporate issues you know yeah it's there and I think we're looking at you know new experiments we have a thing called loot launcher we're doing which is like a crowdfunding approach so we can take more you know do a larger number of partnerships try more things out be more experimental and so we're using that crowdfunding model so I think we're just talking about that is that like is that like sort of almost not Groupon because it's not disconnected but it's that like if we sell 7,000 of these will go make all this stuff exactly captain exactly Labs yep so we're doing we're doing more of those and I think the pre-order model works really well and so we're I think there's there's still a ton of demand in the category and I think direct-to-consumer is such a great way it's where we're all consuming the content building out kind of new new economic models around those opportunities there's a ton of time we can do there's so if you really shift it sounds like a month that has shifted from like doing a better job understanding demand over the last like two years or maybe three years where you're like you know we're really optimistic about this new box of conscious new box didn't go as well as we wanted to be up all this excess inventory to let's pre sell this box let's make sure at least 7,000 people want it before we make it let's not make a max of 10,000 so we don't have a ton of excess inventory is that is that something that's is that accurate or is that not accurate percent right I think yeah turn curves are all fairly predictable but they're all different by product lines also when you're getting it in 2530 different subscription lines like even with models that work well like the bike demand planning and things moving it's just a lot you know asking yourself to xq on that dance perfectly every month is challenging so building in some some flexibility and some predictability has been super helpful that is you know that's so mind-blowing because it's almost the exact opposite of what you'd expect you went from being having no discipline basically early on or not no discipline of course but basically saying look we're we're operating on a gut perspective and we think that'll work and there's money here so you scale the business and you think okay now I actually trust my gut more I've been in this for four or five years I'm like you know we're not 100 million dollar run rate we have hundreds of thousands of subscribers we've gonna run we've only raised $25,000 to actually you have to trust your gut even less when you get that big because the decisions you make are so monumental the ship is so large that when you're making those decisions they they can be not mortal blows but significant blows yeah I think we have a lot more data today than we did as we were sailing so to not use that data would be foolish right and you know I think we are in our growth model was you know Paul Graham and put out that essay on growth and a good friend of Y Combinator at the time and so our you know our whole growth model was let's you know we started at 20% of months and that really essentially worked for three and a half years and so we had some kind of North Star growth metrics and then we all could focus your honor around a single product it's a different dip when you have products in different stages their life cycle totally different offerings price points we saw you know just a very different approach to managing those different stages of the product life cycle is neat yeah that makes a ton of sense I guess like I'm like it blows my mind that you trust your gut less or look I think it's accurate because I think look at media I should have done more of that like I should have trusted my gut less when we reach scale instead I was just like I can make no mistake I'm obviously in I know good I know how to do everything of course I do I've generated all of its revenue Nevada and in reality I should've been like well if I make a decision and it goes wrong now we've ordered an extra 250 thousand products it cost us $500,000 and think it's a much larger mistake today than it was you know three years ago and what did you guys that's how was your gut yeah just ask question how's it like when you guys expand it outside of Yoda right like weirder areas where your gut was just totally wrong I don't trust my gut any longer actually I mean the reality is that like once we expended outside of tiara we were a part of PMG and so there are a lot of like different interests playing alongside of where we could expand whether we would expand like you know we have to sit within a PNG division and that PNG division really owns the PL and so as a result there's more limitations look you know I would I was like okay great we're now part of PNG we can make whatever we want PNG make some paper towels we could make native paper towels of that you know very much was not the case we had more independence in terms of making those decisions pre PNG and we did post p.m. so your guns man egde 12 by the you know we're even inventory on seasonal sense things to that effect and when I made wrong decisions there were a lot more consequential and I think overall I liked I was trying to you know you try to maximize revenues here almost like I want to I'd rather have too much of this product instead of too little until your business is large enough where you're like I see how many things are on my belt like all this excess inventory that I ordered too much of is getting to be a huge you know huge asset on my balance sheet and it's not a good asset it's not going anywhere and moving forward like I shifted my mindset to be like I'd rather sell out of this sense rather than have too much of the Sun and now I think that wasn't as we brought in a bunch of CPG finance execs that was I think the number one thing like scaling up DBC brands can do is expense your excess inventory is cost of goods in month because I think I've seen a lot of folks that you know if the image were just hearing your balance sheet your P&L looks great but the reality is that's excess inventory and you start to realize maybe 10% of gross margin should just be rich down inventory costs yeah so there's a bunch of things you can do to like not convince yourself that the models working as well as is that I think can help companies duel to just a better more discipline around forecasting demand planning an inventory yeah great advance I I guess I have two more questions one is what you wish you had done differently do you wish you had never taken a debt do you wish you were more focused on topics early on do you wish you hadn't expanded into as many boxes or do you say hey you know what like learned a ton and this we did what was right I think you have you learn a lot right and so I think during the learnings you have to make sure that's a positive piece of it because yeah the pain and agony is is gonna come in those moments and you gotta find some healthy way to reframe it I think there's a ton of things I would have done differently there was you know we've gotten so used to hyper growth that the route was taking and the kind of confidence to solve hard problems on the fly we just didn't need to think that way and I think I become a much better communicator with boards lenders equity you know that that like really important structure that sits on top of the business then really if you're gonna it really needs to be managed the right way you have a lot of great mentors and through a lot of experiences I think could have done better there and I think like I said it just goes back to I think risk management and you know making hard decisions earlier faster and bigger then then you'd like to yeah and we had a you know this CEOs done like twenty turnarounds come into the company it advised and we're talk about cuts it's like have you ever cut too deep when you're doing a cut and he's like I always cut too deep and I never regret it and I think like wow I didn't internalize at the time I I think part of the point is because you can always build back up and then you eliminate existential risk and so I think I think there's a lot of lessons there that a lot of companies are going to go through during this period of time which is yeah the world has changed know that and make big decisive action more so than you think you need to right now because it gives you the flexibility when you know which there's gonna be a lot of incumbents that are too / distracted and debt-laden right now they do a lot of these b2c brands capitalise on but you need to be in a position to capitalize so you know make hard big decisions fast and so do you think he's right you can like you should cut deep like you should cut too deep and you don't regret it or did you cut too deep and you don't regret it was he right I think in the face which was much earlier in our lifecycle it was the right advice I think there's obviously a point you need to like customer experience in all these companies is number one so this just has to be in a way that is maximized as customer experience so you can't like if you have 20 thousands and customer support tickets you need enough folks to respond to those tickets if you're delivering a product you're competing with everybody else it's got to be the best product like if you had to start making trade off and your product quality decision that's not really a business anymore so I think outside of that like but really know what those core areas are and then everything else has to be fit that is fantastic advice and like I feel first your this is my favorite interview that I've done ever in my entire life because not only did you you can read the screen like - a hundred on $25,000 in like money $25,000 capital invested which is literally nothing compared to the you know Dollar Shave club's of the world and Harry's of the world voices - you went through like Jake look I feel like a lot of people and myself included never had you know I had a hard day at work but I never like my hard day work was a good day for you I never went through a recession and like in many ways I was a real coward about the business you said I'm gonna raise money I'm gonna go to the mattresses this is 260 billion dollar business and I'm the take advantage of it me I was a real and I was just like we're gonna hire very slowly because I think I'm gonna run out of money every day I don't know what the I'm doing over here there's like you know everything is going wrong and there's gonna be a torpedo hits the side of this boat at any given time and so for us we didn't face those problems but it was intense but but I knew what I knew that we wouldn't face those problems because there's no there's there's nothing wrong with that I think it was gonna you got through that like very few people like you know very few people go through those hard days come out the other end and they're like we're gonna build another sustainable business that requires an incredible amount of tenacity and courage and B but you know it's not easy to go to a bunch of employees or look we're not gonna keep this fulfillment center anymore outsource this we're gonna outsource some of our customer service we have a core team here but when outsource them but like it's not easy to get up day after day and sort of make those decisions rationalized Rob that's for two years come through they'd be like now we're gonna start building again but that requires more tenacity than I've ever seen that's like a G like you know General Electric type of restructuring it's really spectacular and like I'm in all the results of that today that I would have been in 2017 or 2016 and we've been no I really appreciate that I think the you know the one the the thing for me has been the benefit to of scaling once we got to bring in a lot of seasoned folks so when I was having a hard time making hard decisions folks hasn't seen this a few times yeah like these decisions aren't don't you're overthinking these things like these we have to do we have to do and so I think great leadership teams especially these companies get to scale folks need to start removing themselves from decision making because yeah we're so emotionally tied to the brands to the products it's hard to make hard trade-offs when it's your baby and yeah yeah so you know I think you know getting better and finding great advisors making yourself lessee ultimate decision maker and helping having people that know certain parts of the business better than you help you make the really hard choices is is been you know huge for me and those advisors you know asking people I trust yeah I think in any of these areas you know there's a hole on the restructuring a debt side there's a whole separate universe that most of us never interact with that does this and you know it's the same way we you know I'm the growth and marketing side we were scaling up and I was trying to figure out who the best DC marketers who just hitting everybody up and learning as much as you can so I think it's the same kind of general principles they're out there they're ready to help okay two final questions one what is your favorite video game assuming you play video games and - what is your favorite box being in the last okay so I think everybody I think this is the moment for VR to really take off so there's a game called pistol whip an oculus that's amazing that's so fun do you like literally or your arms are dead within 10 minutes because you're just a little running around like in this it's amazing or you like working people you're a pistol whipping shooting first-person shooter or like if you don't have a VR this is the time and VR head says yeah oculus is the one how long have you had not to us a year okay yeah we had one D we haven't the office we like we've had him for a long time we had an interaction but yet we've had it for a while but ya know like it will change it's a there's beat Sabre there's some amazing games that like more casual gamers can get really into so but yeah pistol-whip is amazing and I'm gonna go to oculus and pistol it up today yep it sold out obviously because everybody had the same but yeah waiting list yeah no it's it's but he'll be back soon and then what was your second question what what has been your favorite box that loot crate has ever sent out over the last eight years we you know one of my favorites is we had I'm trying to actually member the we have themed names for everyone so they like curated but it had a replica hub like a one-fifth scale replica lover board like a Doc Brown when he's pulling the to jump starts yeah there is like a collectible figure we had an it had a back to the future be excellent to each other sure which is like the best message of all time and it's just like yeah held my favorite favorite gear there's where did that box come at that was in the 20 and of 2015 okay always fascinating yeah yeah Chris this is amazing thanks so much for sharing your journey I feel like you've got a lot more experience than those people in direct-to-consumer you've seen a lot more things when it comes to direct to consumer and like very few people would be as honest and upfront and as open as you've been so I really appreciate that as a founder and I really like realized you know the amount of tenacity and courage you've had to go through this and build a successful business on the other end all this you is is superhuman and like heroic and so I'm like I hope I hope people in your company if I were to your company I would think of you as the superhero that would go box you're one of those people in the direct consumer industry and thanks so much for being here and yeah I think this is so far and this is really great I can't believe that yeah no this is awesome thanks so much we gotta talk to [Music]

[Music] welcome to episode 5 of the exit strategy podcast I'm here with Paul trend Paul you're the CEO and founder of manscaped manscape you know native started in 2015 manscape started around then manscaped sells products that helps men groom their groins is that right that's that's whitespace and some of the products that you sell just so people have clarity are the lawnmower which helps men trim their pubes deodorant for your balls you know like a foot and a foot odor product as well what's the foot odor product called it's called the flick duster it's called the foot duster ok and you guys have a really cheeky sense of humor you know when people go into manscaped or look at man escapes past you know I've read some of your tag lines they're fantastic one is I remember one cuz that's reading it's called good sense when you trim the hedges the tree stands taller who came up with that I mean I mean that's true right that's absolutely true who came up with that tagline you know we have a really talented marketing team you know we're we're just you know it evolved as I can't remember where exactly where that where that tagline came from but you know we just have a really talented marketing team that that comes up with these these really catchy sayings all the time yeah that's certainly really catchy you know one of the questions I was thinking about when I was doing some research about manscaped is how often are men trimming their hedges do you guys have any idea do you guys like survey your customers about that kind of information or what they do survey our customers and it's it's actually it's turned out to be much more frequent than we thought a lot of men or you know of course anything there's a bell curve right there where the bell curve the highest frequency is around once a week to to once every 14 14 days so it's between you know seven and 14 days is when I wouldn't somebody maintenance their Bush and what's uh what's the other end of the bell curve is the other end once every like five years the the other end of course is you know it follows it also follows the age gap right when you're you're much older less incentivize to do it so it's like never right so the that's the other side of the bell curve gotcha yeah and that look um I guess who are the who's buying who are buying these products is it is it men who were like hey I want to make myself look better and my tree to stand taller or is it women who are like I'm tired of looking at my husband or boyfriend or partner's looking like this and so he needs to trim well we actually have a pretty eclectic mix between men and women during the holidays it's we open marketing much much more to women so we have more of more women customers then you know the rest of the year but really the truth is that if you if you haven't groomed down there you don't know what it feels like I think if after you've done that you feel it's it's refreshing so we've seen that men like that actually start they really enjoy it you know it's like it's like you know we we got your hair is really long you know and then then you finally cut your hair it feels really like it feels really relaxing we really cool and and I think men start they're starting to enjoy that you know it's it feels fresher it's not as damn so I think you start getting used to that feeling and and becomes just a normal thing yeah yeah your app your you're right about a lot of that I know like when I shave sometimes or at least get a barber to cut my beard afterwards I just feel like I'm a new human being and feel great I don't know what it is about that like I still don't understand what like like what psychological impact that is where I'm like okay this guy's just cut my beer it looks good but now I feel like I'm a new I'm a newly reborn person yeah it's it's and that's what we strive for you know we I mean that's the essence of the company at the end of the day at the end of the day we just want you to feel better you know like like the window we think about it is life is pretty rough already you know there's so much to do there's so many responsibilities you know we just want to make your life just a little more enjoyable yeah that's truly that's our mission yeah and so there's a subscription element to the business as well aside from like I imagine like you the the hero product that you guys have is the lawn mower like what trimmed hedges is that right absolutely so I mean if you think about it we like to explain it is that when you look at the female body you realize you can start from head to toe you're analyzing me you you realize that there's a there's a product and a brand for every single female care and need you could dig up when you go to the male body switch your attention to the male body you start with you know inside with your hood you got all you got your Gillette your dog shows your up your hair easily you go down to the Torsen is not native you need that Old Spice when you get down to the groin there's nobody playing in the groin right there that is total empty white space and you know we got lucky and fortunate when we recognized that you know three years ago and we were able to capitalize on that we were to obtain an amazing name so a manscape you know right now I mean we define the category of man sleeping right so that manscape defines that category and we just we totally own this category and you know we and what's really important for us is to create the best products that we're the way that we think about our mission and our mandate is we we don't optimize for anything other than quality so we're not we're not optimizing for price we're not the cheapest products we are the best products so that that's that's kind of how because there's just a lot of products out there right I mean from everything from the low end too high and we want we want to focus on is creating the absolute best products and that's not until non-mo of them it so talking about the lawnmower which is like a trimmer for your pubes really and a fantastic name you know we'd love to delve more into the name of manscaped and lawn mower in a minute but like you know you're on the lawn mower 3.0 what did like how did you guys decide what went from lawn mower 2.0 to 3.0 and what what look what what are you gonna put in lawn mower 4.0 look is that a is that a you know it is there customer feedback involved in that is there look what's going on for you guys to make those types of decisions absolutely so we have a Facebook group and I want to plug it here this is Facebook ballers group it's a VIP group and it's invite-only you have to you know ask to join but the deepest group is for our closest best customers that are interactive with us and when I say best it's not on a monetary value how much you buy it's just you know it's just people that like the brand that want to interact with with myself and our you know our executive team and a product development team and so we have about close to 2 or 3,000 people in there that are really interactive that they love to test products so we have a great group of core you know manscape fans sure can do test new products but one of the biggest things that we do is you know our blade has what we called skin safe technology and skin skin safe it makes it really difficult for you to excuse my friend should make your balls right because if if you've ever nicked yourself down there it is the most horrible feeling you know that I think that's what everyone is afraid of before they start manscaping leads a lot you know so our blades we it's the only blade out there specifically engineered to trim your groin this is not it's not any other area of your face right like in some of your beard it's pretty talked your face is really easy to trim right this is your loose skin with yeah so it's not the same experience as as trimming as trimming your beard it's much more difficult so go back to your TR to your question now how do we determine the difference between the two point on the three-point oh it's just innovating you know in the product pipeline your it might take like a year 18 months engineer and a great product so we have multiple products lined up that we're designing the 4.0 at the same time we're designing the 5.0 and we're putting it off into the 6.0 because we're we're a hardware company in addition to soft goods right so we have our own Rd lab that we that we built out that does all the soft grips all the formulations you know the ball deodorant and everything else that we're going to get into but on a hardware side we have our own in-house industrial designers material experts and engineers that design these and design and think through the problems that you have so when we when did we developed a 2.0 that was really our first mass product with skin-safe and then the 3.0 was an evolution of the of the 2.0 you know it had a light in there because you realize like what even if you're a brat bathroom is really lit your shadows you know so like the light it seems we thought about is it a gimmick you know if we put a light but light on there what do we do as a gimmick and then we actually put a light on a prototype well this is actually really useful because like you you could because you need to see down there you know like it's not the same experience because you you know you gotta see down there so putting the light on there it was made it into the 3.0 the porn for porno I don't want to talk about all the different features but yeah we're really innovating on on this experience and I don't we don't think that there's many companies that really looked at growing trimming and how to innovate in that area well making it safe easy and enjoyable and so going back to this Facebook group are you gonna like reach out to the Facebook group and say hey guys we have the 4.0 does anyone want to try a couple samples and give us your feedback before we finalize this production is that how it works or like an epoxy work that works all the time so that why that cycle there's much more frequent with with our soft goods products so you know all of our you know ball deodorant and all the products that we're we're testing in the pipeline now that is that goes out that gets tested internally you know goes all do all the stability testing and and can all the employees use it and then and then we expand it out to our VIP ballers group and then talk to me a little bit about R&D it's really amazing that you can sort of have that R&D in-house was an independent company we never had that as native as an independent company and even once we joined Procter & Gamble like we did some R&D internally but most of the R&D we did like with their party manufacturers how big is this R&D group I haven't heard of like a start-up sort of thinking about R&D or like you know early on or within the first five years of their existence like you guys are doing how big is that R&D group so that goes back to a firm belief of mine you know I've always kind of thought I always I always thought it was really important not only to go wide but also go deep and what that means is you got a you got to know you know a lot of different things but you just can't you just can't be a what was theirs there's a saying was saying you know a jack-of-all-trades with master of none I don't think an entrepreneur can be like that I think anon to be to be really successful you not only have to go wide we you also have to go deep and you've got to be a master a lot of things so yeah with that with with that that belief now we always we we made sure that everything was done in-house if we've never hired an agency and we don't use any agencies for anything all video production is done in-house all media buying is done in-house R&D is done in-house oh my god there's no agencies how's it look the the technology that you guys build out you guys have your own developers when you guys launch a TV commercial you have your own in-house production agency make it you have your own in-house creative agency decide what it is and then your own in-house like agency or your own in-house employees cut it up as well an edit yeah that's it how big is the entire team then right now we're seeing about 72 employees okay yeah that is not that big and pretty amazing based on like the amount of content that I see coming out of manscaped so you guys are certainly productive at creating content and when did you guys hire your first R&D employee then well I mean just like many other startups in the CPG space you know we we use contract manufacturers so we use a third party lab to create our first products but I think it's about about a year five 14 months ago when we started really building out our own R&D lab Wow and hire the first already our new research chemist and you know it was we knew that we had to retain this knowledge and really understand it you know from top down so having it in-house we've got to iterate very quickly and we didn't like this let's change it and so we're like what would take you know what would take weeks from from from we're working with a lab cuz you know we work with labs before you got to send them to them you know send them a brief they send you samples chirpin and you saw them back and forth it just yeah the cycles are just way too long right so for us having a team that we can work with hand-in-hand is it was was just really accelerated that gotcha okay let's start talking a little bit more about like the early days of manscaped so before this rnt R&D team exists before you guys are sort of developing a lot more 4.0 you know you guys were working on the original products manscape gets on Shark Tank at some point and it's some like uh you know you're on Shark Tank you're working on the original marketing for the for that for the company is do you guys call the first do collies call the first product you release a lawnmower 1.0 and we stopped the lawnmower yeah it was cold okay gotcha yeah and look how do you guys yeah tell me a little bit more about how this marketing strategy developed because certainly like you know I I think everyone is familiar with the Dollar Shave Club like like commercial or video initial video that really launched that brand and how spectacularly successful it was you know how Michael do been saying you don't need Roger Federer to endorse your razor blade why are you paying Roger Federer to shave how did you guys get started in terms of your marketing strategy so you know we first started to be we knew that this is something that was good for men way it helped with being you know it's hygienic and its cleanliness right yeah so we started off with messaging in that way like dudes you guys should do this because it's good for you you'll feel better and none of that one about resonating right how long did you try that type of marketing for there was like more serious and less cheeky probably for three months okay and how much money did you have to spend in those three months to be like this isn't working out it's a ballpark it what is it $10,000 or $100,000 I think we spent five fifty thousand dollars I'm market okay realize that that didn't work and then yeah then tell me about the evolution then what happened yeah so then you know being scientific no it just didn't gravitate to anyone you know so then weeds and we just we basically change gears you know we knew that there was a market for this there was white space we knew that we had we had to crack it and figure out how to communicate with men because communicating like in my past I've I've had startups that focused primarily on women in skin care right and and perfumes and colognes and you know even in SAS and other things right but but we needed to understand that we have to get to that tipping point of understanding how to communicate with men in this way and we realized that you know dudes aren't talking about this like don't stand around the water cooler and be like hey you look so great today what you use all of my volumizer like kind of condition using dudes don't do that right yeah they don't talk about skincare they don't talk about deodorants or hygiene right but they'll talk about funny things right things that were hilarious that that entertains him so then we started creating our first video I remember was a video because it was towards the end of the year and we had produced this video of Santa Claus trimming so it was in it was it was in an apartment and Ryan Fiore our vp of marketing was the one that actually dressed up as Santa and he's got his Santa pants down on his ankles and the camera is just panning and it looks like snow falling down right and then as you pan Santa's legs snowing you here there's like buzzing sound it's kind of snowing indoors because it was I didn't inside inside on the house so as you're you know and then we had another person was like Katherine was was sprinkling you know these fake white hairs on onto the ground and we were we were pulling back the camera that was panning back and panning out and you can see Santa's legs so that was the that was kind of the first video that we that we shot that was the first time you moved from like was that the first like move you had towards the cheeky sense of humor from being serious about like hey this is good for you it's gonna make you feel better yeah that was that was the first one okay let me talk a little bit more about the 50,000 you spent where that didn't work well where did you end up spending that 50,000 over those like three months to be like let's test to see if this you know if this concept has any legs because you know you have a product that you know consumers want you're trying to find out the right marketing channels and the right marketing you know messaging to go out with that that marketing messaging is what's failing where did you spend that fifty thousand dollars but I think I think this answer is gonna be kind of defacto answer across many many startups you spending on chase looking we spend out of Google and any that is just the reality yeah whatever but what I do want to say about that is like all you entrepreneurs out there don't don't get a false sense of confidence that you are your cap is so low even that you're you're doing so well on Facebook that this is going to scale infinitely you know could you start winning those numbers right you're like on Facebook like oh man my cap it's 20 bucks if I if I dump you know 200 million dollars into marketing I wouldn't make this much yes there doesn't work out it doesn't work that way there is a Facebook and a Google wall and I'll use it didn't different Facebook ceiling you're gonna hit that ceiling and it's gonna hurt and a lot of a lot of entrepreneurs need to realize that early on we will work really fortunate that we realize that early on because you gotta think about it Facebook is really really good at targeting I mean Facebook and Google these guys are data powerhouses they know how to target and find the right buyers for you but there's if you are if you are market you have your total addressable market is this big Yeah right you're gonna hit that ceiling pretty quickly you know so you have to really think about how to broaden your product appeal and into to make sure that you are addressing a very large total addressable market in your addressable market like eventually you're gonna have to market to men or women or both if you're still doing like fine-tuned targeting you know love your lights and you can extract every value you can't steal it I think that look I what you said definitely has a ton of is absolutely correct like at native you know we saw a $2 CAC in 2015 a $4 CAC in 2016 a 650 CAC in 2017 so one even looking at that $2 CAC it basically more than tripled over the course of two years but and we saw those like there were multiple ceilings we got to there was a ceiling at $200,000 there was a ceiling at $500,000 there was a much denser ceiling at $1,000,000 and trying to push against the ceilings took a lot of time and a lot of effort and a lot of like right messaging and you're absolutely right from an odd targeting perspective as well look look-alike audiences absolutely crushed it for us for a really long period of time until we hit one of those ceilings like you know we use the look-alike audience of 1% which look like you know 2 million people and then you know you start expanding that to 2% and 3% and then all of a sudden look-alikes don't work anymore and then you at some point you're just like I'm targeting all women and then I feel like I'm targeting all humans that exist on earth now you can reality like not everyone is gonna buy something when they see a Facebook ad right like you know Facebook does a great job of segmenting their audiences they're like you know they have let's say theirs they have 300 million people in the United States something like 80% of the people that are on Facebook generally won't click ads and make a purchase from it and so everybody is competing for those 20% of people who do buy things online and so you're a judge even if your total addressable market it's this big in reality online it's this big because you know there's just fewer people buying things that are online absolutely absolutely you got to get to if you want to build a truly scalable business you gotta eventually figure out how to get off of platforms you gotta be if you don't get off of online I mean online should it's always a part of your marketing mix and your marketing strategy right but it should never be a hundred percent like as soon as you can you know you gotta you're gonna go through withdrawal symptoms of getting off platforms but you can start diversifying your your marketing or it's just never going to scale everywhere now we we have figured out how to and this is where we're very fortunate we have a really talented marketing team you know but we thought off of Facebook and Google probably last year I went what is it off I mean we diversify from it yeah one of the one of our big channels is still is still YouTube right because a lot of people spend their time there where one of the biggest spenders on Hulu where we have a massive TV budget UFC sponsorship I mean we spawned to the UFC where we haven't really announced it yet but we're gonna be one of the exclusive sponsors of the San Francisco 49ers you know so what does that mean if you're an exclusive sponsor for the 49ers what does that mean that means that I think that next year when you go to the by CEM and you go into any of the bathrooms you're gonna see all our signage on top of all the urinals that's gonna be I mean the great thing is that's what we those some things we crap right it's like yeah how many how many companies out there can actually buy that bad the ad unit right likely who's gonna buy the ad unit mcapples not gonna buy that you know sheriff or urinal right but it fits so well for us and it fits our cheeky toned that it that it works for us right so like what are you doing right there you you're like you you're thinking about it right so you know when we had when you see analysis as a finger point down with the children says got Bush you're like you're standing right there you can find a evaluate and think about that okay I want to talk much more about this I want to talk a little bit about the past as well but before we get off this topic how much get you ballpark the cost to me for San Francisco 49ers sponsorship is that six figures or seven figures five figures oh yeah I know it's I I can't imagine it's five figures so give me a ballpark because you know like let me give you a couple examples you know we interviewed Kara from hint water yeah like a couple weeks ago and she told she told me how she bought a Superbowl commercial for under 1 million dollars we interviewed Andrew who's the CEO of this company called hymns which is like a you know men's sexual wellness company and he bought urinals over the you know over giant stadium give me an idea of what like just ballpark the cost for me you don't need to give me the exact number is it high six figures low six figures mid six figures is it seven figures give me some you know at native we were running you know a very lean budget but by the end it but by the time we were you know doing over a hundred million dollars we had a pretty sizable marketing budget we were spending money on TV ads on Billboard's in New York City we spent we're gonna spend a million dollars in 2020 or we were going to before covet really aunt on bill I'm sorry on subway ads in New York City in 2020 and you know that included like station takeovers which cost like a low very low six figures and that included some you know photos and subway trains would cost like about forty thousand dollars what is a forty niners exclusive spa ship getchu are you gonna go are you gonna do you have a booth are you gonna go to games and give me the price or give me a ball you know it's it's in the six figures not not to the seven figures yeah but definitely in the six figures okay and does it include a bunch of tickets or am I gonna see you at a bunch of 49ers games yeah I mean 49ers are just a phenomenal team management wise they're so awesome we got to go to the Super Bowl with them we with NFC playoffs in you know in their box it was okay let's go let's rewind a little bit and go back to the Santa Clause commercial so you guys have you know it's been three months the seriousness it wasn't working we were spending on Facebook and Google burn fifty thousand dollars didn't love what happened you've sort of pivoted now you're running this Santa Claus commercial or like you you've got the Santa Claus video what do you do with it yeah like you know it's really funny it's cheeky super interesting but it's kind of relevant cuz it's winter nobody's ever heard of Santa Claus trimming his pubes but that's really funny what happened what do you do with that commercial and when do you realize that cheeky sense of humor makes sense so I would I would answer that in two parts so the first the first part is you once again you run it on Facebook and Google right that's that's the first thing so you so you run it on you run it on Facebook or you read on YouTube and what you're tracking for at that time is that how am i how much on my pain / CPM and per click right now what am i what am i where's it cost me they deliver traffic to the website yeah right and then and then when they get to the website then you've been now you're you're you know you have to make sure that you're really observant and performing a lot of conversion rate optimization right you've got to make sure that you're you're that lead closes when they get to the site where you present them with the right offer so the first part of only answer your question is you know we've got that video we're testing we're running it on on Facebook running it on YouTube and we're tracking how much it's costing us remember at that time we weren't broad yet we're still like okay we're gonna we're gonna advertise to men that's 18 - you know 25 it's gonna run this video with this call to action and then there's then we're running 35 to 40 with this video or this cut different call to action and then it's all gonna drive to the website so then you know of course you're calculating what are my CPM is what are my CPAs and more important my cpc's and then when they get to the site that's when you really start doing a lot of work with like offer testing like what do I need to offer what do we need to say because early days really really early days when you what you're looking for is when you're looking for our signals right and you have to be really in tune with your entire marketing strategy to understand these signals right and what I mean by signals is early on I sort of bleep three pillars of what what is important to our male audience and this is very early on right it was you know when when you trim the bush the tree stands taller right that was that was an important motivation factor for them yeah right use the right tools for the job right so if you gonna do this don't hurt yourself because like that that was a really important marketing message that really got them that really got me to understand it so we could we distilled down you know this really big concept of hey guys don't cut yourself because that's crude to say right so it really just became if you know use the right tools in the job right so what would you trim the hedges the cheese stands taller it tells you okay well then that that works right you kind of equate then you kind of understand that there's a there's a benefit right outside of you just feeling good because for us we we knew that ultimately we wanted to be a much bigger brand of encompasses you know masculinity and empowerment for men we didn't want to just be a growing a growing business that was that was never that was never our intention we wanted to empower men but to get there we had to figure out what what what we what men were receptive to right so that's where that you know if you trim the bushes the tree stands taller men got that right away wait you've got they got why they should do that and how they were and we see this power it's not receive this feeling of empowerment right and then after that it was author was all I used to write or some job because you don't don't cut yourself don't hurt yourself that was that was the that was the big learning that that cost probably two hundred thousand quarter of a million to really learn and it's it's really kind of philosophical when you're talking about marketing in this way you know what like to spend that much money just to learn these two key things and most people like a lot of people like there are not marketers they're not they're not really in tune with with their audience that might just pass them oh they really get that but we tested a lot of marketing message and realize that that those two things combined together really resonated really got meant to understand why you should do this the need and why you should use dedicated tools that we created to solve this problem so I think any any startup Eddie any started trying to build a brand and not just a Fastpass forum where you're just selling utility right you're satisfied when you sell utility this you know we solve your problem like this right what you really build a brand in a CPG a highly competitive CPG space you have to distill your marketing message to be so fine-tune that that it really resonates with a broad audience so you tested can you give me examples of so the two that worked were you know tree stands taller use the right tools bird in the job what were some of the marketing messages you thought might work and ended up not working do you remember any of those there was so many we we had like we had a bunch that that was it was a 10 on that made it to the shortlist of you know it was a you know you know fueled fuel fresher or something like that right it was was one of them you know you know make sure you're clean and ready all the time and it was it was a bunch of different along that vein but it just didn't resonate you know it was just it it just didn't click with with dudes and and that's what you're searching for us as marketers trying to market any product that's what you're searching for you're searching for though that with this how to sell your product in one simple statement to understand your audience understands it and sees the mead instantly yeah so you spend $200,000 sort of testing that messaging on Facebook and Google you know yeah I really liked what you said earlier which was once you get people to your website you have to like optimize offers as well I feel like too often people are like great what is my CPA and my CPA is what I was like how good is my face but God and what they don't look at is how good is my landing page am i convincing people once they get to my landing page that they should buy this product that it's a good value and that they should buy it now and not two weeks from now and I feel like they're you know those are two sides of the same coin and both are gonna dramatically impact CPA right like you can say hey tree stands taller on your facebook ad and like you know the flip side of that coin the landing page can be used the right tools for the job but if the landing page it's like buy this trimmer because you know your balls aren't the same as your face it could be a very different type of CPA yeah I did a lot of entrepreneurs and it's that see that that's that's where I go back to you know it's it's difficult to it's difficult to hire an agency unless you got a lot of a lot of money right you know your venture funded and that you know we weren't at that time you know and so it wasn't unless we had a lot of money you wouldn't be able to buy enough time of an agency to actually come up with these things you know - so if you if you're an entrepreneur and you could give a really phenomenal product you spent years building this product I I would say take that take that leap don't be shy because I in my core at the half of my career I was technologist like I I didn't I didn't do CPG you know I wasn't I wasn't a brand and guy there wasn't a marketer I was I was a technology so I built SAS and software so I would say that don't be shy take that risk and and do the marketing yourself because you're the only one that really understands the value of your product like to try to communicate that with an agency and it's it's gonna it's gonna it it's really really hit or miss unless you've got a lot of money and you're and you're paying for a lot of their time it just it just I have seen it not work out very well couldn't agree more when we were when native was growing the entire time we were an independent company I ran all paid ads after we sold the business I still ran paid ads until probably like six months ago or something to that effect or like you know maybe eight months ago at this point because I was just like this is the backbone of the business this is how we're growing this is one of the reasons we're growing very quickly and I don't want to outsource that to somebody else who you know by necessity like you know is is an agency by definition and there will be agency costs as a result of that they won't care as much they don't care about the business they won't be looking at the metrics as quickly as I am or as frequently as I am and they won't be iterating on different tests on messages like if this is a skill that I have if this is a skill that's important to the company I should get good at this skill or I should least understand this skill and so like you know one of the things that you mentioned was you need a lot of money in order to hire these agencies in order like you know to get them to do good work going back to what you guys did you guys spent fifty thousand dollars and it didn't really work out with the serious messaging two hundred thousand dollars and you realized what messaging did work how were you were able to afford this stuff because early on you were bootstrapped yeah I mean we were bootstrap for and we grew organically for a very very long time and how we know it would do through prior successes you know you gotta you know you gotta gamble and and reinvest you know that's the I would think that's the best way to to talk about and you know fundraising and and and spending investor dollars it has its it has its price there's there's a there's a cost to that right and I think I think very often that gets OH shadowed by the glitz and glamour of fundraising and closing around and that's where I would I would advise entrepreneurs that you know closing because right now when you read the news right every closes around and everyone's cheering there's a lot of PR around it like dude that's just the beginning and you don't know how much less and that's what's gonna be on your ass all the time you know how to spend that money and then you get into a point where you're starting to spend frivolously you know it's like I guarantee you we had a million dollars in the bank we would have spent about $200,000 would have spent half a million tested yeah right you so I think it's it's a silikal trap to raise money way too early because number one that's when you lose the most amount of the most of your company right it's early on mom most amount of dilution you look back like oh my god that was crazy right looking within like it makes you it makes you not as strict with with yourself and with your budget absolutely I couldn't agree more with all that you know we raised like fifty thousand dollars and it was a great sign that we were onto a successful business we raised that native we raised $50,000 and like a five million dollar valuation probably four months into the business and then another 250 K maybe within the first year and those were you know the reason that I did that early on the business was working I wasn't like in reality we didn't even need that 250k I was just like I want to make sure that there's external validation that what I'm doing here is right I think that was the primary reason and the secondary reason was that I was like I'm in San Francisco and this is what everyone here does everyone raises money as a sign of success there's this great tweet I saw I don't remember who tweeted it and someone's like raise 10 million dollars and you get invited to every party in San Francisco sell your business and make 10 million dollars crickets like people somehow celebrate the fundraising more than they do actually the successful exits which doesn't make any sense well look what scale were you at when you did raise your first few checks and you know I want to make sure there's some disclosure here I was one of those Jax at some point what scale were you at when you raised his first few checks well this first few checks we I mean we were we were beyond eight figures wait wait well by the time we raised those those first few checks would you say you were beyond eight figures you mean you were like north of ten million dollars not north of a hundred million dollars correct okay yeah and those in those few checks the you know the impetus behind those was to bring on talent at yourself right I mean we we called it a a sweetheart round or a sweetheart note because we wanted to bring on amazing talent so there weren't any B C's in in that note it was it was everyone that was pretty much hand selected from a group of friends you know select like yourself like Nick from thrive and like from this amazing individuals that could really contribute to to the business that can have the experience and we wanted to actually call and talk to you you know I will call I'll call you when you're in China and we'll talk about that was the that was the reason why we need and has that been helpful you know we raise money we raise five hundred thousand dollars at native about half the investors I would say we're really helpful like people that I could call and be like hey this is a problem I'm having have you had it before you know we like Nick was the first episode of this podcast he actually helped me with a bunch of trademarks top or at least made me think about trademark stuff early on there were there was a one of our investors was an executive of Facebook who's really helpful and helping us just get access to the right people at Facebook that we needed another was just like a calming voice who you know was a VC and it sort of seen a bunch of things happen in San Francisco and so was like when I called him up he's like his name's Paul Ferris from Azure and he's like hey boys this is how to think about things you're panicking too much have the investors that you sort of let in those sweet hearts have those sweet hearts been helpful I was absolutely and I think you you nailed it on the head with about 50% it's like about even even when you hand select these guys yes group of investors everyone's got their own lives or everyone has to focus so everyone you hand select only 50% will be really valuable so imagine if you don't hand select them and it's just a group of a bunch of different people are you the value out of that will be dramatically lower right so yeah 50% I can call anytime and and I want to say there's you gotta manage expectations right everyone step their own lives I mean suck their own jobs but just invest in your company doesn't mean that you have you know ten hours a week of their time you gotta manage expectations right so it's really key decisions hey I'm going through this what do you think you know you don't need manufacturers in here or whatever whatever it's a set up brought email and you know hey anybody can help me with connecting with this person that person that's what you can get really rapid responses and they can be really helpful yeah okay let's do a little bit of fast forwarding you've raised this money from a bunch of sweethearts including myself you've spent two hundred two hundred fifty thousand dollars on Facebook and Google with the Santa Claus commercial and you're like okay I'm not gonna talk about anything I'm not gonna be I'm gonna be less serious and be more cheeky with my humor because that's what's resonating with consumers at what point you start getting off Facebook and Google look you know I think the most one of the most impressive things I found about manscaped is the diversity of channel acquisition like YouTube is a really hard channel for people to scale so lucky you know Hulu we've tried on Hulu like what native has been on Hulu ads wasn't nearly as successful as you guys how do you guys test how do you guys well first first help me understand your largest channels of customer acquisition is it YouTube is it still Facebook like what is the largest Channel still well it depends I mean Facebook and Google is still a very large channel and in between I mean between YouTube between do YouTube Google and and Facebook is a large channel right because Facebook encompasses both of their assets with this Facebook and Instagram is very very large channel because can't forget about Instagram everyone talks about Facebook sure but it's getting a huge channel so that's where a lot of spend goes the other spend is on on Google of course there's Adwords right there in CDN there is so many different ad units and you guys are the most you know startup on tourists I've even haven't even considered right on on the Google platform and then there's YouTube which drives a tremendous amount of traffic and that's I should say tremendous amounts of views not necessarily attractive okay because there's so much inventory on YouTube it's just it's so hard to crack like YouTube is so hard to crack okay let me ask you in a different way if you had to choose if all of these channels were gonna be regulated by the FTC and all of them were gonna be shut down except one which one would you want to continue to exist it depends on when right now I would say Google today yeah you'd say 182 which today what Google okay and then help you understand a little bit more about YouTube are you guys doing pre-roll ads or Road you guys doing like influence or based ads on YouTube we're doing hero ads where do influence your ads we're doing user-generated content we're doing I mean we signed we have a a team of five in our influencer department and all they do is work with influencers so it gets to a point where you have to keep grinding and there's a tipping point where you're like everything starts to gel because all these channels lift everything right like you can't you can't just be on Facebook and be successful you gotta be on Facebook on Google and Hulu on everything else to actually to actually scale massively so we realize that on very very early on so this year is a big push for us to kind of be be me everywhere including billboards that we don't like we got 20 billboards out there now you know you're in ads and you have sea-fight so we're on the Conor McGregor fight but a car in NASCAR Wow yeah so tell me how you structure your team to handle all that do you guys have like is is one person that's working on YouTube also working on Instagram or is there somebody who's dedicated to YouTube somebody who's dedicated to UFC fights and somebody who's dedicated to NASCAR so there there is there's an out-of-home director joey Kovac he's this phenomenal and you really I think the way that is it to answer your first part your question is how do you structure you gotta find the best people the best people will bring in the best people will bring in the best people you know so it's so important as as an entrepreneur to to build the team right when you're the one of your primary jobs as a CEO is to build the team right to lead the vision and build team so bringing in your your the right generals the right key people in that leadership team will automatically start to bring in the right people on the next layer right yeah so you know Ryan and I have been working together Ryan as a VP of Marketing has been working together for almost a decade now he brought in Joey Kovac which is phenomenal Joey you know work did a lot of the marketing for movement before they exited from from the ground up then he brought in Nate singer the two to him to handle Google and YouTube and then we brought in Nathalie hopin to handle radio so and then she was phenomenal she got us on Howard Stern and all these you know all these amazing podcasts and then and then they brought in Lauren on the markings and and Lauren does all of influencers about the influencer routine so it sounds like you have directors for each channel though as opposed like you know you have a YouTube to somebody who manages YouTube somebody who manages out-of-home somebody manages Instagram and yes and that sort of structured it under a VP of Marketing correct and then however for start-up though well for start-up oh I don't want to I don't want you to think that that's how that's what you need to start right you don't need that to start you got to do everything wrong right yeah in the beginning like Ryan and I were on YouTube every single day like clicking through refreshing like a thousand times a day to see metrics right that's how you start and then when you would you reach critical mass that's when you bring in someone to handle well you go on and you pioneer the next channel yeah I think that's a great thing to mention like I feel like a lot of people want to be like want to be in seven different marketing channels when they launch their business and it's hard to be an expert you know I've rarely met people who are good at Facebook and Google Ads and people are like yeah I'm gonna try and run Facebook Google snap Pinterest and tik-tok ads when I launch my business and I'm like you're not gonna be able to measure look you're gonna forget everything that you've ever done by the time you're looking at tik-tok ads you know which is your fifth Channel today you're gonna forget what your Facebook ads look like and so it's really hard to be a master of so many channels right out of the gate you know I'm a big fan of sort of going deep on one or two channels or three if you are able to and becoming a master of those and then hiring people once you're sort of able to once you understand the metrics behind those and you've built some sort of critical mass and know how to look you you know you understand the next three to four months of the trajectory of that channel you gotta master you got a message where you move on yeah absolutely and then how do you think about budgets when you're doing this so is there like a quarterly meeting for budgets or an annual meeting for budgets where you're like okay influencer team you get 12 percent of our budget radio team you get 10 percent of our budget how do you guys think order or you look sort of like you know what influencers we're willing to spend up to $30.00 tax spend as much as you can until you had $30 you know how do you think about that I mean now we are I mean to be to be honest now we are right like we're we're much more systematic now we're much more organized but the first two years let's be honest nobody's getting six budgets in the first two years you're still learning so much you're still growing so much and it's still so fluid that like you know do we just we just launch this channel with this video the the CPA is so well kind of go balls out right yeah and that's the only thing that matters over the question is this chill everyone else be quiet this is the channel that can make a business now I want to make sure that the listeners are and the entrepreneurs out there don't get a you know don't think that you need to have budgets in place on that you know in the early days you just kind of make it work that's all you gotta do you gotta make it work that's all you gotta focus on yeah in the early days it's always audibles right like every day is a new fire that you have to put out and the rare days where you don't have fires that can sort of focus on marketing channels you got to go with just what's working and not like a not dogma you can't be like you know what Facebook were or like you know YouTube worked for Paul at manscaped I'm gonna spend money on you know people come up to me in there like hey Facebook work for you guys I get Facebook to work for me and I'm like look Facebook work for us it's like you know it will work for us it almost certainly will not work for you we had a specific use case you know we were on there a different time than Facebook is today and like you know we were spending a lot of resources on Facebook for you guys the content that you have and the cheeky humor is much more amenable to video than it maybe tillich a quick mobile uh you know photo and so it's just a different channel that works and like people cannot get a caught up on the dogma of others they have to call audibles when they get to the line see what's working and spend their time and resources there absolutely what did you guys like um fail at so like you know certainly you it sounds you know and maybe they said that maybe fails a bad word you know at native we fail that a ton of stuff operations for a really long time until we hired a stellar operations person finance forever what did you guys feel that like you know it certainly the like not doing the cheeky marketing was tough did you guys have operational supply issues because these things can't be easy to it's not like you you know um with deodorant you want to make more you probably can do it in there and like you know a week like you need a week of heads up maybe two weeks these are you know hardware components that cannot be made in a day or two days it's not mixing ingredients together I mean some of your products are but a lot of them aren't you know what were the things that you guys struggled with to make the business a success absolutely right so I mean kind of an all-encompassing way if you if you're in software and SAS then you don't have to worry about you know making stuff right you know you got to worry about them having enough servers but now there's clouds and but we have to worry about that anymore either right so that's why software is so can be so lucrative if you get the right win but but for hard and physical products and operations supply chain you know it it's it's a lot of work so I'm exactly with you like we failed in Opera and operations if we failed multiple times of operations meaning what was one of the example of a disaster you guys had disaster so were like one of the things that you fail that in operations specifically yeah so we had we were on a run rate we had projected inventory for the entire q1 right we bought it we have it in stock it was November we're like we're good and we bought so much inventory or like we're good for the next quarter this is November and we're like when we're good until we're good until April and that's that's how much inventory we had by December 16th and so but so now all inventory and we're like oh crap it was it was easy you're like everyone and our families were in the warehouse packing new like new inventory to send out so that was definitely failure so we we shipped late to our customers which means they weren't happy with us that means that's a fail for us that we wanted to light our customers all the time and you know that really that bad sucked and that doesn't go away by the way like that that happens all the time all the time like when you're scaling you can never predict how like Howard Stern would do would do a you know a read things what things would just pop and you know influencers would do would launch their videos things will just pop and which is it's just really difficult to manage all the channels because now we were only channel right so we're not just a subscription OTT just a b2c company where we've got Amazon we like D to see without international and without retail so now we're working with you know a lot of all our retail partners and your your planning with them months and months that he tells a different beast it's not need to see you're planning a year in advance time's yeah I think I uh I didn't understand how hard it would be until Native got into retail like you know we scaled we have the same opera problems you did in terms of like running out of inventory in 2015 we were making 500 units of deodorant a week by 2017 we were making 21,000 units a day and we were still like selling out like you know if you bought your deodorant on a Thursday it was either made the day before the day after it was like it's not like we had a lot of inventory but once you sell it to Target and Walmart and like large brick-and-mortar stores you know their first order could be you know five 300,000 units or 2050 thousand units and all of a sudden the just-in-time inventory that you had always been reliant on is no longer sustainable yeah absolutely it looks it gets really difficult as ask your SKU starts to expand also yeah yeah so tell me about some of the retailers you gathering you guys are in target today any other retailers we're in Target Best Buy and we're looking to focus on Target and Best Buy because I had we feel that that's where our audience lives you know we have a lot of great retail partners but we're gonna for the time being at least for 2020 we're really gonna focus on targeting this way and is does your online site make up the majority of your sales or do Target and Best Buy make up the majority of your sales no d2c web ecommerce makes up the majority of our sales and is there like cyclic allottee to the business you know it's really interesting that you said by December 16th you've sort of sold out I've imagined that people are buying this product for Christmas is there another bump in sales for instance right before Valentine's Day you know Valentine's Day Father's Day any gift-giving holiday we see a bug yeah because that's when women bias gifts for men and then of course holidays that's when we women really buy as gifts for men but then yeah men are also spending on themselves so q4 is definitely huge just any other e-commerce keyboard to you to everybody yeah well I mean the q4 is he's like for Native it was actually probably one of the worst corners in part because like deer you tend to wear more dealer in the summer when it's hot out as opposed to the winter when it's cold out and you know some people give deodorants gifts in fact a lot of people do a lot more than I suspected but like you know if I gave you a tea odor and it's a gift I think you'd be like well this is nice but like okay this is like a pretty mediocre gift I mean if I gave you a package of manscaped it'd be very different from like you know it's it's obviously higher price point and a great like on a much nicer gift I wonder if men ever accuse like men who get this as a gift from their female partners I wonder if they ever accuse them of being like this is a gift for yourself like when I buy lingerie for you to gift for me this is a gift for yourself I don't you know one folder we haven't polled our customers thought that that might be the case but we have a lot of you know unboxing experience that people unboxing reactions on Instagram and tik-tok it's been pretty yeah did you work your way up when it came to influence their advertising did you start it like micro influencers and work your way up to like you know a list celebrities or were you like you know what let's go big right out of the gate and get the Kim Kardashian's or Tom Brady's of the world to try this product you know we still haven't gone with celebrities and we have not kept an image to that region so we're we're talking but he went we went with amazing influencers so what a first influencer that we have abroad on was jose zuniga of teaching men's fashion he's phenomenal the dude is dude knows his stuff he's you know yes he really knows men's hygiene and grooming and so we tapped him as one of our first influencers and we still work very closely with him today so I guess like with your budget right away going after maybe the celebrity is a bad example was your budget right away sort of saying hey let's put ten thousand or fifty thousand or a hundred thousand dollars to test among different influencers to see what works and what doesn't or would you look I'm ready to go with an influencer that has five hundred thousand people that may not be an a-list celebrity but certainly a large Instagram so you know but I think I'm you're gonna test it influence your market testing micro influencers will give you a really bad data because it just there's not enough reach right yeah you got it you gotta test with enough reach to have its active sampler I thought the more data you have the better the better the results the better David you better the better you can conclude on your data right so you know I think I think at that time Jose had like four million followers or on YouTube and that was that was the that was the right amount for us to really do a good test Wow all right so you're looking for guys who already like rather large on YouTube but before you spend money there is that still the case are you still sort of focusing on those people that have the million-plus or are you willing to go down now to people who have 10,000 plus four subscribers now it's now our our influencer team evaluates each influence of potential influence a partner and then we evaluate for primarily is authenticity like if you if you've got 30,000 followers or 30,000 fans or whatever that is you know on each on these different platforms and in your Instagram all you're doing is pushing product you're not the right influencer for us yeah you know we want you to actually test our product you know really use it and be a fan of it right because that authenticity comes out because we as a brand really value or authenticity we want to have a really authentic voice and that's that's really important to our brand and so how do female influencers sort of project that authenticity is it sort of talking about you know their partners or how do female you know users project that authenticity well it it depends usually it's the way that they the way that they do is they it depends on which platform right so on on Instagram we're just taking pictures of it and or something and many times are taking pictures with a partner as like you guys because Instagram is a very photo based platform whereas on YouTube it's mostly couples it's the if it's if it's a a woman Instagram or a female Instagram they would be they would pair up with their partner right and and talk about the product because there's so many ways you can talk about this problem right yeah and then can talk about how great it is how it doesn't hurt you how some right tools of the job right and how how how much how much better it makes them feel wimp it's women talk about it as hey you know you give this to your men and it makes them so much better it makes you like it more and you know so yeah sure we leave it up to them to kind of put their own spin on it gotcha okay you know we're almost out of time so I just want to ask a couple more questions you know the business has changed dramatically since you went from that serious advertising and it was you and Ryan sort of refreshing YouTube to today you know you're sponsoring four other NFL teams and NASCAR teams and that's pretty amazing where is it like what is your goal with a business I think that like you know do you want to work here for 20 years is there an exit strategy in the net like you know within five years or like what it look where do you want to go with the business you know this is like the business that you've created is right in the wheelhouse of a lot of CPG companies right it's almost like like there's a lot of competition for the Gillette's of the world from the Harry's and Dollar Shave Club so the world this is going up this is like in the same industry but going after a very different type of category or niche and you're uniquely positioned and so sort of one of the few companies in that space what do you want to do and the way that we think about that is we know if we never like they never create or build a business for the sole purpose of exiting with with that in mind I just feel like if you if you create a successful business that transcends you know fads or you know that can be multi-generational that's a potentially multi multi generational then then you know be potential acquirers just come it's natural so that's kind of how we kind of how we think about it this build a really successful business and so when we when you look at back at in the last 4050 years there aren't many brands that are able to be multi-generation multi irrational right I mean you look at like head and shoulders they've sure generations upon generations right gillette generations upon generations Pantene there aren't that many brains are able to actually do that you've mentioned all Procter & Gamble brands they're gonna love that but there there's there's there's not that many that actually have the unit economics to be able to to transcend what I mean by that is it's it costs a lot of money it costs a lot of money to build a brand it is really expensive to build a brand and if you are trying to sell a shampoo in which you know at retail and you're trying to build a business that way there's nowhere you have enough margin to actually build a brand right because you don't want to take 20 35 20 30 years to build a brand right sure you what you want to be able to spend 50 million dollars on marketing right or and then grow that to a hundred million dollars on marketing for five years six years right and really have a global brand and then and then then you start harvesting I mean that's that's that's kind of how we see it right you have to spend the money upfront you have to you have to pay your dues right and and build that brand I really understand your audience Bill create amazing products within those five to six seven years and then after that we can smoothly start harvesting so that's kind of how we see building a brand we we believe that with our you tour unit economics because I mean this we recoup the clock on the first time sale so beyond anything else many your portal on first unit sale profit of first unit sale so what able to recycle that cash very very quickly so that's how we've been able to scale so quickly without any institutional funding right so I I think there's not that many companies are able to do that and there's virtually no companies that are able to do that especially that like you know there's companies that are able to do that today get to four or five million dollars in revenue virtually no companies are able to do that at the at 50 million dollars in revenue that's why the aways and all birds of the world have raised capital yeah yeah we're we're very fortunate that we you know we're able to get you know beyond nine figures and yeah in in revenue without institutional capital and and you know to have that kind of unit economic so that allows us so we believe that that really helps us you know be multi-generational looking a grow this thing we're launching internationally so we were early in Australia Canada UK OB all of Europe you know and within the next three to five years be a truly global brand and then it's you know it's all for harvesting but what's really interesting beyond that is the way we think about is we're clearly incremental voice you know there's there's no portfolio company in growing care I would pry the last frontier in male grooming agreed yeah it's it's really amazing when like it's not like you're competing with Gillette you're in the same category and we're a P&G and a quarter of manscaped you would sit within their grooming category likely but like it's not like you're cannibalizing Gillette sales exactly you know we anything we can we can help it right we're went to the incremental to the top-line revenue right and if you look at men's men's hygiene in general it's definitely growing but it's not growing as fast as our category yeah yeah and that not only is it growing like I mean your category is primarily growing because of you I think that like you know people rarely realize that like when native launch into target we grew their deodorant category something like 8 percent or 10 percent the first year and rarely do like you know target hasn't seen that in a really long time the men's you know below the waist grooming category isn't growing quickly and you're riding those coattails you're the reason that it's growing quickly you know we're seeing racism low data with with target also great partner great to be working with them there yeah I'm loved target they just they're just phenomenal partners but we're seeing very similar things with them this is category hasn't been innovated and it's a brand new category you know and you got lucky with the name manscape that we define in the category yeah yeah fantastic name okay one last question because I I put on Twitter I said you know I was interviewing you for a podcast what should I ask you and someone from your own team actually asked me to ask you this and they said have Hulk guess how many gallons of boba tea the manscape team has consumed in total I guess so the reason behind this is my my wife loves boba she just she's addicted to boba so she got the entire company addicted to boba so I would say many many many hundreds of gallons of Bo well okay if you have to give give me a number because I'm the tweeted this guy and be like hey is this right or wrong I would say cuz we ordered over almost every day I gotta be like a hundred and twenty gallons okay no you're it's definitely more than 120 gals it's your boba everyday that's right like 18 ounces there's 70 people on the team probably 40 of them are getting boba no it's gonna be that is it's a great it's a great like line item to have in a budget when you're like doing a P&L and sort of showing it to your board you're like that's how much we're going to spend on boba this Paul this was fantastic really love you know that I really love what you've this conversation I think you've you know aside from one of the things that I've realized about you is that aside from having this incredible vision for the company and sort of understanding where you fit within the CPG space you also have these humble origins and you have like the perspective you you still remember the perspective you had when you launched the business and we're struggling trying to get that right messaging out trying to understand you know how to get production up and like understand what entrepreneurs are going through when there's still much smaller businesses I feel like very few people have that perspective and it's so refreshing to hear because I think that a lot of people who were building to three million four or who are at a two three four million dollar run rate you know don't necessarily want to talk about stuff that I brought up which was like how do you think about budget you go back and you're like look budget is what we think about today the first two years we called audibles of the line every time we went up there and that was really great I love how you mentioned that because it makes me realize that sometimes I've forgotten what it was like to be in the trenches and makes me miss those days so appreciate you sort of bringing that up and having that like you know in the trenches type of mentality that was fantastic oh thank you I really appreciate that I think deep down at heart I'm an entrepreneur and I'll always be an entrepreneur you know we I think it's it's a it's a special breed and I I celebrate all entrepreneurs out there because it it takes guts you know to go out there and to sacrifice every single day to follow your dreams it's not easy couldn't agree more with that takes a ton of guts you know you got to stand up to your family and your friends who are you know and are certainly at my age are like you know lawyers and are making a lot of money and had families you're like you know what I'm gonna put everything on the line so have a ton of respect for those entrepreneurs and have a ton of respect to the business at you too no thank you okay thanks so much Paul this was fantastic really appreciate your time congratulations on all the success super excited you know after all this I also makes me realize how excited I am as an investor and manscaped I feel like when you said all this I'm like Oh fantastic man that's what it's doing really well so thanks again for all the time and for taking my money really appreciate that thank you I'm excited to see what your your next projects gonna be me too I don't know what it'll be hopefully once this Kovach stuff dies down I'll think of something really appreciate it [Music]

and what that means is that you need every company you invest in to be able to get to about 100 million a year in revenue what's up guys Sean here Sam is out so I am doing this episode solo and I'm going to do something a little bit different I'm gonna start by talking a little bit about some of the angel investments I've made you know in our Facebook group I posted something about angel investing and a whole bunch of glad questions and so I thought I would come on the podcast and actually talk a little bit about it what I wanted to learn about angel investing I would only ever read things from the people who had killed it usually over the last 10 years you know somebody like an eland Gil Jason Calacanis talks a lot about angel investing and I would read their stuff and it was sort of like I'm an angel investor I've invested in 100 companies here's the five huge ones that you know about where I've made millions and let me talk to you about what I look for an angel investing now and that was cool but it didn't actually tell me sort of their thought process at the beginning how they decided to do it or how they got started how much money it required all those just the actual tactical questions about doing it I didn't hear a whole lot about that I'm sure somebody has blogged somewhere about it but that's what I want to talk about because that's where I'm at you know when it comes to angel investing I am by no means an expert and I don't mean that just kind of in a you know sometimes you say something and you're like you know but I'm not a financial adviser don't listen to me this is not that because when I say that that means hey I really think this is true but don't sue me this is I'm for real when I say I'm not an expert meaning I'm actually kind of like a beginner I'm just one notch above a total beginner a total beginner hasn't even taken any action yet they don't know then you know which direction they're going they're just lost in the middle of Disneyland so I'm one level above that where I've been on Space Mountain but I you know I just have a map in my hand I'm just trying to figure it out I'm still looking for a hot dog that Disney world analogy went pretty far so anyways point is I'm a beginner I'm learning as I learn I say this stuff out loud so there's me just learning in public and if somebody out there is listening because I know a bunch of people would listen to this there are actual investors who have been doing this for a long time feel free to correct me and say hey you know that thing you said made no sense usually do it this way instead those are my favorite types of messages so feel free to message me if that's the case but all right let's talk about angel investing so my angel investing life started truly about six years ago seven years ago when I first moved to San Francisco so I moved to San Francisco I get a job as a product manager at a and an idea lab called monkey inferno so p.m. kind of a boring job p.m. but not at a boring company this was a very interesting company was a company that builds companies an idea lab and I was the only product manager there was only product guy everybody else is an engineer and I'm making $120,000 a year and so I don't think of myself like an investor right 120k living in San Francisco paying california taxes you're not like rolling and money at all I had a little bit of money saved up from my previous company but again I didn't think of myself in as investors so the first thing was the first lesson of angel investing was think of yourself as an investor because those first three or four years I was in San Francisco I had the opportunity I was doing mastermind dinners I was organizing dinners and my friends were the founders of other companies and you know if I had just stopped working on my company if I had stopped quit my job and all I did was just write 20k checks to all of those friends it might have been I might have needed 250k but I would have turned that into you know at least five million dollars just off the success of those friends companies and I was helping them and I thought a lot of their ideas were good I thought a lot of them would succeed I remember I talked to the founders of calm early on when calm was struggling they couldn't even raise their next round you didn't know what was gonna happen it was just kind of Alex toiling away and I remember thinking hey this guy's like really committed to this and this guy's really creative and I think he's right about the world like I think he's right that a lot of people will want this a lot of people will want to have more calm in their life and I think people more people will meditate and you know there was a obviously it wasn't clear-cut but I would have been on that company and I would have been on six or seven to those companies and then several of them did really well calm now as you know a multi-billion dollar company so out of just that group of friends I think there were probably two or three companies that have reached over five hundred million dollars in valuation and I would have been investing when they were like under five so the lesson I learned four years later was why the hell was i investing these guys companies I believed in them I had access to them I just didn't think of myself in his investor the excuse I gave myself was I didn't have the capital but the real the reality was if you are creative enough if you're resourceful enough if you're persuasive enough if you're determined enough you can get capital you can get any resource you need and so that actually brings me to my first angel investment so the next company I got really excited about fast forward four or five years I'm still don't you know have you know millions of dollars in the bank to go write these checks and I see this company called lambda school and I had been thinking about a product like this or a project like this to go do myself and when I saw it I was like whoa this guy's doing a much better version of what I was thinking might might work what's something I thought about doing so I started calling the guy start talking to him and I told him you know I want to invest in your company which was true not a lie I did one invest in his company but I didn't tell them I've never invested in any company so I definitely withheld that and I said tell me about your company I want to invest and he started sent you know sharing his slide deck sharing the materials and I'm like you know I have to find a way to invest this company I thought to myself okay I need to invest 25k in this company okay no problem I can sell a stock that I own or I could say I could just take some of my savings and do this one company was never gonna be a problem but with angel investing you need a portfolio of companies because you're investing in early-stage startups this is extremely high risk of failure so in a portfolio of 10 companies you would expect some kind of distribution where you're gonna get four or five of the companies to go to zero you know two or three of the companies to return somewhere between 1 and 3x and then hopefully you know you end up with one or two companies that actually break out and do 10x plus ideally you get to something that does a thousand X plus or 10,000 X plus those are that the the early investors in uber for example so anyways I always knew I could invest in one company but I never you need about 30 bets to really be you know an angel investor to have a poor enough of a portfolio where you give yourself a chance to succeed so you know I was sitting there doing the math and I said if I need to invest $25,000 in 30 companies I need $700,000 I didn't have that so that's why I didn't think of myself as a Fester but what I did was very smart I got to give myself credit on this one when I knew I want to invest in lam school I said okay how do I get the money to invest in this and so I talked to a friend and I said who I knew invest and I said hey at this company that I think is really great I want to introduce you to them and in general I see a bunch of companies that are really interesting and I know you like to invest do you want to do a deal where you know I can sort of be a scout I can be a sort of a venture partner and an entrepreneur who can help you with your investments and we can set up a deal so here's what you know the first deal we set up was cool any deal we invest in I get 10% carry meaning I don't have to put any capital in I take zero financial risk and I get 10% of the upside after he's paid back his investment so it's not huge returns right like Sequoia Scouts Sequoia is one of the biggest venture capital firms they had a scout program and they gave 50% to their scouts you know they were extremely extremely generous or 45% something like that so this wasn't that but then again Sequoia didn't pick me they didn't even know who the hell I was so I took what I could get and I realized in order to get in to get companies if you talk to one company they want to they usually want to know what other companies have you invested in and so I knew I needed to start building a portfolio of labels so a bunch of logos that I could point to and say yep I invested in that company I invest in that company and that company you would be in good company if you were with those companies right that's the core idea so I said let me start building this portfolio this guy's willing to put up all the cash I get a piece of the upside let's do it so we wrote the check into lambda school and I'm very grateful to him for you know bankrolling me in that and I think it was a you know fair enough deal and so we invested when it was you know it was still a pretty expensive deal because by the time I organized this the valuation had gone up about 3x so I lost a 3x returned just in the time it took me to to get you know sort of a backer and on the deal if it was just my own money and I could have invested after a first phone call I would have but anyways it's gone up about 10 times in value since then it's that that investment which is illiquid but that's the sort of paper valuation of that company today so that was the first dip in my feet in the water and I said alright that was good and I made a deal with myself which is cool I'm gonna try to invest in about five to ten companies per year this is what I might my goal was I said but you know I think five is the right sweet spot and unless I'm you know if I have free time I'll go to ten a year but I'll do five a year and whether it's my own money or other people's money now I'm thinking of myself in his invent as an investor so that'd be the first thing I would say to you guys is if you ever want to invest if you ever want to be an angel investor and play this extremely high-risk high-reward game of startup investing the the number one advice I would give to you is don't wait till you're rich to do it because at that point you know the financial returns it'll just be a part of a broader portfolio it's not going to be that exciting but if you really want to do this start thinking of yourself as an investor from day one and find ways to access the capital there are ton of people out there with capital myself included who would love for you to be bringing them deal flow and would happily give you carry on any deal that they invest in I remember there was a guy named Suroosh who was a 13 year old kid living in Canada and he used to use our product we built this website called blab it's like kind of this zoom type of product he used to get blab all the time and he was like he came to me and he said hey I want to I remember with what our arrangement was but basically I told him I said you want to learn about this stuff I want you to go scout out three companies a week email me the best one you know the best one that you saw and why you think it would be a good investment why you think would be a bad investment in your kind of overall recommendation and one of those companies now several years later he's I think 20 years old now so seven years later the very first company he sent me is a company called apply board that just raised money at a 1.1 billion dollar valuation he brought that email back up to me emailed me again being like hey why didn't you invest in this thing I told you I gotta know you're 13 I didn't believe you but yet there's a bunch of examples like that where you can bring deals to other people and if they invest you can get karey and you could bring it to multiple people so you don't have to be exclusive with any one person you could say great these five people all agree that if I bring them a great deal they'll give me a slice to the upside great you could you could do that with five five different more established investors in any given time okay enough on that so since then I've invested in about I've looked at that I've looked at about 50 companies I've invested in about four or five and some of the questions that came up when I posted about this were you know first question was how do you approach these companies are they sending stuff to you do you go reach out to them and I told my answer this is if you looked at the quantity I get more coming to me than I reach out to but if you look at quality the best stuff is me going direct to founder or a the maker of a product that I see that I love and just saying hey I'm a big fan of what you're doing like I love this I think this could be really big you know we'd love to chat and potentially invest in the company and then I'd get on a phone call and then I end up investing in their company and so that's one way another way is just a friend sent if now if I have a friend who's doing something my goal would be to be the first check in to him there are exceptions of course my buddy Tyler worked with me at bebo before we got acquired and when we got acquired he didn't want to join us he wanted to go do a start-up I said fantastic what are you gonna do and he said I'm working on this crazy robotic arm you've robotic arm for amputees you know if you have your arm amputated there's this amazing you know I don't even know what you'd call prosthetic yeah it's it's sort of a robotic prosthetic arm that is basically you know as close as you can get back to to what a normal arm would be and I said Tyler that's amazing for the world I won't invest in that because that sounds super hard sounds like it's a ton of risk and I'm just not gonna do it but most of the times I would love to back back my friends and so that's the other way that I get deals okay so now somebody else asked what is the bankroll that you think is required to get started I'll tell you what my answer is my answer is I think you're gonna need to get down 20 or 30 bets so let's take 20 as the low end and I think you want to assume you're gonna invest $25,000 on average into the companies typically you can get away with a little bit less if you need I've invested 10,000 into a company before but 25,000 is sort of the realistic big buy-in that you would take you would do for for a start-up so I take that as the average that means you need half a million bucks but you don't need it all up front so you might invest in those 20 companies over a three to four year time period let's take four years and now you know you need 125 thousand dollars per year to put down the the number I would if you need to make your check size go up or down that's fine if you need to do it over a slightly faster or shorter time or a longer time period that's fine the thing I wouldn't do less of is less total companies so I wouldn't go below 20 bets 20 different companies because at that point you're not letting variants work in your favor in fact AngelList did a study and basically found that the best angel investors or the you know the best returns on average just like in the stock market are essentially by indexing so some individuals can be indexing but not consistently over a long period of time and so the same is true of startups if you could just invest in every credible startup that would be the way to do it credible being a key word here that is hard to define but whatever we don't need to go into it okay somebody else asked what do you look for when you when you talk to the founders you know how do you make your decision if you're gonna if you're gonna make the investment or not so here's what I said I said you know there's a million intangible signals that you're thinking about and going over but really you know it boils down to the following does this person know what the hell they're talking about when I talk to them do I get this sense of confidence and certainty that's not about the style of the speed of speech but that the things they're saying actually makes sense and when you push and probe a little bit you can tell that they've already thought through those things they have a thoughtful answer about it and they know more about the subject they don't but they know it's so much about the subject which is what you should expect from somebody who's building a company in a space the next thing I think about is are they an executor or just a talker of course you want an executor are they all in on this or are they doing this as a side project do they have a habit of quitting projects or habit of splitting focus like you know I don't want somebody I invest in to go have a podcast and go speak at conferences and do all this other I mean some people get caught up in that and there's a reason I started this podcast after I sold my company not during the last thing I really think about is are they in touch with reality or they a delusional optimist with what I mean by that is do they actually understand the main risk and challenge of their business so like have they correctly identified what the big challenge is to make their their vision come true and are they thinking about you know do they have they appropriately assess that risk there's a lot of people who don't have what I call credible view of reality they're out of touch with reality you know you bring something up that's a risk they they just don't think it's a risk and I think that's that can be a very very big problem and so you know the overwhelming feeling I get when I walk away from those conversations is either wow this person had a lot of clarity and quality of thought about their business or they don't and I basically just don't invest if they don't have clarity or quality of thinking around their business you know the other thing that I sort of think about is you know what have you done in your past so a track record of doing interesting and unique stuff does tend to carry forward throughout your life and so sometimes somebody has zero experience in a given domain but I look at their background and they also went into other things with zero experience and came out six months later as a winner as it being a leader in a space and so I think that looking at somebody's track record for success is obviously a good sign just because they don't have it doesn't mean it's it's a bad it doesn't mean you know you eliminate them but it is obviously a huge huge factor if you can do it and the other thing is you know the question I got no this will be the last thing on angel investing is what are the type of returns you're looking for some people think and Sam often talks about like he loves great businesses that are like the hustle so this is actually a good example so when Sam started the hustle I had an opportunity to invest Kassam was a friend and at that point I had learned invest in your friends think of yourself as an investor but I went to the hustles office which was just like you know tiny rinky-dink place and they sat me down they walked me through the vision and I thought to myself this is totally gonna work and I totally don't want to invest am I thinking was I don't think this type of business will generate the type of returns I'm looking for so what do I mean by that angel investing works best when you put small checks into many companies and you're not looking for what the sort of median return is but you're looking for what the maximum return is you basically need two or three winners in your portfolio to make everything else a rounding error and what that means is that you need every company you invest in to be able to get to about 100 million a year in revenue 100 million a year in revenue is a hot there's a billion dollar company and this isn't about greed it's about the risk and reward profile the risk is so high that you need winners to pay off so so well to justify the risk that you're taking because you're taking both you're taking risk and in liquidity right a startup that you invest in is probably not gonna be liquid for seven to ten years and so if you have an illiquid if you have an illiquid investment that's extremely high risk you need the payoff to be huge to make up for those two downsides I'll give you an example with lambda school I realized pretty quickly I was like okay so it sounds like the average student is worth what you know $25,000 for you okay so you need four thousand students in a in a year to generate you about a hundred million dollars okay four thousand students I believe you can get there that's not a crazy number that's not four hundred thousand so there's not four million students four hundred thousand I think for hunt for thousand students will take you up on this offer at the time that I invested I think lambda school at that time had graduated maybe 81 people total you know there wasn't 81 wasn't four thousand but it was clear to me that four thousand was an achievable number and that four thousand would get them to the point where they're somewhere between 15 million dollar revenue business depending on what the value per student was was going to end up being and so that was believable and that that alone was enough justification to say write the check in addition to Austin's an incredible founder he spoke very clearly about what he was doing there was clearly evidence that their approach was different than other people's approach and might get a different result than what other people other companies in the space had gotten for example most of the coding boot camps were in person and lame to school was online most of the coding boot camps were in a very short period to read it three months and lame the school was like a nine month program and what ended up happening was that most online learning things had like a 95% dropout rate people did not complete the course and lambda school had like I don't know what the exact numbers were but eighty to ninety percent of people finished the program and eighty to ninety percent of them got jobs a high-paying jobs and so I was like whoa they've you know those are amazing signals and I believe that they can get to 4,000 students I believe they can give that experience to 4,000 students which would get them into a hundred million dollar a year range so that's what type of returns you look for and so I assume that in a batch of 30 companies three of them will drive 95 to 99 percent of all the returns I hope that in the end this Nets out into you know I put in let's call it five hundred thousand and I I basically quadrupled to 5x my money over the seven-year period and so you know five hundred thousand in and let's say at five exit that's 2.5 million out and you know this is not like the biggest craziest life change ever but there's a chance it's much more if you hit one of the real winners then you know I've seen a $25,000 check turn into twenty five million that can happen but you you know I would say the average or they sort of expected return of what I would call the minimum bar of success is to four or five X my money over a seven-year period which Nets out I think to like I don't know like a twenty percent IRR or something like that the last thing I would say is the reason to do angel investing is not to make money and I don't mean that in a kind of philosophical way what I mean by that is there's much better ways to make money there's ways where your money is liquid there's ways where you have a greater chance of greater certainty of success but I do think angel investing gives you one thing it gives you a front-row seat on the future and in a way that only owning like Boeing stock is never going to do for you you know you can go own Apple and you can go make 10% a year return guaranteed and it could be liquid not guaranteed but you know I mean good chance of success compared to startup investing but startup investing will teach you a lot about business it'll teach you a lot about people because every decision is a judgment call about a person and the last thing is it'll teach you a lot about the future as you see what different startups are doing each one of them is pitching you a thesis about how the future is different than the present and I really value that education and I think it's a much better way to get an education I'm getting an education from an expert who is somebody who has seen the future and it's coming to me and telling me what it's going to be I'm gonna get to sit alongside every month and get their updates about how it's coming and the last thing is I've skin in the game so I have money invested in it if I'm correct and they're correct about what the future looks like we get paid if I'm not we get we lose money and that's a great way to learn that's a great feedback loop for learning so that's everything about angel investing that I've I don't know learned or would want to share with you guys that went a lot longer than I thought if you like that we can do another session on that you know later just ping me I'm gonna put my Twitter in my my email in the show notes and get in touch that's the best way for me to know what you like what you don't like thank you for listening to the podcast as always okay I'm out of here thank you very much [Music] [Applause] you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Music] okay we're here on the fifth episode of the podcast with Nick Sharma Nick and I have been friends for about a year Nick I'm gonna tell everyone a little bit about your background you ran acquisition order you put an investor and a bunch of direct-to-consumer of businesses including Juby including house which is an alcohol company and some other ones that I was looking at on your LinkedIn profile yesterday will you tell people a little bit about like the companies that you've invested in yeah let's see GD house black wolf nation bright land there honestly mostly just D to see companies that I'm like a fan of first and then fan enough to want to be involved in a deeper level and which one look are you involved in all of them on a deeper level or are you involved in all of them in like um I would say like pretty much yeah I would say I definitely work on stuff like every week for each portfolio company like I help them out in some way every week for sure okay great I mean exact look what what's something that you did for like Judy this week for Judy well today actually pretty happy I just finished a domain migration so I ended up getting Judy dotco as a domain and I just said it like literally ten minutes ago I was like our new primary domain that was exciting yeah did you by Judy Co lucky had to buy it off somebody or it was yeah it was a five-figure Dublin give me five to five figures is to wider like ten thousand dollars or ninety nine thousand dollars which one is it's it's closer to ten there's a lot of Nagar I'm pretty good at negotiating these domains so I did the same thing at him where our first offer for hint Co was like fifty and it ended up at six you guys bought him taco for 6k yeah Wow yeah so I'm just all about like especially if it's a four-letter brand like that hit the first thing I did was get hint Co at dun Instagram hint on snapchat hint on Twitter and on Facebook and it was just great for brand and I mean you did the same thing with Native and then with Judy I'm trying to do it as much as I can you know Judy's a little harder because it's a person's name yeah the hard part is that you have to like sometimes steal the like Instagram handle from a squatter I really and that's like yeah I didn't even know that it's happening I just reached out to our Facebook folks and I was like hey could we get the native like yeah there you go and I'm like okay great that was a lot of media expected we actually never try do you think domain names are important like I think Instagram handle is really important I think Twitter handles yeah never did that well with Twitter but do you think domain name is because like so much of the traffic that is driving to your site now is like being searched for on Google or being found on social and totally yeah google.com yeah I don't think it's like as important but from a sorry is that really noisy in the background no go for it so I don't yeah I think it's it's definitely important to some extent like you want a good domain I think where some brands get carried away is when they try and put a verb in front of their brand and then it gets too long like like hint is drinking calm it's usually like food and Bev's or like fitness related things but um yeah I mean I I like things that are just nice sort and clean and so I was really proud to get Judy calm but then like other things like for bright land I'm working on a landing page and for house like you know things like connecting them with PostScript and Alex getting them set up there but yeah it's like it's usually anywhere I try to be proactive about like if I see them trying to do something or do something then I just try to think like what's something easy I can do to help them out yeah it makes a ton of sense yeah you know uh like what comes like brand names when we were trying to like you know before were native launched you know I was like okay I want to start this deodorant business what's a good brand name for it and so went through a bunch of ideas and I was like okay I want something liked it uh now heads a nod towards natural but it doesn't say like it isn't like called natural and it's then called something like deodorant club or deodorant company yeah I want to be able to sell other products and when we came up with the term native I remember a bunch of people were like this is a bad name doesn't mean anything and a lot of Native Americans are gonna get upset yeah Native Americans getting upset happened kind of people got upset about it is that the first thing but we never tried to buy like Native calm yeah but we did have a huge issue with a trademark I think I've mentioned this to you before like we tried to we tried to use the native trademark and somebody else owned it yeah to like sort of we had to acquire that trademark and we bought the trademark like five days before we ended up selling the business to Proctor and Gamble like that was the desease saying wow wow wow other people other people would be like we're not gonna we're not gonna give you an offer for your business until you own your trademark yeah I really think what have like pngs advantages was they were like look we're ready to move forward in the acquisition process with the contingency that you buy the mark before we close but we're not energy do like an arm and a leg for that yeah it was yeah high six bigger price well so what's crazy is like you know comparing that to a domain like like you had to get that cuz that's the only way that your deal would have gone through whereas a domain you don't necessarily need it but I'm just as you were saying that this thing popped in my head that Soylent was I think it was like drink Soylent and they bought Soylent comm off this dude who used it to like he was into some weird [ __ ] and he would promote some stuff on that site but they bought the domain off of them for like a 100k Wow and today I think they've like raised 80 million dollars so I think you've raised a dime I don't know what a hundred thousand thousand dollars yeah yeah that is crazy we never look we never tried to buy native calm and our domain name was native cos calm and yeah it would be like what is the COS is it cosmetics is it companies what is it yeah it's like I have no idea I don't know yeah for the longest time on Twitter I never found native because it's a native underscore cos it's so bad yeah we tried to get Twitter to do what we had Instagram do or that's the native job well I told you the guy who had the Instagram also has the Twitter he's down okay I'm glad that you've like got to keep one of them then yeah all right we'd love to talk about like what's going on in like that like not just the businesses that you're invested in I know you said like Judy is sort of crushing a great time to launch beautiful branding actually can we talk a little bit more about Judy like yeah Judy sells like a disaster kit for your hounds which is like I mean it's good timing because you know people are now staying at home and realized that disasters may happen look other people that are involved in the Judy business because you've told me about this I I sort of understand it but I don't really understand all the relationships yes so Judy is interesting because of two things one it's like a really sound business the the product is is basically a very functional product and it's something that like provides immediate value to the consumer so it's a very functional and necessary product which we love as immigrants ya know it makes a ton of sense look I want a disaster kit for my parents is everyone for myself as well so look you don't need to sell me on the business any longer I am yes so the other reason that's really interesting is because of the team that's involved so you know the core team was probably five people it was myself it was our ops person who's just a G with ops a head of customer service and then the two founders Josh who - ken is a former fan of Rayden then Simon Hawk who is the founder of command PR for command Entertainment Group but he also happens to be a celebrity of his own being so closely friends with Kim Kardashian and so and he's also knows like the a-list world like the back of his hand so yeah it makes it it made a really interesting for lunch because on launch day I was learning all about a list celebrities through Judy you know there was like every every celebrity is posted a Judy from Chrissy Teigen to Martha Stewart Kim Kardashian to like literally everybody and is that just because like is that because Steve Huck I guess sort of got all these people to post about it how did that sort of happen yeah honestly Simon I think just has like he's a very loved guy in the industry and in his in his network and I think when people saw that he was launching something that you know he developed this brand because he saw that so many of his own family members were affected by disasters yeah and so I think when they saw that he was basically launching his brand and it was a real thing they all just wanted to support like none of them it's weird because none of the the influencer posts I've ever felt like ads none of them are like go buy this now it's like it's all congratulating Simon or just talking about how handy they're Judy kids are yeah well that's great like I'm trying to get that word Anika trying to get that organic like influence but reach isn't it's really really difficult to get down right yeah yeah they did a really good job and like Josh who's the other founder is the president of Ramona so he he's just a beast of an operator and so making sure like especially on things like logistics and supply chain she's arcing marketing like he's he's a genius is he related to like the founder of LVMH I thought the president of Rimowa was like the guy's son or something like Bernard no I think he's related to them I have heard that name come up maybe maybe Josh replaced them or he like took a different role in the company yeah sure okay let's move on to like what's going on the direct consumer industry yeah because I feel like um you know you're you're in touch with a ton of different brands and they're certainly like a perfect storm brewing right now I think there was all of a sudden people were worried about profitability and not just like top-line growth and so like when Brandis sort of shut down its operations when outdoor voices had whatever issues that it recently had people realized that bottom line really mattered and then all of a sudden like you know the stock market is collapsing and so investors are gonna be a lot more cautious when it comes to writing checks and then finally no one's going outside because you know cope it's cause it's in the stock market to collapse and you know all of a sudden the pair of Nike shoes that you ordinarily wear when you were running outside don't really seem necessarily any longer right what look would you know do you think that the bottom line mattering or a kovat is it sort of having a larger impact or is it just impossible to tell right it is kind of impossible to tell because you know we're kind of in this like sheltered or hibernation stage right now where we haven't like fully accepted that okay this is the reality and figured out the adjustments around that we're all kind of in this like like I'm sure you said that New York Times article around how people are just like turning to junk food I know just from portfolio companies and chatting around that like cookware is doing really well beauty's type of stuff isn't doing as well like anything really related to going out but anything that promotes happiness or calmness or wellness while you're staying in has just been crushing everything from like fitness fitness gear and jump ropes and and bands all the way to like adapt the gin drinks are crushing you know cookware I said is doing well it's it's kind of weird though but it will be interesting to see like when when all this stuff does settle down what how will people adjust and what will people start to realize as their priorities you know I don't think people are going to be rushing to spend a hundred dollars to get you know face wash customized to their zip code anymore yeah like it should things things the perspective of money will definitely change yeah it's crazy how fast that happens you know took like ten years old I feel really blessed and their wallets to feel fat and then to feel like hey I want to spend money making myself happy - all of a sudden yeah like this seems like a crazy luxury to have a customized face wash yeah right I mean if you think about like that's literally a way right it's like you used to have like a $25 Target suitcase or you have like a $5,000 you know Saks Fifth Avenue set yeah and then away kind of came in and found that like high earners but not rich yeah Henry playground the Henry playground yeah and then but I mean they just they just had to let go of like 60% of their staff the worst part of the people who get affected who you know just don't know how they're gonna pay rent in two months yeah I guess look um what's a good stuff that I mean covert is obviously a complete catastrophe for the country yeah like that's heartbreaking and like you know I think about it like I think a couple days ago I saw that there were nearly to tell 2,000 deaths in the United States on a single day and I was like this is two-thirds of a 911 on a single day and it's gonna happen again and tomorrow it's really heartbreaking you know you were talking about some businesses that sort of makes or that are doing well as they're like you know just by virtue of the fact that people have to stay in cookware companies Fitness fans and you're right like I've tried to order fitness products and the weight is like a month or now yeah I waited to get a job broke yeah it's crazy do you think that that acceleration is permanent so for instance if you if you have an order from instacart before and now you do do you get off of instacart are people gonna be like yeah I want a tunnel or a mirror I want to keep this like you know totals and mirrors are thousands of dollars and they have $50 a month like subscription fees or something to that effect they're incredibly expensive but is this now the new reality is Equinox sort of like in trouble or six months from now are these direct to consumer businesses back to where they were and equinoxes back to what it was um well I think there's two parts to that one is do do people like will people trust going out and going into a public gym again I think that like that to me is mind boggling but the second part is like you know how much how much do they value getting that like Palatine bike or soul cycle bike for their house and whether or not they will I think they I mean they've definitely seen sales just jump and for them their whole game is you know if they get a product in your house then they can't get have you with the subscription for quite some time yeah and what happens to the other company like a way Travel had to lay off a bunch of their staff ever Lane has as well you know a lot of companies have just as a result of the fact that sales were down and you can't yeah you know it's it's a terrible thing to have to do but at the same time if the entire business goes bankrupt there's nobody that can work there right and so it's a decision but probably the right decision what happens to these businesses in the future do they have down rounds do they go out of business ultimately to like you know what happens to a way I guess in six months or a year it was it was probably like the darling of the DTC community right like a huge valuation to female entrepreneurs who were I thought doing a fantastic job like really admire both of them and I know look you know I'd love to talk a little bit more about the press related to stuff Cordy and stuff later on but you know what like what happens to this a company that was doing everything right for so long you know investing in a brand you go to the airport and a ton of people are carrying their away bags what happens that brand a year from now yeah it's tough to say yeah it's so scary to immediate things that come to and as one is private equity and then the other is it just gets acquired by like you know one of the big big luggage companies and and they either like acquire it and roll in capabilities or they basically just keep the brand going but support the piano much better yeah it's really tough to say I imagine there's gonna be like down rounds for a bunch of these businesses and like you know aside from the founders who I you know have a lot of empathy for because they built an amazing business and like something terrible happened there was a completely outside their control and hurt their business also a lot of empathy for this employees that work there and you know had bought into that stock or exercise their options and now all of a sudden they're in a lot of trouble and it's not their way right it's an Airbnb and a ton of dodo pennies it sort of we're headed in the right trajectory and then all of a sudden or no longer you gonna do that yeah we'd love to touch base a little bit about well actually before we get there look do you think that like do you think there's opportunities to buy distressed direct-to-consumer businesses so like away travels obviously gonna be super expensive business but look what happened like how do people sell buy and sell these distressed businesses to be honest I'm not a hundred percent sure I've definitely been doing a little more research just because I've gotten curious recently about it yeah but and I've been talking to like like Mike for example who's our friend Nick Greylock but yeah I mean I'm just trying to learn about it as well it's it's like a completely new world for me I never thought that that I you know that all this would happen have you ever had to learn it before yeah okay let's talk a little bit about like you know not just Co vid but like let's talk a little bit about like what happened at outdoor voices and the press o is related to two-way travel you know like I've seen a lot of like articles sort of saying are there hit jobs going on on female against female entrepreneurs yeah I have no idea what the answer is to that like at native we barely got any press when we were independent I've never been a woman so I have no idea as to whether people are doing that certainly seems like something is happening but there are a lot of terrible or male run businesses that don't seem to be getting as much yeah totally I'm not sure why that's the case but you know I'd love to like you know III think outdoor voices and Steph Curry are very different businesses like the away travel you know certainly there were things that like Steph said that weren't great but I think if you look at anyone's like if you look at the slack history I had it native you know people would put me in prison I I was like saying terrible thing like if people [ __ ] up I was like how could you possibly [ __ ] up like this you [ __ ] you know like look that's you know it's a very intense process and yeah like you know all of your energy is being you know put on something so - yeah look geez like what did you think of the away travel one I thought it was really unfair I was like she's got she called like some third-party logistics company brain-dead and as like they probably are bad happens all the time this term I could think of a hundred percent I mean I've empathy on both sides I think as an employee you know if you're not used to that kind of environment of like the hyper growth startup or you know like that like I feel like a lot of a lot of the really successful brands or even companies that sell products like they have a very intense marketing or or customer success organization and it's because and like that's why they're so good is because they're so critical about their marketing their sales and their onboarding and so I think some people are definitely like not made for that I also think you know you probably don't want to be yelling at employees on public channels or private channels but again I mean that's a to you as like a founder if you do that like that's up to you I've definitely done it before so um and you know like you said if you're if you're a founder and and you know like I always try and have empathy for the other person so if like if I was your employee and you were like how the [ __ ] could you [ __ ] this up I'm not gonna get mad thinking o Moses mad at me I'm thinking he's right he has to deal with like you know this company that's trying to acquire him and he's probably dealing with fifteen other things me not doing my job put something else on his plate so like that's how I would do it and that's how I have these things and I was at the last couple companies I was at so all that said I mean those messages were like nothing that I've never gotten before there were nothing I've never said before in fact they're like soon yeah I was like Joe exotic when I was running native and like everyone else was a Carroll basket yeah I think like you know if you're gonna do it you own it and you know you also obviously make sure that your employees are not you know pissed off that they're working for you like sure you know there's good times and bad times and I think that's natural but yeah I mean I think the thing on the press too is like you know female founded companies are just numbers wise you know could be considered anomalies and so I think because of that the ones that that you know like it started way earlier when it was the ones that go through the red antlers or the gin lanes and they come out you know there's like a press tour it's like it's it's a very normal thing where like you know brands is launched and there's a whole press tour between you know everybody's goal is to get into the New York Times with a quote so they can throw that on their site that said I think the press you know good or bad will follow you throughout because people are just intrigued by the story and the hook is so much different than what people are normally used to I guess that that would be my like really zoomed out politically correct just like off-the-cuff thinking yeah I guess it's two things about that one is the other thing I thought about from like their way conversations that got leaked was you know they have a real commitment to customer service that's really incredible you know when they were late sending packages that's all like okay how about we send this person ten suitcases or a hundred suitcases to make up for it like that isn't that's what we want from customer that's what we want from customer service with direct-to-consumer businesses companies that have a total empathy and do the right thing when something gets when something wrong happens and so I really admired yeah the other thing from a press perspective like we you know look at native I was trying to court the press early on and all like you know see peach like all product process like I want to talk about native to yogurt and not the success of the business and what happened was that we couldn't get anybody did it like write about us and then one day we're like randomly we've created a rose a deodorant and we accidentally we launched it June 21st it wasn't even our goal like we we didn't realize that it was the first day of summer although was the first day of summer lounge dead and all of a sudden all these press institution picked up the product which we never thought would happen yeah but like we were on Good Morning America the Today Show you know info in refinery29 probably like 30 or 50 populations in the course of 24 hours and I was like great like this is it you know and in reality like I tracked the customer I tracked our revenue from that day and like all of those publications got us an extra twenty five thousand dollars in revenue and on that day Facebook got us like 50,000 dollars it was like we were like we we were like in a mini viral sensation certainly like nobody remembers it like it was in a lot of publications and got $25,000 it's totally well I mean what is the why do people cordon press like this then yeah well I think it's like you know it serves it serves both parties right because like you get pickup and it's it's good exposure and then for a lot of these outlets they just plug into your affiliate platform and if they can be contextual really relevant for what consumers are thinking which is you know jumping in these first day of summer articles and listicles then they're gonna try and make revenue off of it it's actually a good strategy for for when you try and launch stuff if you can be super and contextually relevant to as many people as possible which everybody can enjoy the first day of summer then you just increase your chances of getting picked up and things like that another example of something like that like I'm fair with Judy it like what did it happen with Judy look give me another example cuz I have a tough time yeah so you know with Judy like not speaking as a as a member of Judy but more is like an outsider you know when Judy launched there were like every Kardashian was posting about their Judy kit and and then Chrissy Teigan had posted it as well and all of a sudden there was an angle of like the Kardashians are promoting this emergency kit what is it and so that became a pro se angle there was another People magazine article which did really well that was something around like what this new emergency kit the Kardashians and and Chrissy Teigen are promoting and so it's almost just like like just making sparks and one in and the fire happens on the other that make sense yeah but that said that one's a little bit different than like the Rose a but similar in the sense that you you you can there are ways to plan things like press a lot of people tend to think that you just cold email reporters asking I talk about your product and then they'll magically like pick it up one day but the real work comes in like figuring out the reason for them to write about it or creating that angle yeah because they're also in cement as a publication like they're incentivized by Admiral Avenue you make ad revenue buy more page views you get more page views by having going yeah it's like a weird weird loop yeah you definitely have to be look you can't just be like here's this product please write about it you have to say yes why I think it's interesting to the readers that you have I remember when my first e-commerce business I've constantly like look for people who have written about something else in the space and then sort of be like hey here's something nice doctor so we're it was a business itself alcohol online and so this TechCrunch reporter wrote about a distillery in New York City for some reason and I was like well that's not very tech crunchy but if you're really right about that maybe you're really right about us because we know that distillery and the number one seller of their products and so he's like okay great let me write about you guys so he wrote about us and then like Bloomberg picked us up and so did like CNBC or something like it was just random but like a cup of the kind and it's like flywheel effect that one single publication that can have and so yeah look you gotta beYOU have to be persistent but you're right those angles are really important yeah if you yeah if you can nail one of those anchors as like a you know whether it's an exclusive or or they pick it up first then the others will definitely make a move to try and cover it just because you know if it's coming from like a TechCrunch or Bloomberg then they probably assume people are going to be searching for it yeah did you guys hire a PR agent already at Judy or how are you guys doing that you guys not need one because you guys have all these influencers yeah they use no they use an agency gotcha yeah yeah when we were like running native I tried to get an agency and we ultimately settled on one but like before that I called up like the guys that are sort of doing a lot of direct consumer electic ensue more people work in New York and they were like yeah we charge twenty-five thousand dollars a month plus one like [ __ ] crazy that's I don't know came from there's a one percent equity ask and I was like you don't know anything about my business and you want one percent of it Allah I like the all birds and you to be asking for one percent of it or I could be a brand that does you know ten thousand dollars a year and you won't want but those are two completely different like one is worth more than ten million dollars and the other is probably worth the dollar sorry how could you just ask for one percent equity without knowing anything else that's insane have you ever have you seen people like do that kind of stuff Oh totally well the branding agents um branding agencies do it and still do it I haven't seen it from PR I know there's a couple firms in New York that'll do like that that will do like growth marketing and they'll also take some equity yeah but it's it's I don't know I think that concepts kind of weird to like it's it's almost like exchanging currency and I think your currencies just have to be you know say yeah that's why we use like confusion yeah you shouldn't [ __ ] with changing equity for services and it just gets really messy also signing with somebody and he was saying that when you get to like let's say you know you're early and you're like a like a native for example yeah and you you go off if you didn't get acquired and you started raising like like round C and D like those investors start looking at your cap table thinking why the [ __ ] does this branding agency have 2% of the company like just knock them off and so they'll just end up getting screwed later oh that's interesting yeah I didn't realize the people who do that I mean from like a branding agency perspective I'm a little bit more amenable to it because presumably your business is just started when you work with that branding agency that's your about that but you know it's worth noting and you might not have a ton of cash I was just surprised as like this buck you know that point needed was probably doing you know 2 million 3 million dollars a month and this person said if we want 1% of your company and I was like do you want one like this company could be doing 3 million a month or it could be doing 30,000 a month you don't know yeah just me right that's insane yeah I would look you know I wish that somebody put together like a Yelp vendors that e-commerce come to use yeah I know there's honestly like that's that's one of the things I get asked the most is like who or who's the best you know I always get like what's a what's a great paid media agency and really where people go wrong is is one they they just read stuff on the internet and they you know like agencies are all marketing themselves so they'll all show themselves the best and so so one mistake is going by that the second mistake is thinking oh you know like this agency looks sick I want to work with them and I made that mistake at hint where I thought an agency which is a sick they didn't see they they were just they did good work and so but the problem was you realize that like certain agencies are built for businesses at different stages and so you know we were too we were too small for that agency to really care but now I've kind of narrowed it down to like you know if you're like if you're under 200k there's different person if you're between like 300 I don't know a million two million it's a different stage and like you know two million plus is a different stage yeah that's a great point San Jose are like PR and you know everything email PR like all your services affiliate to they're all different at different stages yeah you don't want to be like the smallest fish in a ginormous pond look you don't want to work on your agency that is also working with like Nike and exactly because you're never their priority yeah exactly it is interesting like you know at native what happened is the first year first like six months of the business we lost our contract meant like the person who was making our product it was like I'm making this and so we had to find another company and like the other company that we were working with what's like this you know I think you doing them at this point it's 800 ever were gonna have an 800 square foot facility that yeah or something tiny and like it was perfect for us because when we call them up we're like hey we wanted to order a thousand units a week and they're like that's fine that's like you know a very good quest for us other people we spoke to they're like you need to order a hundred thousand units out of gate now it's like you can't even afford that so this and will you share what your cogs were when we launched when we launched the business of first $5.50 to make a stick a nativity ever and so were so high of 715 and we were song for 12 yeah Facebook we were profitable with Facebook which is crazy nice but it's the same in 2015 our CAC was like two dollars in 2016 is four dollars yeah by the end of 2016 we're doing a million dollars a month so there was a ton of even doubt that the business was generating but like there's the cogs went down a ton so one for like 552 that that original manufacturer we switched and it became like 320 and every time we've grew they brought the cost down we went from like making a thousand units of G over in a week in at the end of 2015 or the beginning of 2016 by the you know middle of 2017 we were making 21,000 units a day and so we had just increased sales by like you know I don't know 20 times 500 like you know 100 max basically and and so our cost came down to below two dollars like substantially below two dollars and look you know what was amazing is we found a manufacturer that was really able to grow with us they moved from like this 800 square foot facility to a 20,000 square foot facility now 40,000 square foot facility rarely do you find service providers that grow with you usually you go to a service provider and you outgrow them and they don't make the infrastructure changes that they need and then you gotta go find somebody new totally totally did you ever consider you know like especially when you were doing let's say 5,000 deodorants a day did you ever consider like oh I why don't why don't I just buy the facility to do it and buy the raw ingredients yeah certainly did not - seriously though like you know we were like the business was growing exponentially and like if you could work 80 hours a week just on the business without touching a single through the back end and I became really difficult like it didn't have the view it was just like it was also peace of mind that it was like being taken care of yeah and the simplicity like when we were like you know I sold the business there were eight employees at the manufacturing facility I think they're 140 and at the shipment facility there were like another hundred people and so you know there were eight employees and we had created something like 250 jobs but I only have to manage eight employees and I think one of the things I realized working at native was I like one of my weaknesses is like managing employees it's something I'm trying to work on and like giving me structure and goals and communicating with them well and yeah and like I was like I can barely do that with eight people sitting here if there were 250 I put bullet in my head right like maybe more than me actually yeah and the person who was making it was just fantastic at it like had very few problems she worked really hard to make them well and so that was really give me a lot of peace of mind that's awesome what of like other would or other like agents you know you talked about postcards which I think it's fantastic when it comes to text messaging though it's like the claim in text messaging I really I'm not sure if you've ever dealt with like ship monk they're based in like Miami they do their faith but you introduced me to them they're like of the only three people I've ever met that is run by a young person that's in the 21st century look there ya have really good tech what are some of the other agencies that you recommend to people or some of the other companies they so like most media buying I recommend metric digital they're just like their bread and butters is dtc brands especially if you have like a retail presence they're really good at that let's see texting SMS email probably Clay vo if you're an influencer for texting huge community is that what you use yeah okay yeah let's see landing pages is building on metal if I Commerce you Shopify although you're not really a shut your you'd rather sad yeah which is crazy because like WooCommerce is you know when I used to use it as look I'm so embarrassed telling people that I use it and now I haven't used Shopify and look you idiot it's you guys are like now embarrass the Shopify Shopify is great but it offered you know our conversion rate went down by like a significant material amount once we switch from moody Shopify yeah because my checkout page I thought that like Shopify would be better than it is like I thought chocolate like would have all these network effects and yeah it really doesn't have those it's checkout page is terrible like it's a multi-step checkout page the coupon code box doesn't appear on the car page but it does business is at this point it's only on the checkout page you can't control the server like you know that native I actually bought a bunch of servers like we didn't use AWS for a long time I actually bought some servers and prim up and like you know server farms and our site blazing fast and it should outlaw you can't do that and then we used like you know we use our subscription portal which was that like you know which was a lot cheaper than recharge which is what shot which is what native these is today like like it was free actually and how does recharge charge you they charge a percentage of your subscription sales what a beautiful business yeah I mean look you know what we went from thousands of dollars a month yeah it was crazy yeah look my next business will be on goo Commerce again and next time I will not have any shame whatsoever no no it is commerce you're like you know like someone that's told mark or someone asked Margaret Thatcher like how do you like how can you have the position that you have when there's 80 people that disagree with you like how does that make you feel she's like I feel bad for the 80 people because I'm right and they're wrong that's now how you feel about what commerce yes yeah the hardest part was just like to develop our community it still needed some more like there should be about well there's it that's my biggest tough thing is finding really good developers on Shopify like I have one who I just have on retainer for myself like just for myself I have a Shopify developer who's on my payroll and anything I need done I can hit him up and it's just it's so necessary because yeah a lot of times too you know like Shopify agencies that are on retainers for some of these brands they're also sometimes not the best developers and and then you know you can't necessarily rely on just internal developer teams either for me I like having my own like set of tools yeah yeah especially ones that you understand and yeah and I think it's like it's really hard like you know you're working on a bunch of different businesses at the same time and it's really hard to say okay these guys use Unbounce this guy uses something else this this company a party for a landing page and now you're like I have to like learn all these systems yeah it's really difficult to do all that yeah it is actually sorry god no no God okay what are other industry like you know directly yeah when we launched native dealer when I watched native I was thinking about doing native or another mattress company and I'm not entirely sure that I think the mattress company could have been even better like it seems like everyone who makes mattress company has hundreds of millions of dollars in sales in industry but you know hindsight is 20/20 and like no one was really doing deodorant at the time and today there's like you know they're so like they're not annoying I'm just like look this is a three billion dollar a year industry the two biggest players you know Unilever in Procter & Gamble Oh have made acquisitions in this space you know we're we're digitally savvy we have a huge first mover advantage we have a good price point a good brand where do you look how much of the business are you looking to acquire if you're looking to build a 10 million dollar a year business I get it you're looking to build a 200 million dollar a year business you know that's seven percent of the market that's gonna be really difficult to do other industries that are untapped today but where should people be lucky you know do you like what's a good example like when qyp came out I was like wow this is great guys are doing a great job with brand no one's touching electric toothbrush great industry to be in what are other businesses that like need revolution like somewhere hard so I think like diapers is a great business it's really odd because to make diapers it's really expensive you need a lot of inventory you need a lot of different sizes and there's very few companies that can private label diapers you need like a very expensive paper machine in order to make a diaper yeah to be honest I'm not 100% sure what like the most ripe would be just from observations though I think pet is one that like hasn't really been done from a product side there's a lot of food brands that are getting out there but not necessarily product wise I still think there's just like I think there's a lot on the side of convenience and accessibility even some of these brands that have come out with stuff just making things even simpler so I think that's one area I don't know the other day I was thinking of direct-to-consumer sauces there's no sauce come there's no like deep you see buffalo sauce or like dressings but I have yeah their stuff is good yeah probably the closest to that what are some do direct-to-consumer friends you really admire right now um dude wipes is one of my favorite dude wipes is one of my favorite because I think they have like some of just the funniest content dude was like the one way of Charlie from Dollar Shave yeah okay and it's um they they were on Shark Tank years ago and like they they're really good operators and so because they're really good operators all they've done is just build brand and like the coolest toys possible so like their emails are just the best other brands I admire how rare is appalling for you like look forward to an email from a direct-to-consumer company like all the emails looks so rare so promotions Ted I'm just like I hate like I don't look at any of this kind of yeah highlight all in archive yeah I usually look through and see if there's any like cool new templates or cool things that people are doing with their audience but yeah aside from like you know like I signed up for qui B and so like I've been checking out some of their emails but nothing's really that great but honestly lately it's just been full of sales everybody's just trying to liquidate yeah all right so I'm sorry but I interrupted you because I think you had a couple other friends you said you were gonna admire that you admired oh yeah a couple other brands you know I think what house is doing is pretty awesome because they're very like they're they're super they're other manufacturing is done literally on their farm and they have all the bottles as like inventory to fill and Hellena is just a great brand marketer and so she's really good at just pivoting and and making things pop which is insane so that one's really exciting for me to watch and also learn from and then you know on the I usually have like a couple faves I like on the brand side and then a couple of Fame's on the performance side not necessarily their good friend but they just crush with performance they've great landing pages great ads like really like yours is the native one is one of my favorites just the home page or the landing page the cart all the upsells the payment token holds yeah yeah you know the up stills were crazy we have a post purchase upsell where we sell a trial like a travel-size do you rent we couldn't sell otherwise right it sold for three dollars and it's free shipping so we couldn't sell you that and like we would lose so much money if we sold you that individually and you know we sell hundreds of thousands of those many size to your prints every month and they like you know they're very profitable as well like often or even I was you know like a cops code like they're eBay da is basically J that's their membership fees I was like wow RT but does almost all like you know mini-sized we're selling because there's so much money yeah that's awesome but yeah I usually have like a small tablet brands I just keep looking at their stuff yeah yeah likewise you know I talked to the guy who founded hims in hers for this podcast on that and there's like when we yeah Andrew when we launched the business we separated our marketing budget and we got our Board of Directors to sort of say okay we're gonna spend X percentage of our marketing budget on performance and Y percent on brand look right out of the gate no he said the majority was still performance yeah but that was and he's like you know we do brand stuff like we buy coasters at bars yeah honestly my favorite thing about hims is Andrew is just a genius with I call it like finding that that new quote-unquote inventory you know like like above urinals the coasters bumble used to do coffee sleeves I love seeing brands do stuff like that it's great like I'm at to me is just like so creative yeah and like or borrowers on Friday night and all of a sudden like you can you might be able to have a conversation about it because it's on your coaster and it's a product that these people were like the bars are giving away for like you know coasters or disposables like it was really and we cover their class - yeah it was a great idea and but look it so I won I was really impressed by like the marketing channels that he had created that didn't exist before head and then - like I've never heard of a direct-to-consumer business at such a young stage sort of having the ability to spend so much money on brand marketing usually like you have one more inning budget and you know you send someone brand in someone performance but in reality you have like these numbers that you have to hit and he's like well this is how we do it and what we have to invest in brand if we want to be around 20 years later yeah to get that's a good point yeah it's a great point I feel like a way did that I feel like all birds today as well yeah I just don't know like I'd have never did that never spent one penny on the end one hint and I know no marketing budget was performance - and hint yeah most of it was performance you know actually pretty much I would say most of the brands that I've touched and it could just because I work with like the hyper-growth ones or you know more performance based but a lot of them their marketing budget is focused on performance and then I they're like what's left over or very tiny percentage is dedicated to grammar but I do think that like brand I mean Andrew did a great job building hims like everybody knew yeah everybody knew like the day of launch basically yeah I wonder like you know then I look back on things and I'm like okay what is right and what is wrong like I would really spend a ton on brand and is like struggle to find it and exit and struggle to sort of maintain its valuation a way seems like it's gonna struggle as well as a result of CO bad maybe not necessarily like you know spending a lot on brand and not necessarily enough like as much on performance then I'm like you know what like all these brands that I really liked aspera spent a ton on brand right like all these beautiful out-of-home at it's like beautiful imagery I see their team commercials and I'm like did you like Vincent and go to like create this this is [ __ ] fantastic look I want to free freeze this ad print it out and hang it on my wall oh yeah yeah and then I'm like but then you have a hundred million dollar valuation having raised four hundred million dollars so like uh you know are they right to be doing this what look what is the outcome here yeah I mean it will be really it'll be an interesting case study and you know in 15 years to look back on it and like really look at what mattered cuz cuz um I mean just from how I've seen native like native has always been well named native and I think hinted it really well to when I was there was like performance branding which is you you build your brand equity on the back of your working media dollars and like I think native you guys simplified the messaging a lot which helped that's why I like black wolf nation as well as the company the messaging is just simplified at hint we did the same thing but also to some extent a lot of these products provide convenience and an actual function they're also consumable which I think matters lasts then function but they're very functionable products and they have functional benefits to the consumer yeah and so as a result like the work thing I think you have to work a little less Gandhi brand side because if you can show them the outcomes or the benefits of the outcomes yeah then you just have a stickier brand yeah that said it will be interesting to see like I also don't think like there's one path to doing it that's applicable to everybody or or right path yeah because also quite frankly I would also bet money that some of these companies that spend a lot on brand probably tried to do what you were doing at Maidan but just didn't have the skillset to actually execute it and so their pit was to whatever they end up doing yeah yeah look you know it's really hard build a performance-based company they said that has 500 million dollars in revenue but I think the only way to do that is one get investing in brand yeah I'm not sure like like brand marketing can get into 500 million dollar company I'm just not sure it can get you to a 50 million company that's the crazy part like I need like some of that performance in order like like almost like an airplane right like you need some energy to take when you create that Ripple yeah it is really great like it's crazy to think about what like what will happen in this community you know I think about Harry's and the edge well not the edge well thing and the FTC sort of saying yeah this isn't gonna happen you know I don't know what Harry's does now like P&G certainly can't acquire them they're gonna have another antitrust problem and P&G knows that in Harry's knows that I don't know how Billy feels because Billy's supposed to be acquired by P&G you know I don't know the next few months that was supposed to start when we were boxing in New York that was a long time ago that deal was supposed to like yeah that deal yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right and so like I wonder what Harry's like you know if I were sitting it if I were like Geoffrey I need Harry's I'd be like you know I built this amazing brand somebody else agreed to pay one point four billion dollars for it and now I can't get this done look what happened what is going on in this world I now must be crazy look if Sprint and t-mobile can merge and so that there's only three phone carriers if there's like if you know United can be merged with Continental and Delta with Northwest why can't my dtc company sell to a strategic I'm a direct consumer new company that has launched in the last five years there's an entry I think it's it's tucks and it's also a complement yeah it certainly complement and I respect their business immensely I think like you know ya are looking are our lives both yours in mind were made so much easier by virtue of the fact that like Andy Don and Jeff and Eddie from Harry's sort of pave this path for us like you know Andy like we're gonna build the direct consumer business online everyone's like what the [ __ ] is that and yeah yeah we're gonna spend a bunch of money marketing and didn't know how to spend it well and built you know pop-up shops now there people are copying and the Harries guys yeah we're gonna take this door right to consumer business and we want you to target and it's gonna be successful there and yeah you know when it came to when it came to native I was like great I know exactly what to do business like that and he did and then I'm gonna launch him to target like that and he did yeah and like you know target was like yeah we know why this is look we didn't have to convince target you know target ya know why this is a good deal Ares has been taking a ton of market share and you know native is now 12 percent of the drn's sales at our year 13 percent it's awesome that was over a million dollars a week there and I'm just like I'm like we're walking in the footsteps of like giants and yeah unfortunately Andy done didn't have the best outcome at bonobos I think the outcome for Harry's is too early to tell now you know it certainly made our lives a lot easier oh it totally I think like one thing that always gets lost even back to the those pressed pieces slamming the founders one thing that always gets lost is like a lot of these people paved the way or created these movements which is something to be appreciative of and you know like it like you said it allows us to have a job yeah yeah I really think that like 60% of this industry is like building your business and 40% is getting the timing right like outdoor voice is a hot brand brought in Mickey from like j.crew as their chairman broken somebody from like Nike that was like president or something they just didn't get the timing right of like when to when to find a home for that business and same thing with Casper right like a fantastic brand absolute brand geniuses that created that you know and let great operators as well first month that they launched that a million dollars in revenue they were sending out air mattresses because they couldn't receive orders so like we're gonna send you this air mattress until we can get you a Casper mattress you know it's sort of pioneered out-of-home ads particularly in New York like I don't remember seeing simple yet until I saw Casper no never yeah that's like [ __ ] all direct consumer businesses are now doing this and like just didn't find a home at the right time for that business yeah yeah no I know I know you committed to some ads this summer what happens to those boys do you know yeah we're trying to like so native it's sort of agreed to do some subway ads in New York and you know do current sales pick up in like you know during the summer because it's warmer yeah and all of a sudden you thought about sweating and you know you're outside as opposed to when in New York it's you know 12 degrees you're sweating while you're walking and so we we want to buy some out-of-home ads and like they were pushing for I don't know exactly what time they were pushing for it and you know at the time I was feeling native I pushed for you know the summer which is now the worst time ever to run subway out because they're so what ridership is down probably 90% and so we're trying to look push them out a little bit so that we can still get some traffic like you know you know you agree to like a price and you're like okay this is what the CPM backs out to based on the number of riders right someone has and then but you don't agree to a CPM price you know you don't say okay you're gonna have this many rights right right number of dollars you say this year the price based on your historic traffic and that like that I was like I had terrible timing there it's really couldn't foresee yeah but like just absolutely terrible oh yeah I mean it's nothing you could have yeah it's nothing you couldn't predict yeah I was pretty excited though yeah it was I was super excited too because I want to run all these like fun ads I would say like what stinks down here not you if you use native deodorant and the subway guys were like you have to be careful because you can't make fun of the subway while you're running look it's you have to buy the inventory from us you can't like be an [ __ ] to us and like we're not gonna let happen this place is a [ __ ] use- to10 avoid the rats use native deer yeah what stinks not you use native deirdre like I think that would have been okay with them but yeah I mean look it is crazy out like venturi has sort of changed and you know when I talk to people who are who are advertising on Facebook these days they're just like prices are down on substantial like CPMs are down because your yachts and United's and you know Toyota's of the world just aren't advertising on there now yeah yeah actually yeah totally and then the ones that you know when all that big a agencies pulled out then all the really savvy people like Gus went in and started you know creating these campaigns yeah and be overall inventory got super cheap yeah I remember looking 2017 Mark Pritchard who's the chief brand officer at P&G like when on The Wall Street Journal and he's like we're cutting our facebook ad spend by a hundred million dollar artists because Facebook just doesn't provide the return on investment that it should and I was I was sitting there like this is pre acquisition I was like fantastic yeah you're missing it's fantastic out here if you're lucky to me about running Facebook Ads so like yeah you're right it is that it is that don't worry about it stop spending meanwhile I'll go ahead and increase my set yeah like that's what happens in auction based platforms totally if somebody was gonna start you know I know we're running over time already if someone's gonna start a new business today what is the best way to learn learn about digital advertising I feel like you know you're an expert at it you were doing it hit hit water by the way I try to spoke to Kara earlier this week and she was like we ran a Superbowl commercial and causes under a million dollars to run that Superbowl commercial and I was like when you said you focus mostly on performance ads I was like okay it sounds like that's change now Superbowl commercial performance it's also interesting to hear that just yeah you know you've run acquisition a bunch of companies you're advising a bunch of companies when it comes to acquisition you've run your fair share of Facebook Ads certainly admire your expertise there what's the first step that somebody should do if they're cold and they're working at you know I don't know Johnson and Johnson or they're working there are like a paralegal somewhere and they want to run this direct-to-consumer business where should they go to learn about direct consumer advertising um they know to be cooking yeah yeah you can definitely text me the the main thing like I I had always tried to find like whether it was that one site that was really good at educating you or like the you know that one course or whatever but there did it just doesn't exist and also this world changes so fast that there's really nothing that can constantly keep up I found that for me the best tool is like I just started building a group of people that I constantly talked to so you know whether it's like these are people most of them initially were just actual like acquisition people so people like you know the head of marketing at like third love or Madison Reid or some of these like big d2c brands yeah and then and then I just started figuring out that I could use Twitter to network and now now like I'll talk to people who are running you know tens of millions of dollars of ads all the way to people who are you know doing a thousand dollars a month in sales and they're really proud of it but I it's easy for me to just kind of learn through seeing what other people are doing and then the other thing I'll do is just you know like stock the really really good brands and see exactly how they do it whether it's they're looking at their creative you know there's things you pick up like if you go to you know probably even native see if you go to natives like Facebook Ads library 80% of the creative looks the same that's the creative that's doing really good and so you just like you do that I constantly have a list where I'll go through you know the top like 50 or 60 brands and just see one or all their landing pages looking like now if I identify similarities it's because it works you know I just I learned by observation so I I'm like looking at what other people doing and then figuring out the why and then basically taking the why and trying to make that with my own version yeah that's a great point I think like you know someone made fun of us for like having a landing page of the look like Harry's and I was like you're you're using this as like an insult and I pick it I picked up what you said and put it on myself as a badge as a compliment yeah yeah we didn't spend the money to do it but we looked at other people and emulated yeah and you know if you look at like a lot of these brands that spend you know millions of millions of dollars a month like we can we don't have to do that that tests thing they've done the testing gave us we just have to see what you know they've come out with yeah I'm a big fan of like work smarter not harder so agree with uh like sort of looking at of looking at competitors or actually best in best-in-class sites to see what they're doing really well when you said you developed like a network of people on Twitter and presumably slack and communicate with them and some of them are spending you know a thousand dollars in some of them are spending ten million dollars a year on Facebook Ads how does that help you um it helps me in a few different ways so like you know if I know that you know if I if I know that for example I'm helping out a telemedicine brand you know on board new new customers and they're a part of their customer journey requires like going through insurance then I have a friend who runs marketing at another telemedicine brand for women where they have that whole kind of funnel and they've gone through that whole process so for me can be as easy as you know texting him and asking a question in other cases it could be like you know I I needed a Shopify developer two months ago and so I had asked a couple friends and right away they were just like oh yeah here use this guy he's the best yeah and yeah I usually just learned that way I'm a big like questions person my theory initially I think the reason that it kicked off was because I don't really have a formal education in anything and so my thought process was that and I also wasn't a big reader so my thought process was basically like instead of instead of going to like books and instead of going to college if I just surround myself with the people who write these books and I get the information first um then I should be in a good enough position yeah III think that's absolutely right you know there's two things that say look I have a formal education and I can tell you I like never use it on a single day unless like you know unless someone's saying something like requiring me to do something that I don't want to do and yeah you're a Harvard lawyer and you know I don't have to do this I'm not your slave yeah and so I think that's the only time I use it and I think you know you're talking about networks in San Francisco and I started doing when you were growing native and we're really small as I started hosting like this ecommerce brunch so like every Sun one Sunday a month I would get like ten people who are all in ecommerce into a room and we would talk about like you know the problems that we were having from like in operations perspective a personnel perspective and really a marketing perspective I said what is VN from you but for you guys on a marketing perspective where are you spending money you know it like that Network really helped me understand the shift from like desktop to mobile from you know mobile static images to mobile video landing pages colors that would work how important creative was versus headline you know important the you know the display image was before it started a video like all that kind of stuff and like that community like aside from the fact that it was really like easy to voice my concerns to other founders who came to the brunch it was super inspirational I remember like coming out of those brunches being like it's Sunday at 2:00 p.m. I have nine hours of work to do today because yeah all these guys had such good ideas I need to get started executing yeah in myself Scott Swanson who I don't think you've met but he actually used to work at the hustle me Scott the head of marketing at third love Hadamard a Madison Reed and Mike do blow when he was at the stitch fix we would all get lunch once a month and and sometimes we would come up with these meetings and we all had pretty much the same customer but we were not competing so it was great and we would come out of these meetings and Scott and I would take like an idea that we discussed over lunch and it would make us an extra hundred grand the next weekend yeah it's Chris but it totally did help with like like you know third love and Madison Reid um did a ton in podcasts and TV so like we learned a lot about that before we stepped into that it helped us with figuring out things like the right agencies you know who are the right buyers yeah all the way down to like you know oh I don't you know we're hiring we're trying to hire a head of retention how do we go about hiring that or you know we have this issue on the team where this person thinks they're supposed to be doing email and affiliate but like random issues but it helps to have that group where you know the chances of one of them having already dealt with that issue is pretty high yeah that's it that's a great point it's like your personal like Yelp where you have a bunch of people who have had some experiences and it's just like brainstorming in a way where sometimes you need to get other people's perspective who are doing the same thing you're doing although it's different to really open up your eyes for me we had like a guy from with Eric who runs nectar mattresses or it's called like nectar yes and you know I saw his business go from like zero dollars to north of 200 million dollars and I was just like what the [ __ ] is going on over there like every month we come in and I'd be like what the [ __ ] how is your growth that huge and yeah really helpful and so when I was looking at working perspective might go to him and alright you know need to discuss a small team issue you know I talked to the guys that the vine Boxer Japan crater somebody else who is small but like sort of growing like struggling well and like had a lot of insight and yeah yeah I think those networks are like underappreciated they're like sort of totally below the radar it's a total advantage to yeah it really is you know you're talking about how you guys had different businesses to how like certain things would work I don't know there's like there needs to be a private equity firm that sort of buys up a bunch of these businesses and spreads like everyone's biggest costs or one of their biggest cost is certainly customer acquisition it's got to be in the top five or probably the top - oh definitely you know someone needs to spread this around cuz you're right like the customer who's a native customer is probably a hint customer and the customer is a hint customer is probably an outdoor voices customer and we're all paying Facebook to sort of like acquire these customers as opposed to saying you know we have this one email address it would probably apply to all three of us trying to share this resource yeah there I've thought so much about this there was actually a company that I think the farthest it got as like like as operators we're trying to do that the furthest that ever got was like sharing Facebook audiences like look likes I'm gonna swapping look like some young brands but everybody got super well one people got really protective about their email list especially if it was a big list everybody was really cautious and then secondly anything from like a bigger company that had you know I would say like more than 50 people they naturally had like a chief technology or chief privacy or chief legal and that's where it gets really tough so it is tough but if somebody could figure that out or or you know it's another one I think I'd say the screenshot one time but it's it's if you could develop a Shopify app the hustles like the perfect audience for the a Shopify app that imagine if like I was at hand you were at native and it was one landing page you check out on the landing page and it pushes the order out to both hint and native so on the back end it gets fulfilled like a normal order and on the front end the customer pays once puts their information and once and it basically goes out to two stores rather than checking out on my site and I send you an excel sheet or vice versa you're saying so there'd be one check out like one website that sells both of our products know so well yeah it could be that but it's more so like you know the reason a lot of people don't do like things like like acquisition collabs is because it's like well who owns that customer technically is it on my store that they check out or your store and then if it's if it's just another site like Amazon then Amazon owns it so in this case everybody wins yeah I think you're absolutely right I think the first step to getting there is actually like the word step which is like the private equity company coming in and buying of these businesses and start sharing like because once they prove that hey this kind of stuff works and we can bring your marketing costs down thirty five percent and that's your biggest you know like that's the biggest line and you have in terms of expenses now all the sudden everyone's gonna be like well this cancer like this company's got a competitive advantage and we have to I think there are certain companies that are trying I would be surprised if atomic and like Kim's in hers don't share that kind of stuff and I'd be surprised as like you know that the new chin Lane isn't trying to do that as well yeah it is like I like no has done it well and like yeah you know people are attempting it yeah yeah there are a lot of people attempting it like a back when Facebook would share interests with you like I look at natives it audience and I'd be like what are the other things you like and I'm like great oh he's other like like 60% of our customers also like to honest that's how I would find a lot of like media partnerships we saw yeah the first time I ever did it out it was like the skin was in the top five and I was like yeah this kid yeah yeah it was great and like I was just like we have the exact same audience and we felt like the honest honest Cohen native had the same audience and we have to each of us have to acquire on customers independently doesn't make any sense it's just the only like you know yeah awesome Nick really appreciate your time we're way over already so thanks so much for being on this on this episode if people want to follow you if we're should they text you which they follow you on you know on Twitter you can text me at nine one seven nine zero five two three four zero or you can follow me and tweet me on Twitter at mr.sharma fantastic Nick's thanks so much for your time really appreciate this I always love chatting with you I feel like you and I have this status of like performance marketing if direct-to-consumer businesses yeah and there isn't all this like hoopla [ __ ] you know there there's no like you don't put yourself out there like you're royalty you're like look I'm uh I'm the commoner of fighting the good fight exactly and it makes it a lot easier to to challenge yeah awesome awesome thanks so much for your time [Music]

[Music] were there any like failures from a marketing perspective that you had I would say a couple of things to that first you know I again I I was in advertising before so I sort of always had this theory that unless we you know could really get the frequency that it wasn't worth it so you know we didn't we never really it's like went out and bought one billboard because I just thought it like one billboard it just do anything right it's just wasting money if we're if we're just doing one thing and so I think that we've always believed like you know buy it by a chunk in an area and you know do do it right or just don't do it at all and that sort of been our theory too that you know just just not only from a marketing district marketing brand standpoint but also from a distribution standpoint we've also just believed like if we can't actually do well in a store or in a market like we shouldn't be there right and I think it's the same sort of philosophy for like don't be afraid to take your time and which is sort of like you know not what everybody would say like I mean we've had so many you know brands that have said no you got to get across the u.s. you got to get into the Kroger you got to get a Publix like Costco fast fast fast and so many of those companies aren't here anymore because we just spent too fast right so if you don't have the money to go into those markets and really do it right I mean my best advice would be you know just do the markets they you can be really good at well period [Music]

Mike Cessario is a branding genius. He explains how he branded a NEW water bottle company (Liquid Death) and has made millions in the first 3 months. These branding strategies are priceless and most companies, even successful ones, miss these fundamentals. Cessario makes it clear that creating the RIGHT brand around an already essential product like water, given that the typical brands are not innovating, can tap into a specialized part of the marketplace and create business success.

because everyone was like this is such a silly idea and they raised all this money I mean I guess at the heart of what liquid death really is we're really just completely trying to change the way healthy food and beverages are marketed at the end of the day most of the most hilarious memorable ad campaigns that you ask most people about it the last 10 years they'll tell you Bud Light don't suck ease Snickers Doritos skittles like all junk food and alcohol that's the funniest most memorable kind of youth culture owning and energy drinks like redbull that's like let's not leave old spice out well it's not really a pure beverage but yes but yeah it's like all that it's all junk food and alcohol that does all the funniest coolest youth culture marketing whereas healthy food is traditionally marketed to like mom and it's quiet and it's responsible or it's like look better we're you know show yo you know fitness models you know drinking bottles of water like it's a very different they don't use fun to market whereas unhealthy beverages stuff like that like they want to own fun so we're basically doing that with water so we want to be able to take the healthiest thing you can drink that most people don't drink enough of and brand it and build a you know a cool you know seeing around it where it's something that you feel totally comfortable drinking a liquid death in a bar or at a house party right at a music festival or at work or in the gym and just making it more fun to walk around and have a walk right and you definitely made headlines when you raised all that money cuz everyone was like this is such a silly idea and they raised all this money I didn't it's a stupid reason I mean it was like an awesome company and totally worthy of going big but so it kind of worked right like you you definitely uh you definitely ruffled some feathers and I think that's good no yeah I think you know I always bring up I one of the you know I listen to the Reed Hoffman podcast a lot master scale yeah and it's like I loved it he always pushes he's like truly innovative ideas are almost comical at first because if it seems like it makes a lot of sense right now it probably means there's four other companies that have been working on it for five years already looks like the things that are truly unique and innovative like almost don't make any sense at first there seem laughable I think like that's kind of the case of liquid death I think it's like we're really trying to disrupt a category in a way that's not just disruption for the sake of disruption you know I think it's like we strongly believe that and I don't think it's something hard to understand you know in a category where almost all the products themselves are perceived as the same you know people are assuming I only drink Fiji because it's got 0.75 more electrolytes than smart water which has 0.5 the pH is 7 point 7 it said 7 no it's like most people assume water is the same it's more of a brand play and we believe if we can make you laugh we have a way better chance at you giving us your dollar 69 then the faceless brand next to us who's trying to shout at you electrolyte to let you know they're like guys this all seems like snake oil to me like I feel like there's real human beings behind liquid debt that I'd want to have a beer with so I'd rather give you my my dollar 65 and let's talk a little bit about the form factor so is it's a it's a tall cam as what I've seen are there other form factors or no no it's just the talk game it's all can which is cool the branding of it is sort of like you know almost like heavy metal or punk rock how do you describe yeah yeah yeah I mean yeah I think at the end of the day you would you would say we're like alternative punk metal inspired design and and vibe I think the way I like to think about our brand is like we're a professional Resler like it's all theater and fun and everyone thinks it's trying to be real like no one thinks the undertaker is really an evil guy from the dead who likes metal no it's a character and it's fun to like buy a character yeah and that's kind of that's how we think about it like we're just playing this fun sorry second we're just playing this fun character it's fun to choose to believe that yeah this is what it is and not take it too seriously and you're right like you know if you're at a bar or a music festival and you choose water you feel like you're choosing you're opting out of the fun and in fact they'll sort of you know it'll make you feel that way you know you'll get the small plastic rinky-dink cup with the baby straw right versus if you ordered a you know alcoholic drink or something else it's kind of that's actually a good point I mean I don't drink and I still go to bars and I always felt like I used to order sprites with lime in it because I was like looks like a gin and tonic yeah my god one being people feel uncomfortable what so I'll just even though I don't like to drink soda like I'll drink it anyway and I don't have an O'Doul's because I'm like uh then everyone's just kind of like it's just gonna come up and so it's it is a great alternative to that and so Mike I'm curious where does this idea come from so I think this was really just like a culmination of all my passions and experience sort of like converged into one you know it's like I grew up in high school playing in punk rock and metal bands and skateboarding and you know I would do all the show flyers and album art and stuff for our bands which kind of got like the entrepreneurial probably side of things because like you know we're booking shows and we're selling merch and like we're pressing records and doing all that kind of stuff then I got into a career of like graphic design which led into advertising so then I was like an advertising creative director for a long time and I worked on big brands like Nestle and Toyota and Volkswagen and Naked Juice and all this kind of stuff so I think I got a good sense of where I think big companies screw up I guess like where I think they're short-sighted I can't tell you how many boardrooms I've been in where I'm trying to convince all that social media isn't some like niche little thing you add on to your business like it is the Internet when you say I'm going on the Internet nine times out of ten you're going on social media you know it's like I think a lot of brands are just way behind the ball to understand what it really takes to be successful in the social environment like your little social posts aren't just competing against other beverages you're competing against influencers who are uncensored and can do crate easy on the wall you're again trash you're competing against everything awesome on the internet when you're scrolling through your feed that's what your marketing is competing against so when you really think about it that way do you really think your little ad that seems like a typical beverage thing is gonna actually stand out in someone's quick scrolling feed amongst all this other amazing stuff probably not so I think the bar for what stuff needs to be is way higher and I think that's what I built liquid death around like we think about marketing like entertainment I don't ever want to put something in your feed that feels like marketing I wanted to feel like actual entertainment that made you laugh or it was the funniest thing that you maybe saw that morning that you want to share with your friends or whatever that like we're never just sticking marketing in your face like it's always going to entertain you or it's gonna do something of value that it gives you I've got questions like Sam I'm looking at their Facebook Ads right now and what you're saying is true so here's the two ads I see I wish I could show this through a podcast so I'm gonna show this to your ears but there's a giant can of liquid death in front of a mountain and says this is dumb don't buy this there's another one that's like I don't know what you'd call this it's like a it's like the mountain from Game of Thrones but instead of his head is a can a liquid death erupting from his muscular body and he's standing in a grocery store aisle grocery store aisle holding an axe and it just says like this is a villain nationwide at Whole Foods I'm gonna I want to ask a question about that but first is there any indication is there anything you can give me the shows or the listeners how big this business is like what what size you guys are yeah why should we why should we care about what you say something or not I want you to like impress people yeah I mean I can't get into like specific kind of sales numbers but since we launched national and Whole Foods basically we launched the day the pandemic started so we went we went into Whole Foods March 15 and basically even even though we've been in a pandemic where they've had like 80% decreased store traffic and everything else going on we've had insane growth in Whole Foods and we're now the fastest growing water bread in Whole Foods right and you've raised like how much money to make this far grand total since the very beginning of everything I think we've raised around 12 total right now so great okay so we kind of have an idea a little bit about sizing when you look at when you are looking at this business and what and what to start was that your perspective which is what is something that I mean it sounds like you're into health and that type of stuff what is something that is like good for you but has [ __ ] marketing and how can I build a business around that was that your perspective in a nutshell I think it really came from you know you know where I grew up playing in punk bands and and metal bands and stuff like that I was still and a lot of my friends in that world were very much into health like I was a vegetarian at age 16 a lot of my friends in that scene were more my friends were even vegan a lot of them like you know didn't drink alcohol I do and I think that's one thing that we've been like misbranded is like liquid death its water for the straightedge crowd that is not what we're trying to do I think it's something that's been adopted by them for you know the reasons of yeah it is more fun to walk around in a bar if you don't want drink than something like this but I think another thing that the health food industry does and I don't think we want to do is we don't want to be preachy to people we don't want to say you should be doing this and I shouldn't be drinking this and you shouldn't be doing that like we're like hey you want to go rip some shots at a bar fine but maybe take a break and have a water for an hour you know or like hey you want to smoke weed or whatever it's like great like maybe hydrate while you're doing it right even it's like hey you want to go buy a monster energy drink or whatever great maybe buy water too and have a water after you just pound a bunch of [ __ ] right happy that's the good news anybody who does any lifestyle also drinks water and spray compared to any lifestyle that you want it sounds like you guys trying to do that [Music] [Applause] [Music]

Your brand strategy is key when knowing whether or not your product will sell. Mike Cessario branded a NEW water company (Liquid Death) and has made millions. He explains how he was able to test if his product idea would sell before actually creating it by launching a product showcase video on social media. His water beverage company, Liquid Death, has made him millions despite its unconventional branding, and it's all because he was able to take his vision and prove its viability in the marketplace by testing if people liked it on social media all before actually creating the product.

there's nobody who's writing me a check for the idea of liquid death they're like you're this is stupid you're crazy like we launched liquid death in a bit of a backwards way than most i think beverage brands launch which was we launched a year before we met science we launched liquid death on social media before we ever had product because we knew that with such a crazy idea like liquid death there's nobody who's writing me a check for the idea of liquid death they're like you're this is stupid you're crazy like who would ever buy this it's a negative name it says death retailers will never carry it yadda yadda so i knew that i had to prove it out as a concept on social first before i could actually make people feel like i'm de-risking this thing a bit to actually raise so we designed the can to look like a 3d realistic can we shot a 1500 video and then we just put it on facebook no twitter no instagram just facebook we put maybe um i don't know three grand in paid media behind the video and then cut to three months later we have more facebook followers than aquafina the video has three million views we've got a range of dms from hi i am a 7-eleven franchisee in the midwest how do i get this in my stores or hi i'm the biggest non-out beverage distributor in new york city called big geyser how do we talk to a sales representative to distribute this and we didn't even have product yet right no idea of how we were even going to really make it so then i use all that social traction and distributor interest and retailer interest to then start raising a small friends and family round so we can actually produce physical product because with cans the minimums are really really high like quarter million cans is the lowest you can actually produce with a can manufacturer so it's a little bit capital intensive just to even start playing the game how much does a quarter million how much a quarter of a million a product what would that cost i mean if you're just starting with that cost i mean it all depends what you're feeling in there but i mean i mean yeah i mean you're you're talking you know 150 200 250 grand just to like kind of get started probably you know doing cans um so yeah once we once we then kind of raised a little bit we started producing cans we we bottle oh well we can and source our water in austria in the alps um once we had physical cans the people what does that mean whenever people are like oh this is you know spring water from this mountain it's like you know my head is always like this is bs what does this mean does that mat like a is this true b does that matter um so like why do you go get your water from austria in the alps like what is that is that is that branding is that like is there something about water that i don't know like why do you have to go there to get your water so what i mean let's be totally honest water for the most point part i should say for most people is water yeah like if you had people try to even even water snobs if you had them blind taste test fiji versus evian versus whatever can they really tell the difference probably not right but i've done this test many times as an avion drinker epione versus so evian and fiji are tastes similar to me evian versus crystal geisler like it tastes different i've i've bet money and i've got it right before that's interesting but yeah i think the things that make water that affect the taste of water are the natural minerals and how much of them there are in the water and the ph of the water is it more acidic is it more basic and what those minerals are affect how acidic or how basic it is so when you for us our water comes from the alps and it literally goes right from the mountain into the can obviously it goes through filters and things that filter out debris and all that and then we put it through like a pasteurization process that makes sure everything you know it's all clean and good to go but everything in that water is that's the natural mineral profile of the water that has been built up over probably hundreds of years in the mountain and it's like you know naturally alkaline at 7.8 or 7.9 ph it's got a nice mineral level nice mouth feel when you're drinking it because of the level of minerals so that comes right off that way it's all everything's natural about it almost every major water brand in the u.s whether that's smart water essentia aquafina dasani most of those brands they're using you just tap from the that then they reverse osmosis which strips everything out of water all the natural minerals all the bad stuff everything so it's literally just like empty water then they have to add in minerals back in to kind of make it taste good so they'll add in the natural things that occur in water but just kind of artificially with just doing it at the factory to kind of make something that has a decent ph and a decent mineral profile that tastes good so those are kind of the two options when you say something is spring water it's very strict from the fda of what that has to be like to call it spring water you cannot alter the original mineral profile of the water so even if you take it off the mountain if you put it through reverse osmosis and it strips out the natural minerals and you add them back in you can't call it spring water anymore because you've altered the original thing so you know our water like i said that that's kind of how we think about it um everything we have in our water is natural that's how it comes off the mountain it's kind of its own perfect thing we don't have to go through the whole process of like using municipal tap water from the factory stripping everything out adding stuff in and kind of like creating a water right now that that's great okay and you know i've never actually had liquid death um it's flat water though right it's not sparkling and it's not flavored we have a sparkling version but we have a still and a sparkling yeah and um and so you uh sorry just to sort of finish it so you you took that you know you raised a little bit you did the social media to prove hey we can build a fun brand that people resonate with then you figured out okay to produce the minimum run i'm gonna need a couple hundred grand to get this thing off the ground and you raise kind of the friends and family round uh that was from science or afterwards science came about and they wrote a bigger check we raised the friends and family round just to basically cover like a super limited you know the smallest run of product we could do right and then once i finally had a physical can of liquid that for the first time which was probably around october of 2018. we had a a guy that we knew who knew someone at science who said hey you guys should really talk to science like they'd probably be all over this so we went and met with science and brought down the physical can and once someone could really hold it and it wasn't just like us showing digital images from social it made it way different it just like they understood the magic of it and how cool this would be walking around with this or how you know how into this people would be so then we that's when we kind of decided to do a deal with science and over the next two months after that they helped us gear up our d2c launch where we launched online in january of last year

one of my old bosses I used to work I was the crib director at vaynermedia so Gary Vaynerchuk was like my boss essentially what's up Sam and we have a guest Mike Cesario welcome welcome to the podcast thanks guys there's a lot of crazy stuff going on right now this well we'll have this hour to be a little bit of an escape we talked about everything going on last podcast I think let's we'll try to make this like just say at least a 45 minute 50 minute escape for people we could kind of talk about yeah exactly it does kind of feel silly to be like oh here's some business ideas when like you know the whole world is it's really you know you know tilt whether it's true coronavirus or the different protests that are going on but like you said I think you know for me I'm like glued to Twitter and the muse and all this stuff all day then you know by 7 8 p.m. I just need a break I go walk my dog and I go listen to some mindless stuff about sports or whatever else just you know just to calm my mind and so hopefully we could be that for some people we're a bit of a diversion or a bit of an escape from the heaviness that's going on so you know Mike I'm glad you're here we you have a product that we've talked about on the podcast before which is liquid death so if somebody doesn't know what liquid death has given the what is liquid death and then we're gonna talk about how you started that and then we're gonna brainstorm some cool ideas and spaces around around what did you do sure so I mean I guess at the heart of what liquid death really is we're really just completely trying to change the way healthy food and beverages are marketed at the end of the day most of the most hilarious memorable ad campaigns that you ask most people about it the last 10 years they'll tell you Bud Light don't know SEC East Snickers Doritos skittles like all junk food and alcohol that's the funniest most memorable kind of youth culture owning and energy drinks like Red Bull that's like let's not leave old spice out well it's not really a food or beverage but but yeah it's like all it's all junk food and alcohol that does all the Escalus youth culture marketing whereas healthy food is traditionally marketed to like mom and it's quiet and it's responsible or it's like look better where you know show you you know fitness models you know drinking bottles of water like it's a very different they don't use fun to market whereas unhealthy beverages stuff like that like they want to own fun so we're basically doing that with water so we want to be able to take the healthiest thing you can drink that most people don't drink enough of and brand it and build you know a cool you know thing around it where it's something that you feel totally comfortable drinking a liquid death in a bar or at a house party right at a music festival or at work or in the gym and just making it more fun to walk around and have a lot right and that's you definitely made headlines when you raised all that money cuz everyone was like this is such a silly idea and they raised all this money I didn't it's a stupid reason I mean it was it seemed like an awesome company and totally worthy of going big but so it kind of worked right like you you definitely uh you definitely ruffled some feathers and I think that's good no yeah I think you know I always bring up I one of the you know I listen to the

it's more of a brand play and we believe if we can make you laugh we have a way better chance that you giving us your dollar 69 then the faceless brand next to us who's trying to shout at you electrolyte so let you know they're like guys this all seems like snake oil to me like I feel like there's real human beings behind liquid depth and I'd want to have a beer with so I'd rather give you my dollar 60 grand and let's talk a little bit about the form factor so is it's a it's a tall cam as what I've seen are there other form factors or no no it's just the talking it's all kin which is cool the branding of it is sort of like you know almost like heavy metal or punk rock how do you describe yeah yeah yeah I mean yeah I think at the end of the day you would you would say we're like alternative punk metal inspired design and and vibe I think the way I like to think about our brand is like we're a professional wrestler like it's all theater and fun and everyone thinks it's trying to be real like no one thinks the Undertaker is really an evil guy from the dead who likes metal no it's a character and it's fun to like buy a character yeah and that's kind of that's how we think about it like we're just playing this fun sorry second we're just playing this fun character it's fun to choose to believe that yeah this is what it is and not take it too seriously and you write like you know if you're at a bar or a music festival and you choose water you feel like you're choosing you're opting out of the fun and in fact they'll sort of you know it'll make you feel that way you

social posts aren't just competing against other beverages you're competing against influencers who are uncensored and can do crate easy on the wall stuff you're again trash you're competing against everything awesome on the internet when you're scrolling through your feed that's what your marketing is competing against so when you really think about it that way do you really think your little ad that seems like a typical beverage thing is gonna actually stand out in someone's quick scrolling feed amongst all this other amazing stuff probably not so I think the bar for what stuff needs to be is way higher and I think that's what I built liquid death around like we think about marketing like entertainment I don't ever want to put something in your feed that feels like marketing I wanted to feel like actual entertainment that made you laugh or it was the funniest thing that you may be stall that morning that you want to share with your friends or whatever that like we're never just sticking marketing in your face like it's always going to entertain you or it's gonna do something of value that it gives you I've got a question I'm gonna check Sam I'm looking at their Facebook ads right now and what you're saying is true so here's the two ads I see I wish I could show this through a podcast so I'm gonna show this to your ears but there's a giant can of liquid death in front of a mountain and says this is dumb don't buy this there's another one that's like I don't know what you'd call this it's like a it's like the mountain from Game of Thrones but instead of his head is a can a liquid death erupting from his muscular body and he's standing in a grocery store aisle grocery store aisle holding an axe and it just says like this is a bill nationwide in Whole Foods I'm gonna I want to ask a question about that but first is there any indication is there anything you can give me the shows or the listeners how big this business is like what what what size you guys are yeah why should we why should we care about what you say is the other thing or not I want you to like impress people yeah I mean I can't get into like specific kind of sales numbers but since we launched national and Whole Foods basically we launched the day the pandemic started so we what we went into Whole Foods March 15 and basically even even though we've been in a pandemic where they've had like 80% decreased store traffic and everything else going on we've had insane growth in Whole Foods and we're now the fastest growing water bread in Whole Foods right and you've raised like how much money to make the safari grand total since the very beginning of everything I think we've raised around 12 total right now so great ok so we kind of have an idea a little bit about sizing when you look at when you are looking at this business and what and what to start was that your perspective which is what is something that I mean it sounds like you're into health and in that type of stuff what is something that is like good for you but has [ __ ] marketing and how can I build a business around that was that your perspective in a nutshell I think it really came from you know you know where I grew up playing in punk bands and and metal bands and stuff like that I was still and a lot of my friends in that world we're very much into health like I was a vegetarian at age 16 a lot of my friends in that scene were more my friends were even vegan a lot of them like you know didn't drink alcohol I do and I think that's one thing that we've been like misbranded is like liquid death its water for the straightedge crowd that is not what we're trying to do I think it's something that's been adopted by them for you know the reasons of yeah it is more fun to walk around in a bar if you don't want drink than something like this but I think another thing that the health food industry does I don't think we want to do is we don't want to be preachy to people we don't want to say you should be doing this and I shouldn't be drinking this and you shouldn't be doing that like we're like hey you want to go rip some shots in a bar fine but maybe take a break and have a water for an hour you know or like hey you want to smoke weed or whatever it's like great like maybe hydrate while you're doing it right even if like hey you want to go buy a monster energy drink or whatever great maybe buy water too and have a water after you just pound a bunch of sugar I'm happy that's the good news anybody who does any lifestyle also drinks water and spray compared to any lifestyle that you want it sounds like you guys trying to do that let me ask you like you've said some kind of abstract ways like you know we felt this was missing about what but I want you to like rewind and make it real so like take us back to the moment you have the idea what's going on where are you where does the idea come from who are you talking to and then like how did it turn into something sure so as as you know in the world of rock and roll punk metal whatever the only brands that have invested in trying to own that culture have been energy drinks primarily Monster so Monster was sponsoring the Vans Warped Tour with all the punk bands they sponsor all these different metal bands like you don't see that with many other brand doing that now so I graduated high school in 2000 so that's what I think you're really starting to see that swell up and a lot of my friends were in bands we were at the Vans Warped Tour that was sponsored by monster back in I think it was like around 2007 somewhere around there I was in Denver working for an agency there went and hung out at the work toward with my friends you know they took me backstage we're hanging out with like all the bands you know the bands tour buses and I saw that they had like huge stacks of monster that these guys are all drinking and I was like how are you guys pounding energy drinks right now like in the hot Sun like it's like 98 degrees and they're like no dude it's water and was like monster gives all the bands they look like monster cancer at the bottom it says tour water because they know that none of these bands are gonna drink this stuff in the Sun so bands on stage are pounding what looked like energy drinks to all these kids but it's really just water that's what I remember thinking like that's so [ __ ] up like you know like you know and I think that was the moment where I where it kind of started me down the path of Oh like why is it stuff like water like marketed in a cool way like this and it was like when you actually had a freezing cold can of water it's just more refreshing to you psychologically right there's actually a popular science I think it was they did a study where they showed that temperature was the number one quencher of thirst neurologically which is why like if you're really thirsty and you suck on an ice cube it actually kind of quenches your thirst a little bit even though no water is actually absorbing into your body right so I think there was just like that was sort of the aha moment for me where I started thinking about why isn't it healthier things because none of us none of my friends hang out one to actually drink energy drinks like we just wanted to drink water or beer you know but it's like of course you're banned you got to make money you're touring so of course you got to take the checks from these companies and and you know they they they play ball to a certain extent but that's where I think the idea really started and what other verticals did you explore that you think would also work for this did you explore any other products that you think like so it's definitely there's definitely opportunity here if you do what we're doing but in this this thing or that thing so 21x so that so that worked or thing happened yeah like around 2007-2008 where I started thinking about that but then it was a couple like maybe two years later I was living in San Francisco and I actually developed the spirits brand on my own called Western grace and it was basically brandy so it was like hey how do we make brandy cool because I had brandy it was why don't people drink more it's just like whiskey without the bird but every brandy bottle literally in the in the liquor store had dust on it it was like what your grandfather drank or some trying to be replica of French luxury with cursive golden text on the bottle but it was more similar per taste profile wise to a whiskey which was the biggest fastest growing spirit so I had this idea to create a brandy that felt more like a whiskey and felt cool and sure enough like I found a brandy distillery in Northern California who were like oh my god we've been waiting for someone to try to make brandy like mass and cool for like 20 years so they were like hey we'll make the brandy for you then I went and found some spirit industry folks who helped create Hendrix Jain and Sailor Jerry rum to kind of come on board they thought it was really interesting and then all of a sudden we have a brandy company and I moved back to my hometown of Philadelphia where my partners were and we basically like I was only a couple years out of AD school no entrepreneurial experience no liquor industry experience and we started building this brandy company and it's still around today there in probably 80 bars in LA they're all over Austin they're in Nashville they're Florida but I left the brand a little bit early on because I just me and our spirits folks we brought in kind of like didn't see eye to eye on a couple things from a marketing level so I said hey you guys keep growing it from here I'm gonna kind of go do my own thing and you know I'll keep my little chunk of vested equity and best of luck to you guys like no hard feelings I'm sure you'll do great with it and then went to work for an agency in Tennessee that a friend of mine started called human eye where I started doing a bunch of well human eye and eye we did a bunch of funny work for the organic world we did this campaign called save the bras the first organic protein shake and we did this funny viral video that just went bananas and it was like the first time that like humor had really been done like in the world of organic and that was like the reinforcement the warp tour thing where it's like right like why aren't more health brands like playing with the kind of humor and irreverent internet stuff that these other you know unhealthy things are doing and then that's really where I started building the nuts and bolts of liquid death and figuring out the production and coming up with the branding and then it was I think maybe two years after that was when we officially kind of launched it that's that's pretty cool do you do you think that there's still opportunity for that I mean because when you go to 7-eleven I mean I live in San Francisco I'm in Austin right now there's 7-elevens everywhere is and it's only muscle milk is the only that's the only protein based drink and that is similar to your analogy of like a net that's like an Evian or a Fiji or something like a mass brand well if I'm if I'm not wrong I think it'd be more like taking cottage cheese and making cottage cheese fun than it is Muscle Milk or the kind of protein shakes which are already kind of like trying to mass market and get in with a sort of different lifestyles whereas you know some random product category where it is only trying to play it safe non internet-based marketing those are the ones that you're talking about right Mike where you think those have the sort of larger Delta between what's out there and what could be out there yeah I want to hear which which of which if there are any others that do have that Delta that's what I'm getting at yeah it's tricky and I think that's where it's a so protein shake let's use that as an example protein shakes if you think about who the protein shake consumer is probably predominantly male like dude strike you know bulking up a lot of the time you know at least in that world and that's why organic valley when they came to the agency they knew that like all the ads they've been running cuz most of all organic Valley's products are milk and cheese and stuff that they sell at Whole Foods all their commercials are like picturesque sunsets over family farms and our family farmers they just care more than anyone but they knew that when they launched an organic protein shake it's a very different customer than the mom who shot Whole Foods through their other products so they wanted us to come in and say hey we know that it's like a muscle dude that we're selling this to who's typically not in organic you know the big-time organic shopper maybe they are buying two tubs of you know protein powder at GNC or they're buying you know muscle milk so they're like we still want to appeal to that audience with this very you know a protein shake that's made by family farmers so we did this whole funny video that's like you know if Bros liked all the chemical crazy [ __ ] that's in protein shakes if bros keep drinking them they might not last much longer and they'll go extinct and like who's gonna bring the beer pong table when they're gone and like you know like this whole idea of like save a bro get them on an organic protein ship that was sort of like the funny idea that we had that went really really well and it's because the product even though it was healthy is still a liquid that wants to be drank by a consumer who identifies with the marketing it's like if you just try to say all right we're gonna make an oat milk brand that feels you know badass and rock and roll the oat milk customer probably isn't guys who ride Harley Davidsons like they're not drinking oat milk but you're trying to market to them so it's like that's probably not gonna work as well because you've got way more marketing education to do to try to convert new customers into something that they've never drank before water is different for us because everybody drinks water we don't have to explain how to drink water how to use it like everybody drinks water from Harley dudes to metal dudes to yoga moms to everybody and now it's just about from a from a demographic or psychographic standpoint who just thinks this is a cool thing could be a part of their day with you're not trying to convince them why they should drink water right gotcha and so you also went through science or how did science get involved because this when I first heard about this was like oh this is coming out of science labs is that did you bring the idea to them did you meet them and incubate the idea how did that happen in this room for people who don't know what we're talking about science science science is like this weird quasi venture capital firm but also like a weird incubator they launched Dollar Shave Club and a variety of things or helped correct weird combo of like company builder and investor based out of LA yep yeah so we launched liquid death in a bit of a backwards way than most I think beverage brands launched which was we launched a year before we met science we launched liquid death on social media before we ever had product because we knew that with such a crazy idea like liquid death there's nobody who's writing me a check for the idea of liquid death they're like you're this is stupid you're crazy like who would ever buy this it's a negative name it says that retailers will never carry it yadda yadda yadda so I knew that I had to prove it out as a concept on social first before I could actually make people feel like I'm D risking this thing a bit to actually raise so we designed the can to look like a 3d realistic can we shot a fifteen hundred dollar video and then we just put it on Facebook no Twitter no Instagram just Facebook we put maybe I don't know three grand and paid media behind the video and then cut to three months later we have more Facebook followers than Aquafina the video has three million views we've got a range of DMS from hi I am a 7-eleven franchisee in the Midwest how do I get this in my stores or hi I'm the biggest non out beverage distributor in New York City called big geyser how do we talk to a sales representative to distribute this and we didn't even have product yet for no idea of how we were even going to really make it so then I use all of that social traction and distributor interest and retailer interest to then start raising a small friends and family round so we can actually produce physical product because what the minimums are really really high like quarter-million cans is the lowest you can actually produce with a can manufacturer so it's a little bit capital intensive just to even start playing the game how much is a quarter million a quarter of a million of product what would that call I mean if you're just starting what would that cost I mean it all depends what you're filling in there but I mean I mean yeah I mean you're you're talking you know 150 200 250 grand just to like kind of get started probably doing cans so yeah once we once we then kind of raised a little bit we started producing cans we we bottle or should they be can and source our water in Austria in the Alps once we had physical cans that people let me ask you what does that mean whenever people are like oh this is you know spring water from this mountain it's like you know my head is always like this is BS what does this mean does that Matt like phase is true B does that matter so like why do you go get your water from Austria in the Alps like what is that is that is that branding is that like is there something about water that I don't know like why do you have to go there to get you watered so what I mean let's be totally honest water for the most point part I should say for most people is water yeah like if you had people try to even even water snobs if you had them go find taste test Fiji versus Avion versus whatever can they really tell the difference probably not right but I've done this test many times as an Evian drinker Evian versus so Evian and Fiji are taste similar to me Evian versus Crystal Geyser like it tastes different I've bet money and I've got it right before but yeah I think the things that make water that affect the taste of water are the natural minerals and how much of them there are in the water and the pH of the water is it more acidic is it more basic and what those minerals are affect how acidic or how basic it is so when you for us our water comes from the Alps and it literally goes right from the mountain into the camp obviously it goes through filters and things that filter out debris and all that and then we put it through like a pasteurization process that makes sure everything you know it's all clean and good to go but everything in that water is that's the natural mineral profile of the water that has been built up over probably hundreds of years in the mountain and it's like you know naturally alkaline at 7.8 or 7.9 pH it's got a nice mineral level nice mouthfeel when you're drinking it because of the level of minerals so that comes right off that way it's all everything's natural about it almost every major water brand in the US whether that smart water essentia Aquafina Dasani most of those brands they're zinc unit is tap from the that then they reverse osmosis which strips everything out along all the natural minerals all the bad stuff everything so it's literally just like empty water then they have to add in minerals back in to kind of make it taste good so they'll add in the natural things that occur in water but just kind of artificially with just doing it at the factory to kind of make something that has a decent pH and a decent mineral profile that tastes good so those are kind of the two options when you say something is spring water it's very strict from the FDA of what that has to be like to call it spring water you cannot alter the original mineral profile of the water so even if you take it off the mountain if you put it through reverse osmosis and it strips out the natural minerals and you add them back in you can't call it spring water anymore because you've altered the original thing so you know our water like I said that's kind of how we think about it everything we have in our water is natural that's how it comes off the mountain it's kind of its own perfect thing we don't have to go through the whole process of like using municipal tap water from the factory stripping everything out adding stuff in and kind of like creating a right now that's that's okay and you know I've never actually had liquid death is it's flat water though right it's not sparkling and it's not flavored we have a sparkling version but we have a still and a sparkling yeah and as a you sorry just to sort of finish it so you you took that you know you've raised a little bit you do the social media to prove hey we can build a fun brand that people resonate with then you figure it out okay to produce the minimum run I'm gonna need a couple hundred grand to get this thing off the ground and you raise kind of the friends and family round that was from science or afterwards science came about and they wrote a bigger check we raised the friends and family around just to basically cover like a super limited you know the smallest run a product we could do right and then once I finally had a physical can of liquid death for the first time which was probably around October of 2018 we had a guy that we knew who knew someone at science she said hey you guys should really talk to science like they'd probably be all over this so we went and met with science and brought them a physical can and once someone could really hold it and it wasn't just like us showing digital images from social it made it way different it's just like they understood the magic of it and how cool this would be walking around with this or how you know how into this people would be so then we that's when we kind of decided to do a deal with science and over the next two months after that they helped us gear up our D to C launch where we launched online in January of last year and do you think this will be mostly D to C you think this will be retail how do you think about that obviously you're doing both where do you think is the kind of bulk of the business gonna come from I think we've always known it was going to be retail from the beginning we just didn't know how soon do you start really pushing into Rico water is something that you don't want to just order on the internet like you want to be able to buy a water when you're thirsty somewhere right so it's just naturally a retail play versus like you know something like maybe like a Soylent it's like a meal replacement thing you could order those to your front door because right not like you just randomly deciding to go get one of those but now they're pushing into retail as well what your pitch on how big this gets and the way I like these pitches is kind of like bottoms up so it's like you know rather than saying you know well vitamin order sold for this much so maybe we can get that much or more cuz blah but like bottoms up being like you know there's this mini grocery store I don't know if you think that way but like do you do you have that sort of analysis of like I think this gets this big because I can say that there's this many venues or this many grocery stores or this much do you see demand of this so I think we can you know when we grow up we can become this big do you think that way or how do you approach that yeah I think it's a combination of things I mean one you can obviously start what is the size of the bottled water market which in 2019 the bottled water market in the US alone was twenty billion dollars bottled water still water made up a little under fifteen billion of that twenty and sparkling is about three and a half billion of that twenty so it's a massive market and what's the result labored Oh like private label okay okay yeah and flavored stuff in there the biggest retail in terms of doors channel is convenience stores there's like over a hundred and fifty thousand convenience stores and then I think there's maybe I don't know I think there's maybe thirty thousand grocery stores or something like that and then Shenron and on premise like restaurants and bars there's about a million in the US so you can start looking at you know velocities of what certain water brands do in convenience stores we can look at some of our velocities that we're seeing and what they could grow to and yeah you can really start to like forecast out how big this gets but it's like you know well-performing water brands just in 7/11 can be doing 50 million in sales just in 7-eleven in scan sales for like you know you know a decent water brand and that's just 7-eleven who are the top three the top water brands in terms of six scale are as you can probably imagine like Aquafina and Dasani they're both over a billion dollars and it's those are owned by Nestle and or who those owned by Pepsi aquafina of Pepsi the Sonia's cook okay Wow okay that's and then Nestle's the other big one Nestle has a couple brands like Nestle Pure Life and kind of the more budget value water and yeah they're another they're over a billion as well who owns at how owns and how much so Fiji's owned by wonderful brands they're down near you in LA right or I don't know if you're in LA but in LA how much how much revenue do you think Fiji and Evian does I think Fiji's a privately owned company is a bien public I don't know the exact numbers I've seen a couple things so I can't really comment if they're if they're accurate or not but I assume that Fiji Evian they're probably somewhere around like five hundred million a year something like that I guess what would the margin on that be so is it as big as I would think it's not as big as you think really because the retailers they want the most margin on bottled water like they want to mark out bottled water higher than almost any other beverage that they have in the store so the retailer wants a lot of margin then you've got a distributors that need their margin so it's like you really get down it's not like bottled water and some like insane margin for suppliers than other products like like energy drinks probably getting more margin than water which I think the conception is dude they're just bottling water that's like you know you're like selling air yeah but in reality the margin is probably I would guess sub you know sub 30% not above 30% it's kind of my my guess I think most in most beverage they say like you know a target like really solid margin for beverage would be like 40% that's like 50% is like you're killing it right and then it's like I think you get down like 230 is probably like on the low end of so when I used to own a train a hotdog stands in Nashville and when it was really was called southern Sam sweeteners as big as a baby's arm and and I would crush it on bottled water in the daytime bottled water would cost two or three dollars and at nighttime when everyone's drunk you definitely add a little bit more to it I think from Restaurant Depot I think a bottled water was 14 cents or like or good it was like stupid and so I like the hotdogs would like make a little bit of money I would make it after you can make $1,000 a day off bottled water that was where the money was that was the bottled water yeah that's a sales guy you got Sam here yeah man I was talking water like crazy that was where I was that we had this question which was if you had to make a thousand dollars tomorrow but I stripped you of all your kind of like current income streams and your current business how would you go try to make a thousand bucks in a week or whatever and I think Sam's was I go to a hot place I've buy water for 14 cents and go sell them in front of a stadium or something like that in a corner like at the at the stoplight like yeah because like people don't care about the water they more so care about the convenience like a [ __ ] it's right here it's and I totally over thought it and I was like well I guess I would create this online store and I was like nah it's too slow too complicated dude I would I would be like a bender and a like a concert series like the summer concert series that cities has I swear to God I would make a thousand dollars a day in bottled water sales you just you know that's not every day but you crush it at those concerts just selling bottled water that was where I where I would make a killing what other opportunities have you seen that if you weren't starting this business you would be very interested in like things that you've discovered along the way there's two questions right because our audience the listeners for this right we got hundreds of thousands of listeners who are gonna hear this and they're all entrepreneurial types but really you know it's not like they're gonna go and do one of these things but they just love to hear different perspectives it's like you are right in the world few of us even think about on a daily basis so you're seeing thing wasn't seeing unity thinking about things that we don't see which is why you came up with this idea to begin with and so they really do love to hear kind of like you know I've always thought you could do this I said it doesn't have to be a great idea it could be a you know I just noticed that these things really crushes it or these are kind of backwards I think it might be fun to try this do you have anything that that's in that could complete that sentence yeah I mean that is a tough one like I mean I guess obviously like you're always looking for white space right I think where I was really inspired most by my point of view on business and branding is from Bergeon like Richard Branson what you know early in my advertising career when I worked in San Francisco the main account that I worked on was Virgin America the airline so I got like super deep into virgin and and I read you know Richard Branson books and I just would be loved that their model was like we go and try to find a stale category and we make the one really cool fun brand within that category where it almost changes the category where the rest of the category almost has to start adapting like Airlines like nobody was excited to get on an airplane we eat airplane food or anything and then they were the first ones to make planes look like neon blue lighting and like you know TVs in every seat which now is like a common thing in every time right so it was like that really inspired my way of looking at where I would look for things that were like what is something that like you said like cottage cheese like what is something that is extremely boring or like what's a category that just nobody cares about where you can't think of one cool brand in and obviously like if it's something that seems like it could still have appeal it's just a victim of poor brands not getting it and you know just not innovating or whatever it might be and you see an opportunity hey this actually could be a thing that people really would love but it's just been stuck in this like doldrums of branding for so long that it needs something because at the end of the day with especially with packaged goods like branding is so much more important than most suppliers or the core companies think right you know because most companies are started by business people in the most part it's like someone with an MBA someone who understands the nuts and bolts of building a business it's rare that businesses are started by creative people like artists and people that are you know graphic designers and stuff like it's it's two different things and usually what happens is the business folks think really rationally like okay my product contains this so the name of the product should be about that and I should list all the rational reasons why someone should buy this yeah it's like and then that gets them a certain part of the way but then they end up hiring a creative agency to get all these creative thinkers in to build a story around this boring thing to make people actually care about so what I think is interesting is when you have creative people at the very beginning of the process where it's like just considering what the company should be what the name should be what the product should even look like will someone even care about whatever it is you're selling because I think the creative people do have a good sense of culturally what's going on what's cool what do people care about what's the climate business people not so much I feel like they're more in like the nuts and bolts and weaves of like numbers and affection which is hugely important which is why there's so many brands that never get the creative side but still they just become these logistical Swiss Army knives that still get acquired right but it's like just imagine if they had great creative - you might be a two billion dollar brand right you know I'm speaking of water I'm good friends with this guy Scott Harrison from charity:water have you ever met Scott yeah I've never met him I've ever heard of the brand and so so you've heard of the brand because I think they've done a phenomenal job with the brand and so this is just a like we were thinking when we're just brainstorming oh what's another category in a grocery store that you could do this which is definitely a totally legit brainstorm we can do but this is a very different analogy but I think you did the same thing so Scott was a party promoter like you came from a punk-rock background then ads yeah and you went into this CPG space which not that maybe the most conventional path he's a you know party promoter club promoter in New York for ten years you know convincing dudes to buy you know three thousand bottle and three thousand dollar bottles of Grey Goose that they know you know you could go back fifty dollars across the street to get table service right and so then he goes and he you know has a come-to-jesus moment go goes to act si I'm paid the neck I'm giving back and but he's all he knows is how to promote parties all he knows is cool and so he reinvented charity as a cool brand and he has this quote he does when he like tells his story which is it's a quote from someone talking about philanthropy and they say man imagine if we could sell charity with one tenth of the finesse that brand sell toothpaste like imagine if we had one tenth of their marketing power that they do they use on toothpaste imagine how much food we could do in the world and so that's basically what he did where he was alright I'm gonna make a brand that actually stands for these three things and I'm gonna have awesome design because every charity website sucks and you know it looks like they hired their eighth grade cousin till I build it for them and I'm gonna do these with influencers I'm gonna do these print campaigns etc etc and you know he's now been raising you know over a hundred fifty million dollars for the cause he's one of the fastest growing and best charities out there because he did what you did which is he applied cool to a category that was totally uncool before ya know totally and I think there's so many different places where you can think about you know I think cool is a weird word because it's like it can be taken so anyways I think it's like it's less about cool but it's like how do you make it interesting or how do you make it like desirable like I have to have this writing you know but that's what I want to know I mean I want to go back to that first question that Sean kind of dismissed a little whereas like what else is in that category because I think that's that's really that's intriguing to me I mean our there things that you've explored or you're like you know this actually is one of those categories I'm busy now but that would be interesting for someone to change that category I think we're even thinking about that with liquid yeah to like I think liquid death you know is so much bigger than just a water company like at the end of the day like I think we think about ourselves as like a pop culture Factory like we just made we released a liquid death vinyl record recently I don't know if you guys saw that but it was like in less than two weeks we sold 700 vinyl records which is like more than most metal bands actually sell when they release a record on a major metal label and it was like this money idea where we took social media hate comments and made them the lyrics to this metal album and it's like wow a water company now just became a record label for a minute and it's like I think about all these other places where there could be innovation that tied our general mission of like health that's like do we like what if liquid death creates like a chain of heavy-metal yoga studios you know where it's like people who want to do yoga but they don't want to listen to Yanni when they're doing it like is there some room for like some kind of cool like how do you make it a totally new you could do like this experience you could do like tough-guy multi-vitamins if you need to write a healthy product multi-vitamins and be like okay cool actually you know rainbows and Care Bears like maybe we could just make this form factor a little different brand a little different right to speak to a different audience who's you know so you you guys have raised let's say 10 I forget the number 10 or 12 million dollars you're not huge yet you're definitely still getting going how do you decide so like at my company we have a brand that people know and people just if we make stuff people will buy it but in my head I'm always like I don't want to make other stuff let's just like focus on what we're doing and kick ass at that and then maybe eventually expand whereas you've done these little experiments like the vinyl record inmate so maybe you're also trying to uh maybe you weren't joking with your heavy metal yoga thing in my head I'm like no no no [ __ ] that focus what uh do you have like a like logistically how do you decide where to throw a bunch of that and throw money at in order to so let me ask you that so this is what I mean all these other products that we could potentially make that actually sell or actually succeed they double as marketing for the water yeah this marketing that it's profitable it's profitable exactly it's like we made a vinyl record I can't tell you how many eyeballs that got liquid death on from people reposting the album sharing the album talking about it and that album for us to execute including printing the vinyl cost us $12,000 and we've already made do you have work on that how much stat who worked on it but you know did you we hired a guy that we knew that was a friend of a friend who's an incredible metal musician who wrote the whole album his name's Gus Rios he wrote and recorded the whole album his buddy mixed the whole album and his buddy mix stuff for Justin Bieber and all these other guys so we got the whole album recorded we made a commercial for maybe 2 grand on stock footage and my wife edited the video so I was like you know that's all that's all we launched with it was a little launch video made with stock footage and we pressed records and sold the records in our merch store and it's like all that stuff adds together that's why it's like what would it cost to to start let's call it a chain of five looks small heavy metal yoga studios in LA like small little studios not a lot going on you find some you know some instructors like maybe you could actually build that out for call it 500 grand let's just say like you can make you could build a 5 change Ogas to do heavy metal yoga studio chain for a 500 grand what does 500 gram buy you if you try to run one TV spot right during the [ __ ] Oscars like maybe you get a 30-second spot and what's gonna see more lifts and brand evangelism for your brand running one $500,000 commercial during the Oscars or building a chain of five heavy metal yoga studios in LA that gets talked about by every publication heavy metal yoga studio launches in their leg people actually go to it everyone who goes takes and stares and talk it's like that's a wave smarter way to spend your money and you might actually make some of it back if it's a good enough business model you know this is like Elon selling flamethrowers right yeah he is the you know sort of iron man trying to be a badass rockets and you know drilling into underground and electric sports cars so he comes out with a flamethrower for $700 I think it was and he sold he sold like million shit-ton I think it was ten millions of dollars and the whole thing is basically just being like you know feeding the evangelism like you said of the cult of you on of yeah life should be a little more badass we need a little more fire a little more speed and a little more like you know rocketry to in our in our lives and so it's the brand you know when you curate your own new experiences or whatever for the brand you can also control what goes on there so it all plays yoga studios it's going to be coolers of liquid death as the waters act right you know it's like it all kind of my takeaway from this whole podcasts is I'm gonna do I'm gonna do a handful of I'm not gonna launch a yoga studio but a $12,000 vinyl release or something like of that scale is super interesting I need to do more of that do you have one person on your in your team who like does these odd things or is this just like a product like a project that you lead and coordinate so we work with you know we do have like creative agencies that we work with like most of which are run by my friends who I use I knew from the industry they've got small little startups and what's nice about liquid death is because we want to do such cool different things people are willing to kind of work at a nice homey rate because like they want that thing up for their real we're not just ask them to make some you're crazy enough to be willing you're open enough to like try that necessary and say hey look at this amazing thing we did with liquid death and they want the nestle check not the liquid death well they're doing the same thing that you're they're doing they're doing the same thing what you're doing with the vinyl they're like maybe pay for itself but it's also marketing right right exactly so yeah I mean we get a lot of you know smart creative people that are throwing ideas into the mix but you know at the end of the day like you know I'm a very creative focus CEO I think we built like a nice team around us that like is really smart with operations and supply chain and that kind of stuff it's not so much my strong suit and I can you know focus more on the brand and creative side which you know liquid death it's really a brand play you know like and that it's so important and I think building out all these fun things we're talking about of like how do you build this brand that has such an evangelist audience to it and it continues to grow like that's not that's really the focus this is great we're coming up on the hour Sam did you have anything else you know I'm taking notes I'm gonna write down you know to my team and I'm like cuz I have I'm also creative but I definitely am like fiscally conservative and I'm like no no we got to focus and focus on the cash cow but I'm like you're right this dumb [ __ ] that seems dumb but it's awesome you can do that for way cheaper than you think yeah I guess it's just like always think like one of my old bosses I used to work I was the crib director at vaynermedia so Gary Vaynerchuk was like not my boss essentially you know I learned a lot from him in terms of like marketing is really just about day trading attention like marketing is all about attention and it can mission to it or price the price for a billboard you're paying so much per eyeballed it sees it it's like yes it could be effective but you're overpaying for it versus create a yoga studio in LA you might generate even more eyeballs and attention at a way WAY lower spend I think it's just always thinking about who how do I get attention for my brand and what are all the different possible ways that you can get attention what's like the most cost efficient ways to get that and I have to ask was it awesome or not awesome working for him is the guy the real deal or what I love Gary I think he's like an incredible human being like you know I've worked for a lot of corporate folks and I think there's there's a lot of egos there's people who don't care and I think Gary like truly cares like even if you're gonna tell him you're you're quitting like he's gonna be like Oh awesome like do you need any help finding your next thing you know like he's just like he cares and I think that's what he's built his whole company on is like you can build a massive company with like a compassionate point of view on your people and not just being some like tyrant kind of do you think there's any anything about Gary cuz he's a very public presence right he's personally out there a lot and you know anytime you personally put yourself out there because it's putting a part of you out there not the whole thing is there anything that either people don't really know about him or is a misconception that you've seen about him is there anything like that I would say that like just talking like just talking with him normally one-to-one is obviously the volume isn't as loud as it is when he's on camera you know very like he's an entertainer to a degree right now he's an educational business entertainer but he's entertaining to watch like the way he talks like how his passion is like how he's smart like there's plenty of business people who say smart things but not maybe as many that are like it's like in a way he's kind of playing you know a bit of his character but it's like off camera like he's way more mellow I would say then most people think like you know he's I was on I was I was on his podcast or like I forget whatever it's called and he was very nice and I had we he turned it up slowly but yeah he had he wasn't on right away yeah he had to get amped a little that's awesome alright well Mike we'll wrap it up where should people follow you find you if they want to hear more thoughts or slick with death you know give people shout out where people can get more of what they got today yeah I mean most everything happened in with liquid death is on instagram so follow us it's at liquid death on Instagram you know athlete with death on Twitter and liquid death comms or say and yeah that's that's it awesome this is awesome I'm looking at it right now thanks for taking the time I'm in this bad ass sorry if my typing is something you hear on the podcast kids while he was talking well he was talking I was like I am to write this down I had three ideas while you were talking about exactly what you said but you inspired something while you were talking I was like I got to write this down cuz we're gonna do this and if you don't do this like I'm gonna regret it so all these everyone here's typing and yeah I do the same thing I'm like looking up everything you're saying that's a that's a sign of a good podcast though and it's all about speed like that's one thing I always push it's like the idea shelf life these days is very short they give you have a cool idea right now you don't make it tomorrow someone else is probably making it you know it's like right on guys thank you thank you so much for coming on all right thanks guys take care thank you [Music] you [Music]

Are these signs that we are headed toward another Great Depression in 2020? History is repeating itself in this city by creating fake currency to survive its economic collapse. This fake currency comes in the form of wooden dollars and has not been made for around 90 years since The Great Depression. They are even using the same newspaper printer that was made in 1890.

um so ninety years later they're once again printing their own wooden dollars to pass out to members of the community [Music] everyone this is Zach here with Mike waters he's our newest writer at the hustle and Michael this week you wrote a really interesting Sunday story about this small town in Washington that created its own currency tell me a little bit about this place and why they started doing this yeah so the town is called to 9 o laughington it's out in the woods it was known as like this big lumber hub in the early 1900s and one of its claims to fame in the world and especially in the u.s. is the fact that during the Great Depression it had started its own currency and they printed be sort of like fake dollar bills that were on slick thin wooden blocks and they pass it out to members of the community in the early 1930s after one of their only town banks closed down and so people were out of money people were desperate and so they basically started up their own currency back in the 1930s and it was a huge hit to the point where people still collect these like wooden to nine o dollars that are not like legal currency in the federal sense and now though I mean we're facing another unprecedented like economic catastrophe this town they know their history very well in the mayor of this town is basically trying to bring back that program for 2020 so ninety years later they're once again printing their own wooden dollars to pass out to them to the community and they were even using like the same reason like a hundred and thirty year old printer as their mint right yeah yeah in the 1930s it was originally printed on this like newspaper printer from 1890 so even then it was kind of old and and they're using the same exact mint right now to print their currency basically and one reason for that is just the like historical value and the other reason is like even the best forger is probably not gonna do a great job of forging something printed like on an 1890 newspaper printer so it's a little proof so they're starting with a first printing of around $10,000 what's kind of their general plan for for distributing this what's their vision and who is he gonna help exactly yeah so this money again is gonna be distributed not using like US federal dollars but using this like own local wooden currency so the idea behind that first of all is that because this currency only is really like accepted in tune I know you can't go off spending that money anywhere like Amazon is not gonna take your wooden dollars from tonight oh so it's a way to keep the money local and they are targeting especially with this initial ten thousand dollar printing they're targeting low-income residents who've been affected by the pandemic so to qualify you have to prove that you're below the poverty line and that you've been affected in some way by these last few months um and they're pretty they're pretty open to how that latter part of like whether you've been affected is defined and so if you qualify you get a stipend from within the ten thousand dollars and I should also I should also clarify here that this is a town of like eighteen hundred people so ten thousand dollars does go a long way and if it's only targeting a certain population within this community um so although it might not seem much on the scale of a larger city it does mean a lot in a town like this and yeah and basically every business in town is locally run and so almost every business has signed up to accept this money and so people who are given out the wooden dollars can spend it anywhere in town and like I said because it's not official US dollars it's a way to ensure that the money stays local in is boosting local businesses who have also been impacted by the pandemic sure so it's got this kind of twofold effect of helping these businesses that have kind of been beleaguered by the pandemic but also helping provide some kind of recourse for low-income residents right exactly and um you also touched on on a number of other you found tons of examples of other towns doing this internationally which which I thought were really interesting what what is the is this something that might be used in effectively in other towns like I know there's been a little bit of research done on on the effectiveness of local currencies you touch on that a little bit yeah um the research as it stands is a little bit complicated it is really hard to find like exact cause and effects with something like this because there's so many factors at play it's hard to measure exactly to what extent local currencies like this help economic recoveries which is especially what they were designed for but the evidence from research see it seems to be cautiously positive ID probably summarize it which is to say that there are in about like half of the cases there are signs that local currencies have some sort of positive impact on local businesses and on getting people spending and then another half of cases according to one study are kind of inconclusive and it's certainly something that has worked in different places more than others around the world there are plenty of stories especially from the great depression of local currencies like dramatically cutting jobless rates in a certain region while like in the larger country for instance jobless rates might go up and so I mean again it's it's hard to tease out exactly links sometimes but there's plenty of evidence the evidence is like I said cautiously positive I would say sure sure well this is a really interesting story and if you guys want to read it be sure to check out our email on Sunday thanks a lot Michael preciate your time yeah thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]

you know one great quote as always is it are you seeing unrest and protesting and looting where you live I'm saying it because I'm just glued to Twitter and me too you know I'm just scrolling and I can't believe my eyes and it is it so sad there's so many different things going on at the same time and then the the shitty part about that to me is that everybody pulls a different meaning away from it so like if you're bias going in is you know you know if you're a racist in one way you're going to look at this and say oh man they're rooting and they're looting and rioting and this is awful what are those small business owners do why are they where are they getting their store smashed and then if you're somebody else and you're looking at this you're like dude people are sick of it they've hit their breaking point because this has been going on for so long this police brutality and I totally understand what's going on and then other people are looking at it and they're sort of like hey what's like why are these other malicious groups kind of hijacking the movement and just inciting violence and you know antifa or some people believe you know russia china whoever it is who's dropping these pallets of bricks off trying to bait people into violence and you know some people just trying to make the world burn and so there's all these things mixed together and I think whoever you are you're gonna select the evidence that supports your feeling and you're just gonna get stronger you're just gonna see more evidence towards your view and it's gonna make people more divided my friend shared something and it was like four circles and it was like I'm pissed off about the racism in our countries and black lives matter black lives matters has a point I'm pissed off that businesses are getting brewing this is not the right way to do it I'm pissed off as the police because I think most of them are good but a few bad cops ruin for everyone and then I forget the fourth one and then it was like at the center all the circles had a little bit of everything and like you can be here I was like that's how I feel I'm angry it it's sad and so what was the fourth what support circle I don't know what the fourth one was let's see it was really great though did you happen to see this go ahead and see that but no that explains like exact see how I feel you know and how many people feel and you know I think it's really crazy you know there's a whole bunch of things that you hear you learn from these experiences where you're like oh you know that is a sort of a nugget of wisdom or a bit of empathy that I didn't have before and so you know when you see people that are you know one great quote I saw was when you have a thousand good cops and ten bad cops but the good cops don't police the bad cops then have a thousands and then ten bad cops and you know I believe that and then that sort of applies to my life too like in what anytime I sort of stand by and do nothing well injustice is happening that makes me sort of complicit in my own way right and you know I think about little minor examples of that in my own life and then it was George Floyd's George George Floyd's death was murder and the police should be held responsible I think most cops are good but police departments are corrupt and there are some bad cops looting businesses and destroying properties in morale it hurts - cause I empathize and I agree with black five matter protester and believe in then the right to be heard and then right in the middle was like I am here and this is sad right yeah it's really crazy and I know people don't listen this podcast to hear like you know talks about socio-economic issues and racism and whatnot but you know this I think affects everybody is very different than anything that's happened in in my lifetime where you have riots breaking out across the nation all simultaneously and things really do feel like they get a breaking point for many reasons I think also the fact that people were picked up at home for the last three months I don't think that helps necessarily because that's a sort of a bunch of a bunch of you know just water boiling over you know at a certain point as well I agree I saw I agree I don't even love discussing this stuff presents' think about it a lot and I also tend to like they talk about the positive but let me bring something up that I don't think I have bring up brought up and I want to hear your opinion so I don't this doesn't matter and it doesn't change I don't think it should like validate or just not about validate anything I say so like my wife's black my family's black I'll have black children and this was the first time or half parsley black children this was the first time that I was at my house with Sarah my wife and like she broke down she was like I don't I don't know hops he's like I don't know where I fit in on this because she's like a successful black woman she's a guy haven't had a lot of racist stuff happened to me or if any like I and it was and she's like but I yeah it was it was it was just a total mind because I'm like what am I supposed to how am I supposed to I don't I didn't know what to feel I didn't I was like I don't I don't know what to do and it was incredibly exhausting do you you you're Indian do you consider yourself white or not white what definitely considered was of white and nor does anyone who sees me thinks I'm white but I don't know like how but I get what you mean in the sense of like in some ways like do you feel that you're privileged or prejudiced against I think that's a different way of looking at it and like you know my sister so we I was born in Tulsa Oklahoma which is like you know not the most open-minded and racially friendly place and so my sister when she was in kindergarten you know students would would draw a picture of a pig and then write her name on it and cover the body and brown mud and then they would give it to the teacher and the teacher laughed and my sister who always remembers this like she was I don't know six years old and she vividly remembers the teacher sort of looking at this and laughing and saying no no no put it away but like being you know involved in it and I know I don't understand that what's the pig have to do is that because just like a brown brown dirty in the mud you know that sort of thing and and you know I remember you know when she went to my mom it was like why can't be we'd be white said the thing where's like you know asking questions as a kid just trying to understand why am i different what does that mean why do other people think were worse than them that sort of thing I personally never experienced that because I had luckily moved at Oklahoma when I was really young and went to different places where it was it was less so or just got lucky and sort of my experiences around who I was around but I guess I would say like you know when 9/11 happened you know they're not fun to be a brown guy in are you are you any religion a Muslim no under and they just but I wouldn't even do yeah I would be Hindu but you know just that's typically what most of you people are but yeah you know I'm not religious but you know I do grow a beard pretty quick and so like yeah you know like when you go to the airport I don't think you think about how do I look today whereas I think about that so I'm like look I'm not trying to get hassled for no reason here's let me show you before I get on this flight or like you know I had friends who like are Muslim who had like key their house keys taken away from them in TSA because it was like this is potentially a dangerous thing and then like this is my apartment how does that make you feel so the fact that you have to shave are you angry or you wait where do you what's that make you feel like I'm not angry about it you know I I sort of have this opinion that my Bible my personal philosophy if you were gonna boil it down to any one thing is the only thing you have control over is your attitude towards the present moment and so so that's empowering and disempowering rights disempowering because it's like I can't control anything that's going on I can't control how other people feel how they're gonna act I can't control the results I'm gonna get in my life but it's empowering it's like the one thing I control is my attitude towards the moment so that sort of is a super power because then no matter what the situation is no matter what the moment is I can decide what my attitude about it is going to be so for example when something shitty happens to me someone says something shitty or you know I you know get that extra I sort of hate coming to this room while I go through TSA clearance you know the meaning I put on that is of my choosing and if I put the meaning of it that you know I'm less than I'm being wronged that doesn't help me it makes me feel like and so I just decide not to feel that way but I know that like on the grand scheme of things I get off pretty light it's very different than never feeling safe you know going for a jog in your neighborhood or something like that I think you know there's levels to it and I haven't experienced those levels where it would be very very challenging to put a positive meaning on what's going on yeah it's uh it's just a confusing time because you feel so many different emotions and some of them are opposite and I had it like talked to the whole company today which were small let's say twenty or thirty people and I was like I don't know what to say other than if you guys like ever feel out of place somewhere like our company we're gonna we're gonna make you feel safe like we'll hire all types of people we like I wasn't sure if that felt like weak or like like oh like like a barely anything I was like I don't know what I was like I don't know how to handle this other than you're safe here but uh yeah you know I think that's the right approach because it's not about having the answer or the wisdom or the most heartfelt thing and the best speech but like I think it is important if you're the leader to show up as a decent human being in that moment just say look I understand I'm also feeling this crazy mix of emotions I just want to do my best with this anything you know we're gonna we're gonna try to do our best at this I think it goes a long way to just be a decent person and try to be present and visible there versus kind of shying away from it which is what a lot of people do yeah it's crazy and I have a feeling once I have children my opinions gonna change a lot like or not my opinion but my I think I'll learn a lot yeah like having black kids or part by kids I think well I'll maybe I'll see something that I didn't really see and one more thing which you know we can cut all this out if people tell us later hey you shouldn't talked about this on the pot but did you watch The Trevor Noah thing that's on YouTube or whatever I did not I'm typically not a fan of his I think that a lot of times he says is the wrong take so I I tend to avoid him but I would watch it if you suggest it i-i'm-i'm cuz he I don't think he's that funny but I did watch this thing and you know he brings up like what's going on he's like yeah a lot of people are looking at what's going on and saying well this isn't right either right of course police should not murder citizens that's wrong but also rioting and looting and destroying things is also not right and what his point was which I think made me better understand what was going on his point was like you got to think about this what is society you know a society is essentially a contract it is an agreement amongst a group of people up here's what's right and wrong of how we're gonna act here's the behaviors that are tolerated here's the babes that are not tolerated he goes so what you're saying is that one side of contract you know if we're if we go to contract together and you're just breaching your side of the contract regularly and without recourse and I just see wow this guy just keeps breaching his side of the contract then I also have no no desire or incentive to uphold my side of the contract he goes you'll see somebody that's homeless and you know they don't go and just murder necessarily because because they're in a bad position they say look these are the rules of the game I'm losing in the current game or I have not been able to sort of get to an advantage position in this game but like I still respect that we're in a game together and there are rules of this game he goes what you're seeing now is that a group of people you know black people in America feel like the contract has just been breached over and over and over again where they're you know unnecessary and unjust violence against us and so now we're gonna breach the contract - and we're gonna sort of make it very known what it feels like when the contract is being breached for apparently no reason and it doesn't seem like a positive thing and so that made me look at you know when somebody is either protesting whether it's peacefully or not basically when somebody's rioting and they're creating a sort of unsafe environment for all it's sort of I don't know it sort of explained to me why somebody would behave that way it's because if you feel like the other parties just turned breached the contract and then there's no recourse then it's like I'm gonna terminally breach the contract and and we'll see we'll see how it feels and now both sides feel what it's like when the societal contract gets totally breached I definitely feel the tension I feel it I feel it definitely feels like like almost like the end of the world a little bit it's like there's it's like a small it's like in the same way having a new puppy is just like a small taste of having a baby it's like that's how I feel right now like I'm like if like the world if like everything that I believed in is gonna come to an end it's gonna take a little a little like this right you know it's there every sad story there's also an inspiring story where people are you know waking up the next day and going and cleaning up the city and people standing together and you know I think there's a lot of really positive things going on - and I think that's the you know that's the silver lining or that's the other side of the coin here where where is progress being made and [Music] [Applause] [Music]

Renting vs buying a home, which one is the better choice in 2020? Shaan Puri explains why it is a better idea to rent instead of buying a home. Sam Parr asks Shaan if he regrets buying his home and he answers that he does regret it. According to Shaan, everything that comes with owning a home is not worth it and he thinks it is a better idea to rent instead.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
where I try to say this to everyone and they hate hearing it let me ask you a question real quick and we don't have to you you bought your house so your house is in a you could say where you live if you want but we'll say it's a nice neighborhood that still has some issues in San Francisco it's like I would say one of the less nice neighborhoods overall but it's still desirable because it's like in a hipster area do you regret buying your home yes do you as your what you can want to say what your rights is is that your new house or not yeah sure so the new house front is seven grand a monk and was that less than your mortgage yeah it's less overall because with a house you have you know property tax you have your mortgage and then you have like you know sort of the house maintenance issues that come up over time that you know we're just miscellaneous things do you think you'll make it a bit money a little bit less but similar you think you're gonna make any money off of this deal not really and that's good you know because selling house has a lot of fees so like you know when you buy a house if you want to sell it the next day you basically need to sell it for 5% more just with the broker fees and then there's like the transfer tax and then there's you know all the staging costs you know it's gonna cost us 15 grand to stage the place and fix up the paint and the you know little scuffs and scratches that we've had along the way and then our you know we didn't take care of a long as good as we should have so we gotta get a landscaper so there's all these costs to selling so it's gonna come out that you broke even any wood for free or as they come out that you just lived for a crate or whatever the yeah I lived for I lived it basically about what I could have lived renting it or maybe a little bit ahead we'll see how it Nets out like it's unknown right like with the cove it and stuff like we don't even know you know for somebody to come do an open house tours like a lot of friction now it's like wear your mask signed this waiver blah blah blah so I don't know where it's gonna sell for but the reason I regret it is not because of any of that you know right before I bought the house like I had been house hunting and like a week before I was hanging out with soui Antilles you know 100 times wealthier than I am and I asked him I said do you own your place and I was hanging out at his house he says no why don't you own like you know just the most baller house here because you could and he was like oh yeah no I like the you know I like the flexibility on taint blah blah and I was like mmm it seems like he just kind of didn't give me the full answer there so I asked him it again at the very end up walking st. want to make you feel bad yeah I was walking to my uber and I was like so if you were me would you buy and he goes no I hope wait why and he goes he goes really simple he's like I just think I can get a better cap rate and better return on my money essentially doing other things than than buying a home so like you know you put your down payment down 20% your home in our case 25% and that money sits in your home and it's appreciating at the rate of your home appreciation which is like you know very specific well I think yeah historically across all homes I think it's 3% yeah exactly the San Francisco did a lot better during a certain era where was like 10-15 percent a year but his point was basically like yeah like I know that my if I take all my options for how to deploy a dollar you know stock market I can expect about a 7% return and you know I can do private you know startup investing I can do private equity I can put my money hedge fine I can do multi kind of real estate there's like all these things I can do putting it into a down payment of a house is not the best way and on top of that it doesn't spit off any cash flow so like if I do if I just buy a home and I rent it out to someone I get the appreciation of a home plus I get the cash flow every month we're trying to say this to everyone and they hate hearing it and I understand why they keep hearing it but I think buying how in our in our in Austin all of our staff buys homes and I'm like look don't tell me you're buying this house because it's a good investment tell me you're buying this house because you want to like when I bought my stake last night I didn't think that this $30.00 is a good investment I did it because I thought why not a financial investment but a good investment like it made me happy I wanted it I work hard so I can have things I want so if you're so like if you buy your house don't tell me you're doing it because it's you're just throwing away money on rent right tell me you're doing it because it's gonna make you happier because you want to because that is a good reason but to say that it's an investment that's you could say that it's a great way to preserve wealth but it absolutely in most cases is not a great way to make it what else right yeah exactly yeah and and I don't blame anybody who thinks that I thought that five seven years ago I also said right isn't renting like flushing money down the toilet and if you buy your home you have equity and blah blah blah and I learned pretty quickly first person I talked to they were like no that's not exactly how it works so yeah if you haven't gone down that rabbit hole go down the red hole because they sort of American dream of like own your own home with your you know your white picket fence in your backyard that is pretty silly and yeah it also made a lot more sense with the ratio of income to housing prices was closer than it is now now it's significantly different out of that and you face like you know risk right like when I'm in my home and now boom remote work is on the rise being in a city is not not the thing anymore it's like oh you know people take it for granted that these things just sort of go up and you know you're one shift away you know as soon as elem us can make the Hyperloop work where I can commute long distances in like 20 minutes or less then people are gonna want to go live further away have way more you know space resources and whatnot and not want to be impacted you know like I sardine into a city a lot of people will choose that and so your one technological shift or one policy shift or in this case one policy plus biological you know terror away from not wanting people not wanting to be in a certain type of real estate class like the way the real estate is now struggling because of because of what's going on you get a whole lot of unemployment and now people can't pay the rents and you know every month rents are dropping it was like 99 percent of people pay their rent last month on the multifamily stuff that I I read ninety percent of people are paying their rent and if that dips below you know a certain number maybe it's 82 percent or whatever it is now all of a sudden you're underwater in a multi-family real estate the way that I like to live because so I've been an entrepreneur since I was 16 making money on my own not necessarily all the time a lot of a lot of money but like having to like go out and hunt and kill each week and I like am allergic to like really big purchases and I'm allergic to getting locked into stuff and I actually think that me being allergic to that has actually hurt me I think that had I increased my overhead on some things my overheads really cheap I had I increased my overhead I actually would have worked harder to like have to like fulfill that overhead but now I mean if I don't work for many for very long I don't even know how long maybe forever I'm fine and I just prefer to be on that defense cockroach than putting you know and say forces so you got to put down three or four hundred thousand dollars on home I'm like a I don't wanna that's scary I don't want to do that you know what I mean yeah and so I've never had the courage to do it [Music] [Applause] [Music]

because they were spending like you know 3 million a month on AWS something crazy okay couple things I thought were interesting one you use you posted something about this thing called mode points what is that me yeah did you post something about moe points no what is no points it's just I thought it's your friend who's doing it it's basically like oh my friend yet lo yes he just launched it yeah Moe my friend Moe okay so what it is is yeah I was like what the heck I didn't even remember the name my friend Moe helps people with points that's funny he'll love that we're talking about so Moe points so Moe it's my friend Moe him and Ramone grew up together in Moe's from Afghanistan by way of where's Ramon from Netherlands and then moved here and they used to have a business it's shut down now so I could talk about it where they would buy and sell airline points and he became an expert on how to maximize points and so I'm getting into this now and so for example if there's all these ways that you can like spending money on advertising on this on that you can maximize your points and fly for free forever for years and so he would teach me how to do it myself and I was like whoa don't listen to a course and so that's what it is let's let's let's pick them out though is it moe points com Moe points com yeah I checked it out cuz I was pretty interested in this like in the same way that you want like a tax guy to help you save money on the back end you know whenever you do likes pretty significant credit card spending and a lot of times if you own your own business you can rack up a lot of spending on credit cards I hate going and figuring this stuff out I just feel like it's a waste of my brain and it's a waste of my time together like optimize my spending and buy points that I can travel free and all this stuff but I think no it's valuable and so I was hoping to get like what's the shortcut what's the like you know either you do it for me or like what's the 80/20 give me the few things I can do that will give me the highest return on my time and effort because I know I'm sort of wasting this opportunity and I don't want to go I'm an expert in the stuff but if you're an expert fantastic so I signed up for it oh great I make sure he knows so you know points are interesting I just got into him recently so I earn maybe 300,000 to 400,000 points a month and that translates to 1% of that in cash value so if I spent a million dollars a year I'm through my credit card which sounds like a lot if you're just an individual and that is a lot if you're an individual but your business that's nothing I get $100,000 cash back now here's the cool thing that cash back in most cases is tax-free so in if you live in San Francisco that's the equivalent of getting a salary of 180 grand or a hundred job yeah and so it's great and so I've actually met some entrepreneurs who are I think you can get up to three hundred sixty thousand dollars some of the count was gonna like tweet at me and say I got it wrong but I'm almost positive and it's controversial I'm almost positive being up to $3,000 in cash back and so I know this one lady who's got this flour company and she gets three hundred fifty thousand dollars in cash back income a year yeah that's great I have a friend who he basically negotiate with his investors he's like I'd like to pay the AWS bill for my company on my personal credit card and so he earned like whatever Amex double black platinum gold whatever it is like the highest tier for life because they were spending like you know three million a month on AWS something crazy and so like he's like oh if I ever want to fly I fly first-class now I get like three equinoxes I get free this I get free that because that's the person like the highest tier of Amex and he's like yeah I got lifetime because during my company I just asked can I just put this on this card and keep that you know tied to my name and they didn't and so and so that's what most trying to do now it's just like a course and hand hand-to-hand combat like consultation we're trying to help people but that is kind of interesting to like log in to a portal and or like technology and it does it for you that is pretty amazing and and your transaction fee is either upfront fee or you take a you skim a little that is incredibly interesting you [Music] [Applause] [Music]

do you regret buying your home yes Sam what's up what's going on let me pull up some of our documents I'm in Austin still and what's what's what's a with the world like in Austin right now crazy everything's crazy I don't think it's as bad as San Francisco but the world is crazy I I decided to we got a new office down here and so I've rented a house to see everyone and it's cool Austin's a great city what do you thinks gonna happen to San Francisco do you think it's gonna like is this gonna be the end of San Francisco being like the place I think so yeah I think so for a couple reasons you know right now I'm selling my house yeah so say you're your house looks different you're decorating it to sell aren't you yeah I am trying to sell my house right now so it's about to go up for sale and I'm trying to move to the suburbs of the Bay Area but and so right now because I'm doing that I'm in the middle of the market and listening to people I'm securing you know what are they what's like a mic is the market hot to sell am I gonna get a good price when I try to go look for something else is there a lot of stuff available or is it a bidding war and you know just like you would expect there's sort of a you know a flight to the flight to space right now and not like the space expand I'm talking about like physical house space people in the urbanisation yeah do religious people are leaving cities the leaving San Francisco for sure so a lot of people were in San Francisco were here because of the career opportunities and now that the tech companies are saying you know either we are already remote or we're going remote or way more remote friendly and your work from home for the server foreseeable future here there's basically no the premium the extreme premium I mean like one bedroom for four grand a month two bedrooms six grand a month you know type of rents to be in the city and so like you know when a when a studio condo is a million dollars in the city you know if you don't have to pay that you're not going to and so people want space people want more affordability and people want to be away from like a whole bunch of other people from this virus and so that is driving a lot of people out of the cities now some people say oh that's just temporary personally I don't think so I don't think you can put the genie back in the bottle once the companies start letting you be removed and it doesn't matter where you're physically located why would you live in a more expensive area only if that lifestyle really appeals to you which it will for like twenty something year olds right to be in cities but right now you get the twenty something year olds and the 30 something year olds because the 30 something year olds are there for their career and that's gonna go away I feel like I've been in Austin for a week now I'm gonna stay for another week maybe I'll stay one more week down here it is definitely happier like the way of life like it for me and for many others I understand why you'd happier here like dude my new house I got I got a pool I'm like a swimming pool like what is this this is amazing that makes me happy just looking at the swimming pool I like it too my thing though is I miss San Francisco I want to come back I do miss a little bit of a struggle I also miss the people I hate the people and a dangerous San Francisco has like actual you know real problems with crime and homelessness and stuff like that I don't think anybody wants that and where they're living it I think you know there's part of it that's the energy of the city I love being New York I love being at emphasis come around all these energizing interesting ambitious people a bunch of single people but then there's just like crime and homelessness and like extreme expenses that put a burden on you and I think that's nobody likes that I almost feel like not a real way but just because I can't think of a better word a little homeless where I'm like well where the [ __ ] is my place now like where's my like you know yeah you and I we're not quite similar you've done it more than I have but me too and a lesser extent I've lived in many different cities and I finally felt like I had a home in San Francisco and now I'm like [ __ ] like it's wait it's like damn it's way different and so I'm I'm pretty sad about it to be honest like I've been like depressed over it I'm also sad obviously about all the other shit's going on is it are you seeing unrest and protesting and looting where you live I'm seeing it because I'm just glued to Twitter and me too you know I'm just scrolling and I can't believe my eyes and it is it so sad there's so many different things going on at the same time and then the the shitty part about that to me is that everybody pulls a different meaning away from it so like if you're biased going in is you know did you know if you're a racist in one way you're going to look at this and say oh man they're rooting and they're looting and rioting and this is awful what are those small business owners do why are they why are they getting the store smashed and then if you're somebody else and you're looking at this you're like dude people are sick of it they've hit their breaking point because it's been going on for so long this police brutality and I totally understand what's going on and then other people are looking at it and they're sort of like hey what's like why are these other malicious groups kind of hijacking the movement and just inciting violence and you know antifa or some people believe you know Russia China whoever it is who's dropping these pallets of bricks off trying to bait people into violence and you know some people just rying to make the world burn and so there's all these things mixed together and I think whoever you are you're gonna select the evidence that supports your feeling and you're just gonna get stronger you're just gonna see more evidence towards your view and it's gonna make people more divided my friend shared something and it was like four circles and it was like I'm pissed off about the racism in our countries and black lives matter black lives matters has a point I'm pissed off that businesses are getting ruined this is not the right way to do it I'm pissed off as the police because I think most of them are good but a few bad cops ruined [ __ ] for everyone and then I forget the fourth one and then it was like at the center all the circles had a little bit of everything and like you can be here I was like that's how I feel I'm angry at it's sad circle I don't know what the fourth one was let's see it was really great though did usually happy to see this girl I don't see that but no that explains like exactly how I feel you know and how many people feel and you know I think it's really great you know there's a whole bunch of things that that you hear you learn from these experiences where you're like oh you know that is a sort of a nugget of wisdom or and a bit of empathy that I didn't have before and so you know when you see people that are you know one great quote I saw was when you have a thousand good cops and ten bad cops but the good cops don't police the bad cops thousands and ten bad cops and you know I believe that and then that sort of applies to my life too like in what anytime I sort of stand by and do nothing well injustice is happening that makes me sort of complicit in my own way right and you know I think about little minor examples of that in my own life and then it was George Floyd's George George Floyd's death was murder and the police should be held responsible I think most cops are good but police departments are corrupt and there are some bad cops looting businesses and destroying properties in morale it hurts the cause I empathize and I agree with black five matter protester and believe in then the right to be heard and then right in the middle was like I am here and this is sad right yeah it's really crazy and I know people don't listen Spock has to hear like you know talks about socio-economic issues and racism and whatnot but you know this I think affects everybody is very different than anything that's happened in my lifetime where you have riots breaking out across the nation all simultaneously and things really do feel like they've hit a breaking point for many reasons I think also the fact that people were picked up at home for the last three months I don't think that helps necessarily because that's a sort of a bunch of a bunch of you know just water boiling over you know at a certain point as well I agree I saw I agree I don't even love discussing this stuff as I think about it a lot and I also tend to like they talk about the positive but let me bring something up that I don't think I have bring up brought up and I want to hear your opinion so I don't this doesn't matter and it doesn't change I don't think it should like validate or just not about validate anything I say so like my wife's black my family's black I'll have black children and this was the first time or half partially black children this was the first time that I was at my house with Sarah my wife and like she broke down she was like I don't I don't know how she's like I don't know where I fit in on this because she's like a successful black woman she's a guy haven't had a lot of racist stuff happened to me or if any like I yeah and it was and she's like but I yeah it was it was it was just a total mind [ __ ] because I'm like [ __ ] what am I supposed to how am I supposed to I don't I don't know what to feel I didn't I was like I don't I don't know what to do and it was incredibly exhausting do you you you're Indian do you consider yourself white or not white what definitely considered was of white and nor does anyone who sees me thinks I'm white but well I don't know like how but I get what you mean in the sense of like in some ways like do you feel that you're privileged or prejudiced against I think that's a different way of looking at it and like you know my sister so we I was born in Tulsa Oklahoma which is like you know not the most open-minded and racially friendly place and so my sister when she was in kindergarten you know students would would draw a picture of a pig and then write her name on it and cover the body and brown mud and then they would give it to the teacher and the teacher laughs my sister who always remembers this like she was I don't know six years old and she vividly remembers the teacher sort of looking at this and laughing and saying no no no put it away but like being you know involved in it and I never I don't understand that what's the pig have to do is that because just like a brown brown dirty in the mud you know that sort of thing and and you know I remember you know when she went to my mom it was like why can't be we'd be white aside to thing where's like you know asking questions as a kid just trying to understand why am i different what does that mean why do other people think were worse than them that sort of thing I personally never experienced that cuz I had luckily moved out of Oklahoma when I was really young and went to different places where it was it was less so or just got lucky and sort of my experiences around who I was around but I guess I would say like you know when 9/11 happened you know they're not fun to be a brown guy in are you are you any religion a Muslim no under and they just but I wouldn't even do yeah would be Hindu but you know just that's typically what most any people are but yeah you know I'm not religious but you know I do grow a beard pretty quick and so like yeah you know like when you go to the airport I don't think you think about how do I look today whereas I think about that so I'm like look I'm not trying to get hassled for no reason here's let me shave before I get on this flight or like you know I had friends who like are Muslim who had like key their house keys take it away from them in TSA because it was like this is you know potentially a dangerous thing and then like this is my apartment how does that make you feel so the fact that you have to shave are you angry or you wait where do you what's that make you feel like I'm not angry about it you know I I sort of have this opinion that my Bible my personal philosophy if you were going to boil it down to any one thing is the only thing you have control over is your attitude towards the present moment and so so that's empowering and disempowering right so it's disempowering because it's like [ __ ] I can't control anything that's going on I can't control how other people feel how they're gonna act I can't control the results I'm gonna get in my life but it's empowering it's like the one thing I control is my attitude towards the moment so that sort of is a superpower because then no matter what the situation is no matter what the moment is I can decide what my attitude about it is gonna be so for example when something shitty happens to me someone says something shitty or you know I you know get that extra I sort of hate coming to this room while I go through TSA clearance you know the meaning I put on that is of my choosing and if I put the meaning of it that you know I'm less than I'm being wronged that doesn't help me it makes me feel like [ __ ] and so I just decide not to feel that way but I know that like on the grand scheme of things I get off pretty light it's very different than never feeling safe you know going for a jog in your neighborhood or something like that I think you know there's levels to it and I haven't experienced those levels where it would be very very challenging to put a positive meaning on what's going on yeah it's a it's just a confusing time because you feel so many different emotions and some of them are opposite and I had to like talk to the whole company today which were small let's say 20 or 30 people and I was like I don't know what to say other than a few guys like ever feel out of place somewhere like our company we're gonna we're gonna make you feel safe like we'll hire all types of people we like I wasn't sure if that felt like weak or like like oh like like a barely anything I was like I don't know what I was like I don't know how to [ __ ] handle this other than you're safe here but yeah you know I think that's the right approach because it's not about having the answer or the wisdom or the most heartfelt thing and the best speech but like I think it is important if you're the leader to show up as a decent human being in that moment just say look I understand I'm also feeling this crazy mix of emotions I just want to do my best with this anything you know we're gonna we're gonna try to do our best at this I think it goes a long way to just be a decent person and try to be present and visible there versus kind of shying away from it which is what a lot of people do yeah it's crazy and I have a feeling once I have children my opinions gonna change a lot like or not my opinion but my I think I'll learn a lot yeah like having black kids or part black kids I think well I'll maybe I'll see something that I didn't previously see and one more thing which you know we can cut all this out if people tell us later hey you shouldn't talked about this on the pot but did you watch The Trevor Noah thing that's posted on YouTube or whatever I did not I'm typically not a fan of his I think that a lot of times he says is the wrong take so I I tend to avoid him but I would watch it if you suggest it avoid him cuz he I don't think he's that funny but I did watch this thing and you know he brings up like what's going on he's like yeah a lot of people are looking at what's going on and saying well this isn't right either right of course police should not murder citizens that's wrong but also rioting and looting and destroying things is also not right and what his point was which I think made me better understand what was going on his point was like you got to think about this what is society you know a society is essentially a contract it is an agreement amongst a group of people up here's what's right and wrong of how we're gonna act here's the behaviors that are tolerated here's the babes that are not tolerate he goes so what you're saying is that one side of a contract you know if we're if we go into a contract together and you're just breaching your side of the contract regularly and without recourse and I just see wow this guy just keeps breaching his side of the contract then I also have no no desire or incentive to uphold my side of the contract he goes you'll see somebody that's homeless and you know they don't go and just murder necessarily because because they're in a bad position they say look these are the rules of the game I'm losing in the current game or have not been able to sort of get to an advantage position in this game but like I still respect that we're in a game together and there are rules of this game he goes what you're seeing now is that a group of people you know black people in America feel like the contract has just been breached over and over and over again where they're you know unnecessary and unjust violence against us and so now we're gonna breach the contract too and we're gonna sort of make it very known what it feels like when the contract is being breached for apparently no reason and it doesn't seem like a positive thing and so that made me look at you know when somebody is either protesting whether it's peacefully or not peacefully when somebody's rioting and they're creating a sort of unsafe environment for all it's sort of I don't know sort of explained to me why somebody would behave that way it's because if you feel like the other party is just turned breached the contract and then there's no recourse then it's like I'm gonna terminally breach the contract and and we'll see we'll see how it feels and now both sides feel what it's like when the societal contract gets totally breached I definitely feel the tension I feel it I feel it definitely feels like like almost like the end of the world a little bit it's like there's it's like a small it's like in the same way having a new puppy is just like a small taste of having a baby it's like that's how I feel right now like I'm like it's like the world if like everything that I believed in is gonna come to an end it's gonna take a little a little like this right you know it's there every sad story there's also an inspiring story where people are you know waking up the next day and going and cleaning up the city and people standing together and you know I think there's a lot of really positive things going on too and I think that's the you know that's the silver lining or that's the other side of the coin here where is progress being made and there's this guy there's this guy he's a listener I actually forget his name I think his name is Zach I told you about him he's from Utah he called me the other he calls me like every week like hey you gonna come to Utah now you're gonna come to you did he call you y'all talking about he calls me every week and he called me like a Sunday ago when there's all this Corona thing was go like it was like bad Corona and I just got some bad news and he called me I was like quick [ __ ] call me or like I like I lost my temper with them so first of all if you're listening guy forget your name but my apologies you just caught me at a bad time he's [ __ ] calling me and I was so angry about the world and so anyway he was calling me about coming to Utah I'm like maybe I need to get out to Utah right now so a guy like I feel like I'm afraid to be around the world at the moment so maybe I'll go out there let me ask you a question real quick and I mean we don't have to owe you you bought your house so your house is in a you could say where you live if you want but we'll say it's a nice neighborhood that still has some issues in San Francisco it's like I would say one of the less nice neighborhoods I'm just going over all but it's still desirable because it's like in the hipster area do you regret buying your home yes do you as your what you can want to say what your rights is is that your new house or not yeah sure so the new house front is seven grand a monk and was that less than your mortgage yeah it's less overall because with the house you have you know property tax you have your mortgage and then you have like you know sort of the house maintenance issues that come up over time that you know we're just miscellaneous things do you think you'll make it a bit money a little bit less but similar you think you're gonna make any money off of this deal not really and that's good you know because selling house has a lot of fees so like you know when you buy a house if you want to sell it the next day you basically need to sell it for 5% more just with the broker fees and then there's like the transfer tax and then there's you know all the staging costs you know it's gonna cost us 15 grand to stage the place and fix up the paint and the you know little scuffs and scratches that we've had along the way and then our you know we didn't take care of a long as good as we should have so we gotta get a landscaper so there's all these costs of selling so it's gonna come out that you broke even any wood for free or as they come out that you just lived for a crate or whatever the yeah I lived for I lived it basically about what I could have lived renting it or maybe a little bit ahead we'll see how it Nets out like it's unknown right like with the cove it and stuff like we don't even know you know for somebody to come do an open house tourists like a lot of friction now it's like wear your mask signed this waiver blah blah blah so I don't know where it's gonna sell for but the reason I regret it is not because of any of that you know right before I bought the house like I had been house hunting and like a week before I was hanging out with soui Antilles you know one times wealthier than I am and I asked him I said do you own your place and I was hanging out at his house he says no don't you own like you know just the most baller house here because you could and he was like oh yeah no I like the you know I like to flex a bit of renting blah blah and I was like mmm seems like he just kind of didn't give me the full answer there so I asked him it again at the very end of walk even want to make you feel bad yeah talking about uber and I was like so if you were me would you buy he goes no I hope wait why and he goes he goes really simple he's like I just think I can get a better cap rate and better return on my money essentially doing other things than buying a home so like you know you put your down payment down 20% your home in our case 25% and that money sits in your home and it's appreciating at the rate of your home appreciation which is like you know varies resonated well I think yeah historically across all homes I think it's 3% yeah exactly the San Francisco did a lot better during a certain era where was like 10-15 percent a year but his point was basically like yeah like I know that my if I take all my options for how to deploy a dollar you know stock market I can expect about a 7% return and you know I can do private you know startup investing I can do private equity I can put my money with hedge fund I could do multi find real estate there's like all these things I can do putting it into a down payment of a house is not the best way and on top of that it doesn't spit off any cash flow so like if I do if I just buy a home and I rent it out to someone I get the appreciation of a home plus I get the cash flow every month we're trying to say this to everyone and they hate hearing it and I understand why they hate hearing it but I think buying how in our in our in Austin all of our staff buys homes and I'm like look don't tell me you're buying this house because it's a good investment tell me you're buying this house because you want to like when I bought my stake last night I didn't think that this $30.00 is a good investment I did it because I thought why it's not a financial investment but a good investment like it made me happy I wanted it I work hard so I can have things I want so if you're so like if you buy your house don't tell me you're doing it because it's you're just throwing away money on rent right tell me you're doing it because it's gonna make you happy or because you want to because that is a good reason but to say that it's an investment that's [ __ ] you could say that it's a great way to preserve wealth but it absolutely in most cases is not a great way to make them well right yeah exactly yeah and I don't blame anybody who thinks that I thought that five seven years ago I would have also said it isn't renting like flushing money down the toilet and if you buy your home you have equity blah blah blah and I learned pretty quickly first person I talked to that were like no that's not exactly how it works so yeah if you haven't gone down that rabbit hole go down the RAM hole because they sort of American dream of like own your own home with your you know your white picket fence in your backyard that is pretty silly and yeah it also made a lot more sense with the ratio of income to housing prices was closer than it is now now it's significantly different out of that and you face like you know risk right like when I'm in my home and now boom remote work is on the rise being in a city is not not the thing anymore it's like oh [ __ ] you know people take it for granted that these things just sort of go up and you know you're one shift away you know as soon as Elon Musk can make the Hyperloop work where I can commute long distances in like 20 minutes or less then people are gonna want to go live further away have way more you know space resources whatnot and not want to be impacted you know like I started eating into a city a lot of people will choose that and so you're one technological shift or one policy shift or in this case one policy plus biological you know terror away from not wanting people not wanting to be in a certain type of real estate class like the way a family in real estate is now struggling because of because of what's going on you get a whole lot of unemployment and now people can't pay the rent and you know every month rents are dropping it was like 99% of people pay their rent last month on the multifamily stuff that I read ninety percent of people are paying their rent and if that dips below you know a certain number maybe it's 82 percent or whatever it is now all sudden you're underwater in a multi-family real estate the way that I like to live because so I've been an entrepreneur since I was 16 making money on my own not necessarily all the time a lot of a lot of money but like having to like go out and hunt and kill each week and I like am allergic to like really big purchases and I'm allergic to getting locked into stuff and I actually think that that me being allergic to that has actually hurt me I think that had I increased my overhead on some things my overheads really cheap I had I increased my overhead I actually would have worked harder to like have to like fulfill that overhead but now I mean if I don't work for many for very long I don't even know how long maybe forever I'm fine and I just prefer to be on that defense cockroaches and putting you know in San Francisco you got to put them three or four hundred thousand dollars on home I'm like a [ __ ] I don't wanna that's scary I don't want to do that you know what I mean yeah and so I've never had the courage to do it okay um a couple things I thought were interesting [Music] one you usually posted something about this thing called mode points what is that me yeah did you post something about mow point no what is no points it's just I thought it's your friend who was doing it it's basically like oh my friend yet no yes he just launched it yeah Moe my friend Moe okay so what it is is yeah I was like what the heck I didn't even remember the name my friend Moe helps people with points that's funny I love that we're talking about so Moe points so Moe it's my friend Moe him and Ramone grew up together in most from Afghanistan by way of where's Ramon from Netherlands and then moved here and they used to have a business it's shut down now so I could talk about it where they would buy and sell airline points and he became an expert on how to maximize points and so I'm getting into this now and so for example if there's all these ways that you can like inter spending money on advertising on this and that you can maximize your points and fly for free forever for years and so he would teach me how to do it myself and I was like whoa turn this into a course and so that's what it is let's let's pick them out though is it moe points comm moe points calm yeah I checked it out because I was pretty interested in this like in the same way that you want like a tax guy to help you save money on the back end you know whenever you do likes pretty significant credit card spending and a lot of times if you own your own business you can rack up a lot of spending on cards I hate going and figuring this stuff out I just feel like it's a waste of my brain and it's a waste of my time to go or like optimize my spending and buy points so I can travel free and look all this stuff but I think no it's valuable and I was hoping to get like what's the shortcut what's the like you know either you do it for me or like what's the 80/20 give me the few things I can do that will give me the highest return on my time and effort because I know I'm sort of wasting this opportunity and I don't want to go become an expert in the stuff but if you're an expert fantastic so I signed up for it oh great I make sure he knows so you know points are interesting I just got into him recently so I earn maybe 300,000 to 400,000 points a month and that translates to 1% of that in cash value so if I spent a million dollars a year on through my credit card which sounds like a lot if you're just an individual and that is a lot if you're an individual but your business that's nothing I get $100,000 cash back now here's the cool things that cash fact in most cases is tax-free so in if you live in San Francisco that's the equivalent of getting a salary of 180 grand or yeah and so it's great and so I've actually met some entrepreneurs who I think you can get up to three hundred sixty thousand dollars some of the Countians gonna like tweet at me and say I got it wrong but I'm almost positive and it's controversial I'm almost up to 350 thousand dollars in cash back and so I know this one lady who's got this flour company and she gets three hundred fifty thousand dollars in cash back income a year yeah that's great I have a friend who he he basically negotiate with his investors he's like I'd like to pay the AWS bill from a company on my personal credit card and so he earned like whatever Amex double black platinum gold whatever it is like the highest tier for life because they were spending like you know three million a month on AWS but they crazy and so like he's like oh if I ever want to fly I fly first-class now I get like three eccrine odds I get freed this I get three that because that's the person like the highest tier of Amex and he's like yeah I got lifetime because during my company I just asked can I just put this on this card and keep that you know tied to my name and and so and so that's what Moe's trying to do now it's just like a course and hand hand-to-hand combat like consultation we try to help people but that is kind of interesting too like logged into a portal and like technology and it does it for you that is pretty amazing and and your transaction fee is either upfront fee or you take you skim a little that is incredibly interesting I like it okay so have another random idea I want to talk about so I have a friend shout-out to my friend Mike who he went to Duke where I went to school he was Duke best football player at the time like he was like I think he led the nation in tackles or something like that she's an amazing linebacker was football player goes he's a little undersized but he gets drafted or he gets a tryout with it with a couple teams and he ended up getting cut after a year I think from the Indianapolis Colts and that sort of like the end of his football career but he built a ton of connections and still has connections with athletes in the NBA and NFL so I was talking to him about it I was like you know what problems these guys have what stuff are they trying to do because these are often a class of people who have a lot of money I have specific problems to like people with money fame and specific lifestyle what are some ideas that you know problems that they had that I've just never seen but I could solve because I understand them and so one of the things he had mentioned not even has a problem but I was like asking how they did it was every athlete or I should say every many athletes start their own foundation or charity you've probably seen this like you know oh you know random wide-receiver it's not just like the top of the top it's like random I just yeah I have a foundation back in my CD it's for kids for you blah blah blah kids and books it's for Justin poor yet for year one of my favorite fighters has one and so I was wondering was it hey why do they do this and then be like how do they do this like could you build a business around this and so on the y-you know there's some interesting things and again the accountants are gonna be sort of out in full force correcting me on this but it seems like basically the you know there's some tax advantages to a foundation in addition to like obviously wanting to give back as often an athlete's come from pretty rough you know backgrounds and so they do feel this pull okay I've made it I won the lottery how do I get back so there's the there's the emotional pole to give back and create a foundation and then there's the financial pull as well which is there are some tax advantages to doing the to doing it this way where you basically are you're able to give and you're able to give today and reduce your taxable income and that money goes to the foundation which can then over time spend that money long after your career is over even so you can separate the the time of giving and then the time of spending you can separate the tax event from the giving yeah that's got the name of it but you and I have a friend who had a large exit and what he did was he put away a significant amount of money I think a very significant amount of money at least five it could be as high as ten he put it into this charitable account and over the next I'm gonna butcher this I think over the next five years he has to spend that on what's it called what's a nonprofit called a 403 C five oh yeah he's got a he's got a he's got to get rid of it so whenever I see like a missing charity I'm like hey guy cool and there's other things like a DAF which is a donor advised fund which is what Jack Dorsey said I'm gonna give a billion dollars away and he did it via a DAF so this other ways but I guess but my idea was cool so there's reasons a Athletes one foundations they're clearly doing this but I know athletes athletes are not excited to go figure out the paperwork to start a foundation to make sure they're reporting on time all that stuff so I was wondering is there a stripe atlas for foundations is there a push a button get your app you get your foundation spun up without having to get on the phone without having to print out a piece of paper and go mail it some but somewhere because I think you could build a pretty nice but you know potentially pretty lucrative subscription business where you know these foundations there's a spin up fee and then there's an annual maintenance basically to keep your foundation in good standing I think there's a business there so let's talk about Atlas for a second so Atlas is a thing with stripe and it's a click of a button set up in a I'll see I think or do other stuff seek or pins out speak or Borella why how does that make money well it makes money so it's strategic for striped because if you're doing that you're probably gonna stay in the stripe ecosystem so they're like cool how do we get more customers let's get new businesses to get created and then bill your strengths so it's kind of like when Facebook gives away Internet to people who don't have the internet it's like cool we'll give you the Internet and guess what you're gonna do the internet use Facebook so stripes doing the same thing it's like how do increase the rate of new startups because in start-up stir who use a stripe and then if they grow they grow with us and fantastic we got them all their young type of thing so then how would this make money then what charity they do charge a fee so like when I did it I used ripe Atlas to spin on my company and I think what it is a couple hundred bucks but it's great it's like I don't want to talk to a lawyer I trust that this will this will get set up properly if they do all the filing and documentation they're just email me hey here's your tax ID here's your entity here's the Articles of formation etc and so stripe Atlas was great took me three weeks and I don't know two hundred dollars or something like that and I got my company set up why did she do a sequel I did an LLC for me oh but if I wanted to do a sequel but like if I was gonna do a startup that was gonna erase money I would do a c-corp and and I would have used it for that let's talk about the same amount Monday yeah have you read this post no but it's the same woman something I I have something good that can piggyback off of it okay you want to start with that you want me to kind of know and I want you to start is the Sam Altman who's the guy who runs white Y Combinator or just run it anymore actually but he was the president of my Combinator and kind of one of the you know more well-known guys soca valley he put up this blog post called idea generation and he said you know one of the most common questions I get is how do you get ideas for our new startups a lot of it we want to do startups but they don't quite know the idea or they don't have a lot of conviction in it and he says something it really goes why see once tried an experiment to fund people who we thought would be good founders but with no ideas you guys and I think every company and this no idea track failed and it turns out that founders have a lot of ideas about everything but like great founders actually have a lot of ideas and if you want to founder if you have a founder who can't think of an idea they probably shouldn't be a founder it's kind of distant but then he's just explained art so how do you get ideas for startups so he says think number one you want to be in the right environment so you want to be around the right kind of people so he said who are the right kind of people he goes you want to be around people who can have a good feel for the future they will entertain improbable plans they're optimistic and they're smart in a creative way and he says they have high idea flux which is you know pretty good for our podcast like I consider both of us idea machines and that's what he says we calls idea flux so the rate of ideas coming in other body these sorts of people tend to think without the constraints that most people have they don't have a lot of filters and they don't care too much what other people think he says this is important because the best ideas are pretty fragile most people don't even want to start talking about them because they sound kind of silly up front and like take the hustle for example we want to be this big bad media company we're gonna do an email newsletter and an email newsletter actually sounded quite silly to people who were traditionally in media this was you know back if you rewind several years so you want to be around people who won't make you feel stupid for mentioning a bad idea and they certainly don't feel stupid when they mentioned that ideas and he basically says stay away from people who are like the world has beaten them down or they're the type that belittle your ambitions and unfortunately this in most of the world they hold on to the past and and if you want to live in the future you don't want to be around these people and then he says okay so here's the sort of next thing that would help you get good idea so first let's be around those types of people the second is identify a tectonic shift that's happening right now how is the world changing in some fundamental way can you identify the leading edge of that change and the opportunity that unlocks it for example mobile phone comes out 2007 2008 and then you get all these companies like snapchat uber Airbnb etc that were launched in that time on top of that like core fundamental shift these up when a big shift happens the big companies usually get beat by fast moving and focused startups so you want to ask yourself a question like what's something that's possible this year that wasn't possible last year and pay attention anytime something like that comes up there's probably a lot of good ideas in that space the last thing is if you ever feel like something is like if you can say the statement I'm sure this is gonna happen I don't know if we'll be the ones to do it that's a good sign he's like uber was like this for me the first time I used it it was clear I wasn't gonna be hailing a cab any longer or calling the dispatcher but I wasn't it wasn't clear to me that uber was necessarily gonna win the space I mean the last thing he says is it's important sorry it's kind of long it's important to think about what you are well-suited for so like if you do some introspection or you ask your mentor to figure out what you're good at he goes I believe that founder company fit is as good as product market fit and he goes lastly you could just a good idea if you can articulate why most people think of it think it's a bad idea but what you understand about it that makes it a good idea so that's a final test all right so I thought there's a pretty interesting post yeah I think it's crazy interesting and I didn't break this up because I don't even care about promoting this but so Goggin biani reached out to me about three months ago and for trends we did this thing where he like just give a talk and people signed up and it was neat and he was like hey I'm thinking about maybe I want to launch like a school or something can I like partner with you guys and you promote this course I want to do and I was like yeah that sounds interesting and so me and him just start riffing more and more and I really got fascinated with this idea ideas like why is it Shawn that you are good at finding ideas and I was like I don't know why but I wonder if I could like give frameworks behind it and so he's kind of leading the way and I'm just kind of tagging along a little bit and so we were hosting this thing it's mostly him posting with a little bit of me and it's called the ideation bootcamp and I put together what I thought was all these frames works on coming up with ideas and a few of them that I have coincidentally I've never read the same up an article until you just told me are similar and so a few of them are like I like to do reverse engineering and so what I look at is I can go to like a website and see like how they do it because to me if I can see how someone does it it helps me realize what's possible another one is unbundling so I like to look at like really big things like eBay or Craigslist or Reddit and being like okay if usually if something's huge it becomes a victim of its own success and they can't move fast enough to adapt from an early like interesting change and so we talk about like I just made up ways to figure that out and then I see is there anything else that's interesting that is related to that because I didn't realize it that he kind of actually discussed that um oh and then another thing that I like to do and coincidentally the things that I'm talking about is like he's talking about we just go in like tactically it's like how do you look at like he talked about something that's growing quickly but and you like hop in on it and that's actually quite hard and tell me what what I'm missing here the things that I really love to do is I like to look at forums and comments and article comments and user reviews for apps on iTunes sakir like what what about parking this [ __ ] that's like makes them love something or makes them hate something and that's what I used to come up with ideas so what Sam often said was it's something that's growing quickly early on that like you think is gonna be the future well how else do discover those so so there's two way so what is your do you discover a platform that's growing really pop really fast and you go on top of it I'll give you a perfect example of this zoom is growing like [ __ ] crazy right now I think I went from like 10 million users to over like 250 million users during just a kovat crisis you know my mom and my auntie use zoom now because that's how we celebrate birthdays during cocoa and they you know soom used to be this enterprise thing so zooms growing like crazy I had this friend Victor I don't remember if I've mentioned this on the podcast but he created this thing called zoom URL basically zem URL comm and it's basically Eventbrite for zoom so you noticed the problem of like hey cool everyone using zoom to meet up but zooms like kind of invite and like you know the sort of like splash that page doesn't exist so there's not a cool way to like make an invite for a zoom event you just send this ugly link and you say join this zoom that's where we're gonna do this conference or this birthday or this whatever and so he just made a really pretty auto generator you put in your zoom link and then you can upload a photo you can put the details all over and you make this little landing page for your event and he's growing like crazy because he's just throwing he's piggybacking on top of zoom very opportunistically on the platform and he's doing something that you know zoom probably isn't gonna get around to doing for a little while so he's got this opportunity to grow solving a new problem and so the other way which I said this is I think where I see you do this less is about technology shifts and I think this is where gentleman is actually talking about more which is you know when you go in the back of an existing product a platform kind of sucks cuz you end up with this platform dependency and then they can often kill you or clone you or you just get stuck on that platform you never get off whereas technology shifts like oh [ __ ] we couldn't do this before but now machine learning is good enough that this is now possible or for example my friend told me about these little NFC stickers you know what that is near-field communication so basically I bought these on Amazon they're like these tiny little stickers that cost like you know 10 cents each or something like that and if you get these in bulk they're very very cheap and you just program them so that like if somebody just moves their phone into this thing it touches taps this thing it's like Apple pay it will fire something open on their phone you can open up a website it can open up whatever and I'm like dude this is great for marketing like I should just put these on products or you know this could be in my shoes it could just say is this a real Jordan or is this a fake these little things can be embedded everywhere because the cost has come down and the reliability has come up and the core platforms like I found an Android now you know by default will react to these and I've seen things just like they do QR codes so there's a so technology ships is I think the one that most people don't understand cuz they don't have Technic like technical literacy so they don't know what's going on and they don't know when something before that was impossible is now possible because it was like actually there's just a subtle shift over time or the cost of this chip has dropped and now it's really economical to do something that before that would have been ridiculous or now that you have a small that needs to be so so how do you identify this so for example I I have a meeting every week with my former CTO for my startup cuz he lives in that like bleeding edge of technology and I have an hour a week that it's called the cool [ __ ] hour it's on our calendar and he just shows me cool [ __ ] and I just told him look when we're usually in meetings I talk 90% the time you talk 10% cuz I'm the kind of talker or sales guy but in this meeting you're gonna talk 90 I'm gonna talk 10 and the cool [ __ ] hours just you demoing to me cool [ __ ] that I don't know about because I don't understand cryptocurrency the way you do I don't understand VRA or the way you do I don't know about these other ladies are the technological shifts that are going on so we've been doing this for a month now and it's [ __ ] awesome I basically got a front row seat of this and all I had to do was just ask a smart guy who is in that world but the more generic way of doing that is just to hang out with those guys so again it's sort of like what this post was if I was like who do you hang out with ends up being what's in your what's in front of your eyes and so we hang out with a bunch of business people that figure out different ways to make money so for us how do you make money is there some question of which way do you want to make money I know 100 paths and I have a five examples of each of those hundred paths I have 500 different examples of how to make money I just got to choose one that fits me whereas people who are in the world of technology they don't really know exactly how to make money but they can tell you 100 interesting things with technology and so sometimes you got to hang out with them and eat lunch with him you know three times a week so that you're hearing those things put yourself in that position yeah it's like you just gotta hang out like in the fringes and I think that like a great places great places to hang out the fridges are ready reddit hacker news just like the way that it and I guess you've just gonna you're helping me finalize my one slide show I have to do which is you have to look at user behavior and you have to find this fringe behavior that's growing quickly right you know a couple podcast ago I went off on this random tangent about defy decentralized fun you know finance yeah it was just like you know I'm speaking gibberish I don't even know what the [ __ ] I'm talking about but it's because I discovered this fringe right so all this activity happening I was like global whoa I don't even understand this but I know enough to know that this is unusual and this is a phenomenon and I need to know more and so like boom save that tap in that tab open in my brain and I'm gonna come back to this you got to know more about this this is unusual this is new it's interesting well I think that's what you have to do when you have ideas which is you have to actually steal from a lot of different places so you like take like [ __ ] I don't know like wow at a restaurant I could order like I only have to pay for what I order or something or I don't [ __ ] know like our giving example maneuver like I don't actually have to like have I don't have to own the cabs you know what I mean I'll give you an example so two ideas if you if you do a little idea sex with them so cloud kitchens we've talked about that in the podcast before so creating a virtual restaurant selling on top of post made to coober et cetera and then in the world of e-commerce I was thinking about upsells upsells is you know obviously critical to e-commerce it's like you're buying one thing it's like hey do you want fries with that right hey do you want this extra thing and it increases the order value by 20% 30% 40% whatever it is upsells are critical in e-commerce in the world of delivered food delivery they basically don't exist so I was thinking like how many times were if we were ordering you know Chinese food or Mexican food or whatever through some restaurant why doesn't a breeds just do a you know sort of have a cloud dessert company that's always just like do you want to add some ice cream on top of that or hey we just made brownies whatever and like I bet they can increase the cart size and it shouldn't be another restaurant it should be a upsell across all orders of all restaurants that day then so like I don't know you can sort of mismatch ideas if you see something that's interesting or critical in one area in another area they don't do it that's usually you know makes for an interesting [ __ ] thought experiment i i completely agree with this i when i'm wondering is do you can you teach people this or either got it or you don't know for short teach people this yeah i would love to say here either got it or you don't that would make it mean that make me feel awesome because like i got it and other people do but the reality is i didn't have it and now I do and I know exactly what I did to get there I hung out with people who have a bunch of interesting ideas and I got thirsty for that so I started hanging out with them either in person or my Twitter feed is just full of those people like I don't have you know I don't put sports into my Twitter feed as much like I surround my feed with that so that even when I'm just browsing that's what I get the second thing is like start to come up with these frameworks so for example one framework I have you should steal for your thing it's like you if you imagine this 2x2 grid on the left side you have what type of problem is this this is a new problem or an old problem right old problem people trying to meet their mates they want to date somebody that's an old problem new problem hey I'm trying to throw a zoom event and I don't have a good way to share that right that wasn't a problem that existed five years ago but it exists now and so new brought an old problem and then you have new solution old solution so it's like cool old solutions to things can be applied to new problems so that's what the zoom URL thing is he's taking an old solution like Eventbrite or splash that or like these proven methods he's just saying cool I can specialize and tailor that to this new problem which is zoom events rather than in-person events and then you take new solutions which are things like oh wow so crypto lets you have trust or like a digital contract so I don't need an escrow person so maybe you know I can take an old problem like you know escrow and a home and a home sale but an inert solution notarizing yeah notaries okay cool yeah exactly so a new solution push a button somebody has GPS on their phone and they come to you and they solve your problem for you they either pick you up to take you somewhere or whatever cool maybe I can apply that to this old problem notary and so you just take that 2x2 grid and you say cool what are all the new solutions that are interesting to me and the other one is what are all the new problems that are interesting to me you just keep jotting those down anytime you you know whatever that is and so that's a framework you can use to understand ideas and figure out is this idea actually something novel or not well it's novel whenever you cross old problem and new solution or old solution and new problem those are the two boxes that the new ideas coming if it's an old problem old solution there's nothing new there don't do it you're blowing my mind I'm listening no I don't understand how you come up with these likes like you think you think and like you know how people used to say Obama talks and like quotes like he always like he just has these one-liners that are like really great you talk and frameworks yeah I don't know why but I think it's because I like frameworks so I'm studying them and then I just naturally start thinking that way another another way to practice this if you want to become an idea person is like James altra shared this but he was like every day I write down ten ideas it doesn't have to be good bad it's just a daily practice of idea generation because if you think about it like oh man I wish I was better ideas cool do you do that do you practice coming up with new ideas every day oh you don't okay you know I also wish I was fit but if I don't go exercise that what what do I expect is gonna happen well that's gonna magically get fit it's the same thing here I have to that idea I don't do the James altra one but the two I do one is this podcast twice a week I get up in front of them you know a lot of people and I try to come up with new ideas that's a practice how do I prepare for that I have these documents on my phone and my laptop once called the biggest idea in my head and I have every month and I just write down it this month what is the biggest idea in my head and I just put it there and so like I'll go to my doctor right now I'll read you one of mine biggest idea man Sean everyone has asked that you share this [ __ ] and you never have yeah you know these are I I don't know if I want to share these things today somewhat something I want to share somewhere they don't want sure so like in April I refinance my home and the biggest idea in my head was like holy [ __ ] that was so much work and such and so painful biggest idea in my head is turning refinancing into a five minute online process I don't know how but if there was a new solution that's an old problem that I would want solved when we were doing the weight loss challenge the biggest idea in my head was holy [ __ ] everybody needs a little monitor in their body that tells them how their body is reacting to the food they eat if we want to change people's diets and not have half the country be obese we need to have real-time feedback loops so that when you put that you know piece of chocolate in your mouth you pay a price immediately and not like five years down the road and so the biggest idea in my head was how do we make these glucose monitors so cheap and readily available that everybody gets feedback for everything that it'll help the country eat better about the world world's eat better that's the biggest idea in my head for one month and so I just write these ideas down and then you know I basically have a place to put them I I'm I'm just I'm like being a listener right now I am thinking about this I don't know I don't have anything to add I feel like I'm a student at the moment it's listening to this but that's great what you guys are doing if you guys are gonna release these courses or classes I don't know I don't know I like really the truth is is that we don't have hustle con revenue in June and he had done all the work and I was like yeah okay well well I'll work with you had to do it and I don't know I personally as a business like our business like we have an ambitious goal to build a really large company I think horses will not be part of that you there right I think that it was simply like a thing to like well let's just try it and it actually covered our also found revenue so or profits so but we I will not do this I will not do it ever I hate the course business I think it is it is not fun but I it for a solopreneur yeah for a company no I think it's [ __ ] I think that if you're reforged which is a $5,000 thing for companies that is interesting but I still think it sucks to host like I don't I don't think it's like it maybe it make some profit I don't know if it does but it definitely does but I personally don't like it I don't think most people even finish this [ __ ] yeah most people don't I think that like Duggan who created he created what you to me right yeah you know me he I think he everyone who came out and said less than 5% of people finish you know at one point I'm MOOCs massively open online courses were all the rage everybody said MOOCs are gonna revolutionize education it's gonna just shitty system and then they came out and they were like look we made a Harvard education free and open to anyone all you had to do is click a button and enroll and then you should got to show up and take it you could have a Harvard education for free online from the comfort of your own home and less than 5% of people I think finish the course and I think that tells you a lot about like why people do a thing you know people don't go to university to learn that's the sad truth people go to university to get credentialed so that they can get a high paying job so if you want to compete within the university you should actually create a credential that gets you a high paying job that would gives people confidence if I get this credential I would get that's I think this is what you needed this is what you your next thing will have to be this is the area I'm most interested in and if I could just figure out an angle I'll do it because there's this other great talk that came from the YC mafia it's by this guy Richard Hamming and it's called you and your research she'd go read it's a speech he gives and I didn't know who this guy was apparently he's like a kind of technologist from back in the day he talks about his time at Xerox PARC in Xerox PARC was responsible for life let's call Richard Richard what I think is Richard Hamming his name I'm pretty sure is Hamming I don't know if this person is Richard maybe I just inserted generic white name but the Xerox PARC is where like you know the visual graphic user interface like Steve Jobs went to Xerox PARC and was like Oh mouse point set idle on screen that's how computer should work and he like stole the innovations basically from there because they were just doing Rd and he was like trying to print [ __ ] to the world anyways he talked about Xerox PARC and used to he said he tells the stories like I was that lunch one day and I asked my co-workers these brilliant people you know all the brain in the world is stuffed into these guys skulls and he's like I asked him what is the most important what is the biggest idea in your head what is the most important problem in your space in your industry what is the most important problem and then they would say a thing music and what are you researching and they would say a different thing he's like why aren't you working on the most important the most burning question in your space the most interesting thing in your field why are you that working on and he discovered like you know so his his message is basically ask yourself that question what does the most the biggest thing in my space what is the biggest challenge or opportunity in my industry why am I not working on it and then she could work on it he says the filter is you have to ask yourself do I have a novel angle and how I'm gonna attack that problem because if I just go but if I like the big problems are kind of known but you need a new attack vector of how you can solve that problem if you don't have a new attack vector you're just gonna waste your time and energy you're gonna get the same result as everybody else but if you have a new attack vector then it is your responsibility as a smart and talented person to go to it so that's how I think about this University thing and for a long time I already knew the last project I do I'm gonna do that's [ __ ] dude that's [ __ ] that is only one way to do it because if you think about it like a lot of great restaurants aren't particularly really novel in the solution well I mean they're like novel and branding or they're novel in that sean is making it do you know what I mean so I think that is a little [ __ ] I know restaurants are [ __ ] right like no they're not you're wrong the restaurants are having businesses no you're wrong one of the large tool min 42 owns what's he owned forty demos but he also owns some restaurants yes you know some chains it's mostly he owns the Golden Nugget me owns a whole bunch of other stuff too yeah and like some steak houses is like Bubba Gump shrimp just like fast casual stuff that regular people go to and it's like so fun into the most profitable privately owned companies America the best restaurant chains all had a new attack vectors right McDonald's realized the new attack vector and they productionize fast food and they had a real estate model the franchise model to back it up Chipotle now and they did the same thing but they had they realized over the fast-casual model which was different but there are many hey there are many cases where the the amount of success they had it's not into proportion to the amount of mmm the their new novelty is not a proportion with the amount of success that they have yes so okay here's what I think if you're talking restaurants the analogy there is like I'm gonna create an online course - right that's me opening up my restaurant just like everybody else has a restaurant but my restaurants run by me I think I'm a good cook I think some people will like my will like my my restaurant what I'm try to do is sort of change like change the restaurant industry right so like when I talk about education it's not like I'm just trying to create a course I'm trying to make it so that I guess that here's the analogy I don't want to build a car I want to build a road so roads basically are new platforms that anybody can create a car on and you can get a lot more data - no I understand roads versus if you're just trying to build a car if you're just trying to be a car driving on the existing road system you know I mean I get it that's a fair point no it's asked is a car it's us getting on here and entertaining people we're gonna reach a certain set of people given a certain amount of effort making go they can scale pretty big because we're using the Internet and it's awesome and it's free that's that's good it's better than the cars of old where we would just go to a event and we would host a meet-up in 40 people would show up and we would talk that's the old way this is much better right so much better car but it's still not a road a road is podcasting if you create something like podcasting boom you've changed yeah you've really changed the world and that's that's more exciting to me I get it I we're in the same page there on that one I think we had an interesting podcast I'll be interesting to interested to see if people like it or not I think we turned I think we covered a lot and actually turned I was expecting this week's [ __ ] those in a horrible mood I think we turn it into something good cool yeah this was fun I think we should switch the order around I think you should put the maybe the political stuff at the back I don't know we'll see well we listened to the reviews we listened to the tweets so let us know what you think cool all right let's get outta here you [Music]

enthusiasm is uh such a superpower that most people could tap into and totally don't for whatever reason so i graduated in undergrad and i dropped out of harvard business okay gotcha and you said you studied happiness uh like what was that like one classic i took a class called getting rich and but you know that wasn't like my major it was just one class um is that really a class yeah so i actually i studied psychology um i i started in a track called migraine behavior and then ended up in psychology um and specifically there was a happiness lab that dan gilbert was running where we focused on like how people make decisions what makes us happy and basically the headline of the whole uh you know my whole experience was we're really bad about making decisions that make us happy we do things that we think will make us happy but in fact like getting the fancy car doesn't make you happy because then you have to clean the car or getting a bigger home out of the city doesn't you know necessarily make you happy because then you commute farther to your work so it's just really really i think a good perspective of um it's the little things that really make us happy i love that you know uh this is very on topic so so i remember back in the day there's a guy who was i think a professor at harvard named sean anchor is that somebody who was yeah that was he was uh he is one of my teachers sean aiker um yeah he's wonderful and actually um his core professor tal benjahar um and phillip stone were my my thesis so he gave this ted talk that's pretty great i still remember it and i watched this thing like 10 years ago that's kind of you know some talks just stick with you and it was called that i think the happiness advantage or the sort of something like that and if i remember correctly the thesis was um being happy is actually an advantage to uh getting great results some people think about it the other way like if a great thing happens then i'll be happy and his advice if i what i remember from 10 years ago was if i am happy i'll have better results is that a good is that am i accurate or am i just totally misremembering so the short term is that um in under extreme duress and extreme stress you can outperform in the short term if you're actually very happy and relaxed and fulfilled you outperform the long call so when you're building teams for long-term success so you know inspired capital it's a venture fund uh we have a really unique group of people that have come together to build this firm um and we're trying to build a long-term fund and so i'm very focused on let's make sure we have long-term happiness because you outperform in the long run and so um and the other thing is i think one of the things i learned from sean and tom my my professors is um positive energy and attitude are actually an undervalued resource people are very naturally drawn to people that are positive if you're super negative over and over people don't want to be around you they don't want to work with you they don't want to show up for you um and so i think again you know one thing people always ask me is what would i tell high schoolers and i'm like have a good attitude it goes really far and it's it's part of that point of happiness is an advantage so is positivity i always talk about this uh enthusiasm is sort of in complete under supply amongst successful people so you know when you're trying to compete and you're trying to be successful you're the wrong person i'm like the stupidest person obviously you've bought in on this what i'm saying is that for most people or most of the environments i've been around whether it's like you know entrepreneurs investors right now i'm at a bigger company because my company got acquired it's like the execs at this company um in some ways enthusiasm i think people see it as um like a low status thing to do it's like oh you know sort of um being reserved is somehow more i don't know prestigious or powerful in some way uh and i've gone the complete opposite direction where i'm i'm overly enthusiastic and i i'm like dude i have one tenth of the skills of all the people that have been around me but i've been able to go so far because i think enthusiasm is uh such a superpower that most people could tap into and totally don't for whatever reason i i mean i totally uh agree with you um and beyond not only do i totally agree with you i also think it's worth saying that um it is a skill that we can all adopt right like just trying to have a positive outlook is something you know i can't grow taller or i can't get better at um you know a certain trait that i just don't have trying to be positive and trying to to to be joyful i think actually it's something we can all put on it may not be easy for everybody to do it but it is possible sam are you an enthusiastic guy uh i think i am i think that's why people like this podcast so we have a very loyal audience and i think it's because people feel as though the sean and i have a little bit of a contagious energy and yeah it is it is positivity or it's very positive but i i think some of my co-workers will say that i'm kind of grumpy because i i've got to be the bad guy unfortunately a lot of times i think you have like an angry enthusiasm uh you flip your switch flips from like in extreme enthusiasm and it's super infectious to like quickly very angry or grumpy about something and then you you switch back sort of effortlessly but for the people around you they're probably just getting rocked by it yeah i uh like maybe you were like this uh but like i will fight with my like executives at my company but then we could just hug it we're good we're good but i definitely like that um

for most people thinking about money all day long is two words fun or exciting and in fact it's quite stressful the standard of what I want to see built I don't believe that there's a company that is close there's a couple united states that's starting to think about this and in doing a good job also called tally where the jason the founder is wonderful and it you know he he was helping people he started with credit card debt pay off the credit card debt faster which was the court clean point and starting automation around it but um you know I think I want to I want to like fast-forward the decade ahead where we actually get to Instant Streaming money it you know I call it liquefied money you're calling it streaming money where your money can always be optimizing to the right place and that gets pretty powerful when that begins to happen but most importantly not only is it powerful it meaningfully changes the life of American families oh yeah I've heard this idea before about basically hey what's a category of what you built it's like P P P F am something like that yeah pfm personal finance manager and the theory is basically you have things that clarity money and learn vast and others that were basically all like hey we can suggest some things we can show you some charts and analysis but like fundamentally you the user make the decision and what you're talking about is the software makes the decision right self-driving basically like it's not it's not you're sitting in your car and your car suggests to you how you should you know turn or change lanes the car changes lanes because it knows where you're trying to get is your destination and so I've heard before that hey what we need is for to get get AI basically to the point where it can actually make the decisions and optimize the money for you so that the user doesn't have to make decisions user says I want I have these financial goals for myself this is my income coming in here's my bills and it basically does it and what I've what you added on was the reason that can't happen right now is because the transfer is too slow but it seems like there's a middle step just right now the software doesn't decide the user decides and most users don't want to think about that or make those decisions that most people are not active with their money management much to your chagrin I'm sure so is it more about software deciding versus users deciding or is it more about liquefied money so liquefied money matters but then to your point so I'm gonna like I want to answer that with a with a visual question when we imagine money right now we imagine money by saying okay I'm gonna log into my you know my etrade account and I'm gonna stare it on my grass and and you know look at things and I'm in a top to an advisor and tell them my goals and then like a lot of things are gonna be executed I almost think that we are thinking about the limits in the sound of what technology offers today as opposed to what the customer really wants if you ask the customer what they really want they want enough money to do what they need to do and they want everything else to be taken care of and like for most people thinking about money all day long there's a sort of fun or exciting and in fact it's quite stressful I'm so imagine and so I almost think we visualize money based on what exists but imagine a thought exercise and I'll use an Amazon Alexa since I literally there's like 17 in my brother's house and he just likes to yell at me all day anything's it's so funny but basically let's use an Amazon Alexa and imagine you could walk in your kitchen every morning and just say you have surveillance so you've rules that you've set it around your wallet so has anyone broken my identity has anyone done anything bad or on tour restrictions that you put on to like my kids credit cards can eat only you know spend fifty dollars a month and whatever it may be and then you've already clearly laid out goals and it just does it for you and so you walk in like why do I even need to look at my money all I care about is are there any crises no are the rules I've set up in place so any extra money you know I need four hundred dollars in my savings account for checking for you know if I need cash we're gonna obviously go away from cash permanently at some point um and then everything else just optimize for me and that's math the thing I love you know I am a math geek I've all liked math growing up I always loved it math is really beautiful because this isn't you know we're not trying to cure something a disease that we don't this isn't a kovat situation where we don't know that we don't know what to do yet we are looking for a vaccine to use that as an analogy this is math for every American wallet I can mathematically tell you where their next dollar should go to save to save them money make their life better and outside of them telling us what their goals are then the math can do it and it can do it every hour or every minute and at some point when you get there that is better for the American rollit and so that's the vision of that's literally the picture in the back of my head is like when do we get to a place where my money is just doing what it should do at all times and right now there's wild amounts of friction move it from here put it in the savings account sweep it into this do this with this pay off the credit card to pay off your student loans you have to make two payments and tell them please pay the principal not just the intern friction everywhere and at some point it will go away and I motto services be candid it will be selling my life Doris you're very uh persuasive I feel like I'm ready to like get behind you and say let's go to war you're very you've got a very good [Music]

getting the fancy car doesn't make you happiest and you have to clean the car or getting a bigger comb out of the city doesn't you know necessarily make you happy because then you commute farther to your work cool Alexa thanks for joining us on the podcast days we have special guests I'll let you do your intro because I'm really in terrible at introductions but I you know I'll admit we don't we didn't do a ton of sort of background research because I like to just talk in the moment and actually you know not have too much sort of prepared in my mind because then I'm always sort of referencing my notes and things like that but I'd I'd rather just kind of do it more organically but you were the CEO of learned that hey speak for yourself I know a bunch of I learned I'm just saying I personally prefer to do it this way Sam personally prepares I see he already knew about it you didn't even do the research you just already knew so but for those who don't know what was learned vest give us kind of like you're maybe two or three minutes background so that people know who you are sure I think so I start from the beginning I grew up in Florida and when I always been an entrepreneur love entrepreneurs love building companies went to Harvard undergrad and studied happiness which I I was mentioning because I actually think somehow it's been very helpful to life ended up I going back to business school there dropped out bottom of the worst recession and originally 81 years now I feel like this may be a our own koban moment is is becoming obviously something that's worrisome but I built a financial planning software company called learn bass with a really simple mission which was so learn best became TurboTax for financial planning so literally every American family for an affordable price could get access to a financial plan and an advisor and on our fifth birthday on March 25th of 2015 sold the business to Northwestern Mutual for about three hundred and seventy five million dollars and then spent the next few years as part of that business at Northwestern Mutual and through it all that wrote some books that selling book I called financially fearless and then financially forward future of your wallet and I'm just a diehard entrepreneur I love entrepreneurs and I love to build businesses and so now I'm the managing partner I run a 200 million dollar venture fund called inspired capital which is headquarter in New York City and we pay it forward and we invest in students Series A entrepreneurs of tomorrow building big ideas so it's really fun to get to have them both and now among the investing side and that's me and I'm married I live in New York City I've three beautiful little babies if a girl dear old and a one-year-old which means I'm completely crazy but that's who I am Wow impressive oh you're not you're not you're not New York City right now I see are you I see greenery no I'm not I wish no so I have been in Florida I'm actually sitting in my like highschool bedroom which is which is bringing it all back full circle where we came we came down here for spring break and just haven't come you have like a Justin Timberlake poster on the wall or something or what's what's in the high school room no no but you know it's amazing look at this I literally I'm sitting unlike my yearbook which is just incredible and it's I mean it's so cute my mom has literally kept like all of the things and I'm some days I'm like mom why didn't you serve some of this stuff away but she kept on my pictures you know my artwork and hold myself I'll start because Sam's probably still blown away he loves Harvard you had him at Harvard then you sold a company for three to 75 million bucks and then financial planning he's a total financial planning their personal finance nerd so Sam do you need a moment to just sort of gather your thoughts are you ready to go no a little I I did not go to Harvard I wish but I do have an odd fascination with it I people say I have a Harvard sweatshirt people always say oh you went to Harvard as a kid I went there I paid money into Couture and I will just say I while Harvard was a great education I think there's lots of things in life that are much cooler than Harvard did you say ID sorry graduated undergrad when I dropped out of Harvard Business okay gotcha and you said you studied happiness like what is that like one classic I took a class called getting rich and you know that wasn't like my major it was just one class yeah so I actually I studied psychology I started in a track called mind brain behavior and then ended up in psychology and specifically there was a happiness lab that Dan Gilbert was running where we focused on like how people make decisions what makes us happy and basically the headline at the whole you know my whole experience was really bad about making decisions that make us happy we do things that we think will make us happy but in fact like getting the fancy car doesn't make you happy cuz then you have to clean the car or getting a bigger home out of the city doesn't have you know necessarily make you happy because then you commute farther to your work so it was just really really I think a good perspective of it's the little things that really make us happy I love that you know this is very on topic so so I remember back in the day there's a guy who was I think a professor at Harvard named Sean anchor is that somebody who was he was I he is one of my teacher Sean McClure um yeah he's wonderful and actually um his core professor tall ben-shahar um and Philip stone were might might be situated he gave this TED talk that's pretty great I still remember it and I'd watch this thing like 10 years ago that's kind of you know some talks just stick with you and it was called that I think the happiness advantage or this sort of something like that and if I remember correctly the the thesis was being happy is actually an advantage to getting great results some people think about it the other way like if a great thing happens then I'll be happy and his advice if I what I remember from 10 years ago was if I am happy I'll have better results is that a good is that my accurate or am I just totally misremembering so the short term is that I'm in under extreme duress and extreme stress you can outperform in this short term if you're actually very happy and relaxed and fulfilled you outperform the long call so when you're building teams for long term success so you know inspired capital to venture funds we have a really unique group of people that have come together to build this firm and we're trying to build a long-term fund and so I'm there focus on let's make sure we have long-term happiness because you won't perform in the long run and so and the other thing is I think one of the things I learned from Sean and tal my my professors is positive energy and attitude are actually an undervalued resource people are very naturally drawn to people that are positive if you're super negative over and over people don't want to be around you they don't want to work with you they don't want to show up for you and so I think again you know one thing people always ask me is what would I tell high schoolers and I'm like have a good attitude it goes really far and it's if part of that point of happiness is an advantage so is positivity I always talk about this enthusiasm is sort of incomplete undersupply amongst successful people so you know when you're trying to compete and you're trying to be successful one person I'm like the stupidest obviously you've bought in on this what I'm saying is that for most people or most environments I've been around whether it's like you know entrepreneurs investors right now I'm at a bigger company because my company got acquired it's like the execs at this company in some ways enthusiasm I think people see it as like a low status thing to do it's like oh you know sort of being reserved is somehow more I don't know prestigious or powerful in some way and I've gone the complete opposite direction where I'm overly enthusiastic and I'm like dude I have 1/10 of the skills of all the people that have been around me but I've been able to go so far because I think enthusiasm is such a superpower that most people could tap into and totally don't for whatever reason I I mean I totally agree with you and beyond not only do I totally agree with you I also think it's worth saying that it is a skill that we can all adopt right like just trying to have a positive outlook it's something you know I can't grow taller or I can't get better at you know a certain trait that I just don't have trying to be positive and trying to be joyful I think actually it's something we can all put on it may not be easy for everybody to do it but it is possible Sam are you an enthusiastic guy people like this podcast so we have a very loyal audience and I think it's because people feel as though the Shawn and I have a little bit of a contagious energy and yeah it is it is positivity or it's very positive but I I think some of my co-workers will say that I'm kind of grumpy because I've got to be the bad guy unfortunately a lot of times a time I think you have like an angry enthusiasm you flip your switch flips from like in extreme enthusiasm and it's super infectious to like quickly very angry or grumpy about something and then you switch back sort of effortlessly but for the people around you they're probably just getting rocked by it yeah I like maybe you were like this but like I will fight with my like executives at my company but then I think we can just hug it we're good we're good I definitely like that um can we talk about LearnVest a little bit so I used to I use you guys when you first came out and I mean I was just I didn't have a lot of money to where that was like an issue but I was just starting to use it what uh what was the premise behind the business because I think it it kind of pivoted affair once or twice right um we started it was that business plan was always the same it was content tools and advice and I started the out of my own savings so we started with content because back in 2008 in New York City I actually founded the company in 2007 and you can do a free newsletter and just kind of get going and so we started creating a brand we started trying to talk to our users and just have a really authentic voice to say you know for me it was pretty it was pretty stupefying that I could graduate from a great school you know I worked on Wall Street I was really good at math really good as economics but when it came to just the basic questions of my wallet how many credit cards should I have what's a credit score exactly and how do I make sure I keep it safe what are the activities I need to do and to make sure my wallet is strong how do I you know how much can I afford and rent really basic questions the fact that very clear answers was kind of wild so we started with content and then we always said it would be content tools and advice and so once we finally raised enough money to build protecting we started with a budgeting app I which was a place for you to see all your finances in one place and then what we quickly realized was people wanted advice and I had no idea what advice look like check would it look like phone calls call center open 24 hours a day I had no idea and we just said we'll follow the customers and we originally started on when you build content you want to focus on an audience a specific language so we started with female Millennials and then what we quickly by the time we got to advise we just served households so it was never a pivot it was very much just like an extension of what we were doing and by the time we get to advice we actually built financial planning software that could take any family and ingest 60 data points about them and then would spit out exactly what we call GPS for your money so literally a living and breathing financial plan and we connect you to I'm a certified financial planner and we connect people to trusted advisors that worked full time for us and so that's what we did and it was a subscription service and then by the end we had company is buying learn best software for all of their employees as a benefit it you you know akin to your health benefits and your 401k benefits and so that's what learned us became we became the the the largest fastest-growing online financial planning company you how long did it take to go from cotton so I don't know if you know about my business we're hosting this pocket it's called the hustle it's content as well and we're also building to us how long did you go so I I'm very familiar with the content game and this strategy I think it's great but most people fail at it I think it's quite hard how long did it take to go from content to creating your project products um so we started content in I May of 2007 is when I founded the company my then-boyfriend right now he's my husband his dad was our lawyer so shout out to him he was the best and my mom is a secretary literally like like signed the formal paperwork I will never forget it and then I drew the 75 page business plan and then by the time that I dropped out of HBS it was December 18th of 2008 moved to New York and started I remember I gave myself Christmas I said you get basically a week and then it's go time and I so started building January 1st of 2009 and then by the time we launched the company like truly launched our first 10,000 users was the following January we launched we launched this thing called boot camp which for ten day programs that people could go through to learn about the wallet and they were free and we quickly one day realize holy smokes 10,000 people have signed up and week to go through one of these programs and from there we just kept building and we kept talking to our customers and saying what kind of tools do you want what do you want advice to look like and one day I people would write in and say really want to talk to a customer or sorry to I really want to talk to somebody I have questions I had questions and so we then keep mine as a regulated business to become a financial advisor and so we had to go get regulated and became a registered investment advisor and we then opened it up that you could pay to talk to an adviser and we said let's make it super honest really transparent no hidden costs just on the site exactly what it cost and well like you step back it seems really logical like what we were doing was never illogical but it actually flipped the whole industry on its head the industry used to pretend to give advice wait for free but then charge you deeply on all the products that they would give you and all those fees but actually be pretty material so if you had a hundred thousand dollars we were paying two thousand dollars a year for advice and that didn't always feel good people were very distrustful and so we just said flip it over make it five hundred dollars for the year to get access to unlimited advice and we'll sell no products so we always can trust that our advice is the right advice and so that's what LearnVest did and again it seemed at the time it was actually pretty groundbreaking to build financial planning software for everybody and for the masses and so we also said we'll take you a few thirty thousand dollars in income or thirty million um again not that wild right it's just let's beat let's be a good business that takes care of people but what we realize is that alone brand positioning is pretty how many employees did you have like in the first two years or so to Bill about that uh so we were small in the beginning you know we got to about fifty employees but I call it the first real like two to three years up interaction that's all you're hiring a lot of people that's a 50 0 50 is good and by the time we got acquired we're about 150 people which you know we were real business and so that for me I meant just like so much personal growth so much you know being a young entrepreneur you don't know what you don't know and so it seemed really big to me at times um but yeah you started launching those the products in the advice so how cuz you're what I'll call an audience first company which is first build it through content loyalty and then when you have a service to offer or a product or tool to offer you've got your customer sitting there you just need to convert X percent of them so how big was the audience um well I I mean I can't tell you like it's all from memory by the time we get acquired we're about 2 and 1/2 million users so by the time that we when I your video disappeared we can get me there your back so there is ok perfect there we go I don't know what happened by the time that we got acquired we were about two and a half million what's the user uh I was somebody who had signed up for to make an account so they sign yes no is I mean and we so it's funny we were really old school we actually didn't we didn't ever spend on advertising we I think by the the year we got acquired we hadn't even spent a million dollars on advertising um it was really old school we were very focused on like let's let's go and find customers through business partnerships and relationships and creating content and you know we wrote books and we did all these other things to really build a following um and then we kept converting them into that so you know for that for the tools where people would link all their finances and we would see their for wallets we had about half a million of those and then on the paying customer side when we got acquired we had about depending on how you cut it made about a hundred thousand words on the page - I mean Facebook was like it wasn't the same it was different yes I mean so um Mark Zuckerberg I went to college undergrad with me I was hissing classmate and so Facebook definitely existed before I was starting wearing best but I you know 2007-2008 when I was starting the idea Facebook I think was founded in like 2004 so he did but it was very much you know you weren't building your business on Facebook you were at Harvard when he launched Facebook at Harvard yeah so - you remember when you heard about Facebook uh do we remember are you kidding you like could never have forgotten um yeah I remember at actually at the end of your username what would be the number of Facebook user you were and I was like in the hundreds so I was like roughly around 150 uh and you've knew it because it was just the most helpful thing on the planet it's like oh what's that person's name again I can look them up um and I always joked with my husband when my husband asked me out I like couldn't look up who he was yet he'd asked me out before Facebook existed and I remember being like how I can't remember who he is like is it this guy or that guy and it just like my kids will never know a world where you like can't look somebody up I mean it's gonna be a big deal or were you like this is useful for Harvard and yeah I mean like could you foresee that it was gonna be like a seventy-five billion dollar company um you know I can't take credit for having like something that was that kind of crystal ball ish but you knew it was a big deal um really quickly you could just tell it was like the amount of time you were spending on it how quickly was spreading at when it went to other colleges and you could look up you're at those schools when you could poke people and it was you know to the credit of market was an incredibly infectious blog did you know him personally I know so I did know man we are an undergrad I met him a handful of times and I know his family and his siblings pretty well but no we need to start by joining when it was it's like hey this thing is kind of taking off I'm extra now Harvard you were thinking about drop you know you dropped out of business school anyways to start a business I actually was thinking at that time of dropping out of Harvard to start learn that's basically so my mom convinced me to graduate I said to her I want to go start a company I know I need to my mom was like can you just graduate pretty please I've gotten into Harvard Business School my mom was like huge at least graduate from from college and took my mom's credit I did I'm glad I did but I that that itch to go start something was like pretty alive and I you know to the credit of like a Mark Zuckerberg when you are so close to seeing businesses get built you know I think they called it the Facebook effect which is when you can see how powerful the Internet can be and if you're a you a hardworking person who has skills you're like huh maybe I should go do something and but I so guess and I will definitely say I think Facebook's spawned an entire you know an acquired when you guys had I forgot how many but I've read a blog post which was like hey learn fist gets acquired for whatever hundreds of millions of dollars and it seemed to me when I was doing my kind of back at the envelope math I was like so they were doing sort of like as my math showed me you guys are doing like less than ten million in revenue and got acquired for you said three hundred seven five million that's a huge multiple so first a might look at I just did I lose a zero somewhere and then secondly why did you get such a big outcome that's what I wanted yeah no yeah no so we're definitely doing a lot more in revenue than that but um you know I think what we developed was a pretty powerful software so we had about eight patents on our software we built cash flow based financial planning software which didn't exist which is really silly if you think about it most of the financial planning software out there was focused on helping you know people who were quite wealthy think about how to build more wealth but it didn't have to ever net can you pay your bills but for ninety five percent of the country you know now 78% of the country was paycheck to paycheck so actually that software that existed would never have worked for the majority of the entire country and so we built cash flow based financial planning software which actually would say how much cash do you have and can you pay your bills and if you have something left then where do we go put it and so it was a pretty profound technology platform and in fact I even chatted with somebody else the other day who's trying to build like a similar company you learn best because there's still demand for these software platforms abide these big financial institutions and they're really hard and they're very tedious to build so so no and then North thrush mutual also is just an incredible business and they have you know five million plus families across the country that they serve and for them to be able to take our software and go deliver you know plans to everybody was a very powerful concept that the CEO had so so yeah so that was the first bit and then the second that's good to know what was the sort of differentiator that's really powerful that could drive material outcomes I know I want to come back to you were saying that you're talking to people who are building similar tools I want to come back to that in a second but I have two questions for you were you profitable when you guys sold uh we weren't like within profitability meaning like we depending on how we're spending we were near profitable and we could have been profitable one thing that's worth saying we we were incredibly lean and how we had run we had just raised thirty five million dollars so my mandate was to continue growing and bills out business units at that time but again I'm a recession entrepreneur in my DNA we always lived as though we didn't have extra money and it was just I you know I think we went through a moment at post 2010 where was all about growth and get as big as you can with no mindsets profitability my roots first of all are like I'm naturally you know very very frugal very scrappy every dollar every dollar we started spending with my own in the early days its heist at the company up and so that was and I read a few different founders saying that that's the best way to be a founder and I I lived it because I felt like it was the right way to run the business and so even when we were spending like there were no dollars that were not going somewhere I'm gonna get this number this number will be roughly right but we had something like forty five million dollars of cash when we got acquired on the balance sheet and meaning that we just we were never spending that so why are me why raise you so much if you just raised thirty million dollars you had forty five million dollars in the bank that means you had something like ten or fifteen million dollars when you raised your last round and if you're making good revenue why raised in the first place and also why sell so great question and so I think first of all we'd so we'd literally just raised when we got acquired and North Oxford which will actually had had just invested and then they came and said actually we'd like to we'd like to acquire you guys so so that's that and then why set so what we were building I to be able to go get it to you know our direct consumer business was growing but I remember every day we were you know signing up forty families a day forty households a day to get financial plans or you know some days we do two hundred but it was and I remember thinking we built this incredibly valuable asset and we built it because we really believe that it should be something that should go as quickly as we can't cross the country but getting people to financially plan is really hard it's not like anybody walks down the street and says oh I can't wait to go get a financial plan today that concept didn't exist and I always joked I actually was selling an entrepreneur today I was like god I really did run a hard business to build which in retrospect I think need it and like an even scrap your entrepreneur than I thought if that makes sense like if I was selling shoes online like holy smokes how much fun would that be and I feel like that's an easy business to build but I was selling something that was hard right and we were productizing a financial plan that nobody ever was super excited about and there was some part of the population that loved it you know we were we were telling people hey financial plans gonna make you better and then once they tasted it they loved it so our customers were super sticky but I remember thinking to myself oh my goodness Northwestern Mutual's 8,000 financial advisors that passionately care about the mission and the same way I do that can actually go and use this platform to get to more families faster and if I really believe in their mission that's probably the right thing to do actually for the business is if you could tell me that I could go from hundred thousand to five million in a short period of time and like guarantee that that would happen like that actually is a better use of what does make sense so did the company Northwestern Mutual did they acquire you based off of was the the frame or the valuation based off of how many customers you currently had or did they just say that's a we don't really you know behemoth of a company we don't really care about your users but what we want to do is just take what you built and plug it in on our back-end and yeah I mean I think and again I can't speak for how they valued the company exactly it wasn't part of those conversations on the back end but I think that what they viewed it as was they'll say that there were three really powerful things the first was an incredible software that they could plug in that could go to their customers the second was our entire platform and if you go in Northwestern Mutual comm you know today I was effectively learned best we just moved over the tech stack made it so you could log in and see your finances use a lot of the tools we launched their mobile apps everything leveraging all of that and then the final thing was the team and I think one of the things I was most proud of is by the time that I was i you know i joined the management team but it's toted at one point roughly a third of the management team of Northwestern Mutual was the learn best original team and Northwest mutual is a incredible company if you remember you know they do call it 35 to 40 billion in revenue they'd be a fortune 50 company the little tiny startup and by the way you know I forget how many assets app but it's like half a trillion of assets like they are massive they're blue-chip they are solidus can be been here for a hundred and sixty three years but for a little tiny startup if they acquire to come in and be such a big part of the future of the company really shows you like a talent the innovation the thinking and then they got a whole campus in New York City and they still have today which became a bit of their digital headquarters i and again it was 150 people and we've got acquired but at some point it became close to five six hundred people that they were envisioning growing it to to be there yeah because it just raised I mean if you said yourself it sounds like you had a it was a slog a little bit if I'm kind of reading between lines like you're like oh my god it's 40 users a day like this is really freaking hard wit and they offer you that we're like yup and or what was that like no it wasn't that simple and made a handful of other acquires at the table I and I actually took my job very seriously which was my your job as CEO in those moments if you take your job seriously and maybe this is just how I'm wired my job is actually to go get all of the opportunities and unemotionally bring them to the board and to say here all the different paths that we can take forward and then the board came together and made a decision of what we thought was best for us and I actually waited until that day which was the morning that we signed to make my decision because my job was gathering all the different opportunities to bring them to the board and say here's what we have in front of us we can do this path this path or this path I mean to be crystal clear it was never like a stressful decision in that staying private so it was a really good decision like we had as I said about 50 million dollars of cash actually they goes 52 million I remember correctly of cash on the balance sheet we were growing it was starting to get easier and easier because we'd launched learned best Network which was growing rapidly and we were selling the software subscription in tens of thousands that's way more fun than you know a hundred a day um way more fun you're like great I can do this and that business was really taking off and it was I just started to see the oxygen of it um I think the present I'm making is every minute to getting there was a lot of work it was never one of these businesses that just like overnight 7,000 people show up to Chipotle and can't wait to eat our salads like it was it was tough anything like that but so I didn't make the decision till that morning and it was really I took it so seriously because I had as I said about 150 employees I had you know hundreds of plus shareholders if people had been part of the company at some point left and then all of our investors and so I had to think on behalf of hundreds of people and I felt that your CEO job is actually a really serious one which is to bring it to the table and then make the best decision on everyone's behalf knowing that some people be thrilled about neck juez ish and some people big why are you selling this is such a good business it's going well and I just also knew it what do you what do you regret about that journey I mean are you how would you take back selling or are you happy with that would you take back racing all that money are you happy with that is there anything that you you're like really well I don't regret a single thing I have to say I'm the CEO Jang shil ski at Northwestern Mutual was one of the best leaders that I ever have had the chance to work next to he is visionary and honestly like what he did I think I'm blown away by as as big companies think about you know I ingesting innovation he was really and I think and how he did a um and I think there's a another guy named Christian Mitchell who's the head of strategy and he was instrumental I actually it really was his idea the acquisition he became a best friend and somebody I admire and you know to take a fast-moving go fast break stuff start up in New York City with 150 people who are forward leaning in every way and then taking a company that literally is about as blue chip as you can get the the 163 years I you know they will live through every major challenge that we could go through as a society and to put us together it was kind of a brilliant marriage and we always said what what cemented us was our values if we believe every American family should have a financial plan it was a very simple marriage but it was like it was the Odd Couple I actually think some story one day wrote like The Odd Couple came together um and we felt like we maybe we made each other better and I think you know personally I got to grow a lot through it most times when a start-up CEO gets acquired they like sneak out the back door as quickly as they can and I care deeply that by the end of it um that I I wanted to make sure they felt great and I wanted to feel like I had done what I said I was gonna do and so I end up saying for years because I had such a good time and I think that that that speaks volumes to Northwestern Mutual which again I was chatting with a few friends who sold their business in the last week and they were like how did you stay four years and I'm like I loved it and that doesn't mean there weren't hard days there were brutal days there were really hard days uh you know we got down to learned best brand at one point because it really made more sense for it to live on the parent company as a parent I'd been around for 163 years and learned best was a tiny little brand and you know I was proud of that decision also because it was the right one for what we promised we're crazy interesting I know Shawn's good thinking of something I was just going to say if you can be this enthusiastic about Northwestern Mutual you sure do have the enthusiasm skill mastered so I commend you for that so what do you what are you looking at now so you invest now you got a fund inspired capital what spaces are interesting to you nowadays and so so inspired Capital we're an early-stage funds so seed series a we're totally generalist we're literally looking right now at everything from restaurant tax so food tech which is really interesting it's a mix of FinTech and sourcing of any type of food that we lolly from straight to agriculture you know farms to your coffee shops that were pretty excited about we're really focused on the future of money movement and there's some really cool things we're working on there and we are we just messing the company and the trucking logistics space which we think in hope can put lots of people to work um and so you know really focusing on what is the next decade gonna look like we actually published today a future of works study um and I heard this great quote we basically started the year in 2020 and we're ending this year 2030 just in how much we have just advanced the ball on who how and who we all are and how we will think and you know being a working mom how amazing it is is it that I can actually excel at my job truly excel and actually see my kids probably an hour and a half to 2 per day more I mean it's yeah it's I will say I think we're living through one of the biggest seismic shifts on our planet right now ever may be the probably biggest in my lifetime the global health world is collaborating in ways that you've never seen because we are all focused on the common enemy of kovat and I just think the world is incredibly exciting and I will say when you see asymmetric dislocation like we see right now because the world is on its tilt that's when innovators go nuts and this is like my favorite thing I'd talk to ten entrepreneurs a day and as you can tell I'm honestly just a junkie four founders I love building businesses my brain loves nothing more than hard problem-solving and I was just saying to a founder before this you know companies have season right you have spring summer fall in winter winter stocks right and as I just said I had plenty of winters that LearnVest summers when it's fun and things are exciting and I like to say that you know the inspired capital team we are our best when it's winter and for a lot of businesses right now this is a winter it's a scary time I was just gonna ask you you talked about future of work and you think there's a huge shift going on I think a lot of people right now are talking about this remote work what is what does that mean is this sort of permanent is this temporary what are the second secondary effects I'm curious what's something you know it's the Peter Taylor question what's something that you believe about the future work Denton is not sort of consensus right now it's not something that everybody is saying do you have any sort of original views or contrarian views around the future of work um I mean I'll just say a few things I've been thinking about a lot lately um I don't know that we I I don't we will go back to offices so let's be clear um but I think a lot of the fat will be cut and what I mean by that is we use I don't know about you guys but I used to like be in cabs and running and ubers and subways and sprinting and planes and trains and like the frenzy of what I used to do because there are so many social norms like if I'm gonna see you in the city I wouldn't be like hey let me zoom you right you'd like that's rude come visit me why like they're so just I think the amount of what I'm gonna call it useless friction that we used to apply to our lives that now looks calmer so that's great I think you know I'm really bullish on just equalizing households I actually think that this is this is a great equalizer um everybody's partaking in so many parts of running a household these days because we were blocked in our homes and that's gonna create some permanent habits but I think our gonna be better and um you know I I am really fortunate to have a phenomenal partner and my husband and we really do both a lot of everything I around our home and I think that that's gonna be hopefully more normalized going forward as I think a lot of parents are gonna realize it's not a choice stay home or work like there's this very powerful middle path and so you know I think the Greek economy going into this intermittent work economy it's just exploding right now like you can work 20 hours a week if you want to you can work 70 hours a week if you want to and I think that we're gonna so the only thing out I'll say that's I'm not contented I am deeply worried about how 40 million Americans are gonna get back to work and I think you know the markets right now Main Street and Wall Street are completely disconnected I honestly wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning wondering how are 15 million households gonna be absorbed when those jobs don't come back and and I'm worried about that a lot so that's one thing I'll say I don't I sometimes wonder why more people aren't talking about what we're gonna do with the jobs that do not come back and are you that for is me whatever what's your background you're what part of Florida you from I try grew up in Jacksonville Florida I was born in Kentucky I grew up in Jacksonville Florida my mom's side of the family's from South Bend Indiana my grandfather was a welder who I once whole life my grandmother I've worked at AT&T is like a operator I'm doing the spinning motion she was literally operator and then my dad's side of the family I want oval eyes Belgian and so and then both my parents were in the Army as doctors and nurses and so my brother was born in Germany and I was born in Kentucky what you sound so you I'm from Missouri and then I lived in Tennessee so I'm from a normal family not a Silicon Valley not a Manhattan family I live in San Francisco now and I'm deeply I'm definitely on like the inside of like a lot of the you know the San Francisco nerds and it sounds like you are on the inside of the Manhattan relatively elite circle I mean the partner for your for your firm is like a pretty big deal that fits their family so you do you just feel ever like you're an outsider of I mean are you do you just feel a little bit more connected to like your roots and you said Main Street in Wall Street does it feel more like you're connected to your roots where you grew up or do you identify more at this I mean and I say this because I'm in this crew to a little bit like this we're pretty elite right like we're like in this like relatively tight circle I mean where are you or do you think yeah I'm so glad you asked this question I so glad for a bunch of reasons and I think what's really obvious to me is I think it is an incredible competitive advantage um we I think right now we are in a world where the country is very disconnected I'm actually hoping that cope it is something that like does unify us a bit more those days where I worry in the wrong directions there's days where I feel hopeful and I think the fact that I came from a really again like my dad was in the army as a doctor my mom went to boot camp was a nurse my mom is a nurse practitioner my dad passed away when I was younger so my I was actually raised by a single mom with three older sorry three kids I've told her brothers um who are also both doctors um but like it reminds me every day that the bubble that we live in is completely ridiculous and in fact you know I am a certified financial planner who stared at America's wallets for a decade and the headline is people can't afford anything and everyone's stressed and if you don't have dignity to be able to put food on a table for your family that's what that's a pretty stressful thing if you're not sure how you're gonna forget like leaving for retirement if you don't know how you can actually think all right now holy smokes and now that I become a parent like that's so much more visceral and I actually think it's a real competitive advantage to remember that I there's 300 plus million households and this is in this country and that not everybody is on the same page and technology is and always moving everybody forward and so I think it's a major advantage to not forget that and again I'm literally in Jacksonville Florida right now in front of me dressed in like my childhood bedroom and I'm so proud of my roots and I'm so proud of my family and what they've helped me accomplish and goodness gracious do I feel like we need to do more so it's a good segue because earlier you said that people are actually still trying to solve the problem that you were trying to solve for what opportunities exist in this financial planning personal finance base I'm a huge nerd in this I used wealthfront I used personal capital I've used mint I use spreadsheets I love this stuff well first I love you for caring so I know thank you I mean it means so much to me you have no idea and I still honestly have days where that like makes me so proud you know I think a few things at the problem of our wallets for America is bigger than just like great software there's a lot of what I'm going to call infrastructure problems that like tech can't solve what's the minimum wage how do we handle you know working mothers when 25 percent of the country's moms are single moms and how do we handle daycare blah blah there's a lot of other big problems around the wallet in America that like a cool technology app doesn't solve that said I don't feel like learn best solved everything and in fact I I have this itch that we wanted to scratch for a long time and around you know I was a part of the population where I wanted to talk to a financial planner that Herning there's a certain user type about 22% of the country from our data that wanted to talk to an adviser in the country but about 78% of the country doesn't want talk to anybody they just want the problems of their wallet to be solved for them and so I get really excited about the future of self-driving wallets because I actually think every hour that you have an extra dollar penny $10 $100 $1000 it should go to the exact right pocket instantly and so I believe more innovation will happen and I think that's one of the things that you know we get pretty excited to talk about is you know I wrote a book called financially forward literally just to force myself to think about what I think of our wallet could look like self-driving wallet I so it softly word that every act you've put rules and controls around it if they my checking account always needs at least four hundred dollars in it but every dollar above that please go put it in the exact right place and what would you do with a pair of it would you like I use simple I like simple calm I've been toying around with that but what I learned was that it's it's a checking and savings account it's actually they use I forget what's whatever the biggest bank in like the world is it's like be I forget what it's called anyway they put their software on top of another banks checking account and because it's opening up the bank is really is that what you would do I mean how would you go about solving this yeah like a fair member correctly simple got acquired by BBVA um I think actually right before learn best firm weight less money of you guys which is pretty wild um so I think the thing that's um so the again I don't want to totally bore you but basically underneath it the problem with Thomas wallets is money movement which is money doesn't move quickly from one bank to another it moves across a CA trails from 1971 and they typically take about five days to move the money and so if you want wallets to actually be able to self drive you actually have to fix money movement so we've written thesis Macomb useless papers I call it actually liquefied money as the thesis which is also and I'll give another example why do we get paid every two weeks how does that make any sense you work every day guess what for a normal American family getting paid every day that's a pretty radical how cool why do we get paid every two weeks is this like some something that I have no idea it's a concept some people get paid weekly but most of us get paid twice a month and if you think about that people have liquidity crunches in between those two dates what do you think every day so under you get paid every hour that solves that problem that tries to solve the problem well they're solving a portion of that problem so but um but no I think that there's a few of them there's earning there's Dave there's a bunch of other there's a company called even which is but I'm projects that are streaming money it's basically like the way we you know we don't download movie files anymore and play them we stream it bit by bit as we watch but basically getting paid like that so why don't I get paid by the second that I'm working and it's just streaming into my bank account fractions basically of value and there's crypto companies you know but even are you both even more valuable okay is not just the streaming in its then what happens your credit card debt actually turns you interest every single night okay so actually you pay your credit card bill nightly wouldn't materially help save in keep mind the average family in America has between 9,000 and $16,000 of credit card that based on how you cut it the average savings account is 400 bucks but if every hour you got paid and then you could pay your bills and live your life but it would actually scream into your 401k and get the matching dollar that same hour and then auto invest think about that like that is what is the difference between and I always I feel like COBIT exposed the precariousness of our economy but it also exposed the precariousness of the American wallet and I think that we're going to be in a groundbreaking moment of how do we go fix it so any entrepreneurial is thing I want to talk to you Alexa at inspired capital I want to hear your ideas but these are the big that's it that's a crazy idea and I think that's a that's a cool idea for someone who wants to like it's it's kind of like a go big or go home that's a pretty cool idea I like that what would prevent that from working what are the barriers ACH it's the infrastructure layer that I was just saying that I mean is it money movement or is it a cultural thing because I'm a business owner I like I like the two weeks buffer for a small business when you're just getting started like businesses are we take advantage of that right like you're like like oh great I've got like five days I got to go collect this this clients money and then I can make payroll yeah um it no I that I think is probable I mean you have to bleeding-edge companies you know I think in just the last week we saw a few companies say I'm work from home forever but you take a few more that then say we're gonna pair our employees daily and in fact uber started playing its drivers every ride that's that's an example of you've worked you should get paid why do why do we withhold from you it's a free loan to your employer and at some point that will break down but that's not the thing I think is harder it's actually the money movement piece of because our wallets have been unbundled we used to have wallets at one place let's say chase and used to have your credit card they're your savings account they're your checking account your 401k cetera you now just both of you have names while you've been on this call seven places that you have financial accounts so it's money movement across those accounts moves across ACA trail that ACA trail takes about five days or it mimics it and it'll look like same day and sometimes that same day is really more of like a magic trick it's not really there so then to be able to pay it out to some other place is very hard so it's the rails and money movement that European companies doing something similar helping what was it called transfer uh there's a company called transfer eyes but then actually Europe is miles ahead of us they're on real time payments rails and you can actually they like let there they're like a full decade ahead of us and you don't even need them no monetary api basically a mandatory payments infrastructure right if your notice called UPI or how much know about brainstorm ideas we just shoot the and we brain some ideas where we see something interesting and we say hey this is cool these guys are doing streaming money what would you do with that hey why do we get I think we literally had this conversation which was why do you get paid after two weeks that's crazy it's a free loan to your employer and so that's what we do on this podcast twice a week so that's yeah we like to nerd out about this stuff so it's like we know we know a medium a little bit yeah what uh one of my favorite ways to brainstorm is I like to look at companies in other countries and just be like do that in America so like Gilt Groupe Kevin Ryan was like oh I see this French companies doing this let's just do that in America and we'll put a little spin on it what's a European company or an Indian company that is doing this quite well that I can go and learn about in order to see like how this is done because this is this like pretty hard to conceptualize right because we're like it's been done this way for who knows decades hundreds of years yet I mean to be honest for the standard of what I want to see built I don't believe that there's a company that is closed there's a couple united states that's starting to think about this and in doing a good job also called tally where the jason the founder is wonderful and it you know he he was helping people he started with credit card debt pay off the credit card debt faster which was that Court mean and starting automation around it but um you know I think I want to I want to like fast forward the decade ahead where we actually get to Instant Streaming money it you know I call it liquefied money you're calling it streaming money where your money can always be optimizing to the right place and that gets pretty powerful when that begins to happen but most importantly not only is it powerful it meaningfully changes the life of American families across meaningfully so I've heard this idea before about basically hey what's the category of what you built it's like pee pee pee FM or something like that yeah pfm personal finance manager and the theory is basically you have things that clarity money and LearnVest and others that were basically all like hey we can suggest some things we can show you some charts and analysis but like fundamentally you the user make the decision and what you're talking about is the software makes the decision right self-driving basically like it's not it's not you're sitting in your car and your car suggests to you how you should you know turn or change lanes the car changes lanes because it knows where you're trying to get as your destination and so I've heard before that hey what we need is for to get that get AI basically to the point where it can actually make the decisions and optimize the money for you so that the user doesn't have to make decisions user says I want I have these financial goals for myself this is my income coming in here's my bills and it basically does it and what I've what you added on was the reason that can't happen right now is because the transfer is too slow but it seems like there's a middle step which is just right now the software doesn't decide the user decides and most users don't want to think about that or make those decisions that most people are not active with their money management much to your chagrin I'm sure so is it more about software deciding versus users deciding or is it more about liquefied money um so liquefied money matters but then to your point so I'm gonna like I want to answer that with as with a visual question when we imagine money right now we imagine money by saying okay I'm gonna log into my you know my you trade a town and I'm gonna stare it on my grass and and you know look at things and I'm gonna talk to an advisor and tell them my goals and then like a lot of things are gonna be executed I almost think that we are thinking about the limits and the sound of what technology offers today as opposed to what the customer really wants if you ask a customer what they really want they want enough money to do what they need to do and they want everything else to be taken care of and like for most people thinking about money all day long is two words fun or exciting and in fact it's quite stressful I'm so imagined and so I almost think we visualize money based on what exists but imagine I thought exercise and I'll use an Amazon Alexa since I literally there's like 17 in my brother's house and he just likes to yell at me all day anything's it's so funny but basically let's use an Amazon Alexa and imagine you could walk in your kitchen every morning and just say you have surveillance so you have rules that you've set it around your wallet so has anyone who's broken my identity has anyone done anything bad or on tour restrictions that you put on to like my kids credit cards can youth only you know spend $50 a month and whatever it may be and then you've already clearly laid out goals and it just does it for you and so you walk in like why do I even need to look at my money all i care about is are there any crises no are the rules i've set up in place so any extra money you know i need $400 my savings account for checking for you know if i need cash we're gonna obviously go away from cash permanently at some point um and then everything else just optimize for me and that's math the thing I love you know I am a math geek I've always liked math growing up I always loved it math is really beautiful because this isn't you know we're not trying to cure something a disease that we don't this isn't a Kovan situation where we don't know that we don't know what to do yet we are looking for a vaccine to use that as an analogy this is math for every American wallet I can mathematically tell you where their next dollar should go to save to save them money make their life better and outside of them telling us what their goals are then the math can do it and it can do it every hour or every minute and at some point when you get there that is for the American wallet and so that's the vision of that's literally the picture in the back of my head is like when do we get to a place where my money is just doing what it should do at all times and right now there's wild amounts of friction move it from here put it in the savings account sweep it into this do this with this pay off the credit card to pay off your student loans you have to make two payments and tell them please pay the principal not just the interest friction everywhere and at some point it will go away and I motto services began and it would be selling my life starts you're very uh persuasive I feel like I'm ready to like get behind you and say let's go to war you're very you've got a very good pitch I would set these teachings at his book his book I can teach you at he's a great guy and I will say like every financial planner out there that's doing the work to help help people I just how I feel I'm not poor anymore but I will remember be poor and like so afraid to look at my login to my bank account and then I eventually created all these systems so it's like a little bit of paycheck goes here a little bit of interest this thing goes there though there and I'm like I I like jerry-rigged this thing together and even to this day I'm still like I hate logging into my bank account just because I'm from a year it's like PTSD right you're like it's so like I just don't even animate some stuff because I'm like I don't even want to I hate it I don't like yeah this is a perfect example of where you know I really do think yeah I grew up a really normal life I grew up in Jacksonville Florida which is a wonderful place to grow up and I just think you know I'm interested in technologies that can impact tens of millions of families I and like really meaningfully make our life better and one last thing you know inspired Capital we literally invest across all sectors I just told you everything from trucking logistics to consumer software to FinTech but one thing I particularly like about in tech is in fin tech any innovation is actually helping the customer right like you're not innovating in fin tech in a way that like gouges the customer it's like there constantly making their life better and cheaper and less expensive and the pressure it puts on the big incumbents to drive their prices down is really powerful and I think that's pretty awesome so I think it's a great place you already gave your email address I wish people find you who should find you how do how do people connect with you I would say I'm also on Instagram I'm just Alexa von Tobel our fund is inspired capital but you can message me on Instagram and I at the one place I actively try to respond to as many that come through so Alexa von Tobel on Instagram and thank you guys for having me this is so fun you guys are so memorable and again really honored to host out [Music]

or hell even if you want a job but you just want a better job this is what I would do first it's been almost exactly a year since I had this idea for the podcast so I'm looking at my messages right now too Sam so five thirteen twenty nineteen so this is May 13th a year ago I messaged him you know I got a proposition for you he says yes I said I'm starting a podcast it's like how I built this good quality good guess and I sent him a list of guests that I had in mind I said I want the hustle to be the publisher I'll do all the work you included in the email and this in your episode if we start monetizing let's share the economics Sam says okay deal I said cool I'll send you the first episode to preview at the end of this week and then we go back and forth a little bit and then and then we started you know I you know the first thing I did was I went and found somebody who could edit a podcast by going on Twitter and writing podcast editor in the search and I'm looking for people who wrote that in their bio and then I found Sean who was an editor for other people's podcast we made a cover or we made we figured out a name if I'm looking at the messages here the original name that I was thinking was because I was basing it off of how I built this so the name was how I got rich which I decided was way too you know an accrued or something it could've been good name it's at least sort of I don't know get your attention but uh but I knew I'd have trouble getting guests on with that name and in fact my first million also had trouble getting guests on because a lot of people who were successful don't want to come talk about money and they don't want to seem like a rich but it worked out anyways my first millions got off the ground we shifted off of interviews and started doing more casual brainstorm type episodes and that's what people resonated with they liked listening to something where you know it gets the wheels turning in your head it gets you to learn about a new space or a new business model or a new product that you hadn't heard of and people like to hear two people scheming and thinking up you know new ideas and dreaming about what could be because there's not very many product guys to do that and so that's what I learned along the way I'm like our stats now we have reached over 2 million downloads so we did about a million downloads in the first six months and a little more than that and then to let the second half and dude I could have never imagined that we would hit 2 million downloads in year one that's kind of amazing I'm like in shock even right now just sort of looking at it because I don't really check you know I don't really pay too much attention to it because I'm not doing this really for the listeners in fact when I started this I told Sam I said he asked me why are you doing this and I said well our company's getting acquired where it's we're in the due diligence phase right now and it's a lot of either lawyers or security people looking at our code things like that I was like it's really boring I want to do something I can't start a company but I can start a podcast during this time and so I need I had the itch to start something and this was my something and I'd always wanted to do a podcast because I like to talk and I figured this would just be a great little networking hack you know when I actually started the podcast I didn't think anybody would listen to it my plan was there's all these interesting people here in San Francisco I want to meet him instead of just saying hey my name's Shawn I'm a founder and this company you want to get some coffee which is annoying I hate when people ask me hey can I have some of your time do you want to get a coffee do you want to do a call we'd love to chat I'm like what's in it for me this is awful I don't want to I don't even drink coffee so that but if somebody invites me on a podcast or advise me to speak at a conference I'm like okay cool tell me more and I usually say yes and it's weird because it doesn't matter how many people are listening to the podcast or it could be an event that has a hundred people but still it feels good to sort of be on stage and I knew that other people like that too so my goal was this is a great way to meet interesting people and have an excuse to connect with them and I thought nobody will listen to this except for my mom but I'll build a cool network of people through the podcast that was my my evil plan and then I got greedy once it started growing and now it's now I kicked off all that yes and now it's just me and Sam talking but yeah my perspective change I think that's a good lesson to in general so I had one decisive reason to do it which was this would be a great way to meet other cool people I got that out of it and I did you know 30 episodes with different guests would build awesome companies and then you know I discovered a different opportunity as I was doing it which was hey a lot of people I should listen to this okay instead of making this about meeting the guess what if I made this about giving the audience content that they like and being you know being somebody that they listen to on a regular basis and I've you know sort of pivoted pivoted from there but anyways it's been amazing one year one year since having the idea and that's that's pretty bizarre I think I'll probably be podcasting for like ten years that's my guess because I like this a lot and and that's been cool there's all these different things that have come from it and I think you know if you're somebody out there who doesn't create content today it is where I would start if I was somebody who wants to have a non-traditional career if you don't want to just have a job or hell even if you want a job but you just want a better job this is what I would do right off the bat I would start creating content about a topic I like either interviewing guests and networking that way or talking about a subject researching and talking about a subject that you're interested in learning more about and just publishing and just publishing regularly because you'd be surprised who listens pretty badass people who saw this podcast and they reach out and then opportunities come my way or investments come my way or whatever it builds trust in people and the media of it is that it's low effort right I record once for one hour but each episode gets listened to for thousands and thousands of hours by other people so you know my one hour yields tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of listen to hours and that's amazing leverage right I'm getting a multiplier of what's called a hundred thousand to one on my effort in time which is kind of amazing that's why I would produce content and I would it also forces you to think about content as a product right so you gotta make content that people want you got to figure out how to distribute it to them you're gonna figure out how to monetize it so it's a great little mini business in and of itself without any cost really you just gotta you know buy a microphone that's kind of the extent of it it's not much more beyond that you

what's up guys Sean here Sam is driving for some Memorial Day weekend thing so it's just me flying solo today but got some good stuff to talk about first it's been almost exactly a year since I had this idea for the podcast so I'm looking at my messages right now too Sam so 5:13 2019 so this is May 13th a year ago I messaged him you know I got a proposition for you he says yes I said I'm starting a podcast it's like how I built this good quality good guess and I sent him a list of guests that I had in mind and I said I want the hustle to be the publisher I'll do all the work you included in the email and there's in your episode if we start monetizing let's share the economics Sam says okay deal I said cool I'll send you the first episode to preview at the end of this week and then we go back and forth a little bit and then and then we started you know I you know the first thing I did was I went and found somebody who could edit a podcast by going on Twitter and writing podcast editor in the search and I'm looking for people who wrote that in their bio and then I found a Sean who was an editor for other people's podcasts we made a cover or we made we figured out a name if I'm looking in the messages here the original name that I was thinking was because I was basing it off of how I built this so the name was how I got rich which I decided was way too you know an accrued or something it could've been good name it's at least sort of I don't know get your attention but but I knew I'd have trouble getting guests on with that name and in fact my first million also had trouble getting guests on because a lot of people who were successful don't want to come talk about money and they don't want to seem like a rich but it worked out anyways my first millions got off the ground we shifted off of interviews and started doing more casual brainstorm type episodes and that's what people resonated with they liked listening to something where you know it gets the wheels turning in your head it gets you to learn about a new space or a new business model or a new product that you hadn't heard of and people like to hear two people scheming and thinking up you know new ideas and dreaming about what what could be because there's not very many podcasts to do that and so that's what I learned along the way I'm looking at our stats now we have reached over 2 million downloads so we did about a million downloads in the first six months and a little more than that and then the let the second half and dude I could have never imagined that we would hit 2 million downloads in year 1 that's kind of amazing I'm like in shock even right now just sort of looking at it because I don't really check you know I don't really pay too much attention to it because I'm not doing this really for the listeners in fact when I started this I told Sam I said he asked me why are you doing this and I said well our company's getting acquired we're it's we're in the due diligence phase right now and it's a lot of either lawyers or security people looking at our code things like that like it's really boring I want to do something I can't start a company but I can start a podcast during this time and so I need I had the itch to start something and this was my something and I'd always wanted to do a podcast because I like to talk and I figured this would just be a great little networking hack you know when I actually started the podcast I didn't think anybody would listen to it my plan was there's all these interesting people here in San Francisco I want to meet him instead of just saying hey my name is Shawn I'm a founder and this company you want to get some coffee which is annoying I hate when people ask me hey can I have some of your time you want to get a coffee do you want to do a call we'd love to chat I'm like what's in it for me this is awful I don't want to I don't even drink coffee so that but if somebody invites me on a podcast or advise me to speak at a conference I'm like okay cool tell me more and I usually say yes and it's weird because it doesn't matter how many people are listening to the podcast or it could be an event that has a hundred people but still it feels good to sort of be on stage and I knew that other people like that too so my goal was this is a great way to meet interesting people and have an excuse to connect with them and I thought nobody will listen to this except for my mom but I'll build a cool network of people through the podcast that was my my evil plan and then I got greedy once it started growing and now it's now I kicked off all that yes and now it's just me and Sam talking but yeah my perspective change I think that's a good lesson too in general so I had one decisive reason to do it which was this will be a great way to meet other cool people I got that out of it and I did you know 30 episodes with different guests we've built awesome companies and then you know I discovered a different opportunity as I was doing it which was hey a lot of people actually listening to this ok instead of making this about meeting the guess what if I made this about giving the audience content that they like and being you know being somebody that they listen to on a regular basis and I've you know sort of pivoted pivoted from there but anyways it's been amazing one year one year since having the idea and that's that's pretty bizarre I think I'll probably be podcasting for like ten years that's my guess because I like this a lot and I mr. cool there's all these different things that have come from it and I think you know if you're somebody out there who doesn't create content today it is where I would start if I was somebody who wants to have a non-traditional career if you don't want to just have a job or hell even if you want a job but you just want a better job this is what I would do right off the bat I would start creating content about a topic I like either interviewing guests and networking that way or talking about a subject researching and talking about a subject that you're interested in learning more about and just publishing and just publishing regularly because you'd be surprised who listens pretty badass people who saw this podcast and they reach out and then opportunities come my way or investments come my way or whatever it builds trust in people and the beauty of it is that it's low effort right I record once for one hour but each episode gets listened to for thousands and thousands of hours by other people so you know my one hour yields tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of listen to hours and that's amazing leverage right I'm getting a multiplier of let's call it a hundred thousand to one on my effort and time which is kind of amazing that's why I would produce content and I would it also forces you to think about content as a product right so you got to make content that people want you got to figure out how to distribute it to them you're gonna figure out how to monetize it so it's a great little mini business in and of itself without any cost really you just gotta you know buy a microphone that's kind of the extent of it it's not much more beyond that anyways I wanted to because I'm flying solo today I wanted to actually look back and look at some of the different ideas that we've bring stormed and I want to give you my top ten half-baked business ideas that we've talked about on the podcast so as we've been riffing and brainstorming and just kind of shooting the these are my 10 favorite ideas that we've talked about podcasts I don't know if they're the best ten ideas they're my favorites which means I find them interesting either because I think they would work or I think there's a nugget of something interesting there and if somebody really kind of remixed it or rift on it or sort of built it up fleshed it out they could build a great business around it so I'll give you my top 10 and this will be kind of a recap episode we'll keep it short all right so number one or actually start at number 10 number 10 first dibs okay what's first dibs okay so this is when we were looking at auction houses we were breaking down I think heritage auctions which did eight hundred fifty million dollars last year in auctions which just shocked me right people selling collectible coins movie posters comic books I had no idea collectibles and auctions are as popular as they were I knew they were a thing but I didn't realize how much money was really flowing through that system and so anytime I observe something that surprises me I want to know more and I see that as an opportunity I used to see something odd and be like that's weird move in the other direction and now when I see something that might that's weird tell me everything there is to know about this and I'll give you an example I remember when I was in college this guy who lived on our whole tewfiq probably the strangest guy I've ever met I walked into his room his dorm room and he was looking at his computer and he was look at he's playing a video game I was like oh what are you playing an eternity he looked at me and the game kept going like his character kept moving and I'll say whoa you're not even touching the mouse house is happening he's like oh I'm not playing I'm watching as you're watching a video game is you know back in 2001 2006 2007 something like that and he's like yeah yeah this is a replay of a Starcraft you know tournament that happened yesterday those are what I was like you watch other people like video games and he said yeah it's great I'm like and it wasn't even live it was a recording of a Korean match that some guy had commentated over record and post on the internet and he was catching up first thing in the morning he woke up and he was watching it I was like this is so weird you're so weird dude I moved on with my life now fast forward you know 10-15 years later I sell my company to twitch which is the largest live game streaming you know a place to go watch other people in video games you know who knew but he knew and he knew it was awesome and if at that time I had been like whoa this is interesting why do you do this I could have learned a lot more I could have started twitch had I really sniffed out that opportunity and instead you know now I work at twitch and you know they've created a multi-billion dollar company out of it sounds like kind of learning for me anyways back to first dibs so as I was looking at these auction auction houses you know of course you have eBay which is the auction site for everything but then I saw all these niche ones there's goat for sneakers you know for sneaker heads bring a trailer is an auction site for vintage cars and it seems like you know on the surface that there's every every niches cover there's an auction site for everything so what do you do when there's no inventory left there's nothing else there's no there's no niche left you got to make a new niche you got to make something make a new inventory that doesn't even exist yet so the idea for first dibs is it's an auction house for things that don't exist yet now what does that mean you would partner with musicians artists movie studios athletes and you would auction off their first whatever you know these are the first hundred of this new line of LeBron sneakers that are coming out so it's the same sneaker that's gonna go for sale but auctioning off the first hundred to be made the first hundred Tesla Model 3 s the first hundred t-shirts the first hundred of copies of this album from your favorite musician I think people would pay a premium maybe even a super premium for getting first dibs from the creators that they love musicians athletes artists movie studios etc and it's like cool kids version of Kickstarter right if you're a famous musician you're not gonna do a Kickstarter it's sort of beneath you like a cool version of doing the same thing you're gonna say hey we're gonna make an album if you want to have one of the first hundred copies or you want to be the first 1,000 people to listen to the single you can pay me right now you know $500 piece to get that and you would end up raising you know potentially half a million dollars up front to fund your project just they're selling first dibs to your superfans alright that's that idea number nine drone light shows so fireworks big industry but there's all kinds of problems sound pollution air pollution danger so this is a new way of doing fireworks you do it with a fleet of drones that are all synchronized I'll have lights on top of them so you've probably seen this you know intel is doing a bunch of these demos for new year some people do this but I think there's an opportunity to do this at a franchise level on the local and local markets so fireworks you know pretty big business to two billion dollars a year in a last year I think you can do that with drones I think you can basically say hey you know pay a thousand dollars you're gonna have a drone light show at your corporate retreat at your birthday party at your cities you know festival or whatever it is and so it's a business in a box and if somebody was to create a drone light show franchise I bet you could have franchisees in you know 100 cities in the next two years if you if you've made it easy for them to push a button and have their own drone light show business all right number eight just talking all right there's one of my favorite ideas I was talking to my uncle who was divorced he's you know 60 years old and he's lonely you know like he's not lonely in a depressed way but like it's just a reality situation how would you feel if you were six years old and you're divorced and your kids have grown up and they moved out of the house and a lot of people tell them you know you should get out there you should go and do also do online dating but you know that's normal for Millennials but for somebody like my uncle that's kind of intimidating he doesn't necessarily want to go put himself out there and he doesn't even necessarily want to you know start dating and remarry somebody that's not his goal and so I think you can create something that is just talking it's a way for people to connect it's for way for sort of single people to connect but not for dating and so it gives you know the baby boomer generation a way to go online and just chat in a safe place it's sort of like you know you've seen the oldies Netflix shows love is blind or the circle and you know I think they're tapping into something which is that you can form a pretty strong bond with somebody just by talking and I think you could build a subscription business around giving seniors and baby boomers a place where they can go push a button and have somebody to talk to all right this episode is brought to you by Super side all right so here's the deal I'm incredibly impatient like horribly horribly impatient and if I get an idea at midnight by 8 a.m. the next day I want it done you know but that's really hard because if something needs to be designed where am I gonna find a designer at midnight to try to make this thing get brain to life so you know I don't Lee I'm alone other startups even huge companies need design help fast and they just don't have the internal resources or expertise to get it done so how do you get reliable design done without dealing with expensive agencies and lots of freelancers you use super side that's our sponsor for this week just go to super site calm slash MFM and tell them what you want they have a team of designers that can get it done fast you know they are 20 times faster than hiring a designer and 50% more affordable than a traditional agency so if you need high quality design done fast try super side lots of fast growing teams that are stretched or using them already check them out super sicom slash MFM I'm using before I love them check it out alright number 7 is YC for content okay so first you got to know what YC is YC is y combinator it's the sort of best startup accelerator that's ever been built they incubated or not incubated really but they accelerated companies like Airbnb Dropbox etc etc bunch of billion-dollar companies so they're super successful and what they did was they said hey we can take two people with an idea and we can in three months give them a clear focus which says hey at the end of these three months you're gonna be on stage in front of a group of investors who want to invest in you and you got to have a great product and you're gonna have traction you gotta have something to show for yourself something you've done in these three months that will give them the confidence to invest in your your company and through office hours whatnot they hit they made that happen and so they can help to create a whole bunch more startups that otherwise wouldn't been created they helped get them funded so I believe we're in the biggest boom ever for content content is king in a way that it hasn't been before you have Netflix if Disney Plus Hulu HBO Apple TV Plus quippy you have all these companies that are spending billions as a capital B billions into original content they these are platforms that are hungry for content they're walking in Benihana's they're looking for sizzling content on the grill so I think you can create Y Combinator for content it's an accelerator where you take talented people who are either directors showrunners producers whatever and they create a pitch for the show and at the end you have a demo day where they're gonna invest in funding your pilot and so you can create a sizzle reel which is like a two minute trailer essentially for your show that's what you create during the three months and you come in and you say hey here's the concept it's a group of friends that get lost on this island but then they discover you know mysteries that that start you know when they when they dig up this hole and it's like oh yeah wave it's that lost yeah it's kind of like lost but it's the new waves lost so anyways you the idea Y Combinator for content I think someone should go to LA start this now if you're willing to do this I would love to be involved ok I'm going to zip through a few more quickly so Boy Scouts without the religion and sexual harassment so this happened when me and Sam brainstormed about Boy Scouts big business two million members two hundred million dollars plus and revenue but the recent announced earthing bankruptcy due to all the lawsuits that they've been slapped with so I think that the fundamental need here is still gonna get solved people want to have a sort of rite of passage style program where you learn life and nature skills and parents want a place to put their kids you know as sort of a glorified you know take care work ok I don't have to watch my kid and they're gonna learn something they're gonna come back you know sort of enriched in some way and so I think you could go direct consumer through Facebook you could have targeted ads to parents who basically they want their kids to stop playing fortnight and go do something outdoors and so I think you can create a new brand like a Boy Scouts that's just not rooted in necessarily religion and doesn't have the sort of problems that Boy Scouts has had with sexual harassment and other other things I got them bunch of lawsuits ok great number five org charts ok this idea came from Daniel gross who was a special guest on the podcast daniel was great I should get him on again he was like you know ten ideas a minute type of guy so he brought up that every something that I've noticed now that I'm at a bigger company right I'm at a company now 2,000 people and every company has an internal or obstruction right as the CEO here's their direct reports this person's the head of marketing here's their different reports this person does content marketing here's their reports and so there should be a really easy org chart builder that can be used inside companies say it cuz I can find hey who who do I talk to if I'm trying to who runs our social media I could find that person and then secondly that should be made public so you should be able to look at other companies hey I'm looking at stripe who's the head of their developer platform and you can crowdsource all the content by pinging employees with each automated emails that basis says hey we think you're the head of this is that the right thing and you can get people to fill it in sort of Wikipedia style and so I think you could use this and this could either be a free service that you know eventually pivots into more of a linkedin type of thing or it could be a SAS tool for for companies so that they can have this up there's actually a startup they came out of Stella step that is doing this after we we talked about it clearly stole our idea called the org they raised eight million dollars from Sequoia and founders fund and there looks like they're doing exactly this all right number four Hemingway for email okay I believe that now more than ever as companies are going remote writing is an incredibly important skill you need to be able to communicate through email through slack writing memos and Google Docs so that other people can understand your thinking and your plans the problem is most people suck at writing and a lot of people are self-conscious about it which is why a company like Graham early can be at a hundred million dollars in revenue just doing spell check grammar check type of things Hemingway is a cool little app that you know I discovered many years ago which is it analyzes your writing and it helps you make it more punchy it tells you hey this paragraph is too wordy or hey why are you using this complicated word there's a simpler one you could use and so I think somebody could build a Hemingway like tool for business and write help you write better business emails I'm very very interested in this I talked to the Hemingway guys and said hey I'd like to buy your business because I want to do something like this so if somebody wants to build this I'd love to help make that happen all right number three TRT subscription all right so Sam has been taking TRT or testosterone replacement therapy for a while you know so so beverage testosterone and a male decreases by 40% over the last century that's sort of I don't know how they're measuring that because I don't think in a hundred years they were measuring testosterone but whatever that's a stat it's decreased over time and when you have a less testosterone you feel more depressed you feel weaker you have increased chances of heart attack blood pressure problems etc etc you know in normal sports you can't take testosterone because it sort of gives you an unfair advantage but in real life you know there's no Commission that's drug testing you to say hey are you taking testosterone which helps you you know maintain your muscularity and feel you know sort of greater levels of energy and whatnot I know Joe Rogan sort of popularized this he takes testosterone and some other things and so here's the idea six letters d2c trt you can make a hundred million dollars off those six letters and yeah so you're the direct consumer testosterone replacement therapy solution it's a repeat you know recurring business every month I think it's very high margin high retention and potentially a big market so I like that idea a lot I think that could be very lucrative number two this one's crop kitchens so this came from Stu Stu was a guest on the podcast and he said look food delivery is booming GrubHub post mates ubereats they have you know millions of users who open the app every day and they're trying to figure out what to eat and so now the restaurants that are on there or just right now your local restaurants but what they should be is you know there should be more diversity there should be more special restaurants that really they get you to click when you open up post mates or ubereats so cloud kitchens are on the rise which is basically it's a central kitchen there is no storefront there is no in-house Dining these are kitchens designed to produce food that gets delivered through these apps so ubers founder Travis Clinic he's raised I don't know hundreds of millions of dollars to fund his company cloud kitchens where he's buying real estate in cities turning them into cloud kitchens so this one it's clout spelled with T at the end cloud kitchens because it's going after influencers so you go and you get big names in the same way that like Gordon Ramsay Bobby Flay Wolfgang Puck Jimmy Buffett they've opened up their own branded restaurant chains you could do the same thing but on delivery only restaurants so Robert Downey's brownies you know ASAP rocky road the Kardashian salad company you know the possibilities are endless so you have influencers they partner with a cloud kitchen to produce one type of cuisine and then you deliver it on the top of all these different networks okay I'll pick one more one more good one here okay so this one's hooked for romance novels so I didn't know this but my friend taught me about this my friend Ramon he basically educated me that romance is one of the best-selling book genres there is I believe it is the best book selling genre romance fiction really appeals to older females and one third of all mass-market fiction books are romance and one-third of all romance readers are forty-five plus you know the average reader who reads romance novels reads five times more books than the next genre book reader so there there's voracious readers of romance if you like that genre you like these books in fact I know because my mom used to love reading Danielle Steel she's got this mansion here in San Francisco on billionaires row that mansion was built because people love to read romance you know one of the most best-selling books of all time Fifty Shades of Grey romance fiction so you get the idea but most you know entrepreneurs don't do this they don't read this so they don't see this opportunity but there's a multi-billion dollar industry of romance novels and there's a group of devoted readers and they have time and money to spare so I think you could deliver that same content in a new way so well the new way would be is like hooked so hook does this app that's short form stories that you read on your phone and they did it for you know young adult fiction and they raised fifteen million dollars they have over 50 million readers I think you could replicate that model you could do hooked for romance novels and you could build a very you can build a cash cow you're gonna build an absolute cash cow you can get people to pay you seven bucks a month to subscribe for this content to have unlimited all-you-can-eat great romance stories deliver to you on your phone so I think there's a bigger opportunity here you can pay a bunch of writers to write writers are out-of-work writers need you know who needs who needs a paycheck more than an you know struggling author so you can get a bunch of authors who are capable and you can say hey I'll pay you whatever hundred bucks per story or whatever I don't know the rates but basically you could get stories written for fairly cheap and then they become your content library that you are that you're amassing and so I think there's a big opportunity here but anyways ten ideas for you from the podcast as you can see we are idea machines if you're listening to this it's because you can become an idea machine too my goal is for more people to see the world as you know full of possibility when you see something that's interesting you go and want to learn more and you try to think about how you can get involved and you can make it bigger or when you see a problem and you say wait why isn't there an X that solves that problem and you can come up with ideas to solve it you're not gonna go and do all of these but it's really great to train your brain to see the world in this way most people see the world as just the way it is it's like this fixed thing and I see it as this completely fluid thing full of little holes where I can hook into and I could build new things I encourage you to do that don't look at the world as this fixed thing and be surprised every time someone invents something new just see the world is full of needing inventions and maybe you or somebody you know could be the one who fills it all right I'm out of here thank you for for listening Sam we'll be back I think for the next episode enjoy [Music]

what's up guys Sean here Sam is out today but we got my friend Greg Eisenberg filling in greg is a great dude you guys will like him a lot he's been a founder of a couple companies sold two of them one to stumble upon one to we work he's at we work now he said investor in companies he's a cool guy you guys would like him a lot he's got a real brain for designing products anytime there's like a social or consumer product he's one of the best thinkers around and I think you guys will see that we spent the first half of the conversation talking a little bit about his background and then the second half case we go through a bunch of random ideas he has on his you know Notes app on his phone just for fun so I think you guys will like it tweet at me Sean VP tweeted Greg let us know what you think about the episode as always enjoy hope everybody's doing great out there in the quarantine keep hustlin building stuff keep yourself busy with with good things all right take care enjoy the episode okay so I should introduce you so Greg is on the podcast greg has a homie from I don't how long over ninety few years at least we you know I guess the world probably now knows you for your haircut website right explain what that is what is the URL do you probably need a haircut you probably need a haircut calm yeah we're the the busiest virtual barber shop on the internet dude so what happened okay so people aren't quarantine they need haircuts and how does this idea go from a little germ a little little sperm in your head to and a real idea out there I mean you know me I like you know I get sort of excited about stuff that goes by Roe and I was talking about buddy of mine he's a stylist out of work couldn't pay his rent I was like I need a haircut I like to look good you know built the MVP and then just threw it on product hunt and before I knew it and when I was on The Today Show ABC and basically the way it works is pretty simple like for people who need haircuts they book an appointment they get connected to a virtual stylist and they could either cut their own hair or they can have a friend cut cut their hair for you this is a dope idea when it came out I was like who's behind this I know I feel like I know the person behind I don't know is you when I was like I feel like it see they do its Alex - all right it's like you know one of you sort of viral meemers of products yeah if you're like actually generalize hours brainstorming with you before I feel like for you to get excited about building something it's got to start with some emotion like either you think of something that makes you laugh and then you're just giggling and but you're serious about it once you start laughing or is something like really sad story and you're like okay this is an injustice in the world I wanna go salt but is that a fair is that a fair characterization of you yeah I mean I do like things that kind of go viral and like for me you probably need a haircut I mean I was I told my girlfriend I was like I'm a hundred percent sure this is gonna go viral and she's like well how do you know how do you know and I was like well like the name and and kind of you know where Brad and it was the timing like you just seed it with a couple of journalists and you know throw it up on product hunt and like before you know it like I don't know we probably had 150,000 uniques in the first 24 hours how many actual haircuts probably more probably over a thousand at this point yeah yeah definitely more than we have one Silas you did 200 so yeah more now any public speaking thing where they like hey can you send me like your bio this absolutely needs to be the first thing you know I you know conducted I'm responsible for over a hundred thousand haircuts and the crazy thing is that people like actually look good like I've I guys you don't have a haircut right now you're growing it out they're crazy try booking a haircut right like this weekend if the site is busy now I'm an entrepreneur I'm out here I gotta say I got a make it happy bit of people I love it there's a reason I have this hat on because you know your boy butchered himself with his own two a.m. haircut keepers without using your website and you can't declare so that's why all right so let's give people background and then we're gonna shoot the [ __ ] as we do there hi Greg first do you remember when you became a millionaire do you remember the day of course you always remember the day but I actually like you know where I started actually and I've never publicly said this word where I started I think you might know this where I started to actually make a little bit of money was really as a teenager doing affiliate marketing oh absolutely and like the underbelly of the Internet yes and you know not people not a lot of people talked about you know there's a lot of actually great entrepreneurs who who actually came from that area area I think Julian Smith you know is also was in that area as well but I actually remember 2008 it was my I think was my 18th birthday and I was doing affiliate marketing basically I was doing deals with you know the eHarmony is the mash comms that in and Zynga's who were like they were willing to pay you three four five six bucks for every install you generated for them and back then there was this Arbor I mean there's still arbitrage now but there was this arbitrage where if you could you know create a landing page and cost you $1 to to get someone to it to install that game or get that lead to eHarmony they would pay you five bucks right so I would just figure out like kind of just some innovative ways to do it you know one one thing I did which you know which I invented was the auto-playing video pop-under ad which ruined the Internet were you desperately trying to find which tabs playing the sound well we did it for a poker company and yeah that's it and basically you know we I remember getting like 1 2 % conversions on and this is a pop-under ad to cut costs like a fraction of a penny but you know from that whole experience of like as a teenager kind of working in affiliate marketing it really just taught me like what do people want yes because yeah you know I didn't grow up poor or anything but like my parents were giving me to let go and a lot of money to let go and buy the things that I wanted so I was like okay I'm gonna have to go out there and do it myself and I ended up building you know I put it like okay a hundred dollars a month on this landing page a thousand and it sort of grew and you really pay attention if it's your own money you really do pay attention and and you know if the difference between like a one percent conversion rate on one point two percent conversion rate is if you make a hundred dollars a day or lose a hundred dollars a day or at bigger scales lose a hundred thousand dollars a day or gain a hundred thousand dollars a day and if you realize it's it's around just subtle details like having a woman with red hair or have the eyes look at look at you in the landing page or certain copy all these little nuance things add up to the to getting people to do things on the internet totally me and I think you know fir Conde the CTO had my startup we used to literally look for hire for can we find anyone who's done affiliate marketing we're like the people who understand those arbitrage they actually understand how the internet works you understand what makes people click what drives them to actually take action how the economics of the internet works how to move traffic around and that's a problem it's not a great long-term path but it is like a great place to sharpen your sword so that then you can do damage with like products that actually matter or like more sustainable businesses versus these kind of like you know moment in time arbitrage is yeah I was I tweeted the other day actually I was like the people I I want to hire are if I'm building a consumer internet thing is like X game developers or game product people are game marketers or X affiliate marketers like those are the people that understand game dynamics mechanics social mechanics how to how to build like you know game game companies have very sophisticated marketing funnels and understand the flow very well and the same with affiliate marketers like those are the people that have been there done that better that are probably undervalued in the market yeah and then you you went on you did a bunch of other things you did an agency yeah that was kind of like building websites for big big brand bigger brands yeah then you decided we we James Altucher on the last one he said he did the same thing basically those because kind of his first hit was like making American Express calm or like whatever those websites well yeah after after I the affiliate marketing I mean no one's lower on the totem pole in terms of status and reputation and then domain airs and affiliate marketers so I was just like how do I gain credibility so got into the agency game and said I would only work with the top clients which is all status all status like 100 percent says so did you have like status symbols do you have like dope car or anything like that did you do anything to play the status game I mean not not I mean I feel like for us like Internet entrepreneurs like that's not even like the status like the status isn't dope cars or dope like houses I feel like it's you know it's more about I don't know um house invite or not yeah exactly that's not you know it whatever is cool at the moment so yeah I ended up start you know doing this agency it was called stress limit design we ended up doing like high-profile projects like the TechCrunch redesign which was like in 2010 which was like a big deal and that spawned a lot of business and then like I think you had Andrew Wilkinson from tiny on the show we had a similar model where we took a percentage of our revenue and we built our own startups and the startups is was all really all around this idea around building mostly communities so like we built like start a vertical so we did like start cooking calm which was like at the time the largest video cooking set on the internet things in the finance space a company called Wall Street survivor which became the most popular financial education and stock market simulator on the internet and just like how do you look at a vertical and build something that they really want and then wrap around community yeah so did that and then I realized I want to go do something I want to do the whole San Francisco kind of like I was living in Montreal Canada at the time I'm like I want to go do the whole like this is like post social network right around then probably when they came out of 20 2012 maybe and one day what did you think was hot [ __ ] back then were you like reading certain blogs was it too the social network the movie what was hot shake because I literally twenty twelves when I moved to San Francisco - and my journey was like I'm starting like a restaurant I started I'm trying to start the Chipotle of sushi at the time which ended up becoming this like Cod kitchen and then someone you know mano mentor gave me the book the lean startup and I was like oh [ __ ] yes we should test if there's demand before we pour everything into this inside personal guarantees for this lease and that led me to Paul Graham's essays and I was like oh this guy this Paul Graham guy this is the [ __ ] I don't know why his website looks like this but this is amazing and so then I started to like you know drink the kool-aid of Silicon Valley and I was just I picked up and moved from Australia just off of the kool-aid I changed my phone number I was like here's a San Francisco phone number that means I'm in I'm committed and then I moved so what were you what got you hooked I mean I'm like a product designer so like for me I was really and I love social apps and so for me it was really like the Pat like Pat you know that was like so cool back then you know Pat yeah so yeah for those who don't remember was like kind of a you know is based on this idea around Dunbar's number which is like a person only really has 150 relationship so like what if you designed a social network around 150 people like private and it was just super well design and beautiful and they invent they kind of were like way ahead of their time like Danny Trin invent like reactions and stuff like that right and I just like remember looking at a lot of like those people like the dig guys the StumbleUpon guys and just being like I mean you needed to be there you needed to be there and then yeah you know even if you took quick trips it just didn't feel there was something special going on in that era so came down you're speaking past tense you still think that's that's true or that's not true anymore I mean I think it's for me I think like Bay Area is like very much I mean listen it's a wonderful place but I think for most people it's very much like I look at it like a college experience like if you're not from there it's like you go there for six eight ten years you do your stand them as much as possible you build your network and then you bring it to wherever you're from or whatever major city that you live near absolutely where do you live now no I live in New York City now okay nice yeah did you sell your place here or what yeah it's gone you know I had this yeah house here in San Francisco it was awesome it was a great great little play place I mean that was a crazy stay that was like a commuted like it wasn't even like it was my place but like it was a community place okay you know we threw so many events there and it was you came to some and parking space if instead of working you just partied there it was like a co partying space I do miss it so yeah I think like you know that's what drew me to San Francisco and I started something called 5by which basically took a look at all you know integrated with all the video popular you know apps like YouTube and Vimeo and all these sort of sources and we built like a beautiful curation layer on top of it so that when you press the funny button you'd actually get videos that would make you laugh yep and we sold that to stumble upon which is Garrett camps company which at the time was one of the largest social apps by referring traffic so you ended up being within reach of being able to invest in uber right you know Garrett and then what do you remember the first time you heard that he was doing this thing yeah I mean I don't remember exactly but I remember when I met him you know uber was you know it was a thing it wasn't obviously what it is today but yeah you know I definitely I definitely wasn't like hey like take my money you know I think but you know I guess you live in you learn I have a friend who you know Garrett pitched him and he was in New York City you know one of the smartest guys I know and Garrett pitched him on the seed round of uber and and this is in you know in Manhattan he was just like Garrett like I don't know what you're thinking about man like people aren't gonna like press a button like and like a car is gonna come it's just you know you raise your hand look at me I raised his hand watch this watch this BAM you know like it's about creating 10x better product this is in 10x quote-unquote yeah that's true in New York it actually wasn't right this isn't a whole bunch of other places it was it's right it's like people without with crypto they're like oh watch this credit card boom paid for coffee I'm done you know look at this Bank you know don't need to worry about my money it's like well yeah but that's not the experience for most people in most of the world and so maybe this doesn't solve your problem but it's gonna solve somebody's exactly so we don't crypto guy my crypto guy I am I have some crypto I not enough good to have some crypto I dabble I mean the my whole thing is like everyone should have 2 to 5 percent of their net worth in crypto as a hedge right I calculated the other day I think I'm at 9% because I was like am I going a little too crazy with this like no no it's okay it's at 9% that's that's except it's in the acceptable range I'm at 7.5% rows right so as it grows the thing is are you gonna sell off no now so yeah not not gonna not gonna sell off Oh we'll see if this the exactly the other thing is like pay to learn in a way right like dude okay this is interesting I need to get in the game I need to get a little bit of skin in the game just to like be be you know if not like sort of driving things in that space but at least I'm in the passenger seat or the backseat or the trunk like I'm involved in the journey of where that's going by putting a little bit of skin in the engine I highly recommend that too because that's been my approach with a lot of things now is just pay to learn right yeah I think like for me like I learn best when I'm just like pushed into the ground just like push me into the arena and like listen like I'm like I've lost a lot of opportunity and I've learned a lot of things and you just have to assume that you're in it for the long got long game and like life is long hopefully and that you have enough at it's all about at-bats like getting at-bat trying different things you know build good relationships in the end you'll be fine if you if you learn and if you have a lot about that alright this episode is brought to you by super side alright so here's the deal I'm incredibly impatient like horribly horribly impatient and if I get an idea at midnight by 8 a.m. the next day I want it done you know but that's really hard because if something needs to be designed where am I gonna find a designer at midnight to try to make this thing fit brain to life so you know I don't lay I'm alone other startups even huge companies need design help fast and they just don't have the internal resources or expertise to get it done so how do you get reliable design done without dealing with expensive agencies and lots of freelancers you used super side that's our sponsor for this week just go to super site calm slash MFM and tell them what you want they have a team of designers that can get it done fast you know they are 20 times faster than hiring a designer and 50% more affordable than a traditional agency so if you need high quality design done fast try super side lots of fast growing teams that are stretched or using them already check them out super sicom slash MFM I'm using before I love them check it out so we sold the business to stumble upon ran in as an independent unit it sort of helped a somewhat upon as well left I grew that to like one of the fastest growing video discovery apps at the time left in 2015 it and started Islands which was based on this thesis around group chat is the new social network and it was gonna vertical eyes and that you'd have a place to talk with your workplace friends that became slack a place to talk with your gamer friends that became places like discord and we focused on just the college market so raised a couple million bucks on the idea and away we went and then now it's your story on how that ended up so the story is we sold a business to we work in May 2019 and I would have loved to have continued building it out it you know it had amazing I had a lot of really good metrics like the daily active users would send between 30 and 50 messages every single day weekly active users would open the at 47 times per week the average user would invite 2.1 people it was a beautiful product people loved it so it had like engagement it had written and retention was a 50 percent 45 days so like that's - you know it's like pretty damn good for social app above above what you'd normally see but like when I went out in the market to raise money I wanted to raise a lot of money and the reason I want to raise it is because we were seeing five to 25 percent penetration and every school we launched at within a couple of weeks and we had all these metrics so it was just like hey give us money so we can scale this to every college the United States but at the time this is around Facebook antitrust type stuff Twitter wasn't really like you know innovating that much so they had a lot of like kind of like health of the health and the product that they were doing snapchat the stock was at five dollars and ninety cents like social was kind of like and and house-party was flat you know so it was kind of like no one wanted to look at it you know and I could have raised two three four million bucks to continue it but like I was kind of like I'm very much in you are to like very much like a go big or go home yeah and I just figured yeah let's find a good home for ya okay gotcha all right so tell me tell me what's it got your interest now so what are you doing day-to-day basis nowadays so I am the head of product that we work which is awesome an interesting place to be I am a co-founder of a product studio called late check-out it's spun up the problem you need a haircut idea and among other ideas which is kind of a reincarnation of what we had it's stress limit it's part agency part part products to do I've been an advisor for the last year and a half or two years for tik-tok which has been amazing to see because they've obviously grown tremendously and so I've been keeping busy yeah okay nice so people when they listen to this but they like to hear about is they like to meet interesting people I think that's check then the second part is the people who are listening are your current entrepreneurs in the market doing something or they're people who have a job or thinking about making the shift or they're college student thinking about making the leap and you know one of the things that we do a lot of is we sort of you know just in check or sort of pontificate on you know why doesn't somebody solve this problem or wouldn't it be cool if you did this or hey that things working what if you applied it in this other way and so I'm curious do you have I don't know do you have like and your phone do you like a Notes app of like startup ideas have big startup ideas yeah I am probably there's probably over a hundred ideas here I thought what might be fun cuz you mentioned that just before you're like oh hey like you have any ideas I haven't notes file I can literally just like yeah let's do I can play we could play a game where I just go like this and spin the wheel yes let's do it all right pulling it up okay some of them are like you had a couple of glasses of wine I understand I understand all right Metamucil for Millennials Metamucil does what its rehydrating or it's like diarrhea or whatever fiber fiber okay so I think the genesis of this one was you know I think I love subscription-based businesses a lot of businesses that are like repeatable um people who take Metamucil take it every day mostly to get their routine yeah kind of in china routine yeah a lot of brands right now are just being kind of like rethought of with like obviously is d2c with like kind of a nice brand like I don't connect with Metamucil I'll tell you about it all yes you know maybe it just so it's like that's like a no-brainer yeah I like that one in fact wouldn't I did III did a podcast with the guy from Seoul who created Soylent and he was like yeah like you know part of the original thesis was kind of like the you know what the other shake is called ensure it's like ensure for Millennials and right they don't they don't market it that way but they were thinking about it that way early on and so Metamucil is another one all right I like it I'll give that a solid matter than ten actually I came out hot with that one all right spin again yes second opinion calm when you need a second opinion on literally anything okay it's giving you bends or what I don't know man like being an adult is hard right and we have to deal with it and sometimes we need relationship advice sometimes we need I don't know how to fix something like you know what I've learned from you probably need a haircut it actually is that people are actually open to getting help and they'll pay for it right and so it's like imagine you're having like a big fight with your girlfriend and you want to tell someone but you want an unbiased opinion you need a second opinion based on the text that you're gonna say right second opinion calm here to help great domain if you could get it okay I like this what what vertical would be the best that's kind of where this gets interesting to me because I where would you start and you know maybe you actually just end there because it's it's yeah you specialize but if nothing else you start with one where people really want this or people really have this problem so so where could it we're gonna be hot so a good framework for thinking about like how to think about consumer like Internet products is like what is the thing that's gonna get a lot of media attention because you want free customers and you also yeah you want free customers and also word of mouth is the best customer anyways so like what's something like why don't you just reverse engineer what would be a good PR story like that's just one way to look at like MVP right it's like with the minimal viable press release so somebody was doing this like for dating profiles which especially as tinder got hot that was the time where somebody was like oh my god there's tinder coaches they'll give you a you know objective opinion on your profile and how you're coming across and right you pay for it and that's like actually a thing and that worked wait and that worked when there's like kind of the way Internet you know tinder itself was kind of newsworthy you could piggyback off that in the way that you guys sort of piggyback to off of you know all the sort of quarantine woes with the you probably got a haircut so you'd probably want to find something that is people already talking about and then you sort of you offer the second opinion around that space exactly so you know maybe yeah so one idea is like maybe you start with like relationship like relationship advice because that's like my evergreen that that's always and but then you've launched like the viral piece of it should I get a divorce calm or on top you have to answer the why now and the why now is like a lot of like single people are like should I go on a date with this person like an in-person date less than six feet let's say or should I make out with and then you press the button and it's like no or something like that so we think like that's where it comes down to like yeah like building little games building a little like neurons things that like surprise people delight people people want to write about okay love it spin again this is kind of like I'm gonna give that one that's kind of a penitent yeah this is maybe even a three-and-a-half minute n but like picking random ones here yeah text me a secret calm and this is I didn't do a full spin so I guess it was related to second opinion calm but like we all have secrets and a lot of time we want to like talk about those you get them off our chest get him off our chat chests so this is a service that does that here's another one like that idea so so here's here's how what I'm imagining yeah I get matched with someone and it tells me a little bit about them Johnny nine years old male San Francisco rich and then he basically did but I but I don't know more than that and then they open up and you can open up or you can sort of roulette wheel get to the next person it's a secret network of telling secrets to each other yeah man is model is blackmail it's genius we'll make millions I'm doing the money burns you know evil and next idea which is a bit more the the opposite of this idea more you know nice for the world is a wash and fold for low-income families so I a lot of people especially in New York City but you know everywhere in the world and cities spend a lot of time in laundromats and if you're a working mom or working dad like you know sitting for 2-3 hours of the laundromat is like take is a lot of unproductive time that you could either be spending with your children or you could be like doing a side hustle or whatever it is right so like how do you like do wash and fold and just take that out of the equation so that they can focus on what it is they want to be doing and so this just philanthropic it's like it will be taken care of for you we're gonna get back hours of productivity to the people who people who need it yes absolutely ok here's right here's another one Spotify but for work in progress it's called watercolors so the whole idea here is ok life is messy and there's a reason why there is an eraser at the end of a pencil but like when you go on Spotify it's all these like highly curated like I've produced this piece of content for the last six years and this is you know here - here it is right what if whatever what if artists can put like just like little pieces of work that are like unfinished and create almost like a SoundCloud type website or app and and it's called yeah what do I call it watercolours I don't know why called the watercolors but so for the unfinished thing would it be like a dribble where it's like a shot it's like it's like 10 seconds of the song it's not the whole thing raw it's a snippet that you like yeah it could be whatever whenever the artist decides so the artists decide they want to do a like 10 second thing great this is like here check this riff but I just think that there's a whole dimension of music that we're not exploring and I'd also think that it's just kind of like I want to see more apps I want to see more websites where it's fine to put unfinished work I think that's a part of the creative process yeah and I think that it's a good message that we should be spreading yeah and I think stories is an awesome format for unfinished things like just like stories got people to share little raw moments of their life because they're like look it gets it's gone after 24 hours I feel like if you can make it ephemeral than more people the question really is why don't people share more unfinished work and then you would work backwards from that like well here's my objection here's my hesitation here's what I'm worried about and then you could figure out product design that will solve those problems well yeah I think like to talk to speak to that I think you know artists and I include myself as an artist because I'm a product designer is like we don't we we'd like to show our best work right so like putting unfinished work isn't quote-unquote our best work so I think like a part of this is like ajik that's a big challenge with this one but I think like educating the artists around like it's okay like you it's cool like and in fact like if you're like an artist hundreds of thousands of followers or even like 20 like if you just have like a thousand really engage people like they want to interact like III know there's one artist he has 2,000 followers but like he posts on stories like little unfinished things and I'm like post more of this right yeah I'm with you we I used to call it working in public and then somebody sent me this link I think Jessica Livingston or somebody was calling it working with the garage door open I don't know who it was reading but they were saying like imagine your startup you know you're starting in the garage but what if you get the garage door rolled open and like what are the sort of serendipitous benefits you can have of putting your work out there in public mm-hmm another you want what you want a couple more yes yes I get we get literally do this for hours this is just a concept so like I just wrote you know what are cool ideas that take something free and then you charge for them like and then I put my G water like water bottles if you think of water bottles like no-one was charging for water until something someone was like hey wouldn't it be cool if like you can transport this water and like food sell it and then we could have like a luxury brand like you can have Evian and it's gonna be from France and then there's this whole new category like new categories the founder of Gumroad tweeted the other day he was just like do you want to make $10 an hour do you see that tweet no I think you wanna you want to make like $10 an hour like go work for some someone you want to make $100 an hour like charge companies or something like that I'm butchering it here but if you want to make a thousand not like $1,000 an hour the point is it was like you wanna make $10,000 an hour creed create a new category and be like the leader in the new category and I think like I'm always interested in like new categories like virtual Bert you know barbershop new category like yeah may not work but it might work and if it works it's gonna work big uber new caddy it's really just like a new on demand like using technology to bring a car to you like new category like boom yeah for sure so what's something that's free that could be it could be charged for so for example water is a good example you know when you first said that my brain was like oh air but actually air is also charged for air purifiers diffusers things like that humidifiers there's pee there's ways that people have found a way to essentially charge for air in a way their process processing it but they're doing it what else is free that could be charged for so content is I mean the [ __ ] or put another way like what are the things that we take for granted as human beings that we can charge for and that opens up like a whole other set of products and services and so forth because those are blind spots right you have to actually think hard because they are just embedded in the world you you don't even realize that they're sticking out because there you take them for granted by definition absolutely and that's what I like I was before we were chatting I actually someone called me and was like Greg where do you where do you see can't like the consumer Internet going and I was like it's that this stuff comes out of nowhere the stuff literally comes out of nowhere there's like you can look back in hindsight and be like oh yeah like we can connect the dots for these reasons but I think like the dots are actually pretty messy to connect if we actually look at it and I think like the best actually consumer businesses are kind of like somewhat random there's someone random it's based on like an entrepreneur just like being obsessed with like like I been Ruben for example the founder of house party he's an architect he thinks of you know house partiers is these rooms sort of physical space you know digital representations of these physical spaces the guy is like spent years being you know studying to be an architect and obsessing his like entire teenage years about like presents Ryan what that means so like it's not because that in like 2016 or whatever 2015 like the live video was like important why you know it was like no the guys literally been like thinking about it forever and he's like the expert in the world on it have you ever seen there's this video of Evan Spiegel from snapchat he's in a kitchen and he's explaining snapchat on like um you know like a notebook they're just like a note pad of paper and he's got like you know he flips it three times and it's like those are your slides essentially have you seen this video I have it's actually everyone should watch that everybody should watch this video because it's he's taking when you go through that it's like I've never met him but he's such a like you just realized that he's amazing because he's able to distill a really quote-unquote complicated sort of like he just makes it so simple and I think the beauty of it is like everyone on this team could look at that and like oh yeah then they repeat it to other people yeah what snapchat oh it's so hard to use no actually it's so simple right exactly yeah the video the video was amazing even like I just never one detail in it on the design he's like yes so he explains first you know why why you know it opens up to the camera so you could take a photo and it's meant to be he's like basically photos today are thought of as memories you take a photo and you're stashing it away for essentially your your keepsake he's like but we use photos for communication we just think if you send someone a photo it's a great way to communicate you know what you're doing how you're feeling if you take a photo of your face it's you know it's better than typing in many ways like first snapchat is just using photos and videos for communication not for memories it's a boom insight one insight he's like and then we created this thing called stories and he's like four stories you know what we wanted to do is like every social network is reverse chronological so you open up your feed and you see sort of the latest thing first music but that's not how our brains are really wired you know we communicate through story and that's what we remember and so you know when you click on a snapchat story it starts from beginning then it goes middle and end and it sounds like obviously duh but that was counterintuitive Twitter was reverse chronological Instagram was reverse chronological Facebook was reverse chronological your email was reverse chronological and so that was the you know with stories he's like when do we do it beginning middle end you can you know you're potent or when somebody clicks your thing they're gonna experience it the way you are wanting to tell that story and I was like okay guys a genius like that's what that is it's taking complicated things making them simple we're taking things that seem simple on the surface and it's shot and showing how much is actually below the surface how much thought went into crafting that simple experience yeah I think what I like about that is like he starts with the key insight well it's it you know pictures worth a thousand words is one way of looking at it so communicating through photos is a richer way of communicating through then through text or calling somebody right and so yeah great and people do do this and that's sort of like the immediate hater is well I can just I can go to iMessage I can upload a photo and then I can face right send and I can send that to you and then sort of so the first insight is people use photos for memories they should use it for you know it's really effective way to communicate that's the insight and then he changed the how which was like well we reduce the friction to zero so like you could open up iMessage click your friends name click the camera button click the gallery button find the photo then hit Send and then they get it and like then they view it or you open up our app the cameras already open you push you know you take the photo and then you send it to as many friends as you want one too many and like boom that's done and so they change to how lowered the friction of getting people to do what they already wanted to do alright so I think it starts with the it starts with the key insight next it goes to like what is who what is the community that has a burning need for this like instead of like a long you know mistake a lot of people make is they create software and then they find the community versus like finding the community and then building the software right so like you know with this particular key insight the way it relates to the community I mean snapchat started off in high schools in Los Angeles had like preppy preppy preppy country $50,000 year high schools and these people were sending you know their kids they're sending like naked pictures they're sending pictures of drugs they're sending things that their parents don't want them to see or just like making or just basically things if their parents don't want to see so election obviously should change one think the unique insight wasn't just that the user for communication it's that wins photo stick around forever people you know it's a hesitant to share it sucks and so there's a whole bunch of things we want to share that we don't want to stick around forever and so that ephemerality was the was sort of the key mechanic so second second piece burning you know what is the burning need for the community and then third I think is like okay how like what is okay now you you want to build software now explain to me how that ladders up to one and two and why this is the most beautiful and the fastest and you know and then if you have those three like forget Dex forget like business plans like just show me one two and three and if you show me one two and three two and three like the market for you know when people looked at uber and them initially people like on-demand black cars San Francisco come on right such a small market what are you talking about it I know I know people who've done who did that and it's like yeah like but sometimes small markets you can't always pick a really big market sometime so small markets actually expand to be new categories in really big markets so I think you got to play the field I think you got Austin you got to look at small you got to look at medium and look at large and I don't think that if the market is small you should be like I can't do this right and I guess if we're being honest with snapchat they didn't realize the high school was the community that they that would need this the most because I think what ended up happening was they had it they built it while they're in school summer hit usage was pretty flat they were thinking like Oh college kids will want to do this which ended up being true college kids did want to use it to send photos from parties and whatnot photos you don't want to stick around forever and then somebody you know to introduce it to their knees or something that something like that and they basically not in the school I think they were using it it was am i right on iPads to send sort of in classroom iPads to send you know messages to each other across classrooms or whatever and the teachers couldn't catch it basically because the message destroyed Burn After Reading essentially is that it they do I have history correct yeah that's it that's it and then with uber same thing where I think they also probably thought it was a small market because neither Garrett nor Travis ran the company initially right they hired a guy they you know guy off Twitter wants to run this yes sure come on over and he became a billionaire you know but like I think if they knew whatever becomes they probably run it from day one themselves I think they sort of observed over time holy [ __ ] there's a lot of poll here and then this could go even further and so you know it progressively stacked up from there I agree and I think like for for the people listening I think it's important to like when you're thinking about what do you want to spend your time doing think about like what have you spent your time doing like what have you spent your life doing and why why do you have like this unique advantage or these you know what are some key insights that you can have about the world that that you could so what was the answer for you for I mean I have a law I had you know I think every person has had unique insights like for example like or unique backgrounds like my my family used to own like store you know stores in Quebec for I don't know 100 years and I grew and because of that like every Saturday my mom would drop me off at the mall where my dad's store was and I spent a lot of time in the mall frankly because that's my mom was there my dad was there and my dad was working so I kind of like walked around I got to know them all really well and I've learned I have a unique perspective on the world in terms of like Commerce in terms of like what is the mall even represent as like a meeting point for people to like you know young people and old people and why are they there and like what what are the types of restaurants there why is there a restaurant why is the food court here like why are things you know how are things merchandise you know I think one of the big reasons I became a product designer was because I saw that you know if you put like a product by like I remember like yeah basically like if you put products like near you know the lineup like people will buy them and I was like wow like the ui/ux you know the interface and user experience of the physical world is a real thing and that just led me to digital right yeah for sure so I like that basically there's one one school of thought and I think this is a Paul Graham school of thought is where I sit [ __ ] this idea from but he basically says if you want to invent the future just live in the future and then invent what's missing and it's not sort of this crazy thing it's like back to this there's some quote but it's like if you want to paint the perfect painting become perfect and then just paint my idea is like if you already do something in your lifestyle that is unusual that is sort of forward-thinking in some way maybe you're somebody who doesn't own your house you you rent any rent your car and you rent everything then the sharing economy is quite obvious to you right if you go and do couchsurfing and you think that's normal Airbnb is normal is a normal idea for you even though it's abnormal to others but to you you're like no I live in this future where this is true right I push button and my groceries appear not everybody does that today but I live in that future where that that exists and I'm going to sort of enable that for more people all right and so one way of looking at it is what one of the things that are normal to you it's normal to me to record something and have hundreds of thousands of people I've never met listen to me in their ear balls every morning while they commute to work and they feel like they know me that's a normal thing for me but not for most but like maybe there's something that I could sort of make that make that make my normal normal for others so that's one way think about it and when you said it sort of the the the counter to that or the compliment to that which is you know don't try to get interested in sort of new things to try to create a company look at what you're already interested in the life you've already lived and there's embedded insights and domain expertise and nuance that you understand because you lived that way and then think how do i how do I start something that leverages those insights and that experience that I've already had yeah and and be mindful of the fact like oh hey like why why am I so why do I love this P like why do I love spending time at the mall or like why do I love looking at like how things are merchandise and stuff like that Wow like I I have an eye for that and let your imagination go wild and be like oh you know it would be cool if you could do this you know like what if you could do that and then then that's when you start like oh yeah wouldn't it be cool if you can like create that something and that's when a business is created to fill that void what are some of the most interesting either products or startups you've seen invested in do notice existing things what are some of the most interesting things that have caught your eye lately so I'm sure like pull up my phone there's an app have you I was playing with it today it's all it's me do you know it's me no this is a yes okay I think I have but I forgot what it is yeah so it started it recently started to kind of take off but the way it works is you login with snapchat it pulls your bitmoji and you see your age if you want to meet with like girls or guys or both and it chatroulette style like you press a button it connects you to someone it so it says a bit about like where they're from who they are and you see you're at the Avatar talk so like you're like you're you're talking but you see yourself as an avatar yep and I think when I find you know like what is the key insight there is that like then like being you know if for a lot of people like being in a physical form be it even on like a zoom or face time or you know literally physical is tough for people yeah and having that like wall is nice as like an icebreaker to eventually get you to meet in person etc I like that let me connect that to the last idea so when I first started working in this kind of twitch ecosystem to live Khmer ecosystem I saw this get one guy his name's Manny I think his handles like the one Manny or something like that and Manny it streams on Twitch but he's a dog he's not actually a dog he's a guy but his avatar is a dog and so he's one of the few twitch people who their little webcam areas not themselves it's a it's a dog that he uses this you know obscure app or a cup I think I might've got bought by now but it's called face rig at the time so face rig was this obscure app you have to have a Windows machine go on Steam download face rec pay 20 bucks for face rig then you get the dog and the dog will mimic your head movements and your mouth movements while you're streaming and so for him he was like oh yeah this is way more comfortable for me than putting my own real face out there as the like kind of the show and and so I saw that and then I tried it and I was like wow that really does make me feel way less anxious about kind of like performing if I if I just have this little you know goofy looking dog as me instead of me and so that's another one where it's like okay it took today it took a lot of extra work yet to go find this app download it pay money blah blah blah set it up on a PC book but once you've experienced the magic at the end of that you're like okay magic is here now can I make this way less friction I've lived in the future I take I saw what life is like and now I'm gonna bring that back to the present and make it accessible to more people and it sounds like these guys were guys and gals were building this app might have done that they might have made it way simpler for somebody to have that same experience yeah absolutely and it's simple it's fast and magical and I think what I'd like about it I like about your story actually is that like that dude was like he was unique and he was like yeah I'm gonna do this I don't care what people think like this is what I'm gonna do and he like pushed the envelope and did something weird and it turns out like weird things are actually like head-turners I had like head-turners are actually create word of mouth and word of mouth actually creates audience and creates buzz and creates all these things so like same with snapchat right like that and it's obvious now that like a message would disappear a photo would disappear a video would disappear but at the time like no one that didn't exist it's a new concept so like people like you know listeners like tap into that like uniqueness about yourself and don't be afraid to do it because who knows you might be on the verge of a snapchat or anything like that and people will doubt it there's a reason my snapchat handle is still SVP test because I was like this happened going nowhere right like I don't to worry about making a real handle here I'll just do this test account because I just want to try this silly fad and then you know this will be gone in a month and of course famous last words yeah absolutely let me give you let me give you an idea that's sort of like that okay so my friend Damien he's the founder of a company called doodle have you ever heard this I haven't it's like a British based company due diligent due diligence so basically they surface private company information in a way that's I think the EU has different laws of what you need to disclose so he can provide like you know revenue information employee information so you can get a lot more information about companies there so he built this platform it's like fin tech guys doing fin tech things it's a super group at the super valuable company I think it might be a billion dollar company and anyways he did that and so the other day I see him on Facebook any posts like hey you know you know I you know I've left and I was thinking about my next thing so I come up with this new thing called Battelle and I was like oh [ __ ] what's Patel is this like some neo bank is this well you know what is this new FinTech product he's like it's not FinTech it's a remote sleep school for parents and basically he's like I met this woman and what she does is she teaches parents how to put their baby to sleep and you know so they get a good night's sleep and the parents aren't up all night feeding every two hours and whatnot and she doesn't use what's called the crying out method which is the normal way you do this but it's like really hard on the parents to fight through and let their kid cry it out she's like she doesn't use the cried out method and she's a you know she's like the dog whisperer it's amazing I watched her work her magic on two hundred families and I thought okay I'm gonna help this woman scale her her you know magic too you know as many families as I can and so he created this remote sleep school it's basically cost a thousand bucks but you're gonna teach your kids gonna get a good sleeping program so it's like you know what's that worth to you and like I don't got enough to know this I had a kid eight months ago so now I'm in that position and so I was like oh dude I'll beta test this now because you know I'm going on three hours of sleep right now and damn I would love if I could you know do this and so I think that there's these fringe sort of weird things where it's like what people really pay a thousand dollars for this woman to zoom call you and and teach you how to put your kid to sleep like you know but I think that that's one of these products that is just weird enough solves a real problem and like adds a lot of real value in his chart is charging for something that normally this advice is just like a free mommy blog telling you hey try this and instead it's like no here's a super high end version of that but we're gonna guarantee the result in in a better way than the average blog would do what do you think of that idea I think it's actually really like it I think like I'm a big believer in you know come for the tool stay for the network I like the way I look at it is like come for the tool stay for the vertical network where the vertical here would be parents yes like the fact that he's capturing such a high like you're just in the beginning stage is my friend and like you're you're about to buy a whole lot of products and services for your child and maybe even more children if you have so like the fact that like here's the thing here's one thing I'll tell you if if they help you with this problem you're definitely gonna be wow that was amazing so bottom will be like 1,000 points you know right so that's what it is it's like when you're looking at like building a vertical something in a vertical it's all about like what is the trust quotient you can have with the vertical and I like that this particular task will give you a lot of a lot of you know a lot of cred for this business yeah man I think like that's the other thing is like it could I could see it being like a million dollar a year business but I can also somehow see it being a billion dollar right business and so it's worth a shot yeah you know the math I think works where he has both options where it's like you know thousand people paying a thousand bucks a month or sorry thousand bucks for the program that's a million bucks and can he find a thousand parents to do this I'm very confident just through Facebook ad so I think he could bootstrap two million dollars in revenue very quickly with sort of like 30 40 percent margins on that and and just pocket that so I think very low-tech easy to start bootstrap a bull into the single-digit millions let's call it between one and nine million or what you said which is like cool if he thinks about this bigger like how do I now that I have trust with these parents and I've solved one problem for them the problem they had during their first seven months of their baby how do I help them with their next phase in the next phase in the next phase and you know could go good go bigger from there so I like I like having those options on the table where it starts with sort of those humble beginnings and it might just be a great cash flow business or goes for the sort of home run yeah man tell them to keep going well well I don't think you I don't think it is my my encouragement to keep going that's the best entrepreneurs donate any advice I invested in this resident lamb to school and afterwards I was talking my friend we get it together and I was like here's three reasons you know here's what I want out of this investment I don't know if this will make us money or not but you know I want to learn about like this idea of this trade school thing for education I want to hang out with the founder you know monthly and be helping problems I think will be really interesting and you know lastly I hope we get a return on this he replied he was like all I care about is the return don't give a [ __ ] about the rest but hey to each of their own and on my end I was like and ironically the return is gonna be there but for the first - like Austin doesn't need my help doesn't ask for my help you know if I text him something I'm actually just taking up his time and it reminds me of kind of what an investor told me which is the best companies don't need us that's the reality of the value add services is that the best companies rarely need your help and the worst companies you can't save anyways and so there's some in the middle where you can help influence their trajectory but this idea of investors really helping out or encouraging entrepreneurs or whatever else is sort of overblown marketing I totally agreed I think I actually last week there's a spanner he's just like literally crap he crushes it like for years he's done ten percent year-over-year growth and I started month over month growth and I responded to his investor update keep it up and then he just responds right away he's like as if I wasn't going to keep it up [Laughter] I picture myself smiling and sent it back then that's so good it's great alright we should wrap up kind of weight over time but yeah anything else we do one last spin of the one last bit of the idea well let's do these get one more than we're out of here throw it notes boom okay so this one is a quarantine H idea but it could last beyond quarantine it's an idea that basically I called it chef's table and it's this idea that like I don't know if you saw a car bone then the restaurant in New York City is not doing they're just doing one meal per night and then it sells out so it's kind of like a drop yeah which builds a lot of buzz and demand and it sells out and every night this idea is that like it's it's it's a drop for strong but you have a live stream with the chef telling you about like if it comes with wine or or the meal it's like this is how I did it and it's more of an experience live stream is after you order order so everyone the way would work is you would you would order it everyone which is everyone would get the meal at the same time I don't care if you want and then chef comes and he's like listen like I you know pick these these you know carrots myself and Hudson Valley and here is explaining it and I think like that's what I miss most about sort of restaurants I guess is like the the stories behind right and then this the experience behind it which you don't really get if you're just like frying up some eggs in the morning for sure okay so here's a twist on this idea you're a high-end restaurant your business is gone right now like you're a Michelin star restaurant what do you what are you doing you can't do anything and so here's your your pivot you go live on Instagram before the drop so you live before and you're showing the prep it's the you know you're in the chef's kitchen they're talking about it they're drinking wine there and you're seeing it being prepared and people I think like to see as the show chef's table is shown people like to watch high-end food get made a real skill you know that that sort of thing as long as you have a personality with it and and then basically by the end of the 20 minutes the the meal is ready for the drop the drop goes live and it's you know it uses the new Facebook shop thing that came out yesterday you'll push the button and it orders it basically and it is like a hundred dollar meal and it's you know it's the stuff you don't find on post mates or GrubHub or whatever which are all kind of like the bottom of the barrel so you come in at the very top end of those and it's like the delivery experience is gonna be you know the packaging is gonna be amazing and whatnot but you're gonna get what you just saw on the IG live and so you do these like 100 or $150 drops you know I'm for high-end stuff through the through the delivery network but you go live before to build up that that anticipation of QVC but for high-end cooking I like it I think we kind of merge the ideas that's right it's nice to have co-founders okay great I'll incorporate it and we'll get this off the ground so we all right great where should people find you if they like your your style they want to hear more of you if you want to hear more of me check me out on Twitter my name's at Greg Eisenberg GRE G is e and B ERG check then just holler cool we'll put it in the show notes - all right all right well I got a run but there's been yeah good catching up yeah you too take care I'm at sea [Music]

and so if somebody's listening and they're like okay cool you made millions how did you go to zero so what what what was happening what how are you making money and how are you taking it to zero were you just making wild bets or Wow yeah yeah but where you're like hit I imagine you've had like three hits yeah I would say it's more like five or six hits again for better or for worse I needed all five or six but the first one again I was working at HBO and I made their website and at at the time other entertainment companies and other companies they didn't even know what this internet web thing was this was in 1995 and companies like American Express American and his world have an American Express would call Arthur Anderson which was their accounting firm and you know Arthur Andersen famously went out of business in a scandal six years later but American Express called him Arthur Andersen said can you make us a website Arthur Anderson said sure well they're gonna charge you millions of dollars Arthur Andersen would then call another software consulting company and they would say yeah will charge you a million dollars the software company would call me because nobody knew how to make a website in 1994-1995 so I would say sure I'll do it and then suddenly they pay me and my brother-in-law $250,000 to make American Express calm so that was one of our first websites and I were at HBO at the time was 40,000 a year so my brother-in-law and I we made HBO com then we made websites for everything from Warner Brothers Sony Disney BMG all the record labels like we did every gangster rap record label bad boy loud records jive death row Interscope we did the movies for the matrix and many other movies but anyway that was and were these built up sites at that time like if you looked at that website today what would it look like is it like a Craigslist well you know what that's a great question so no it doesn't look like Craigslist I wish it did but design Web Design back in those days so I was a software guy my brother-in-law was a design guy web design back in those days was very heavy so there would be like big heavy images and animations using flash or yeah you know some Mac I forget the company macro something and they were there are very heavy designs not that usable and but yeah I mean they were okay there they were admired back then so the website for the matrix was a great website which you know on archive.org you could find or HBO's web site was a great website but it wasn't as functional as all websites are now wasn't very easy to navigate and you walk away with at the end of that about 15 million and then oh yeah so cash not not like so a lot of people then you know when public or sold and they got paper and then they died in the dot-com bust because the paper went to zero the stocks went to zero so I had enough sense I liked the peak in 1999 I cashed out and I had the cash in my checking account like I didn't even what do you mean cash out were you getting like stock in these company yeah so so no I sold the company to a company that was rolling up web agencies and so we in a sense that was how we went public like some company that made I don't know vacuum cleaners or whatever decided to get into the internet business in 1998 and acquired us and so suddenly they were an Internet company and the stock went from three to forty eight and I cashed out with literally at the peak with about a little over 15 million almost 16 million cash and and here I was I was smart every step of the way like I knew that the web design development business industry was going away because they were teaching web you know how to make a website in junior high school classes so I knew that was going away I was smart I sold the business I cashed out as fast as I could and then I became everybody you suddenly when you when you make money at one thing suddenly you think you're a genius and everything or at least this happened to me and everybody would come to me and say hey how can what what should we invest in or you know this internet thing you you you have like curly hair and glasses you must know how this all this internet stuff you're you look like a technology guy what should we invest in so I started thinking oh I must be really smart at this and literally I poured all this cash back into uh internet investments after I cashed out of the Internet and it really went and then I also I bought like a huge apartment in New York City and the one thing I was doing that everybody thought I lost all my money on but it wasn't I was I was gambling every single day like I was playing poker for 365 straight days I played poker at least eight to ten hours a day I was really ask you if you're a degenerate gambler because you kind of have that I mean you sound like that before you told me you're a gambler but but but that's just it poker was the one thing I probably should have stuck with like I was doing well at poker and it was right before poker boom took off when I decided you know what I'm just gonna focus on starting new companies and internet investing and I stopped playing poker like in you know right at the end of 1999 I started a venture capital firm and I just started investing money and which was your firm all your money so your firm no no we raised we raised two hundred million dollars like we that was the other thing too I didn't have any experience doing any of this stuff I didn't know anything um I'm trying to remember all investors uh see s first Boston Deutsche Bank like all these major banks gave us money and then another company invest Corp which is a major private equity firm gave us a hundred million and and then I started investing my own personal money side-by-side with the fund and in other investments and I started buying stocks all the way down so hello zero from 15 is zero how long was that I was losing about a million dollars a week in the summer of 2000 and and I just didn't know what I was doing and it wasn't even that I didn't know how to invest I didn't know there's so many other skills to investing than knowing what companies are good and what companies are bad like I didn't understand risk I didn't understand money management I didn't understand you know how to I really didn't understand anything that about investing like I was an idiot and I went to zero by right around mid 2001 I put up my I was desperately putting up my apartment for sale cuz maybe I would have some money left I stopped paying my mortgage and maybe I would have some money left after putting this apartment up for sale I lived two blocks three blocks from a little building called the World Trade Center and we were getting an offer on September 11 and of course many worse things happened that day than me not getting an offer for my house but 9/11 happened and we couldn't sell then because we were part of the crime scene and you know just I went totally were you only broke were you home I was at the World Trade Center oh my god which I don't really I don't really talk about because a it sounds unbelievable but be it all so many worse things happen to people too many more people than me that day obviously but my business partner and I were there was a Dean & Deluca and on the first floor of the World Trade Center we ate breakfast there every day and then we would day trade the markets and at that point I was starting to come back a little bit from day trading and I had written some software and and so on and then we're walking to my home where I had my office and we my partner turns to me and says it's the president coming into town today cuz this I look up and there's this plane that's just like right overhead and then BOOM we watched it go right into that like physically we watched it not on TV but like physically we saw it go right into the building and everybody on the street instinctively ducked and and your brain does weird things so my I started thinking to myself like my business partners name's Dan he said we're we're being attacked and I'm like no no no that was that was just an accident like and no one's no one's it's too early no one's in the building like my brain was telling me this even though it was a quarter to 9:00 a.m. and you know how do you remote control us of whatever was a 747 into the World Trade Center but that's what my brain was telling me so we run to the fire station and we say we want to help and these guys throw two firemen suits at us and say get this on we're gonna go straight over there and we start putting it on but then they say wait a second are you guys firemen and we're like no we just wanted to give blood or whatever we could and they're like no no only firemen and that fire station it was the Duane Street fire station a hundred percent of those people died who went to the World Trade Center that morning and and then from you know there's a bad day but that kind of clinched me losing everything also because I had been invested in the stock market that morning and boom everything kind of went to went to zero after that and then I was just desperate for like a year and a half couldn't sell the place couldn't there were no jobs I was an idiot nobody would I had no friends anymore and you know I had to I had to teach myself how to invest so I wrote some software where I took every piece of data about every single stock since World War two and looked for patterns you know when would I would have my software fine statistically significant patterns where trades were good so I would try to model let's say fear and greed in the markets and and and it worked pretty well doesn't it wouldn't I don't think that strategy would work now but it worked then because there weren't there wasn't that many quantitative investors in the markets then this was kind of the beginnings of that and so I was very successful with it and that kind of kept me alive and that's how I bit by bit I started learning about investing this gave me time to actually learn the skill and and talk to people who were experts and professionals and and really learned then I started writing about investing and I started going on CNBC and I started a hedge fund and I start I wrote my first book about investing and so gradually I built these two careers one in the hedge fund business and the other in writing about investing and going on CNBC and then I built so I was doing deals also then and making money and then I built a website that combined my interest in web development with investing me like a social I called it the myspace of Finance cuz myspace was big then and I sold that site and that was like my next big hit sold that for ten million and you know and then a year later I was broke again and that's things like that just kept happening [Music]

what's your favorite wave ways for monetizing content uh for me right now I don't think I've ever really monetized content the way I would like to like subscription okay so but let me ask you a question subscription is the best way to monetize most content but again you have to plan for that in advance so you have to say I'm gonna make a subscription and called the subscription product called the hustle with with new ideas and trends every week you've made by migrate analysts and people are willing to pay a dollar a month or whatever ten dollars or whatever it is and subscription is a great way to monetize because you're not always chasing advertisers it's this annuity that comes in and helps you even survive in a recessionary environment or like right now so I love I think subscription you say whether it's an online newsletter or an online course or a subscription community like you know let's say the trends Facebook community I think subscriptions my favorite way to monetize but it doesn't solve the problem of monetizing when you're not already in the top one third of content like like you guys are in by in the top 1/10 of 1% of content you're going to monetize and do very well no matter what model you choose whereas the someone who rakes a newsletter about I don't know you know some obscure kind of Taekwondo or whatever they're not going to be able to monetize a newsletter necessarily where someone who's going to monetize how to mow the lawn better is not gonna be able to monetize but might have one piece of content that really stands out [Music]

so the background here by the way Shawn is I was on James's show three weeks ago and actually air today yes I've been getting people reached out reaching out to me James James is an oddball I like him he's been around and done all types of interesting stuff he's had books he's got paid newsletters he's I don't know what how you describe yourself but you're just kind of all over the place and you've done all types of stuff and you have a really interesting life and we thought we'd get up we thought we'd get him on here and we could talk about anything but uh do you know about James Sean I know about you yeah I know about him I've read about your stuff I was like this guy's the [ __ ] and then I read I read something that was like I think you were talking about bit coin and crypto at the time and I was like wait a minute is this just a guy who just just sells the latest thing like oh here's the new thing cool I'll seal that and I was like okay I don't how I feel about this and then I've read some of your stories where you talk about how you made money and lost it all over and over and over again and I was like this guy is very interesting you reminded me of like if Tim Ferriss you know smoked a bunch of weed and was on the Internet I don't know like is this like some some variation of really interesting guy who potent you know who's built his brand on the internet you know you always had like something unexpected like it wasn't the formulaic thing like even the fact that you own a comedy club is like you always have sort of unexpected things that's what I have sort of come to like about you but you know that's my admittedly very loose knowledge about about you do you want to give some background yeah I mean it's kind of like what you were both sort of referring to have I've had for better or for worse a lot of different interests which I turned into a lot of different careers and I say for better or for worse because a lot of times I would have an interest I'd built a business I'd sell it I'd make money and then for some reason I would just I don't know I would totally [ __ ] the bed and lose everything and I'm not talking about like oh I sold something for a billion and I ended up with ten million this is horrible no I would sell something for millions and then end up with 0 or less than zero in my bank account really just zero actually I wish sometimes it's better to be less than zero than to be zero because if you like are less than zero then that means there's a deal you could work out with somebody like oh I owe you 10 million let's work it out and you maybe give me some so I could build then I don't know what it is but like I think it was a young man in the 90s named Donald Trump who said if you owe if you owe two million to the bank the bank owns you but if you owe two billion to the bank you owe in the bank and but but anyway I would often end up at $0 and be depressed to the point of like suicidal like I had kids to feed I had myself to feed and it's really true when you go from having money and selling a business to broke you find out who your real friends are and for me almost every time it turned out I had zero friends and so I had nowhere to go and and no idea and depressed and I didn't know how in some cases put food on the table for my kids after having millions and so I had to learn very quickly over and over again what are my interests what can I pursue what's an idea how to be creative and maybe a horrible environment and then figure out how to monetize it so I was a software guy I worked in the entertainment industry I work for HBO I started I combined those two things and I started a company in the 90s making websites for entertainment companies and then I became a venture capitalist then I started a hedge fund I wrote some software to help me invest in that and then I started writing books about that so I became a writer then I became a podcaster and then like you were saying I started writing about much more personal stuff and I think everybody who knew me couldn't believe it like it was almost like they had never seen anything like this before like why they people call me up like James are you do you have cancer or are you about to kill yourself are you about to die like why are you confessing to all these things these are horrible no one's ever gonna do a deal with you again or this is too embarrassing and I you know and then I think since then people have I don't want to say people copied it people have their own versions of writing about failure and and so on but and then those because I writing books based on those articles and it turned out I had not only was like building up even more as a writer and my audience was bigger than ever previously I'd written about finance now I was writing about all this personal stuff my audience became a hundred times bigger and then I started getting more investment opportunities I started gay cast which became successful I started getting many more opportunities because of I because because essentially I paid with my vulnerability for freedom and that created a whole kind of career for me and it wasn't intentional I just was sick of writing about all the BS stuff I kept seeing everyone else write about and if you want to if you want to be unique you kind of have to say what's unique to you and what was it unique to me was all the times I was scared to death and and depressed and and had to fight my way out of it so many things to answer the question I have back background a lot of things and also I always like trying new things and experimenting and I was everything I'm passionately interested in I like I like figuring out how to make money from it and and getting good at it and so if somebody's listening and they're like ok cool you made millions how did you go to zero so what what was happening what how are you making money and how are you taking it to zero were you just making wild bets or well yeah yeah but where you're like hit I imagine you've had like three hits yeah I would say it's more like five or six hits again provider or for worse I needed all five or six but the first one again I was working at HBO and I made their website and at at the time other entertainment companies and other companies they didn't even know what this Internet web thing was this was in 1995 and companies like American Express American at his world have an American Express would call Arthur Andersen which was their accounting firm and you know Arthur Andersen famously went on a business in a scandal six years later but American Express called him Arthur Andersen said can you make us a website Arthur Andersen said sure well they're going to charge millions of dollars Arthur Anderson would then call another software consulting company and they would say yeah will charge you a million dollars the software company would call me because nobody knew how to make a website in 1994-1995 so I would say sure I'll do it and then suddenly they pay me and my brother-in-law 250,000 dollars to make American Express calm so that was one of our first websites and I would my salary at HBO at the time was 40,000 a year so my brother-in-law and I we made HBO calm then we made websites for everything from Warner Brothers Sony Disney BMG all the record labels like we did every gangster rap record label bad boy loud records jive death row Interscope we did the movies for the matrix and many other movies but anyway that was and were these build up sites at that time like if you looked at that website today what would it look like is it like a Craigslist well you know what that's a great question so no it doesn't look like Craigslist I wish it did but design Web Design back in those days so I was a software guy my brother-in-law was a design guy web design back in those days was very heavy so there would be like big heavy images and animations using flash or the you know some Mac I forget the company macro something and they were there are very heavy designs not that usable and but yeah I mean they were okay they were admired back then so the website for the matrix was a great website which you know on archive.org you could find or HBO's web site was a great website but it wasn't as functional as all websites are now wasn't very easy to navigate and you walk away with at the end of that about 15 million and then oh [ __ ] yeah so cash not not like so a lot of people then you know when public or sold and they got paper and then they died in the dot-com bust because the paper went to zero the stocks went to zero so I had enough sense and like the peak in 1999 I cashed out and I had the cash in my checking account like I didn't even want to mean cash out were you getting like stock in these come I mean yeah so so no I sold the company to a company that was rolling up web web agencies and so we in a sense that was how we went public like some company that made I don't know vacuum cleaners or whatever decided to get into the internet business in 1998 and acquired us and so suddenly they were an Internet company and the stock went from three to forty eight and I cashed out with literally at the peak with about a little over 15 million almost 16 million cash and and here I was I was smart every step of the way like I knew that the web design development business industry was going away because they were teaching web you know how to make a website in junior high school classes so I knew that was going away I was smart I sold the business I cashed out as fast as I could and then I became everybody you suddenly when you when you make money at one thing suddenly you think you're a genius and everything or at least this happened to me and everybody would come to me and say hey how can what what should we invest in or you know this internet thing you you you have like curly hair and glasses you must know have all this internet stuff you're you look like a technology guy what should we invest in so I started thinking oh I must be really smart at this and literally I poured all this cash back into internet investments after I cashed out of the internet and it really went and then I also I bought like a huge apartment in New York City and the one thing I was doing that everybody thought I lost all my money on but it wasn't I was I was gambling every single day like I was playing poker for 365 straight days I played poker at least 8 to 10 hours a day I was going to ask you if you're a degenerate gambler because you kind of have that I mean you sound like that before you even told me you're a gambler but but but that's just it poker was the one thing I probably should have stuck with like I was doing well at poker and it was right before the poker boom took off when I decided you know what I'm just gonna focus on starting new companies and internet investing and I stopped playing poker like in you know right at the end of 1999 I started a venture capital firm and I just started investing money which was your firm all you money so your firm no no we raised we raised 200 million dollars like only [ __ ] that was the other thing too I didn't have any experience doing any of this stuff I didn't know anything um I'm trying to remember all investors uh CS first boston deutsche bank like all these major banks gave us money and then another company invest corp which is a major private equity firm gave us a hundred million and and then i started investing my own personal money side-by-side with the fund and in other investments and i started buying stocks all the way down so how long was chosen 0 from 15 to 0 how long was that I was losing about a million dollars a week in the summer of 2000 and and I just didn't know what I was doing and it wasn't even that I didn't know how to invest I didn't know there's so many other skills to investing than knowing what companies are good and what companies are bad like I didn't understand risk I didn't understand money management I didn't understand you know how to I really didn't understand anything that about investing like I was an idiot and I went to zero by right around mid 2001 I put up my I was desperately putting up my apartment for sale cuz maybe I would have some money left I stopped paying my mortgage and maybe I would have some money left after putting this apartment up for sale I lived two blocks three blocks from a little building called the World Trade Center and we were getting an offer on September 11 and of course many worse things happened that day than me not getting an offer for my house but 9/11 happened and we couldn't sell then because we were part of the crime scene and you know just I went totally really broken were you home I was at the World Trade Center oh my god which I don't really I don't really talk about because a it sounds unbelievable but be it also many worse things happen to people to many more people than me that day obviously but my business partner and I were there was a Dean & Deluca and on the first floor of the World Trade Center we ate breakfast there every day and then we would day trade the markets and at that point I was starting to come back a little bit from day trading and I had written some software and and so on and then we're walking to my home where I had my office and we my partner turns to me and says is the president coming into town today because this I look up and there's this plane that's just like right overhead and then boom we watched it go right into that like physically we watched it not on TV but like physically we saw it go right into the building and everybody on the street instinctively ducked and and your brain does weird things so my I started thinking to myself like my business partners name's Dan he said we're we're being attacked and I'm like no no no that was that was just an accident like and no one's no one's it's too early no one's in the building like my brain was telling me this even though it was a quarter to nine a.m. and you know how do you remote control us whatever was a 747 into the World Trade Center but that's what my brain was telling me so we run to the fire station and we said we want to help and these guys throw two firemen suits at us and say get this on we're gonna go straight over there and we start putting it on but then they say wait a second are you guys firemen and we're like no we just wanted to give blood or whatever we could do and they're like no no only firemen and that fire station it was the Duane Street bio station a hundred percent of those people died who went to the World Trade Center that morning and and then from you know there's a bad day but that kind of clinched me losing everything also because I had been invested in the stock market that morning and boom everything kind of went to went to zero after that and then I was just desperate for like a year and a half couldn't sell the place couldn't there were no jobs I was an idiot nobody would I had no friends anymore and you know I had to I had to teach myself how to invest so I wrote some software where I took every piece of data about every single stock since World War two and looked for patterns you know when would I would have my software find statistically significant patterns where trades were good so I would try to model let's say fear and greed in the markets and and and it worked pretty well doesn't it wouldn't I don't think that strategy would work now but it worked then because there weren't there wasn't that many quantitative investors in the markets then this was kind of the beginnings of that and so I was very successful with it and that kind of kept me alive and that's how I bit by bit I started learning about investing this gave me time to actually learn the skill and and talk to people who were experts and professionals and and really learned then I started writing about investing and I started going on CNBC and I started a hedge fund and I started I wrote my first book about investing and so gradually I built these two careers one in the hedge fund business and the other in writing about investing and going on CNBC and then I built so I was doing deals also then and making money and then I built a website that combined my interest in web development with investing made like a social I called it the myspace of Finance cuz myspace was big then and I sold that site and that was like my next big hit sold that for ten million and you know and then a year later I was broke again and that's but things like that just kept happening alright this episode is brought to you by super side alright so here's the deal I'm incredibly impatient like horribly horribly impatient and if I get an idea at midnight by 8 a.m. the next day I want it done you know but that's really hard because if something needs to be designed where am I gonna find designer at midnight to try to make this thing keep bring it to life so you know I don't am alone other startups even huge companies neat design help fast and they just don't have the internal resources or expertise to get it done so how do you get reliable design done without dealing with expensive agencies and lots of freelancers you use super site that's our sponsor for this week just go to super site calm slash MFM and tell them what you want they have a team of designers that can get it done fast you know they are 20 times faster than hiring a designer and 50% more affordable than a traditional agency so if you need high quality design done fast try super side lots of fast gory teams that are are using them already check them out supers Icom /m fm I'm using before I love them check it out there's a lot going on here but it's used told to companies so far well you've also sold your newsletter business too right yeah so that was a third company and I've also sold companies that I was on either there's many companies I've been an investor up that have been sold by this point and then some companies that I'm like a co-founder of that I've that I've sold I was like involved I've been involved with everything from like I'm a mental rehab facility that's sold for 41 million and then that was in 2004 I did go broke after that and then was stock picker of the stock site and then I was in an early investor in buddy media yeah which Peter Thiel invested in my class where I was the CEO Mark Pincus who started Zynga was an investor in it and we all were the seed investors at a four million dollar valuation that sold the Salesforce for about seven or eight hundred million I had a company today that I was a investor and it just it just kind of did or they just announced a reverse merger they're going public so hopefully that will do well but I've been I've been investor in a lot of companies that have done well cause like because I finally figured out the most important thing about investing that I missed before and that since then my private investing has done very well and I don't really do public investing oh what's that thing that one thing is that I am the worst idiot in the world if if you're in a room with me I'm the stupidest person in that room and what I mean by that is take buddy media as an example I didn't have to do any work once I invested because Peter Thiel was my co investor so it's not like they're gonna call me for advice they're gonna call the people smarter than me and also presumably the first investor in facebook wouldn't know what he was doing when investing in a facebook marketing agency which is what buddy media was so so I always if someone a lot smarter than me says hey I'm investing in this company I don't even have to do any more work I just send the check because I assume and I'm always correct when I assume this he's done or she's done all the due diligence all the hard work he's got PhDs working for him that are a lot smarter than me if worse comes to worse he or she can make phone calls and get this company acquired which is what happens and I've done very well with just that one strategy that if someone a lot smarter than me is investing at the same terms as me that's important too then I'm going to do well and it's almost like a hundred it's not like a normal success rate it's like a hundred percent success rate when you do that and and the other rule is if they ever call me for advice then on my spreadsheet where I keep track of these I assume their value is zero and I never call them back because if they've reached so far down the totem pole where they have to call me for advice that means they're screwed so and this secret works like it's amazing how well that one technique works and so that allows me to invest in at companies ranging from oil companies to tech to law enforcement to the company today is an erectile dysfunction drug I don't that I don't know anything about biotech like the yeah but as long as someone you know if if someone calls me and says look hey I've started the last three erectile-dysfunction drug companies and they've all done well now I'm investing in this are you with me here's my check I don't need to know anything else I think I think Sean's gonna want to ask you questions on angel investing and I want to ask them and I want to hear his answer or your answers to those questions but before we get to that what about selling I mean so you've sold more than a handful of businesses selling companies is hard most people will never sell one how are you how are you able to sell so many you think but you know that that's a that's a great question because and let me ask you saying I don't know if we've talked about this have you ever sold a company I had a small like hundreds of thousands of dollars sale for this company the hustle we had term sheets and I walked away at the last minute I've had two or three term sheets and I've walked away from them and I've never closed the deal yes so and I bought I've also helped by companies - yeah so it's a similar it's similar skills on both sides of but maybe slightly different but people don't realize selling a company is very difficult like it's there's three skills there's starting a company there's building it and they're selling it and Sean his company - to twitch yeah okay congratulations for you yeah and you so you know what I'm talking about like you'll you'll your company's up for sale and everybody's and you meet a bunch of people I don't know if you met a bunch of people but like I would meet a bunch of people each time and you kind of there's this courtship and you kind of fall in love with each other I just like in a courtship and then there's and then there's suddenly you move into a different period where lawyers take over and you're waiting it's a waiting period and it's a due diligence period and it's a very painful period because before you were in this like massive selling and dating mood but now you're like living together and you're getting to know each other and you know you don't want her to figure this out too fast and you know before she really falls in love and you know and all that dopamine you get when you first meet has gone away and it's by the way that's when I started this podcast was during the due diligence period because I got so itchy because I was waiting and I was like oh my god I'm gonna jeopardize this deal either because I'm gonna push too hard and just because I'm impatient or I'm gonna go start another business which is the worst thing I can do while trying to sell this one sounds like I need to have something and so that's why I started the podcast was during that due diligence period yeah that's smart because I would just do nothing but wait and it's it's it's a painful process and the way you sell is first off you have to and this is not you have to be sincere the whole way through you have to have a vision that matches their vision very strongly and it has to explain why you would well if this your business is so great why do you want to sell it like there's that inherent contradiction in selling a business and I was always aware that I would you know in every business I've sold that I would be better off with a better capitalized partner and now maybe I would limit my upside but you know the first time you saw a company for millions and then the second time if you're broke the second time you still owe me four millions and then the third time it's okay to not sell for billions because you want to get that initial chunk but you also have to say look together here's how it's one plus one equals three and you have to be really persuasive on on why one plus one equals three even for you personally like you have to be able to express that this vision is gonna benefit you personally if you partner with this other company and and and and it has to really make sense and then and then of course you have to survive this waiting period you have to survive the initial period where they're still checking you out but now you're together and you have to integrate and get along and you have to keep all your employees because usually there's some back-end earn out or something like that like that every you have to understand deal structure so you're not ripped off it's very easy to be ripped off by lawyers in a deal and people don't realize that and you have to be you have to have some skills at negotiation which negotiating is one of those things that 9 out of 10 people think that they're above average which is impossible like you have to be four out of ten only could be above the median and only one out of ten is really good enough to to sell a company improperly and so I had to learn the hard way how to negotiate and like when they come to you and they say well how much do you want for your company that's a very hard question to answer because you don't want to sound greedy and you don't want to sound desperate and you don't want to sound and you don't want to underprice yourself so there's all sorts of negotiating techniques that you have to use to help them answer that question in a way that works for both sides not just do you value your companies on a multiple of your profit or revenue or was it if we you use our stuff with your audience or your current products it will create this much value so that also is a really great question because this there's three ways to value a company right the one is a standard industry multiple on your earnings and cut it in half by the way because no one's gonna pay the maximum you cut it in half so they everybody wants to get a deal so like if if you have a profitable company and it's an industry that trades on the stock market for 20 times earnings then your company is probably your last year's profits times 10 the 20/2 that's just a basic formula or you could do what you just said which is hey and I learned this for my second company I didn't limit for my for my first company was profitable unlike every other internet company and so we sold for about 10 times earnings which was was a mistake on the second company was like I've did value like how you said which is if if you if we put ads all over here and you're driving this amount of traffic and we monetize those ads and then you cut that in half this is what we're worth and the second company I sold on the basis of that the challenge there is with the other company you work out this formula for how you're gonna value your company based on their them helping you build your earnings and the challenges then you fill in all the variables they know the variables better than you so you have to make sure when you're negotiating the formula that and you agree on the formula that you understand the variables enough so that it works out to what you want I didn't do that part properly on my second negotiation and then the third way to value things is you look at other companies acquired in the space they sold for this we're bigger so we should be this now that's kind of a BS way to value a company but that is how people value companies often particularly in the in the tech sector like giffy I don't know what the how they value themselves but certainly wasn't off of earnings I don't think they had 20 million dollars in earnings my guess is they were losing money so so they probably valued off of something some kind of comparable to deal in in the internet yeah cuz and then tenor solo tenor which was good if he's competitor just sold to Google a year before for a little less than that who was their competitor a company called tenor T enor they were and it just says society is it true that gippy was the second largest search engine in the world that's what they're saying yeah they don't they know they love this I thought YouTube was yep so YouTube is number two and three Amazon for right like so yeah depends what you call a search engine well I did in New York and it is huge it was just there was nobody make money off of it really yeah I had that issue I was I was a seed investor and on the board of bitly so bitly had about 5% of the internet's traffic every day running through it and for the life of us we just could not figure out how to monetize it like it was impossible and they did exit the private equity firm I bought it but it was like two or three acts which is not really what you're looking for an angel investment and so James when you lose your you lose all your money the first time you call back you make money again doing something else you lose it again I mean obvious question at some point were you like okay rainy day fund two million bucks is going into this account and hey I lost the I lost the keys just so you know just to stash some money away what surely your life was like come on man how did you get away with not just saving something I got divorced and I lost the second house that I bought and no I kind of finally I think it was the third time or the fourth time I finally looked back and I said what was I always doing right on the way up and what was I doing wrong on the way down and there were things in common which is just that I kind of I kind of would just give up after I made a lot of money I would kind of say whew I did my job as a human now I can just let my health go away my relationships I don't care about anymore I don't need to be creative anymore you know I don't need to have any kind of sense of spirituality and I was just whatever and I just would lose all sense of things and and not take care of myself and not just physically but like emotionally and creatively and so I just made it a very concentrated effort it sounds sort of cliche and almost self-help helped me a little bit but I really would make a concerted effort to keep myself physically healthy to have only good people in my life and quickly eliminate any toxic people I guess like the speed of light no second chances and creatively I just started writing down every single day ten ideas a day like and it could be business ideas it could be writing ideas it could be dumb ideas it could be ideas for TV shows it could be ideas for how Google could be a better search engine and then I would arrogantly send them to Google but the whole idea was not to have good ideas but to just practice this creativity muscle or else it would atrophy and literally like I'm not I'm not trying to sell anything here like literally within months of writing ten ideas a day down it felt as if my whole brain was rewired and I would just I would bounce back so quickly with ideas is just non-stop and then the aspect of sometimes I would write ideas for other companies and I would send them these ideas if I thought they were pretty good and you know I would always get new opportunities because of that like I would visit Facebook Amazon LinkedIn Google Cora Airbnb and just just this one process of writing ten ideas a day down for the past twelve years has been such an incredible thing for me I can't even praise it enough so the other day just for fun a friend of mine recently took a job at Disney plus and he was just like because of this lockdown we're not getting any good ideas pitched to us so I'm like well what are you looking for and he said we're looking specifically for unscripted ideas that would cater to nine year olds so I wrote my list of 10 ideas the next day and I sent it to him he forwarded it to that I don't know how like he forwarded to the head of reality programming at Disney and right after this I'm meeting they got excited and right after this I'm meeting uh with Disney to go over the ideas what was there um as someone who's gone up and down and up and down can you explain what your happiness levels went like what the range was from like let's say zero dollars to ten thousand dollars to a hundred to like 1 million to 15 million like what was the difference in hat your happiness and fulfillment things like that oh my god so and really we're just talking about the first time because then there's different where it's different each time but um I had zero dollars in the bank and I was living in a studio in Astoria Queens which is you know was not in the night early nineties was not a nice part of Queens before that I had a roommate and in a apartment smaller than the room you're seeing me in and I was paying $300 a month he's working at HBO for 40,000 a year I was I had a suit in a garbage bag that I would pull out every day and put on the same suit seven days in a row and walk over to HBO and then we did the very first site I did was this diamond dealer and he gave me seventeen thousand five hundred dollars in cash this is 1994 and I had I had never had seen any money like this before seventeen thousand five like he almost was like I couldn't believe this was actually happening and I walked over to the Chelsea Hotel on 23rd Street was like this sort of famous artsy hotel but also really rundown and I gave the owner like the whole bag was a paper bag of seventeen thousand five hundred dollars and said could I live here for a year and he said are you a drug dealer and I said no I work at HBO and he let me live there and I was just so happy like oh I'm living in Manhattan now and in this cool hotel and I felt like part of something I felt like part of a scene I felt magical and that was an amazing moment and then when I sold that first business I felt good but it was weird because it was so much pain closing that deal like I was so stressed out in the months prior to that and I got burnt out and that's when I started playing poker every single night just to kind of escape burnout so I don't know if I was happy or just more escapist then and then when I started losing and every time I lost every single time I've lost everything I was suicidal and in part for practical reasons I thought maybe my my kids could live off my life insurance and particular that first time there were babies so I figured they wouldn't remember me but they'll definitely remember the life insurance so fortunately I I couldn't figure out how to do it in such a way as to not hurt myself and I never did it and you know I was very depressed though for long periods of time but each time the period of depression would get faster and faster and you know I think one of the most probably important things I've been learning you know I used to think learning is like you know in school it's like learn math and then as you get a little bit older you're like oh maybe I should learn some skills like sales or programming or whatever and now I'm like oh [ __ ] all that the only skill that matters is sort of managing my own psychology my own emotions and so I started to you know figure out what works for me right like cool if I exercise here's how I feel if I you know eat this if I make this decision if I listen to this song whatever I started to find different little ways to manage my own psychology do you have a sort of any things that you've worked on or you figured out that help you either you know boost up gratitude or like you know get out of that Yap depression funk what works for you or do you are you conscious about that yeah very much so and that was part of this realization that every single day and I even it's I call it my specific daily practice and it's it could be different for each person but I always have to ask what am i doing to eat move sleep so that's physical health I always try to stay healthy like I don't I'm not an athlete I'm not a you know not used to working out or I mean I'm 52 years old I've got a stay as healthy as possible and so eat everyday I have to make sure I'm eating well sleeping eight hours and and moving and now with this pandemic lockdown is I have to go outside and make sure I have some outside time and then emotional health just what how much are the people around me toxic or not and that is the key to emotional health nothing else and then creative health am i writing ten ideas a day down because creativity not only is it rewiring your brain to be more creative you know or that muscle atrophies but it also triggers a lot of dopamine when you're creative and it just if I do it in the morning to work on my ten ideas a day list I've got this surge of dopamine that carries me at least till like 1:00 or 2:00 in the afternoon and then spiritual health is just am I trying to control things I can't control so that's a very important part of spiritual health so you see people on Twitter all day long oh man they should we need to open up this economy right now or we need to lock down all the people who open up like on both sides they're trying to control things they can't control and they're all day long they're 24 hours a day on Twitter and even during this pandemic I felt like I was getting a little into that and then I pulled myself back and realized it wasn't I can't control this so it wasn't healthy for me and so always avoiding trying to control things you can't control is very important and that really just those four things physical emotional creative spiritual just those four things if I attend to them every day I keep at a very high state and even when I'm even when I lose money now or go up and money i keeps me very you know contentment and well-being are much more important than happiness happiness is very as the cliche goes is very fleeting but well-being you build a real foundation of well-being and that and that sticks with you so what's your business now James that you're like which like your job now uh well I do I do lots of things so I mean I I write every day and I just finished a book that will be published by HarperCollins in a year I do a podcast I am still involved in my newsletter business which I sold I'm I'm a private investor in about two dozen private companies so I'm but I'm remember I'm not active in those because they don't I don't want them to want my advice so it's very very passive but I have to make sure I'm enough in the deal flow that each year I can still put a little bit of money to work because you never know which year you'll find the next uber or whatever and and a lot of my time the past five years until this lockdown has been on stand-up comedy which makes you know which makes minimal at best so then you did did your nut for your angel money that came from like your initial sale really really now most the way I make a living and the way I built up is just from private investing because pretty much every company I've sold I ended up losing all or most of the money but private investing is now the way I've been able to make a living most of all so on the angel front so what percent of your money do you have your net worth do you put into angel deals which is a risky illiquid thing I'm very much now and this is this was the key point that made a big difference for me investing is that risk is the most important part of investing whether you're investing money or you're investing time Ritt risk has to be managed and about first and foremost and the way I remove risk is two ways one is as I mentioned I always invest with people who are smarter than me because I let that outsource some of the risk management to people who are professionals at it and the other way I manage risk is position size so I never invest more than 1 to 2 percent of my net worth is the maximum I will ever invest in any company right now I'll let the I'll let the investment grow to much more than that it's sort of like what Warren Buffett says if you've got Michael Jordan on your team you don't trade I'm just because he got better so I like it when good private companies don't exit because that means they're growing still at like 50 to 200 percent a year and as long as they're doing that I don't want them to exit and what was your biggest angel or private company you win so far which company yeah it's it's it's hard to say because a lot of my investments are doing really well but there's still private like I have deals I invested in in 2009 which are still doubling every year but they they're still private but that buddy media won you know four million to seven hundred million was pretty good ticket fly was another one that invested in which I was in the seed round of that and it sold for 450 million I invested in another one which is public now it's a law enforcement company they have a gun that if they we I was sort of a co-founder of this it started in the living room I was staying at and there was a hashtag black lives matter was the trending hashtag and so we tried to solve that problem basically so we found an inventor who made a gun that fires a Kevlar cable at you at the speed of sound and it wraps around you and the more you try to struggle to get out of it it squeezes tighter and so like like a Batman I was gonna say straight out of Batman yeah and even the one of the founders of taser is the president of the company now he became the president company about a year ago and we went public it's it's a really great company it's still in growth mode but they're starting to to sell quite a bit and that's been I'm not exited actually I'm I own the shares of the public company I'm not planning on exit hopefully ever because it's it's what's up no competition the comings called rap technology so I'm not trying to push the stock or anything so I don't want to even mention that right the stock stock symbol but it's it's it's just such a great thing to invest in and be a part of the founding of something that's literally saves lives every single day so when you can you have the journal with you that you write your 10 ideas can we like what what do you what's interesting to you right now James a lot of times it's in my email oh there's my iPad I do it all in waders Pat's or I do it in my email so if I'm out in a cafe I do it in a waiters pad and if I do it at a sitting at my computer I'll do it in my email well as an angel investor and I don't know if you're ever gonna start another company again maybe you are maybe you aren't but as someone who's always scheming what what do you have your eye on now yeah I've no problem even saying what I'm scheming at because so I haven't considered starting a new company in a very long time but I have been considering it now and one of the ideas is I feel it's a shame that content is not monetized unless you're like but in the top 1/10 of 1% of content creators so you have to be like you know Logan Paul to monetize your YouTube channel and the other twenty billion people on YouTube even if they have one video that goes viral they can't monetize it so or like even if you have a if you have a tweet that 20 million people see but you have only 300 followers you can't monetize it so I've been figuring out a way to use these ecosystems to allow people to monetize content so that's one idea I'm working on actually physically working on it and another one involves making a derivative of a board game that I like but in general I don't I don't come up with business ideas I come up with like like I said the other day I had this challenge like of oh I'm gonna challenge myself to come up with TV show ideas that nine year olds would like and I did that and I sent it off and usually I don't send it off or sometimes the ideas are ideas for books I could write or if I have an idea for a book I could write like the next idea all right of chapter titles and again most of the ideas are supposed to be bad because you can't come up with 3650 good ideas a year and it'd be foolish to think so so I'm just trying to come up with bad ideas what I'm trying to make my brain sweat so for instance one idea list that it's particularly hard is and this is the one I wrote this morning is 10 good positive things that have happened to me personally because of this lockdown those aren't actionable ideas but it was actually hard to come up with 10 like 1 through 7 is always usually pretty easy by 8 9 10 is usually makes my I feel like my brain sweating and but yeah but a lot of times we'll come up with business ideas or I'll start to say to myself what industries are gonna be attractive after this that are unexpected so you can't say the obvious ones like obviously you know video communications technology is going to be a attractive businesses emphasis instead I would think what are the 10 ways I can improve unzoom which was is the most popular one right now so that will be how I exercise the idea muscle around zoom and for your content idea is there a comp out there like is there somewhere something out there that you'd like man this like little behavior that some people are doing I think that if we just blew this up or systemize this this could actually have legs yeah so sort of so I'll do something what I'll call what I call idea sex so I'll take ideas from two completely different industries and again I've been a professional in many different industries again fortunately or unfortunately and I'll combine ideas to see if after I do sex there's a little idea baby that could work in what I'm doing so for instance if I go to a restaurant and have a pretty good meal that meal could get monetized and if the waiter or waitress treats me nice they might get they they have better chances of monetizing their behavior than otherwise so there's lots to learn from how monetization works in the bottom third of the economy in other industries so a waiter is the third of the is in the bottom third of people who work in restaurants or involved in the restaurant industry so how do they monetize themselves and there's a lot there's a lot of industries where you can say hey the bottom third of this sector or this space or this country they don't make any money but but they could maybe and you could look at that as examples of you know how do i how do i lighten up this third by allowing them to collect money this is that's gonna be always a huge industry square is a great example square took the mom-and-pop store that couldn't accept credit cards because no bank would trust them and square enable them to accept credit cards so squares the only company in the world that does that and they became I don't know a twelve billion dollar company because they were able to monetize the bottom third of you know mom-and-pop retail stores and so that's one model for creating a billion dollar company and then I might use idea sex to generate the ideas like oh how does every other industry monetize their bottom third let's apply it to YouTube and see what happens you know and then I'll look at competitors like okay there's patreon but you have to patreon has various hurdles you you have to already know you're gonna be a good content creator and you have to come up with awards and you have to interact and create content specifically for patreon and so-and-so patreon has problems so I try to look at hey I think yeah like if you're a content creator patreon could be a great way to make money but it's it I find a lot of content creators once they have a big audience I'm patreon to be more annoying than helpful but advertising also is annoying so you know finding advertisers yourself and outsourcing all your advertising to YouTube could also be annoying so you know there's various problems in the current ways people monetize I mean you guys monetize a newsletter subscriptions another way but that puts a some friction in front of your subscribers and so you know I've done newsletters I've done you know advertising supported media like podcasts or websites and so I'm familiar with all these types of monetization and I don't know all these things together help me make my idea list what's your favorite wave ways for monetizing content for me right now I don't think I've ever really monetized content the way I would like to like subscription okay so but let me ask you a question subscription is the best way to monetize most content but again you have to plan for that in advance so you have to say I'm gonna make a subscription and called a subscription product called the hustle with with new ideas and trends every week you've made by migrate analysts and people are willing to pay a dollar a month or whatever ten dollars or whatever it is and subscription is a great way to monetize because you're not always chasing advertisers it's this annuity that comes in and helps you even survive in a recessionary environment or like right now so I love I think subscription is a whether it's an online newsletter or an online course or a subscription community like you know let's say the trends Facebook community I think subscriptions my favorite way to monetize but it doesn't solve the problem of monetizing when you're not already in the top one third of content like like you guys are in the top 1/10 of 1% of content you're going to monetize and do very well no matter what model you choose whereas the someone who rakes a newsletter about I don't know you know some obscure kind of Taekwondo or whatever they're not gonna be able to monetize a newsletter necessarily where someone who's gonna monetize how to mow the lawn better is not gonna be able to monetize but might have one piece of content that really stands out and if you were you know I think you're pretty much one of the top 1% or better of people at building new businesses or audiences right I think you've done an amazing job of building up audiences that will follow you through one medium podcasting blogging email whatever you want let's say you're 21 years old again today you know everything you know now but nobody knows your name how would you go about building an audience today yeah today I will first off let's assume I have something to say you have to have something you have to have a unique perspective and again I'll I'll take I'll take the this podcast as an example it's my first million it's the name of this podcast right yep so there are other podcasts about there's there's a podcast the eventual millionaire which talks to millionaires about it but most of these other podcasts unlike you most of them are started by people who haven't yet sold their first business or haven't made that first million so their unique thing is they're approaching people almost as if they're asking for advice how can I do it you did it how can I do it so that's a different your perspective is you've done it so you're able to more in a different type of nuance drill down on that and you have something unique to bring out of people and say to people and so on and and and Sam for you you've spent so much time studying trends and side hustles and the gig economy the hustle is like the best email newsletter out there because it's your you're the voice of it is so unique it's it's the go-to particularly during this lockdown it's it's amazing people ask me hey what are some side gigs we could do from home the first thing I always say is check out the hustle and you'll get a ton of ideas even on our podcasts and it was just like spinning out ideas that I've run with it's completely stolen from you so that's the other thing about having good ideas they could steal them from people but you know I think you have to something you have to have something unique to say so at the age of 22 you have to question well do I really have something unique to say and often when I write something I don't hit publish unless I'm afraid of what people will think about me after I hit publish because otherwise that I'm probably not saying something new or different or you know there has to be I have to challenge myself in some way to create unique content but give it let's assume you have something unique to say or some expertise you built up by the age of 22 I would go on Quora and just answer every question I could I would participate on LinkedIn groups again answering every question I could I would go on groups like the trends group or other Facebook groups and you know a lot of people ask questions I would go on podcasters paradise which is a subscription community about podcasting I would a lot of people say hey what you know how do you get good guests or how do you what kind of microphone should I use I would answer every question I could and establish expertise and then I would again I'm thinking if I'm 22 I'm not thinking this way now and then once I had some expertise I would sprint out so now have you just you just saw me everywhere you looked you saw me Quora LinkedIn Facebook there's James again answering questions now I'll start going on sites where there's a little bit higher barrier to create content so like a Forbes calm or Inc calm or TechCrunch or whatever and and this is what I did do and I started would start writing or Yahoo Finance I start writing articles for them so now people see me in a more of a position of authority so it's not just I have like a number of sort of number of followers on either Korra or Twitter or LinkedIn or whatever it's like oh I just saw James encore and now I see him on cnn.com what's he doing there and so so I establish some authority then you got to create an email newsletter and it's free 99% of your content has to be free so I would create an email newsletter and always just at the end of my articles I would say hey you want to hear more from me I have an email newsletter sign up now and I'll give you my book the top 20 hustles for 20 20 and just for free and you know just and then I would just start putting all my articles on my free email and then I'd start at some point my level of expertise should be big enough that I can start a for pay subscription newsletter like whether it's about trends or stocks or some physical activity or and this is the exact thing you did I mean I think that from an outside perspective I mean it looks like your newsletter business makes tens of millions in subscription revenue yeah so so I did do that and again it wasn't the first business I started that would have been a good first business if the question was if I was 22 what would I do that is how I did do that that latest business that I sold and and it worked that model works and I encourage other people sorry online course like a friend of mine has an online course that she started this person is the most introverted shy person I know and she started a course on how to be noticed by the media how to become a media expert and she priced it at $700 she said she opens it up for like three days every year sells another thousand and makes seven hundred thousand a year and you know lives in a cheap country she moved there just to keep expenses down and you know this is a and it's just a course so it's not an ongoing newsletter I think an online course is better actually than newsletters and I think affiliate deals are better than also creating an online newsletter so so if I were to redo my business I would do it over slightly but you know that that's what I would do if I was starting completely from scratch I think I've seen that methodology work over and over again and it is the advice I give people because content creation is is king like that is always there's a demand how many times you've been asked this during this lockdown man what what show should i watch I feel like I've watched everything content people always want more content all the big content creators spend hundreds of billions on content just on sitcoms this year so there's so much demand for content and you can provide value like if you really again ninety-nine percent of your content will still be free that's key but you could provide extra value that it's worth paying for like for instance I forget if I get I think I get the hustle for free right like that's funny trends is not trends is not but but the hustle you convinced me I love the hustle and that's where most of your content is yeah but it's it's the quality and the voice in the hustle that convinced me okay I need to get trends and I'm happy to always pay for it and it's or it mean it's just gone [ __ ] but we got yeah but there's value like if you don't provide value then people are gonna realize pretty quickly that you're useless like you always have to provide value and have something and have a unique perspective yeah I think that is the key in the hardest part is having the unique perspective everything after that is sort of the textbook you know you run the PlayBook after that of how do I did it out there for free how do I collect you know over customer relationship and then how do i monetize for the most hardcore but the only perspective is hard how do you shape that I'll give you another example like do you guys play fantasy sports at all yeah okay so I do not play fantasy sports I knew I don't even know the rules of football but Matt Barry who's the fantasy sports anchor at ESPN and he also hosts this TV show the fantasy showed ESPN that guy was a Hollywood screenwriter he was writing movies and TV shows and he hated his life and he quit that it's making a ton of money he quit that I started writing blog he just loves sports and fantasy sports he started blogging about that for a hundred dollars a blog post just kind of broke after all this and quitting Hollywood moved away and a hundred dollars of blog post was the most he can get but because he had this writing skill from his Hollywood Times uh he had a quickly got a huge audience in fantasy sports then he built a for pay subscription site and you know after producing Moses condom for free ESPN bought it and he kept moving up the ranks there and boom he's he's done so much better doing what he loves at fantasy sports and monetizing in almost the same way I just described and he's so much happier than when he was writing movies which is a lot of people consider the dream job I love it we should we should wrap up in a second James this was awesome I got to admit you were way more legit than I expected it you know I thought you were what why did you expect me not to be legit okay I've already already called them out on this which last time he called himself out he goes so when his company was acquired Sean James like dude my contents legit I'm legit I do it all but the acquiring company admittedly is incredibly aggressive with the advertising and sometimes that uh kinda makes me appear as though I'm one thing when I'm not yeah and and and and by the way it's a very interesting topic how aggressive you should be with your advertising and they're so aligned to Putin who's this French philosopher he is this theory that even the good guys need to use Machiavellian tactics they need to use that because otherwise if I just said hey guys I have a unique perspective on Bitcoin please listen to me there was so much aggressive advertising out there they would have drowned me out and I would have not succeeded in my mission which was to inform people what I thought was a correct view of Bitcoin and then what would have been the point right so sometimes and but but it did cost me though like doing because my ads were so good we dominated I mean that was the reason Facebook Google and every shut down crypto ads is because of my ads yeah that was definitely a little piece of it but what I actually meant was most of the time when a guest comes on I think to myself well there's a really successful person but man they're there you know they don't tell great story you know they they do not bring you know sort of energy stories and also you know some unique insights that the audit that you know I'm imagining I'm a listener right like during this interview you talked for the most of us I was actually you know listener number one for this podcast episode and I would have liked this one and so I I can't always say that that's the case with all of our guests but you brought that that's all I really meant what you're legit which is huh you know I've raised the bar for the podcast which is great excellent thank you so much so James this was awesome if people want to say hi to you is Twitter your go-to method no I'm James Altucher on tick-tock my absolute best content tick-tock 50-year old dude perspective oh yeah I'm not dancing I did do one one time I danced and someone said someone literally said commented dude this is not why we found out this I took that one down and I haven't danced since although if if push came to shove and I was drunk I when I was 12 years old I was a semi-professional breakdancer big boy breakdancer that's an ass man we appreciate you coming I I'm looking forward to joining you again and you coming back to us and developing a friendship that's awesome excellent yeah and and Shawn yeah definitely let's have you on the podcast as well so all cool let's exchange emails and we'll figure it all out sounds good thank you all right all right you guys thanks a lot talk to you soon bye [Music]

and kind of just ask them where they think the opportunities might be in a post Ovid worlds Zack welcome back so Zack this week I guess we've done we've done a lot of stories in recent weeks where we've helped you as readers navigate these uncertain times we've written about a couple dozen stories on people and companies and how they're pivoting we did a webinar to sort of break down next next tier steps that people need to be thinking about and sort of second second-order effects that our colleague step Smith did and but one thing we kind of haven't heard a lot from and that I think these are people who everyday are thinking about these kinds of issues it's futurists and so this week we asked Zach and a bunch of our writers and analysts to reach out to a number of futurists and ask them a little bit about where they see things headed Zach what did you find yeah so I guess to start off many of you might already know this but futurists aren't profits at least the good ones they don't claim to know the future a futurist is basically just someone who studies kind of next order outcomes they use signals and trends and analyze you know technology trends to try to get a bit of grasp on what might be coming and they use a you know it's very interdisciplinary they use mathematics engineering art technology they use forecasting models so we talked to a bunch of these folks on our team and kind of just asked them where they think the opportunities might be in a post ovid world what the emerging industries might be the short and long term impact of this crisis on entrepreneurship and we got a lot of really interesting varying answers some of some of the futurists we talked to you we're specialists in certain industries or sectors like education others are a little bit more in general and you know that some of the recurring themes are that you know catastrophe is a catalyst for change generally in a king it can lead to some really good things so one one of the Futurists that I think really highly of is Amy Webb and she shared a sort of construct for how she thinks about change and how she anticipates things so what was it she shared with you that was interesting yeah so Amy Webb is a what you'd call a quantitative futurist she's is a lot of data to formulate her opinions on things and what she does is she always starts with a set of five questions and I'm gonna share those here because I think it's an interesting preface to what we'll be talking about in our article but she asks where and how are people wasting their time so that's one big question she'll always ask she asks where and how are people having difficulty with technology that's an especially interesting one right now you know a lot of we're seeing a lot of new technologies emerging video conferencing has been accelerated it others have struggled the third question she asks is where and how are people looking for information and then she'll ask where and how are people stuck and how do people want to be perceived so those those those are kind of five big questions that they guide a lot of her thinking about what's to come in the future does it sound like the kinds of questions you should ask yourself before you start a business so I'm curious to see like what else what else we can learn from those if rather than just like how do you think about the future how do you think about what's coming but like how can you position yourself in front of that if you're someone who needs a new job or is thinking about any business sure definitely and she took us through a number of hypothetical examples which we'll share more on in the piece but um she kind of took us through her framework of thinking about these things particularly for entrepreneurs who are maybe looking to get their feet wet for the first time or more importantly looking to do something important right now I think there's going to be a lot opportunities for entrepreneurs to do things that help other small business owners and entrepreneurs and I think that that's an important thing that shouldn't be overlooked in this conversation that's great well I will look forward to seeing more on this and I'm sure you will too so definitely check your email and Sunday thanks again for joining us I see breath [Music]

this is very casual so I don't even care we could record right now it's recording now and we'll put that up so this is very casual and I'm gonna ask you a lot of questions and if you don't want to something just say it but uh oh I will yeah it's very casual what's going on you're Randy right yeah ask me so I I'm a fan of your guys product and typically I own it I have my own my own gym downstairs I I do research on the businesses that we talk to and the people we talk to but in this case I didn't do too much research on purpose because I only have the product as a fan of the products perspective and and I wanted to come from that point of view but do you know do you know what this podcast is and who we are or anything like that well give me a little more background because I'm yeah I've been doing a fair number of these since this crazy-making period took off and it's hard to keep up with them it was funny because I love to support right because I do so much in the entrepreneurial community I love to support young entrepreneurs so I'm I'm basically you know taking pods that I normally wouldn't take just because it's you know we're here we're home and if I can support other guys that are getting stuff going that I'm all about it and what you said you've been doing a lot since the making what MIT what are you talking about well I said since this mayhem right yeah I mean I I do a quite a lot of stuff in the press normally just to promote you know to promote my brand but since we've all been locked at home there's a massive proliferation of digital content in the form you know sometimes in the form of video blogs and podcasts and so I in fact I just got off another another one with a with a investment bank an industry panel basically but it was just a call so I I didn't have to be as pretty as I am now for you Sam good well you look great so let me we're gonna I'm gonna give you a 20 second or two minute background and then we're gonna make this all about you but so i'm sampar i own this company called the hustle and what we do is i started it we just turned four years like a weeks ago so typically we have these conferences there were be hosts trade shows conferences where we host tens of thousands of people each year but we also have the hustle and the hustle is our daily email it goes up to millions of people so millions of people log in and they get our news from us and their email INBOX each morning and it's a great business it's a eight-figure wonderful business that we bootstrapped and then we also have trends and trends KO it's our subscription product so we it's those premium content community which is also great business so awesome and and we do this podcast as a that I think I forget how many listeners we have but we've had millions millions of listens all over a million lessons and what this podcast kind of started as was me and Sean my co-host who isn't here right now but we both have started companies and we always had these interesting brain storms with people like you who were our friends and we would just riff on interesting ideas and on cool insights and most people don't have access to those types of people and so we just do this publicly and so that's what we're gonna do today and so what I want to do right now is uh I want to learn up a little bit about your background and kind of how you came to be where you are now and where you are now well uh where I am right now is in my house in Mill Valley I'm sort of like I feel like Rapunzel I spend all my time up in the tower above my garage right it's a become my sort of everything from the sports marketing department or sponsorship marketing department of TRX to the you know production studio for every one of our sort of you know blog interactions and that kind of thing but um you know I I so I'm the founder of TRX I I live in in you know Marin County prior to TRX I was a Navy SEAL for 14 years and uh actually created the first cornice while I was at the special missions unit and then just decided you know after I left the SEAL Teams I went to business school at Stanford and decided while I was there that this was a viable business concept you know which I think at the time I massively over over as made it how easy it would be because the product was so great but what i used stanford is basically an incubator second year as an incubator for this concept and TRX is i guess this is our 15th year in the market and you know we're doing pretty well we're one of the only truly global Fitness brands and we you know we've we've put close to 350,000 training pros through our our terrace coach qualification courses and we're in about I don't know somewhere between fifty and seventy thousand gyms and studios around the world most of which are closed right now which is an interesting you know experience but fortunately for TRX we we we were for 10 years all b2b just serving athletes training centers clubs trainers and and boutique studios and then about four or five years ago now we decided all right we're ready to start to expand into the consumer the true b2c consumer space and you know it's good that we did that because obviously that side of our business in the co19 environment is absolutely off the charts the commercial side of our business is really struggling because all the all the gyms and all the trainers are all out of work so it's been a little bit of A Tale of Two Cities over the last couple months but that's basically the snapshot of you know what TRX is and and I'm today I'm co-chairman and really promoter in chief of the brand do you own the company or have you guys been acquired or anything like that well the company is we have you know I raised a long time ago I mean it raised a bunch of rounds of angel money when I started and then and then took on private equity back in 2012 and then recently recapped the business to exit those initial partners and bring in some new partners because that's one of the you know the dirty little secrets about institutional capital is once you take it it's very difficult to get rid of so so it's a you know it's a private company but it's co-owned by by a bunch of us including the capital partners that that came in got a twenty at the end of 2018 beginning at 2019 how much would you raise from the angel folks well in the way back I think I raised about Oh to think back to my round five million bucks from you know in several rounds of angel money and and that's great capital right for I don't know I don't know what the complexion of your viewership is but think about raising don't use you can use jargon it's a very it's a very highly intelligent not beginner audience so go ahead yeah well I mean that by far the highest may look the cheapest source of of money to grow business as always what they call non deluded capital right and and that mostly in the form of sales but if you're gonna take on diluted capital the I think by far the best source is angel investors for a couple reasons I mean if presuming you pick your angels the right way because what you get in an angel investor if you've chosen well is you get somebody who has a lot of domain relevant domain expertise because angels tend to invest in things that they know and think that one way or another they can contribute value to if you pick the right angel you'll get somebody who not only has domain expertise but super passionate about your venture generally angels are willing to to invest on a common stock basis which you know I strongly recommend to entrepreneurs that they stay away from preferred structures up until they're ready to to sell a significant piece of their of their equity or exit all together is what you once you you know once you bring in a preferred layer of equity into the cap stack everything's different in terms of the Solidarity that you once had right across the team and the investors because that changes and and it's a you know it's it's a tough change in the variants of most people that I know to manage so so I'm a big fan of angel investors in which you get not only capital right but you end up getting pro bono experts effectively who are excited to be involved in your venture how how big was the company when you sold it to PE or sell parts to PE well it's been you know two rounds of that now right so so the first the first money we took and I think we're around I don't know you know 30 million something like that revenue in annual revenue yeah and and you know and and who knows you know will be will be north of you know probably north of 60 somewhere who knows how far because kovat is a interesting experience but and we don't you know we don't really get into specifics because we're privately held company so if you're heading that way just to redirect you well so you already said it's the ballpark is sixty million it could be way higher but you bet a number that's been said um a company like TRX you guys so we talked to a lot of like these direct-to-consumer folks which you didn't start out as but you are definitely are now yeah when I think of TRX I think that you guys are in the same category as a CrossFit or and this isn't an insult but like Tony Horton like you guys are like a brand right like you're not just some amazon you don't rank on Amazon and that's how you win TRX is something that people know and it's a brand do you think that your valuation is significantly we you're multiples be significantly higher because of that you think or is it still rough to get a high valuation on products like this well I mean so for starters I mean we aren't we aren't it we're the number one selling fitness item on Amazon yeah but but I didn't mean like your weight your path of success has not been like well we're just gonna rank higher like it was just like people love it no I know yeah we built I mean look from day one this was never intended to to be a gift get-rich-quick scheme right it wasn't a a trend I mean it's funny because when I first started the business there were no predecessors to the product that I brought to market right our initial hero product which was the Suspension Trainer the the idea there seemed kind of crazy to bring this strap into the club landscape full of machines and think that you were gonna be successful but one of the things that we did that was that was a really great choice and I made plenty of less than great choices but the one of them that was a great choice was really finding this sweet spot in helping training pros of all kinds right from from chiropractors and physical therapists on one hand out to to MMA coaches and powerlifting coaches on the other end and then obviously you know and under the under the bell curve you know tons of personal trainers and group fitness instructors we decided we're gonna become the part the business partner of them and that we were gonna give them this great tool that had it's like I was described the suspension trainer like a magic wand right if you if you know the magic you can really make you can become a magician to your to your clients and your athletes and deliver them unbelievable results that always you know you look at a 12 feet of nylon webbing ago yeah what can that do with the right Pro and the right knowledge in that pros head you end up going oh my god this thing I've never seen anything like this right and that's that's a unique characteristic that not many products or services ever have which is you have people to come in with a very low expectation and leave with a very high level of astonishment and so that's been a powerful benefit to us and then we diversified the book the the company's scope of operations we became you know the largest provider of professional education to trainers and then we brought in the product line significantly all the while focusing on this premium brand that you alluded to which I do believe brings you know and enhanced multiple the reality though is that long if all a company wants to be is a product company right that delivers durable goods because our stuff lasts for freaking ever you know way too long from Yodo I've had the same on I've had the same one for four years I think I got it was gifted on Christmas and I've had the same one for four years now yeah I mean and that's and you're in four years is nothing for a one-on-one right I I talk to people that are that are still traveling around using our like first gen strap from 2005 in their bag you know and it's I mean on one hand it's a compliment on another it's a nightmare right because you need what they called plan planned obsolescence yeah yeah the break after like you know five thousand push-ups we never we never planned that because I really wanted to be I look I I came at this whole thing you know I started my entrepreneurial career at 39 so after a career as a as a Navy SEAL so I you know I had a set of premium level delivery and if I was gonna be associated with this brand and that's what we were gonna do so we built everything that way the unintended consequence is the one that you and I are beating around right now is your stuff lasts forever and that which means that you know you either have to create more products to serve your existing customers which is expensive right as R&D is not cheap or you have to constantly be in search of new customers which is not cheap and so you know it's it's I think that's why pure product goes get uh what I would say you know unfair valuations relevant or relative to some of these fakers more fake companies that are you know tech based companies that have the potential not the promise but the potential to scale infinitely right and so those kinds of companies tend to get higher valuations than gear companies and that's that's just one of those realities and it's part of what you know we've never planned to be just the gear company we we have always planned to expand our services into subscription services and con and that's what we've done so let's talk about that in a second but first right now you guys make what are your revenue streams your revenue streams are coming straight from the revenue streams our purchases from coaches and things like that well coaches and chiropractors and who like you know B to beat people with servicing clients right we make well we're an omni-channel distributor so you know on the on the commercial side of the business which is the b2b side yeah we sell the gym so geared to gyms services and education to gyms and trainers yeah but and that's what I want to ask about what is education so you well yeah so we knew so we we became early on I mean if you think back nobody knew how to use a strap that didn't stretch and didn't have any weight attached to it so if I was with you or one-on-one I had almost a hundred percent close rate in the in the earliest days problem was I can't be everywhere right so and if I wasn't with you and you were just looking at a picture of it say on the website the conversion would drop to you know five percent so that was something that I realized very early all right well I have to be able to scale my knowledge on how to use this thing and so I brought in a guy who was introduced to me very very early in the company's history again in Frayser Quelch who had been a career trainer and had written a lot of education in the form of courses for other pros right to teach other pros the various skills I mean how's a trainer or coach learned his or her craft they usually get a basic certification from a entry level certification body like American Council on exercise or or NASM or NSCA and then they go out into practice and they start developing practical skills and along the way they want to learn more about you know a particular tool or a methodology or and so they they do they have continuing education requirements right just like a doctor or a lawyer they have to they have to do so many continuing education units per year to maintain their basic certification we became one of the leading providers of those CEC courses that that help help a new trainer or coach move toward mastery so do charge them for I'm on your website now and that cost money yeah yeah our normal our knowing we have about ten courses different kinds and an hour all b2b and the P not $89 well know traditionally they were two hundred ninety five right so two hundred ninety five bucks for a one day qualification course and it was eight hours live in person what you're probably seeing now is we've done some some pretty incredible pivots with Kovan nineteen hitting and changing the landscape and so one of the things we did early on was try to figure out hey alright number one we're not gonna be able to provide education right as long as this thing lasts because you can't get people together number two most of the people who come to our courses are out of work and so what what what can we do to support them was sort of idea number one and then number two was how do we take this moment which is really a bunch of lemons being thrown at us and make lemonade out of it and we decided that well we can take our courses we can make them free figure out how to how to deliver them through zoom instead of live and we'll do that as long as as this you know crisis continues and we'll just try to fill our bucket with a whole bunch of new pros of all kinds of stripes right who on the other side of this will then appreciate that that we help them out when they were down and also just grows the community grows the TRX community and so that's what we've been doing so then you guys have revenue from selling the the main product the TR the main TRX which it looks like you have a few varieties but I imagine most is from the main one and then you make revenue from these hundreds of tuner 100 to 300 dollar b2b digital products what what's the breakdown is like is the actual product eighty percent of sales oh it's you know it's falling pretty pretty fast as as the education and now the with what's the big epiphany and the big unlock that's gone on over the last two months is that we massively accelerated our what already was a migration toward digital delivery and subscription models and so you know we've also got an app that that we make money off of that's a four ninety-five a month app that supports the end user and and we we have turned off the paywall on that during kovat but that will go back on once everybody gets back to work you know we're really using Cova 19 as an opportunity to develop new to solidify the relationships with our existing customers and bring new customers into the tribe through a free door that eventually obviously everybody knows that no business can keep their services free forever but in the meantime we're using it as as a big opportunity to you know to build a new relationship so the the mix is is really changing the other thing that that I think you know well what was the big pre kovat you know I mean it's probably probably 70/30 between you know equipment but you're defining equipment way too narrowly right you're looking at our hero products which are the suspension trainers we do the entire ecosystem of functional training so from yeah you know steel echo systems that you built the infrastructure that you know they not only hang straps on but you fill with kettlebells bands balls you do pull-ups on right everything you would see in a gym yeah you're right yeah which I which I've used do you have a sales team to handle that like did you have to do like hand-to-hand combat for that or is a lot of it inbound and you're just fulfilling orders um it's some of both right I mean no I don't think any business it certainly doesn't exist for very long as as all inbound flow right general you have to be out there knocking down the you know the targets yeah I mean but are you like running paid ads to them or do you actually have to have a sales force who's hitting the phones and mechana hello both yeah both we advertise into the commercial landscape through the traditional you know means to reach gym owners and trainers but then we also have a pretty significant direct sales force inside and outside that that does account development service say look I'm looking at um I use this tool that guesses website traffic if I looking at this tool I would imagine that your sales are like Forex in April what they were in February it looks like you guys are just like like you your web traffic has gone through the roof yeah well it certainly has and the reason is I think less to do with anything we've changed in our marketing then with the reality that you know as a ten year into B business we we've put you know we serve tens of millions of people around the world who identify themselves as TR extras but ironically had never bought a product for their home right because they use us Jim and I run into people constantly one of my best friends you know will tell me like oh I've never bought you know call me and be like hey can you give me a friends-and-family yet you know discount and I'll be like you don't have one of our straps these are people that I know are diehard TR Xers and then there would be like hello man I do it three times a week in the gym you know and so that that was that was a reality that comes with being a b2b business for ten years but what happened with the virus was when all the gym doors got shut all the sudden all of those installed that installed base of TR Xers went well how the hell am I gonna do my my workouts and so they turned to our Amazon site and our web site and you know that's that's been I believe the big source of of the the growth the explosive growth you have a unique advantage of seeing like consumer goods or well hard goods and digital products so you're able to see how they both work and my from my perspective and I've been an investor and I have friends who sell direct to consumer hard goods and then I also have a digital company and I've invested in them as well what my perspective is that the DTC guys can grow their revenue from zero to not zero very quickly but there's massive supply chain headaches where as digital it's often the opposite where it's maybe a little more challenging to get started but the margins are way better and you never have a supply chain issue what uh knowing both sides of the business which do you prefer well I mean I I think did which do I prefer I prefer the one that's easier and makes more money um you know I think with what's that yeah well the reality is that I think I think creating a digital company pure digital is is hard because it's a very cluttered field right it's a it's there's especially now I mean this this virus has unleashed the digital universe right and so now just like any other marketplace there's gonna be this explosion of would be you know participants and then there will be a consolidation and and some of the you know they'll separate sort of the wheat from the chaff and I think that we're in a really unique position because we started as a physical products company then we became an education company education and content right because we made I mean he'll we probably did 35 DVDs prior to DVDs becoming disintermediated by digital delivery we've obviously taken all that content and repurposed it into our digital echo systems but then we we became a brand like a really significant premium brand in the space and then we stretched that brand around the world so now we're in a really unique position because we have the best of both worlds right we have a large customer base that bought our physical gear and that then came to group classes in clubs around the world that we helped develop and and educate the instructors who are do those so it got comfortable and identified with our brand and then as we've done more and more consumer branding we've extended that brand from the the pro space which is great from a credibility standpoint because if trainers and physical therapists love you the consumer at home tends to go well these guys must be you know a quality operation and so now we're in a really unique position now we're turning on some new digital engines and subscription engines that give us the best of it all right we're you will have our products which you're right you stock out of I mean we're you know we've stocked out over and over and over during this thing because no one plans for a you know multi time step function change in the demand curve right and you you you scramble to try to catch up to it and I think a lot of us will find ourselves just about the time where we're caught up and we've got this you know a whole new stockyard full of product maybe the demand will settle down a little bit and we'll end up with Harry yeah and it's but that's just that's part of being a physical product you know just supplier is so so that's my question which one do you find which one do you personally enjoy more both in terms of working on and the results I'm a uh I mean I'm an inventor you know so so that is part of my like it's it's a it's probably what maybe want to go into the Navy SEAL Teams I have a MacGyver bent to me and I came up with an old man that can fix literally anything with almost nothing and so I I sort of grew up you know out in the garage until you know the middle of the night holding a flashlight for my oh man well he was you know jerry-rigging some kind of a of a fix to to a old motor or to what ever could be anything so I really enjoy a lot of time and energy at TRX developing our next products I also though appreciate and enjoy creating great content whether it's in the form of pro education or whether the form of end-user content a workout content and so I I would say I like both I like the economics of the digital side of the equation for the reasons that you've pointed out right you don't stock out of it and you don't it scales infinitely but I don't think that it's an easy business to just say oh I'm gonna become a digital content publisher and I'm gonna you know make a billion dollars yeah like you and the other billion would be digital content producers that are out there all right on the same path and so so I I like them both I like the multiples on digital content and subscriptions though I'll tell you that so I'm gonna ask you about some I'm gonna ask you about that in a second and I'm gonna ask you about interesting ideas that you're seeing it in new opportunities but first you said something that you're the chairman right so does that mean you're not the CEO yeah I'm what we brought in a a president you know I've tried a number of times to get out of the day day in day out management of the organization because a couple reasons one at this point you know I mean number one there's one founder right and so you've got a certain amount of founder cachet that is really valuable in working with the press and working with key accounts right in in generating love around the brand that there aren't others who can do that there are others who can manage the steady state sort of linear growth of a you know of a midsize and and growing company in fact there's those that can do that better than me because I'm more of a startup guy so I've tried you know several times over the last call it six years to to get more out into the market and less in the conference room and you know we hired a president about eight months ago who you know I've been doing a transition where I can you know basically hand most of the day and day out over him and to you know to to to the team and then with our new partners they're very good at the financial engineering side of the equation so I'm not right that ain't I mean that is just not something that turns me on I like the outcome but the process is just not something that you know floats my boat and everybody's everybody's cut a different cloth so what I'm really focusing my energy on is promoting the brand developing your products and and looking at new initiatives right that's something that I'm I'm very good at and passionate about is sort of trying to see around the corner and what what the next opportunities gonna be for the brand we're very similar so I've done the same thing I have a president who handles a lot of stuff and I do the exact same thing where I can lead vision but I also come at the very bottom and I could just change pixels and invent I do it digitally but the same exact crap where I'm just I have my computer up late at night I'm just making stuff and most of it sucks but every once in a while I'll show to someone and they're like oh yeah let's go make that that's the product patient dilemma right most of it most of it goes nowhere but but about every 10 you know every every tenth effort you go oh wait a minute there's something to this one right and that's you know and that's you got to be wired to not get frustrated by that just like you know just like folks who like to manage it that mid level they don't like the scariness and the ambiguity and the you know the vagaries of of the startup or creator they like the the consistent predictability of you know weekly staff meetings in a checklist and all the things that make me sort of you know make the hair stand up on the back of my neck because I feel like man this is not where I want to be so this and this is a consistent pattern that we've seen I don't know if you know this woman named Sophia Amoruso but she had this company called Nasty Gal and it's scale to I forget the exact number one or two hundred million a year in sales and had multiple offers around half a billion and it they screwed it up for a bunch of reasons one of the biggest ones that she was like I'm a brilliant at creating I'm horrible at operating and I I to him like that where I'm brilliant at creating but operating I just don't find it to be exciting and I think that most people who start stuff are the same way but I think there's actually a huge issue in your in Silicon Valley although you may or may not run in the Silicon Valley crew particularly amongst that group of people I've noticed there's a huge problem of people starting stuff who are afraid to hire people to actually run the thing and what I've really embraced and it took years to learn this is that there's actually people who like creating the car from scratch and designing it and then there's people who love modding it out and making it better and having both is really important how did you hire your president and what was that like going through that process and also how many mistakes have you made in hiring their own people because that's exciting yeah plenty I mean I mean look first of all so I I operated the company you know every single day for its first 10 years that's a long time right and at that point when you're winning it the engine of both creation activation aligned with why not in your three I mean well because we were still very much evolving right and I think one of the challenges with bringing in somebody to take over the daily management is you have to be pretty well-defined about where you're headed as an entrepreneur before you can now hand the wheel to somebody right if you're wheeling right wheeling left that's not exactly the moment to be like hey buddy here take this right because them guys like where do I Drive man so so I think that's the answer the short answer is I wasn't ready yet in terms of our our definition - and the enough certainty to the general direction of our course to want to hand that over but about your eight I was nice okay so I handed it over the first probably the first two presidents that I hired which are both great guys but the mistake that that I made largely from being from listening to my then private equity partners that you know had had sort of their their business school 101 playbook they were trying to run which is go hire a quote unquote best practice president well okay help me kill me kill me yeah I'm sure I was just gonna say I'm sure you're gonna you're gonna be hearing something familiar here right which is that a lot of the institutional capital investors they they they haven't run businesses themselves so they want to execute what they learned in Business School which is you know the idea of best practice well what is best practice that's the problem right and and generally they will say oh it's someone from the upper mid levels of a great big successful company that we've all heard of what I've learned and it took me to to go rounds to learn this by the way is that that is almost a disqualifier to be a good present company I need I need a guy with an MBA telling me what to do like I need a hole in the head I don't like right like what like oh my god I so I I've had a I got lucky I've had a lot of great success we have a guy Adam Ryan who's our president and I've known him since high school I'm from Missouri so I'm not from like this fancy San Francisco stuff like I live now and that was awesome because Adam has wonderful at being scrappy and things like this but he also can be like a big company suit if you wanted to and what I found is and I've hired some MBAs and it didn't work out what I found is these gray hair they're not actually great hair but it's more figurative these best practices this they just these people can't roll with the punches and I never had success with that test I've hired I have a few businesses on this like little investments I've made and we've hired CEOs who are like this and it just man it never works any but you think that it should yeah well it's it's a little bit akin to trying to get a cat to bark exactly a path yeah dogs bark so saying that well you know either one of them should be able to do this thing is just not right and you wouldn't do it because it would be preposterous and yet what people do all the time especially institutional investors make this mistake they assume that because somebody operated out of scale right and at a successful brand that well that person clearly can this will be easy for person and it's it's almost the reciprocal because what what they don't realize or haven't thought through is those people are playing a different game like Michael Jordan was you know arguably the best basketball player in history when he went over to the major league baseball ready hit with a thud why he's a great athlete he's playing a different sport so so what works for women on the basketball court you know doesn't work when you're on the mound of a baseball diamond and and so I think it's the very similar thing big company big company leaders have large staffs generally a lot of certainty in the direction that they're heading you know kind of single-digit management objectives right up or down it's it's it's a in a very long patient bureaucratic decision making process yeah you're almost more like a politician you're a politician a little bit you're not yeah consists of a small company right a small company and by that I mean anything south of 100 million bucks is it's constantly pivoting and in the the windows to make those pivots or not you know years you're not even quarters you know you're lucky if they're months and so though I think the difference in the operating cadence and style is profound and just going to a big company a successful big company manager and thinking they're gonna be successful as a small company president it almost never works out yeah I think that look if once it once my business becomes a financial arbitrage machine and I need someone to figure out how to milk out three percent off the bottom line by using less materials then I'm gonna get one of those nerds but until then I need innovative people who understand how to eat it's a perfect balance of art and science who understand like financial analysis and things like that but who also can understand what motivates buyers and who can think of widgets that you know make people feel good and want to purchase and be it's just I've been to this so I empathize you uh are you investing in anything at the moment or 100 percent of your time on this or like on Saturdays and Sundays are you tinkering with anything totally outside of this field perpetually yes yeah right now well I mean there's a lot of different things that interest me I'm you know I'm an angel investor in a bunch of different enterprises both inside and outside of health and fitness and I because I'm a super you know I'm a startup nerd so I I live and breathe you know that and I teach I teach classes at both my alma mater is at the Marshall school USC and at the Graduate School Business at Stanford so I get to see a ton of Liam badass so you're a fitness guy a Navy SEAL and academic you know I have to put that in quotes Sam I'm not sure that I would that I would put academic technically I'm right though be you tell you dude you teach at Stanford ok what I'm a lecturer right not a professor so so that means that you had all you had to do is have gone there and then I've done something that didn't suck subsequently right and made a list you're just an eclectic dude you'll like you can kick someone's ass but then also like you talk to them about Aristotle and like Britain's economic policy now the impact of imperialism then I think I'm at that part right right I'm gonna collective dude and I'm I'm a super geeky inventor you know which which I love I mean I've got like 40 patents that I didn't care less about the patents what I cared about was the thing right like bringing the thing to life and then once you do particularly in today's digital economy but you gotta protect it because if you don't you'll be knocked off and blown out of you know blown into oblivion almost immediately with factory direct stores out of China that have FBA shops on Amazon now so you know so that's why I became you know like I joke about having a minor PhD in intellectual property law that I never wanted but I had to learn and so all of that like all the nuts and bolts of creating and then you know articulating a vision and and wrangling a team to to to share that vision and then moving that thing forward that's the stuff that that makes my you know my heart pound what are your best angel investments well I mean I suppose we'll wait and see until they until they they pan out but yeah uh no not yet I'm sort of an equity investor right I'm I'm you know I make a good living now and and so I'm not you know I'm not I'm not in any of these for a quick turn but I think that they all will and you know most of them are in areas that I that I I tend to to both invest and advise only in things that I think I can make a difference in I've taken a couple of different fliers on on things that you know buddies that I trust and our domain experts in other areas have said hey man you should get in on this you know but I'm and also let's just qualify this I'm a small you know investor all I'm not I'm not placing six-figure investments one after and but I but I I tend to invest in things where I can help the operating team based on my own experience try and really experience is just the sum of all your mistakes as much as anything else and so I you know I can help early-stage businesses set up their their partnership arrangements right figure out what makes a good partner figure out what capital sources that make the most sense for them or because I know both the pros and the cons of all of them at this point and then you know team selection that's I mean I've been leading teams since I was you know 22 year old frogman and led all the way up to you know the national level and so I've got a lot of experience whether I've done all right I certainly haven't haven't done all wrong either but I've got a lot of experience in in helping you know build a culture create team dynamics that are that are durable and and performance oriented and build brands so if it's in those categories that's kind of my wheelhouse I have to polish real thing I go in the restroom real quick go we'll edit this part out sorry about that no no man yeah are you an MMA fan yeah big-time so I'm a huge MMA fan and I this quarantine thing I've gotten very healthy much like I've done higher Mane's and things like that but I've like actually started using my TRX by the way and there you go lifting weights I've gotten strong but I I have a weight loss challenge and I have $500 on the line and I have to hit it by Saturday and I have I'm gonna crush it just through diet and exercise but I began just I'm drinking like crazy amounts of water because I want to do like a MMA weight cut and just like destroy the benchmark oh yeah and so I'm uh I'm currently drinking three gallons of water a day and then tomorrow and the next day I'm gonna taper down my goal is to crush everyone that's great yeah I've been an MMA fan since before there was MMA because you know coming up in the SEAL Teams right you do a it was very eclectic in terms of the the coaches that we would bring in so I I was a you know I've been the the full gamut I was I was an MMA guy before MMA was turned right everybody was still purists in there arts but because I had this Bedouin lifestyle of constantly deploying and coming back I didn't have that luxury so I became you know I'd been a kickboxer and a wrestler in high school kickboxer through college then a then a got into jutsu at the end of college and and lean into that you know hard in as a seal but it was never I never had the luxury of being in one place for more than a couple years at a time and and so but I've been a huge fan of we did a ton of sponsorship actually of the fighters in the UFC prior to Reebok buying the you know the global rights to to the sponsorship placements so yeah I in fact Mike Dolce could should help you with your with your weight cut right he's a he's a freaking master that's death well so we do you know do you know who Ben Askren is sure I've become friends with been through this podcast and media and so he's been helping me out and name-dropping a little but I'm a huge fan of his and then I start talking to him like it's awesome I'm principal I looked up to and then I think we're having Michael Bisping come on and do a podcast as well yeah they're great man I mean a screms a stud wrestler and biz beings just you know you talk about one of the veterans of the of the sport I was so happy when you know when he finally got to the mountaintop after all those years of racial fighting everybody that you know that was that was there to be fought and he just kept sort of somehow falling just short but he finally got there before retirement so I was stoked for him so you um you know about all this stuff and it's sometimes whenever I talk about like MMA and UFC I'm like I think I'm being too niche right now no one cares I think it's way bigger than I actually realized but when you were in the seals this the seal thing interests me for two reasons one Jaco wilt is it Willick yeah sure willing well link that guy's everywhere right now so and he's always fun and he's got good clips that are fun to watch and then I'm also reading David Goggins book can't hurt me yeah it randomly came up on my audible thing and I started listening to it it's it's emotional it's sad it's hard to listen to have you looked have you heard it well I mean I know I know David you know I did never work together but I you know you cross paths same thing with Jocko those guys are those guys are both way behind me in terms of age but the and so and the SEAL Teams you know if if somebody's more than a couple of years ahead or behind you the the likelihood of you knowing him is possible but not high unless you worked at the same places right in which case then you then you transcend the age barriers because you're all you know at a command together and you you work together and I never work with either one of those guys in fact I think as I was getting out they were both coming in but I certainly no you know of both of them and I like what what they both done with their brands and you know Jocko has done some really really cool stuff with his podcast and his other appearances in fact he popped up the other day on on the billions which I was laughing about oh I haven't watched through the premiere and a few up so this new the new season he popped up in that and I was like yeah man that's what I love it when I see other frogs doing doing good stuff versus stupid where they're out there you know telling and selling secrets that are gonna you know put other guys at risk which I do not admire but I but I really love when I see guys out there doing great things post career because that's what the whole country is supposed to be predicated on right it's the citizen soldier you've come in you serve for however long you try to serve as well as you can and then you go on and do something something else cool out in the civilian community and be able to share some of the things you learned I love that Jocko does that and I love the Dave's doing that as well so when I started my business I I was like like you or I'm just like I like to invent things and I like selling them and I like making money what I didn't was what I always did track-and-field and running and weightlifting and swimming and those are all individual sports and what I really struggled with early on was how to be a leader it's super hard because you like for a lot of people they start stuff because it's like I said it's fun and it makes money and it's cool they don't but then they like if it was successful then they're like oh I got to be like a leader of men and women not necessarily a creator of products what do you think do you think that I mean I know the answer the answer is definitely yes but what specifically helped being in the seals in terms of business leadership and managing a team and by the way how many people do you have we've got about a hundred full timers and then we we you know we use another 350 master instructors to deliver our education courses so they're 1099s but you know so it 100 full-time plus or minus and you know another several hundred that we need to we employ as contractors do you think people would say you're a good manager and or or a good leader I think they'd probably say I'm a better leader than I am a manager right that's that would be my guess because it maps to I mean I can manage and I the distinction between that to me is quite a wide gap right there are there are people I think who can do both at a very high level but not many because the I believe that most of the characteristics that make someone really good at one or the other almost prevent you from being good at both I mean there are some extraordinary people I think out there that can do both but but management requires just a a different level of you know attention to - - minutiae I want to say detail because I'm very detail-oriented but ongoing minutiae which is important in making a business go um you know I don't have the patience for it and I also you know I never I never really liked corporate management I I liked leadership a lot and leadership is about storytelling being authentic right motivating and communicating and you think you're good at that I mean you seem very charismatic do you think they're a good leader yeah I think that's one of the strengths that I have developed largely as as a result of my experience in the SEAL Teams what doesn't think I can learn from you then through your field experience and that our listeners can learn anything well I mean we do you know so I do I do a key I do a keynote that is pretty massively oversubscribed frankly called lessons of a frogman and it's leadership lessons a business leadership lessons that I learned as a seal which turns out almost all of the key lessons that I know I actually learned as a seal the leadership lessons not necessarily the tactical business lessons but and and you know you would think and I actually had one of the assistant Dean's at Stanford Business School when I was out interviewing for two to be accepted there you know give me this sort of patron and put a shoulder hand on my shoulder and basically said well that you know why do you want it what do you think we should take you Randy I talked about you know my leadership experience you know I was at that point I was at the special missions unit as a as a troop commander and had been in the SEAL Teams for you know out of ten years or so and you know then he put his hand on my shoulder and said well then it's it's a bit different leading in the real world than it is in the military don't don't don't you think because out here you can't just tug on your collar device and have everyone snap to and do what you say i don't livi it i was so astonished man i was like is this guy for real right now or is he baiting me and and i basically said to him you know uh dean if that's your view on military leadership that i think it says a lot more about how little you know than it does about the subject of leadership and you know not surprising that i didn't get in that time but but but you know i think that if you're talking about people and groups of people there are many many more commonalities to how to lead and motivate the group then there are differences depending on you know like irrespective of domain because you're talking about anthropological behavior and that changes very slowly over millennia you know and whether you're a you know a baker or a freakin frontline soldier or a software developer if you're dealing with other people humans behave you know largely the same way they have different micro cultures but but we're all part of the Homo Sapien species and we we've evolved our behaviors over you know hundreds of thousands if not millions of years so the commonalities are that people want to be inspired they want to be they want to associate with something they believe in and other people you share that belief system they want to feel important right like they're contributing everyone wants approval and reinforcement that what we're doing is is good and so figuring out how in a context to provide those basic human needs is what leadership is all about and and I think that it's not actually very domain-specific whereas management arguably is much more domain-specific right depending on the industry and and I think that requires you know a different set of skills and very often the things that makes them one a good manager prevent them from wanting to be on the podium prevent them from wanting to take risks right and and those are things that you know you can't lead anybody if you're not willing to get on point and and so I think that you know leading and managing or related but not same thing as this lessons of a frogman is that available publicly if I google that can I watch it I hope not because it's one of the is it's one of the you know the side hustles that I enjoy doing I actually it's obviously I'm doing them during covert 19 but but I'm I'm working on a couple of books in the early stages one of them is is going to be that it's gonna be the deeper look into the substance of my you know keynotes that I do for corporations the other is is gonna be an entrepreneur Survival Guide because what I discovered right is that the gap between what I learned at Stanford Business School and the stuff I actually needed the day I launched this scrappy little strapped startup couldn't have been wider right and and that's at one of the best business schools in the world but what it what those business schools really prepare you to do is enter as a mid-level manager into a large organization very few of them prepare you to be a boot scrape entrepreneur right that needs to walk out and figure out how to how to find some space how to get pesky little things like insurance you know when you when you start thinking about somebody you're gonna partner with what's that all about you know how do you go about the nuts and bolts of raising money without screwing yourself you know there and ever after all that stuff you don't really get in Business School you get that by getting out there and doing you know hope so no I agree and we're gonna be wrapping up soon so I want to ask you just I wanted to wrap up the questions on angel investing any companies that you've written checks to that we would know about well I mean I can tell you a couple of ones that I'm super excited about right now there's there's one of my ironically one of my board members started a company called basil Street Cafe which is a really cool automated Pizza Kitchen concept that I think co19 has has actually now made more viable even than before but it's a really sophisticated combination of technology branding and distribution to create a nationwide initially and then global automated Pizza Kitchen and and that produces some of the most kick-ass pizza that I've ever had in my life which is really astonishing because your expectations have a machine or very low and it turns out it's every bit as good or better than blaze or any restaurant quality pizza so that Softbank backed one of those automated pizza companies hopefully you guys have a better a better run at it than those guys I think sometimes you know like there are things that that you know we're a great idea but we're ahead of their time and I think some of the some of the plays that have attempted to do this before had an interesting idea but the technology they didn't get right and you know and it's largely a distribution business as well because you have to make great great pizza and be able to you know keep the keep the machines stocked with it and so it's a but I'm excited about that one you know I've got another buddy that I'm helping that has a company called ever ins which i think is a really cool you know opposite end of the spectrum and a lot of in a lot of respects it's it's basically a very unique way to to collect capture and then encapsulate can be anything but the idea is hair ash could be any kind of material you know from a flower from you know the mountaintop where you got married or buried your gran mother or whatever and then enables that to then be put into either jewelry right that that you now have for instance I'm having some stuff done right now that I'll have my boys you know lakhs of their hair encapsulated and put into a bracelet right that'll happen with me always and so it's like with Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie had filed the blood you ever read about that they're weirdo but the other thing they do that's really interesting you you choose to put it into jewelry or into tattoos so for everybody who has tattoos and wants to ascribe a little more meaning to them right it's a it's kind of a cool thing to be a MacRay to cut a lock of you know everything from your dog's hair to your kids hair or a cheek swab and you send it off to them and they've got this patented unique process what the call into what what you know keepsake basically a permanent keepsake with a jewelry or a tattoo how do you spell it Everett's e ve R and C E and they're cool they're website severance dot life but yeah there's a couple you know that and and then I'm involved in a in a technology company and lidar radar called lumen R which is a cool a cool company and that's one of the example of one of those that all right not exactly in my wheelhouse right not an area that I can necessarily add value to but you know very exciting and another friend who pays a lot closer attention to that space you know put it in front of me and it just made sense it's it's you know one of the companies that's out there vying for supremacy in the self-driven automobile category and I feel like if you if you tell me that category and that you're starting a company in there I would just invest in there just because it's like yeah probably right it's kind of in that category and then you look at that you look at the you know the leaders and go well those people are really smart people this is us this is a sector someone's gonna win in probably more than one so you know reasonable and again as I said you know I'm I'm uh I'm a you know 20 to 50 K investor in any given one thing I'm not taking huge exposed positions usually I like to invest in things where you know I can help based on my experience as a brand or as an entrepreneur you know some government stuff that I've got involved with because obvious I spent a long time and you know in the government space but and then just some cool companies right there's cool companies that I'm trying to help right now like in d.com is an awesome new platform to help influencers monetize their followings right with content and I'm a big believer in that space and it's in it's an area where I can help them by exposing them to our large installed base of trainers who all of whom are influencers in their own right and trying to figure out how to scale themselves right and create new sort of passive streams of income so you know it's a smattering right and and there's you know there's a handful of others that are kind of in the same same category were you able to get some liquidity from the first PE event in order to make these investments the first one no I should have right and that's one of the I mean one of the big lessons for anybody who's listening and I really believe this unfortunately I didn't I didn't hear it or or if I heard it I didn't listen the first time I heard it but I really think for entrepreneurs you really should not with I'm speaking generally because there are exceptions to every you know every generality but in general I don't think entrepreneurs should take institutional capital without pulling a significant piece off the table it just you know from the time that you do and you introduce a preferred class of shares into your cap stack things change right what would be your definition of significant a million five million five hundred thousand I think it depends on the venture I I would view I would view it from where I sit now as you know if you were building and then running a successful company that and you thought that the only option for financing was to go raise it institutions I sell at least 1/3 you know of of my holding to bring those people in enough basically enough to be ok if things go differently than you expected that that would be sort of the you know the rule of thumb ant answer so that we've had a wait but you had a way for the second round then to make that happen yeah yeah and and you know I probably could have sold more at the first stop but I I was very bullish and very you know as entrepreneurs need to be and I thought hey this is you know I'm not selling anything right now um and that you know that was a big mistake that when I look back on it later on on it you don't realize it you could be locked up with these guys for a long time right and once they're in front of you then getting any kind of liquidity becomes really problematic so you know that's just something that entrepreneurs need to keep in mind and you know you could you could lose control obviously if you sell control but there are other ways where you know through the Preferences that institutional investors tend to get into term sheets where your autonomy and your ability to drive the bus at the very least get impaired in ways that you didn't expect and you didn't have the ability and we'll wrap this up a second what you didn't have the ability to take a couple million bucks like a million dollars off the profit each year to pay yourself I mean so like you are just strictly earning a low salary as the company grew or were you able to like because if you raise five million bucks right out the gate I would imagine you wouldn't even have had the ability to say like well this year we made three million in profit I'm gonna write myself a seven hundred thousand dollar check no of course not and and you don't you know and that's not frankly that's I mean that's that's a tough way for an early-stage entrepreneur to even think because if you're starting to think about trying to extract stuff out of an early stage business chances are you're gonna impair that businesses growth and so my my view is never of that I mean I wanted to start making money right because the first if you count you know two years of Business School where I was where I was working on this idea I went the first that those two years blessed the next three without any pay right so I was five years you know into a no pay environment baseline and that's why I'm saying like but you're like ten years in before you raise the first round I think right yeah we were maybe a little less time a were nine years in don't think by that point like alright if we're doing okay like I could definitely I can definitely work I should have taken money off the table then that was one of the mistakes right because what I focused on instead was hey I want you know to up my up my my salary right and my bonus structure to a point at which I can start making you know a good living on an annual basis but I should have I should have done both right because that that was possible and I chose to just focus on all right let's get my cash comp up to a up to a level that feels right for you know what I've built in the hundred hours a week that I'm working and not worry so much about you know extracting value right now right oh man you're saying you should have it just increase your salary and bonuses not I should have done both is what I said I I did increase my salary and bonus structure I did not pull money out of the business right and that we're gonna stake all were you paying yourself that to where I mean we paying 50 grand a year well I mean no probably more than that by by then but early on yeah I mean should for the first three years I was paying myself nothing then I think I started paying myself 50 grand you know and it just sort of if you if you dollar cost average back you know it would have been a very bad financial decision right on an on an hourly basis but you know you get there and and I make you know a good living today that's that's that's plenty so you know it all evens out but if you dollar cost average the first ten years I probably made fifty grand a year you know which which after 14 years as a Navy SEAL with a Stanford MBA right eight killing it and in Mill Valley where I lived in San Francisco at the time I thought the alley like everyone does eventually or to Marin you know but but yeah I was living in you know living the city paying a mortgage up on Twin Peaks and oh no I'm in Glen Park oh well that's that's where I was I was right behind tower market Austin Park my Glen Park was my my my rake dealer you know the Chenery rest strong I was still down no but that was my rage and I live it down the hill and you know you Glen okay I live in Park I rang Glen Canyon today and I have a house here with like a garage and a gym with my TRX this is awesome man you're cool I appreciate you taking the time what's your preferred method what's your preferred method of chatting with people to Twitter that rainy hat trick ride Instagram Instagram and on Facebook at TRX training is is the brand and TRX training calm is is obviously our website I'm working on a Randy Hetrick calm website right now we're where some of my stuff that you know my next big big vision is to to take a page out of Richard Branson's you know handbook and and basically figure out ways to grow my brand that can help the brand that I gave birth to do things that maybe it can do and vice versa right you ladder yourselves up just like he's done with virgin and the Richard Branson brand that's that's you know sort of a goal that I have maybe you know I'd be wildly fortunate to get to his scale but I could I could be happy with a lot less than that scale as long as I'm still contributing value to with the mothership and it's giving me opportunities to do cool stuff well I I think you you you look you you have the story you have the look you have the charisma Navy SEAL who's fit and also went to Stanford IV yeah [Music]

The entrepreneur life of this mysterious billionaire is interesting. Who is he? He owns a 31 billion-dollar company and has always remained hidden from the public eye. His entrepreneurial lifestyle is elusive and strange. Sam Parr and Shaan Puri talk about Mark Leonard, his successful businesses, and the mystery that surrounds him.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
guys like a satoshi nakamoto of boring businesses so Shawn puts us on here as Billy of the week mark Leonard you wanna we sometimes do this billionaire of the week so the Billy of the week is mark Leonard constellation software so I had heard about this for a few people because they do something that you know we had Andrew Wilkinson on here and he buys internet businesses and sort of has this conglomerate of small internet business that he's collected that are now you know let's call it a hundred million dollars worth or maybe a little more a little less and that's a fantastic success so this guy mark Leonard did that like he's Andrews daddy you know like he his company's worth thirty 1 billion dollars what they do is they buy software companies and they roll them up sort of and they're they try to be a perpetual owner so they're not like they're not private equity where they're doing a leveraged buyout and trying to flip you know kind of skin it and flip it or whatever they tried to just own the thing for a long period of time and had the cash flows and so what I like about this guy what I thought was cool was this guy's like a Satoshi Nakamoto of boring businesses so he nobody knows [ __ ] about this guy you can't find a photo of them wait what's that reference the Bitcoin guy yeah you just don't know a lot about I guess so so this guy you can't find photos of them he doesn't do public appearances he doesn't really talk he writes his annual letter and you know but so I was reading like kind of the definitive thing about him because I wanted to learn and it's like all we know is this guy's born in 1956 maybe in South Africa maybe in England I was like what the [ __ ] we don't even know where this guy's from and you know he's wrote on his bio he's like he was a VC and but before that he said I was a banker evaluator a Mason a gravedigger a dog handler a bouncer a sapper and wind energy researcher I particularly enjoyed the bouncing but an early retirement was necessary so I loved it that I don't know anything about this guy but what we came love and I think half those are like a joke but here's their business so they buy in the early on they buy they bought businesses that were you know two to four million dollar acquisition target so very small acquisition which is which is on paper you would say that's asinine my own yeah tough change you know okay you know a small ball but small balls turn into sort of big league returns and so you know this data is out of date now because when the article I was reading was like hey this guy has you know done really well they did last year they had 1.2 billion in sales 20% margins they're doing 10 to 20 acquisitions a year and at that time the market camp was 5 billion I looked at it while I was reading the article it's now 31 billion and so if you're just invested my guys it they have a thirty 1 billion dollar valuation and only one point to and that was the old one when they were at five billion market cap now they're at thirty 1 billion a market so you know if the ratio sort of held held the same it'd be whatever six seven billion in sales we can see we can see what it is now but I love that this guy's mysterious I love dude it's probably it's only it's three billion their sales were only three billion dollars a lot of money but that's not a got a good little I wonder I wonder why it's going on such the run up because you can see the stock chart it's like you know it's going up like crazy and then they can use that money for for acquisitions and this guy he writes these annual letters that are actually pretty interesting so like if you're like me you I like to read Bezos his annual letter I like to read Warren Buffett's annual letters this guy is a new one I'm adding to the sort of arsenal of annual letters and he has a lots of really interesting sort of views on business and none of which are like totally groundbreaking but he does something that I think most people fail to do which is the same thing Warren Buffett does which is take a very simple principle then everybody would nod their head and agree with and then like actually stick to it and do it for like 40 years and that's like a winning formula most people you know nod their head and then go do some other [ __ ] and they get their lack of discipline and lack of focus and so I also like you know trying to read a little bit more about the company and you know they have sort of a focus on what they call vertical software so they'll go for like within one vertical hour sorry they looked at this and hey some companies are horizontal like a slack every company can use slack as a messaging service and slack will be a multi-billion dollar company but what about all these vertical things that are like better software specifically tailored software for uh you know what if you're a golf club you need to manage bookings T times memberships and whatever else every golf club you will pretty much use whatever the bests off they'll pay for it every month reliably and they'll never churn so they'll buy like that clubhouse software they'll buy healthcare software public transit software law software and that's been their focus I don't know if that's a change over time but when I was reading about them they try to consolidate vertical market software which I thought was a pretty interesting approach what do you think of this guy I love it I'm reading about what you have here so I love doing these things and I love that but what he's doing and I actually I'm gonna bring up a different point and I don't want to address it yeah but I want to ask your opinion of it in a second but more so what I'm interested in is and I I don't want to refer to like things I tweeted that sounds super lame but I was tweeting earlier about how I hired an operator so basically Adam Ryan works at the company and he kind of handles a lot of the operational stuff and I work sometimes down in the weeds sometimes higher vision stuff and it's hard finding someone who's competent to run a business and so if this if this guy if he might have I just say I many companies he has it could be like 200 right so I don't know if they're not or if they keep the existing management or if they replace them I'm not I'm not one percent sure what they do I'm sure there's some some mix and blend there one thing I saw that was interesting was so they like Berkshire Hathaway the execs of the companies do not get share options as their compensation which basically you know incentivizes you just boost the share prices as you as much as you can which is often somewhat short-term so instead they take you know 75% of their after-tax bonus and they can buy shares on the open market and then those shares are held in escrow for four years so if the shares if the stock is overvalued because they are sort of temporarily pumping you know enthusiasm energy or doing buybacks or whatever they're buying overvalued stock and so I don't know if this is perfect because maybe the other thing happens where they actually you know when they're about to buy they sort of you know bad news dips the state share price temporarily they could buy it on the discount so I'm not sure if any incentive system is perfect but I thought it was interesting that they've thought through how should we compensate everybody and and not sort of follow the traditional playbook so I want to dig in more I've only just scratched the surface of this guy I think there's a lot to learn here but I wanted to bring it up because I think it's very interesting and I like that he's a sort of mysterious character I think that adds to it [Music]

what happened you've lost five million dollars yeah which one you see you look at the list tell them which one you wanna do what happened you've lost five million dollars all right I didn't exactly lose $5 but I did not make the five million dollars that I could have made all right so this is called Sean's shitty investments this is a new segment we created just now and I'll tell you about two bad investments in one good investment I made so I was talking to a friend of mine a guy who had been added in advising this guy about his startup this is maybe four five years ago I've been advising him he didn't live in America he was building a product for international his product was around international students applying to US universities and making it easy if you don't know if you live overseas like I finished high school in China so I saw this firsthand if you're in China you're in India you're in Malaysia the goal like your life goal is to go to a u.s. University don't even matter if it's a good one but it's to go to a u.s. University and you know if US universities overcharge for for that and and they get in trouble about - sometimes yeah actually right now there's a bunch stuff in the news because they charge like three times more for it the state is in trouble because they have like 60% Chinese nationals there and they're like right you guys I've charted 60 grand for these kids exactly so so anyways I was helping this guy great founder really like the company was really interested but I was at a point at that time financially where I was like okay if I'm investing in startups it's a pretty irresponsible investment because you know when you invest in startups high likelihood of failure so you need to place like 25-30 bets and so if you say okay I'm gonna place yeah 2530 bets and each bets gonna be 25 grand like I'm basically I need to have five hundred thousand I don't have $750,000 that I'm gonna put into this which means that can't be like your whole net worth which is like well this would that would have been 75771 50 grand at that time would have been more than my whole net worth and so I knew I didn't have the the sort of bankroll to do it but that was an excuse I could have found a way I could have brought the check anyways I could have banked on myself making more in the future like I did and bottom line is I didn't so I would have been the first check into this guy's company and my sort of $25,000 check which I was very very close to writing would have become a five million dollar stake in this guy's business by now wait what's the name of the company say the name and how big is it now I'll just tell you the name will bleep it out so it's called and so he told me that they just crossed it you know the billion dollar valuation and and so I don't know if they're exactly at that onething a little over a little under but the point is they're they're doing well and and so yeah I was kicking myself because that would have been a big investment as happened to me this has happened to me now two different times where I could have I could have been one of the angel checks into a business I thought it was a good business I didn't pull the trigger and those two would have combined to be worth you know ten million dollars plus by now well calm yeah so this company this studying abroad company there do they make a lot of revenue or is it just yeah reading it and even then like this was the reprieve ever knew at the time but I was doing the math and I was like wait like they had an LOI signed by a bunch of universities and I was like wait so if they just match the supply and demand like this things there make money do them enough conviction and it's just a bleach insight no no it's a full software tool that let that actually does the application for the student the universe money oh it's a SAS company it's a free SAS tool for the user and then it's a lead gen on the other side when a kid gets accepted they get paid that way got it and they charge the university's money yeah like thousands of dollars per student so okay so they don't charge the money for the software no the software's used by the actual student and customer so anyways it was a it's a great business big mess on my part happy for the guy though he's an awesome guy and I really I like this guy's energy a lot kind of sometimes you meet people who got could just have good energy I don't know how describe it he was one of those peoples and you know MGM so not again so basically I haven't talked about this on the podcast but I during co vid I decided to mess around with option trading which you know famous last words and so I was literally this is how dumb I am right so so I don't play in the finite by the public markets that much I just do very simple things I just buy companies I think are good for the next 10 years or i buy index funds I don't do a whole I don't do like day trading I don't do their leverage buying or I don't do shorts but I was like you know what I don't see any way that MGM which is MGM Resorts I was like I don't see any way that their business doesn't go down with this coded thing and so I was thinking about it and it got cut by like 75 percent so the stock price dropped from I don't know it was like 25 dropped from 30 down to like 12 and then I was like yeah I still think that this thing is gonna go down and so I'm literally on one tab I have like a Khan Academy video of like what the hell is a put and on the other hand I've got my Robin Hood account and I'm like just pushing buttons and so I pushed a bunch of buttons and I placed this trade which basically said okay I think MGM's gonna go down and yeah about two thousand dollars worth of options and like let's see what happens and it turns out MGM didn't go down but I needed it once I understood my own trade which was like after I placed it cuz I was again just put your buttons when I was looking at the like confirmation I was like this is a horrible trade but I just basically said that this is gonna go down 40% in the next seven days did you lose - grab stupid bet so that's my bad the two bad investment side of waters here on the other side other side I bet really big into Bitcoin and when it dropped to like 4500 recently and now it's back up so that one made back money from for the buy shitty option trading in Spain I I completely stay away from stocks I only buy S&P 500 or Facebook stock and about two weeks ago when it was at the bottom I was like I was like well no when the whole market was real low like the lowest point maybe ten or two weeks ago I sold most everything and I was like I think I think it's just gonna get worse and worse and worse because I'm and unemployment comes out and it's the highest it's ever been and/or the unemployment work claims and then the stock market goes up 20 percent like I just don't understand how I know I don't understand how this works at all because and then I applied for the loan for for Trump enacted and I'm like so you're telling me we get free money that sounds great but you start thinking about it you're like I'm gonna pay for this eventually like somehow I'm there's no such thing as free we're gonna pay for it eventually and so this money it's just this whole situation it doesn't make sense to me because the stock market should be going down yes this is a dead cat bounce or like sort of a false rally but forgetting forgetting the market right now because I don't know about it and who also who cares it's not that interesting it's a speculators game though there's a phrase I learned that I thought was pretty cool it's called a king Xena contest you know to Kenzie and beauty contest is okay so have you ever heard of that sort of economists full names like Maynard John Maynard Keynes or whatever anyways he's famous guy in the world of economics Keynesian economics and a Keynesian Brede beauty contest describes this phenomenon where let's say there's a know what you think the stock market should be is here's an asset here's a company you can buy some of their stock and you buy it if you think that the companies are can have become more valuable than it's priced at today that's what we think should be happening but what's actually happening is this is a speculator market rights a speculation driven market and so you don't in in a short time horizon you don't you're not betting that the company is going to improve and actually generate more revenue and whatnot you're just betting that other people are gonna think this is more attractive but they're also bidding that other people are gonna think you're attractive suits kingsy beauty contest is where you're not actually judging the beauty of it you are thinking what the other judges would think about this thing and they're thinking about what the other jesters think about this thing and it becomes a sort of speculative loop and that's my sort of Wikipedia page of the week that's exactly how things working and it just annoys me so much you have so much more control over your life when you actually run the business right and there's also a great phrase which is sort of in the short-term the stock market is a popular lady contest and in the long term it's a weighing machine and I think that really describes it well right so like is this also for private companies as well and when you're you're raising a Series A in your hyped company it's a popularity contest and what people like how did this valuation that doesn't make any sense like yeah it makes sense if you if you understand that this is currently a popularity contest but over the long haul it does not remain a popularity contest it becomes a weighing machine and if you're full of air and there's nothing there like your value will go down and so for all those people who don't understand those valuations that's why it's frustrating I'm just so I don't I don't do anything in that world because I just know I I don't know anything about it and I don't want to know like it makes me too angry [Music]

hopefully you have done your research hopefully you know what you're in for if you don't know what you're in for my friend will eat your chickens [Music] hey everyone i'm brad i'm the head of continental hustle i'm joined tonight by carolyn dohak one of our uh longest serving and most entertaining writers who does a lot of work for the daily and this week she's got a sunday story for us um welcome to the show caroline thanks for having me brad you bet so um we've written about people who have are baking their own bread and we've written about people who are doing a lot more gardening and lots of do-it-yourself trends and this week caroline has a story about chicken rearing and i wonder caroline you're um in the missouri area where did you find the chicken story for us sure so um i'm a have been a chicken wrangler in the past not at the moment but i was just scrolling facebook one day and a friend who lives out of town had posted that anyone who had panic bought chickens and found them overwhelming was welcome to donate them to her however people needed to know that she already had a full flock of laying hens and any chickens that they donated she was going to slaughter and eat them so that's how you stumble upon the story you realize this is that there's panic buying happening yeah i hadn't heard of that and um i mean urban hens have been popular for a while and and so i looked into it and yeah this has been a thing turns out it is a thing now and there's a there's a whole economy around it and so what is the um what is the business of raising chickens look like both for the consumer and for the businesses as much as you know at this point if you are in the business of selling baby chicks or chicken products this is a great time for you you are seeing compared with last year your sales have increased hundreds of percentages it's awesome if you are someone who has panic purchased chickens hopefully you have done your research hopefully you know what you're in for if you don't know what you're in for my friend will eat your chickens um but the thing is you're not going to break even on your investment and you're not going to have a steady stream of eggs not for a while because your chicks will have to mature but also they go through awkward molting phases and they don't lay in the winter but you do get these amazing eggs like fresh laid eggs and you have these chickens running around your backyard so is it worth the hassle i mean obviously you're gonna explore this a little bit in the story but it doesn't make a lot of money for you but you get these nice eggs i mean personally i think so um the eggs are far superior to what you get at the store the yolks are orange um they just they just stand up in in the pan um there's some research on the omega whatever levels that shows that they're more nutritious um the chickens are fun you know you look out your window and you see these little triangles and they're moving around and they have personalities and um they're very and that's really fun and uh your neighbors will like you a lot more i have found i was concerned when i first got into it that they would not but they like it and if you share with them you become very popular exactly share some eggs you've had some uh it sounds like some entertaining battles in your yard with chickens tell us about like your favorite story about one of your chickens and what some of the names are oh sure so um my husband is an early 90s hip hop aficionado and so a lot of our chickens have hip hop or rnb inspired names and we got our first batch um we got six of them and little kim died of unnatural causes we're not sure what um lp was killed by a raccoon which was very messy so we got two new ones to replace them um mary j blige and pharrell and it was the girl who was on the like just the very lowest point in the pecking order she was very insecure and she started pecking the new girls like in the neck and she actually packed a hole in mary j blige's neck and the thing is you don't you don't want that because if they get a taste for one another's flesh they will cannibalize it's very gross so your choices there are you can clip their beaks which i'm not into you can kill the chicken which i'm not into or you can get these things called penless peepers so they're bot they're blinders but they look like kanye west sunglasses right and they they fit into the nostrils on the top of the beak it's completely humane and um they keep the chicken from seeing straight ahead so she can't attack but she can still see well enough that she can pack and scratch and bite so um salt and pepper had to wear these for a while while they um got used to pharrell and mary j blige and it took a little while and they got over it but that was that was a thing for a while that's fantastic i i can't wait to read your story there's so much more to hear about the chicken business how you raise them how lovely they can be and then also there are some very troubling things which you will talk about in the story i'm not gonna let you tell tell everyone now but uh make sure you open the email on sunday you will love caroline doheck's first sunday story and thanks for tuning in everyone thank you so much

guys like a satoshi nakamoto of boring businesses so cool um what's up how are you man oh yeah your video went blank for a second I'm great um I upgraded my internet hopefully it looks better called Comcast now paid 60 bucks a month and just called them and with a click of a button I paid them more money and my internet was supposed to improve we'll see if it happens like mad great great business to be in I'm excited to talk to you I feel like it's been a little while I got a bunch of random topics to talk about I don't know how about you do you have anything that was top of mind for you yeah well I know about all this stuff that you or a lot of the stuff that you have in here right like I know it to the point of I wasn't sure if I wrote it or you wrote it that's for the best ok great ok so I'm gonna start with let's pick one that's that's interesting okay so how about how about we start with this one so somebody was somebody tweeted this and I saw it and I was like this is pretty smart so a lot of people right now we're talking about coronavirus how does the world gonna change and lots of speculation I think everybody sort of agrees ok handshakes you know might go out the window for a bit live sports you know it's gonna be a little tough so there's there's some things that we know we're gonna change and there's some things that you can't really predict they're sort of second order effects and so somebody reached out and they have put together this they had like a group of people had put together this thing called a second order effects of coke kovin I thought it was great I'm gonna find the PDF and I'm gonna link it in the description here I know one of the creators was this guy that I've met one time super super smart guy he created are you a Harry Potter fan no but I know I mean I'm not not a fan but I don't buy the stuff seem to move so he created this site back in the day called muggle net which was oh yeah I know that guy he also created a oh my god pop or what was it he's a viral convey about what's not a ng pop but he's yeah yeah yeah I know all about him tell me his name I'm trying to find out I can't believe I forgot it every wife know some sparks so they start of sports media yeah and yeah yeah I know I know about him well I think his business is the one you're thinking about that's right so he started a chain of viral websites and they got really popular but like everything in that era I bet it just crapped like and but if I met this guy once and I was like oh my god if I could just bet on this guy's like lifetime earnings I would bet right away like this guy's really really sharp yeah he's he's kind of like a little genius yeah I like when you say because it means like kind of hard to talk to like he's a little GGC but when I read about him like dude why are you doing these viral sites like you'd do anything yeah and I bet he will I bet he's gonna be one of those people that transitions from like yeah I first created these you know the Harry Potter fan site that would be him number one then I created this viral Twitter account and these viral mean websites oh and then I like solve climate change like that's what this guy's career should look like right all goes well he's cool so he anyway what about him in a group of people created this thing that was like second-order effects they were basically like okay you know for example what's a second-order effect so everyone knows a first-order effect is coronavirus they you know is is wild first-order effect you shelter-in-place okay but the second-order effect of that is like our people can have more babies our divorce is gonna go up because you're at home is grocery delivery gonna take off because of that and then there's a good third order effect okay if the grocery delivery takes off they need to Hut you know instacart hiring hundreds of thousands of delivery people okay what happens when all those people go to that job now they need a healthcare system for a gig worker becomes more important so there's like these these knock-on effects and so for a business person you want to think about okay oftentimes the biggest impact - the biggest opportunities are in the second and third order effects because you can start doing work now and then as this plays out those things those markets are growing rapidly but you can kind of predict them so a classic example of this was you probably know this better than I do there's some story like the highway system was built for for something like it was built for I don't know what it was like military purposes or something like that but the second-order effect was that like Walmart basically it was like oh people are gonna exit and want to get you know buy stuff get little you know get food get drinks blah so the whole retailers got fast there yeah cars get faster the retail system takes because now there's a highway interconnect system blah blah blah so there's a second-order effects so one of them that I just thought was kind of interesting was this idea of drive-thru and drive-in so now that you know movie theaters are like short of going bankrupt because all their chairs are so close to each other that people like people are going to go back to the movies movies are already kind of struggling and this might be the knockout blow and so people are talking about drive-in theaters is that gonna be a thing I could see it I could see you know sort of rising on top of that you have drive-through so how do you use or minimize contact well drive-through caffeine so there's some coffee shops that are like the photos I saw on Twitter you know the line is out the door I've never seen a line this long except for chick-fil-a and so like what's this for and it's basically just drive-through caffeine and so I'm pretty bullish on this if somebody was you know right now they had like nine franchises but they were doing well and they were a drive-through coffee concept I would you know be very very bullish on this thing expanding and going from nine to 200 locations over the next two years because I think the need for this is gonna go up what do you think about that okay so what do I think do I first of all are people gonna change their behavior forever let's let's talk about that right like are shaking hands got to go away um certainly now like I don't want to do a lot of that stuff but is that going to change your behavior forever I don't know um what's it what's in an out like what can we compare this to like World War two I mean September 11th like when I see when I hear low planes I get scared so like no no no TSA clearance right so like you used to be able to just walk into an airport take a ticket that didn't even have your name on it and board any plane and it took you five minutes to get from the you know check-in desk to to the gate and now it's like yes you know security buffer in an hour you have to have your ID it's gotta have your name on it if your name sounds a little sketchy hope you're gonna come to this special room and get checked that the world changed forever from that sure but we're also talking so the September 11th was definitely like a lot of like force change like TSA but then what we're discussing is like unforced when you and I see each other are we gonna hug are we gonna high-five or we got a are we gonna bow like you know it's like yeah so like how far away are we gonna say so I would imagine that some of these consumer behaviors are a little bit more analogous analogous right to that I don't know man um will we change I think so I think that at least for three years something is gonna change the question is what's gonna change and how long is it gonna change or is it gonna be sort of a temporary precaution that goes away well so look you how long did you live in China for two years maybe not long enough to maybe maybe long enough to when when they went through they've had not I don't know if they've had pandemics but they've had a variety of outbreaks of things like this has their behavior yeah like the masks is a great example so like masks quite common in Asia to be you know something you just generally wear out and nobody even bats eye or seasonally like when it's flu season yeah everyone masked up I'm not trying to get the flu and you know you don't see that here but will you maybe you will I got I would I would expect I did I go to crowded movie theaters they do yeah there's crowds everywhere in China you I can't avoid a crowd but you know yeah like a billion people in a small city so it's very you know there's crowds everywhere in China but people do behave quite differently than they do here gloves you know gloves are very sort of common there that that people here don't wear gloves just on the day to day life right so yes I do agree I think things gonna change I think specifically big cities are gonna I mean I'm biased because it's directly impacts me I think cities are gonna our cities are different right I do think that work is going to be different we we're getting rid of our office yeah exactly so you know there's all these sort of second order third order effects example of a second order effect of the TSA so first order effect is TSA second order effect is people selling toothpaste in three ounce bottles because that's what you need now to get through that all right that became a market whatever before who wants this tiny little bottle and so you know from I'm just trying to keep it from a business perspective because you know from a medical scientific and cultural perspective you know don't listen to me with some other people but from this perspective I think that there are it is worth you know taking a pen go into a whiteboard and starting to map out okay if this then that and then if that then what and the what is where your business opportunity lies and if you're looking for that it's just a good way to guess and check even if you're not gonna go do those things the only way to get your gut to be good is to predict a bunch of times and be wrong or right and we'll go revisit those and so I often do this role predicting also let's talk about some talk about some of these predictions here I pulled it up so some of these predictions here are so gyms are gonna go away or significantly go away and which means innovation and home exercise obviously that's like at the dock that's not real quick that's like just yeah that's I mean that's not even a question right well I don't think gyms are gonna go away necessarily but yeah people are going to whatever the home exercise market was versus gyms it's gonna eat more share are you exercising at home yeah but it's you know I exercise at home as much as I do at the gym which is like weak on both fronts have you oh that's interesting funerals I don't know cities will become less popular that's one of his predictions suburbs and rural become more popular like oh girl we came out today and was like you know camping and RVing is gonna go on the rise because people still want to travel but they're not gonna want to travel you know in dense areas staying and you know maybe maybe staying in hotels or uncleaned Airbnb news yeah I just rented an RV so I'm gonna do a three week cross-country trip for my birthday in June so uh yeah I'm I love that I completely agree I've never understood that the first place anyway Americans are kind of interesting whenever they like want to do a gap year or like travel for a honeymoon or ever they always want to go outside my country I'm like dog like let's you should explore here it's way easier and we have everything that's what's interesting about America is nobody up every time I think we're the only country that has every geography or every climate so anyway another thing that he talked about is virtual tours and virtual museums so on trends we had talked about a company that was crushing it with virtual museums and we also talked about a company that was doing a blow as they called the VR thing and I remember the name of it but I know what you're talking about sandy our or is that was it sandbox and I yeah so I I think it's great you're struggling with this right because sandbox er you have to go to a physical place where headset that somebody else wore an hour before and you know this in person and and they place their locations in malls and they're supposed to be foot traffic from the malls so foot traffic is dead nobody wants to wear a device that somebody else just wore and you know in general this is like sort of a fringe behavior anyways and so I talked to yeah I heard from them that you know they had to be really conscious about how they're gonna do this I think they did some layoffs and whatnot but they you know they have to figure out how are we gonna survive and what does the new world look like and so unfortunately some great ideas and great businesses you know some markets got punted back a year or two four years of whatever it is and some markets got pulled forward like it's my friend Chris from first base and they do remote work set up so you you know everybody now at home but this wasn't the case when I started advising him when I started advising it was like hey I think companies are going to be going remote more and if you have a remote employee they need a desk and a chair and they need a webcam and they need a microphone so they can work effectively remotely maybe companies will pay to give them a home desk and I was like I don't know maybe they'll pay maybe they wall and then boom this thing happened and like his wait list has exploded thousands of companies signing up and he can't handle the demand and now every company has to have a person like you know at the head of HR or whatever that is planning how are we gonna have so many employees remote and also hey this is extra this remote thing actually kind of works why are we paying so much for our office let's just do this this is way cheaper and so you know the world has changed for him then his market got accelerated by four years yeah I that's incredibly fascinating I what I think we should do is we should just link to this this document is dance there's no way that we can yeah but I think it's cool I think it's cool that so do this and that they just published it as a Google Doc that anybody can access I think that's just like a cool way of going about things and also one that I like on here one more that I like is Church so like you know Church was one of the super spreader type of places where everybody congregates people often hug or shake hands or touch and it can spread throughout a community rapidly if you if you have churches open and so how are people gonna do this right history can go away no are people gonna go in 6 feet 6 feet apart maybe I don't know and so I'm of the opinion that Church like live streaming for churches is going to be a very big deal I've been in the live sharing space for wild so maybe it's one of those situations where you know to a hammer everything's a nail and for me everything can be live-streamed but no I you know right Church is one of those things that's every Sunday so people can build a habit and you know the experience of a livestream sermon it's pretty much just as good as being there it's not that much worse in fact in many ways the more convenient and you have all the sort of community features like chat or donations I mean that's like what the twitch product is for example and I researched and there's a platform called Church online now or something like that Church online platform so some horrible name like that Anoop like a pastor who weren't programming in his spare time and like you know sat in the pews and and coded this thing up like it is so you know unbranded it backwards in a way but he said they have 7 million members or something crazy and you know I guarantee that's not the best thing that's out there so for me you know digital faith is a big thing whether that's sort of like a next door for churches I don't know what that means but it sounds provocative I like it is it is it twitch for churches is it you know what is it and so I would be if I was if that meant something to me if religion meant something to me I'd be like now is my time I need to combine technology with community building and religion and I need to bring these these real world institutions online I I'm very good to see what happens with all that stuff um speaking of this Korona stuff you have on our sheet that you want to talk about outdoorsy I would love that as well I don't really know [ __ ] about it I just put it on there because I'm like interesting and I didn't do any research so you tell me about it okay let me uh the good thing about us doing this remotely is my computers right in front of us okay so outdoorsy it's a it's a peer-to-peer market but this is the exact description peer-to-peer marketplace to disrupt the thirty two billion dollar recreational vehicle industry okay so they've raised seventy five million dollars they've raised a lot of money this what you notice to rent your or see clearly you said you just rented RP no because I I think I'm gonna drive from San Francisco to New York and then maybe fly back I have to I have to figure it out I technically haven't rent it I have a lot of outgoing quote so I've got people are gonna be sending me back quote so I think for outdoorsy it's kind of like Airbnb where you submit it sometimes you gotta get approved and so anyway outdoors he's interesting if you want to learn about this industry there's actually um what's that guy's name who's on that TV show called profit Marcus Marcus something yeah mark is the profit I've watched like eight episodes Leonys yeah or no Lamanna something like that well anyway a lot of people don't know this but Marcus is actually I don't know if he's the founder I think he like aggregate a budget or brought a bunch of companies together so he's the CEO and chairman of Camping World Good Sam enterprises Gander outdoors and the house board shop basically all of this or is around RV and camping and you can actually go and read about this company and a lot of their information is public so you can kind of see huge business many many hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue maybe even hundreds of millions of dollars in income and so what outdoorsy is doing is baking is basically kind of screwing up that model and I love it I don't know right do you know what the revenue is um I don't know outdoors use revenue I think it's quite high if I remember correctly it's over 100 million let me just do a quick check let's see yeah we hundred twenty five million in 2019 Jesus Christ okay it's meant there's a difference between revenue and is that their revenue or the growth bookings that might be there GE let's assume for a second is there G MV because marketplaces love to do that so let's say you you take 10% of that exactly 32 million is there cake maybe yeah so they're just exploding right now eh yeah this is I mean this is a great business and you know we talked about before hey market places are great what are the fringe or niche market places and this is one of them right renting RVs you know and now now is the time and so they're you know I think they're gonna ride a wave of interest as people sort of crave being outdoors crave travel but need to be away from others how about hit camp are you familiar with head camp yeah they're like the same idea right there like a turnkey glamping is that right camping camping experiences camping in the way that I don't do it where I'm like alright do I want to learn how to camp and like go get at REI membership and buy like hundreds of dollars of stuff and then be like wet all night like now I'm not into that but this is like hey you know sleeping this instagram-worthy tent is what I remember of it yeah it can be as easy as that or it can be as difficult or you can make it as difficult soft or hard as you want right yeah so you could just like go and rent like a cabin which isn't probably camping but or you could just like get a plotter like an area and like land and apparently they're booming as well so they've raised about 50 million dollars and what's interesting is if you told me about hip hip camp about two years ago I'd be like this is not interesting but it is kind of interesting and there's a I don't know if this is a company but okay so like I am like I'm like a a habit I keep referring to this type of stuff but I what I always like to do is I like to look at comparables and I like to look at public information so do you know what koa is never heard of it okay so koa I don't know what it stands for actually but what it is is it's a it's a it's a non-profit and they have campgrounds throughout the country and if you go to like in Colorado they're all over the place you'll be on the highway and you'll see in the same place you see signs for food you'll see a koa sign and what that means is if you're a member you can for I think it's like $20 a years super cheap you can camp there either for free or for 5 bucks a night right it's really cheap and I used to use it all the time when I was traveling and so according to some analysts sir I think the privately-owned they're not nonprofit they do about 40 million dollars a year in sales and they charge like five bucks right it's like dirt cheap and so if you want to learn about that business look up koa that's probably the best comparable it's a I can't believe Sean you've never heard of koa never like okay now it looks great seems like an obvious idea fantastic but the what's interesting to me what I love doing is I love looking at these older things like koa like Boy Scouts and it's like show me the demand and that kind of gives me an idea and then if you just like add add-ons and operate it in a in a way where you prioritize revenue and profit then things get super interesting and so koa is a really cool one to look at it's yeah it's it's it's it's an interesting group and I also think that in terms of RV I would look at a Marcus Leona Leo mice's companies right and you can allow that information is out there I love it I love hearing about businesses that I've never heard of that are successful I feel like there's a my brain I feel like is organized like there's a set of hangers and every hanger I can just hang another like business or business model onto and then that's just mapped in my brain and then when I see something new I'm like oh is this a new hanger or do I just attach this to one that already exists and I start to see a pattern of like oh yeah there's five things that are just like this and so that's what I see when I love hearing about new things just another thing to hang into my brain have you um updated your home at all while you've been at your house I had built a home office right before Kovac because I was planning to work remotely anyways for the month of March which has happened to be like kovat so that's been like the only home upgrade and then [ __ ] started breaking my dishwasher broke and my dryer broke cuz I'm like that's not an upgrade yeah that's it I started go to the park every single day and I bought these little like tiny fold-out Park chairs and I have actually seen several friends buying this same product called click CLI Q it's a it's like you know whatever a park chair like you go to a soccer game you want to you just want to unfold but the key is how small and discreet can you make the the fold in versus like oh [ __ ] I'm carrying a chair all the way to the park and I don't know it's gonna arrive soon but I've seen like I've seen three different people I know mention this thing and I bought it myself too before that I have began spending so I I think I'm saving like Matt I haven't I actually ever since the the stock market crash I have refused to log into my accounts everything right yeah I sold though so like my philosophy was I was like man there's gonna be like dead bodies in the streets of New York and that's gonna scare Wall Street and that someone's gonna take a picture of like a body and in the like a in the like an open van with bodies and it's gonna flip people out and they're gonna like say so so so and that happened there was like videos or like these like ice trucks with like bodies in there and nothing happened and that day I saw that picture I was like I'm out right and it took off a week after and so I'm still sitting on a lot of cash and I've lost a lot of money and I hope well I don't hope this proven right if it goes down and I yeah if it goes down and I get back in so anyway I haven't logged in I usually use I use personal capital and I log in all the time to check my finances I've not logged in so I don't entirely know what's going on but I the other day I went and bought like eight or maybe $1,000 worth of artwork because I'm like I haven't bought anything in forever I'm just gonna buy exactly I want because I'm normally pretty cheap and I just haven't been buying [ __ ] have you been buying like crazy dude because I shop online and now I lost track of like time and space so I'm just buying things and then there's stuff arriving and it's like if you can't go anywhere the next most interesting thing is like someone comes at your door and leaves a mystery box at the front you're like oh [ __ ] what did I order nine days ago I don't know I'm excited to go see what it is it's like this moment of fun so I keep giving myself that gift but yeah buying a lot of stuff also all the delivery stuff is like super expensive so I'm like post and insta carding and it's like you know $400 for groceries or something crazy so I don't know if that's just an SF thing or I don't know what's going on can we alright I want to talk about this mark Leonard guy who you have but before we get to that have a good segue which is I I'm gonna get rid of these map I have okay so little people listening I have a background and I got maps and which apparently is like a super basic thing to do I didn't know that yeah it's like basic with the capital B st. Louis Nashville or no st. Louis New York San Francisco me my wife are from those areas and I'm gonna switch it up so I have a a wall of people who I like being inspired by so yeah so let me tell you who I have I have Steve Prefontaine you know who that is ever heard of who's that there's a movie about him that's really great you don't to be a runner to like it but he was a he was a runner at Oregon he was the first person to wear Nike so Bill Bowerman was the coach of Oregon tracker filled his pupil his his athlete was Phil Knight together they partnered and made shoes together Steve Prefontaine was probably the first person at Wharram he was or one of and he was definitely the first sponsored athlete and he was kind of a badass runner where he was like he was like kind of like a full clip so he would say [ __ ] like to give anything less than your best as a sacrifice your gift he said all this inspiration stuff but he died when he was 20 26 and he was just kind of a rebel too cause then I have we hold on behind anyway he was drinking and driving and flipped over and crashed his car and suffocated okay so pretty try very very tragic but he lived fast died young and he it was real tragic because he got fourth at the Olympics when he was a favorite even though he was only 23 anyway it was a big deal he's also like really good-looking so it's like easy to like admire him props to you for admitting that that's part of the appeal all right great yeah he's like it's like you know romantic kind of that type of thing like you kind of look good that I have eazy-e in dr. Dre okay they're interesting to me because when eazy-e was only 23 24 25 something like that he created ruthless records which went on to become a huge business like hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales and he was like a kid from Compton who knew nothing didn't deserve to be there or did you know like on paper like what do you here anyway they achieved it dr. Dre [ __ ] changed culture in in a variety of ways then I have Felix Dennis and Ted Turner Ted Turner started a CNN I like him Felix Dennis he started a media company and he was like Richard Branson but more vulgar google him and then I have got three more I've got Mike Tyson I love Mike Tyson he screwed up so many times in his life he's done a good job of being ferocious and kind of coming back and then I've got to Pok and then I think that's it that's amazing great oh maybe yes maybe all right so you have live love Nate yeah you have like the Intimidators road dude like it's a the majority of your people fight for a living or like should fight not Intimidators rope but I'm incredibly fascinated with people who are bald people who on paper should have done nothing and they did a really good at having bald ideas but then also we're having fun along the way right so that's what I like like Ted Turner I think you know he was a southerner he stick out and but he had a bold idea and he laughed along the way so I'm always fascinated by that I went to sue Lee's house where our friend silly and he had this on his walls like I was like who are these people but why these pictures there's not your family and I was like because if the first one I saw was Hillary Clinton I was like why do you configure Clinton on your wall he's like oh these are people I admire and he had seven photos and I only knew like three of the people told me the other before in a story and it was like Hillary I don't I was like whoever you know Malcolm X or Martin Luther King or something like that another cool idea it was like you know I guess that's cool like you know you walk out of your bedroom every day and you go to your office or wherever you're going what does he admire about Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton sue Lee don't see me like Anton I have no idea why you just think she's also said am i right okay I guess I mean not even get say like that she's not awesome but I didn't think that she was wonderful enough that exactly what I'm indeed entrepreneur I was like I don't want to sit here and hate on Hillary I don't hate Hillary but I am so surprised she made it to your wall like that doesn't make any sense I definitely disagree with that one yeah so yeah it's just like mediocre maybe so let's talk about this guy constellation so I know a bit about them Shawn put this on here as Billy of the week his name's mark Leonard you wanna we sometimes do this billionaire of the week so the Billy of the week is mark Leonard constellation software so I had heard about this from a few people because they do something that you know we had Andrew Wilkinson on here and he buys internet businesses and sort of has this conglomerate of small internet business that he's collected that are now you know let's call it a hundred million dollars worth or maybe a little more a little less and that's a fantastic success so this guy mark Leonard did that like he's Andrews daddy you know like his company's worth thirty 1 billion dollars what they do is they buy software companies and they roll them up sort of and they're they try to be a perpetual owner so they're not like they're not private equity where they're doing a leveraged buyout and trying to flip you know kind of skin it and flip it or whatever they tried to just own the thing for a long period of time and had the cash flows and so what I like about this guy what I thought was cool was this guy's like a Satoshi Nakamoto of boring businesses so he nobody knows [ __ ] about this guy you can't find a photo wait what's that reference the Bitcoin guy yeah you just don't know a lot about I guess so so this guy you can't find photos of them he doesn't do public appearances he doesn't really talk he writes his annual letter and you know but so I was reading like kind of the definitive thing about him because I wanted to learn and it's like all we know is this guy's born in 1956 maybe in South Africa maybe in England I was like what the [ __ ] we don't even know where this guy's from and you know he's wrote on his bio he's like it was a VC but before that he said I was a banker evaluator a Mason a gravedigger a dog handler a bouncer a sapper and and wind energy researcher I particularly enjoyed the bouncing but an early retirement was necessary so I love it that I don't know anything about this guy but we came and I think half those are like a joke but here's their business so they buy in the early on they buy they bought businesses that were you know two to four million dollar acquisition target so very small acquisition which is which is on paper you would say that's asinine my own yeah chump change you know okay well you know small ball but small ball is turn into sort of big league returns and so you know this data is out of date now because when the article I was reading was like hey this guy has you know done really well they did last year they had 1.2 billion in sales 20% margins they're doing 10 to 20 acquisitions a year and at that time the market camp was 5 billion I looked at it while I was reading the article it's now 31 billion and so if you're just invested in ok guys it they have a thirty 1 billion dollar valuation and only 1.2 and that was the old one when they were at five billion market cap now they're at 31 billion market cap so you know if the ratio sort of held held the same it'd be whatever six seven billion in sales we can see we can see what it is now but I love that this guy's mysterious I love dude it's only it's only it's three billion their sales were only three billion dollars so a lot of money but that's not a got a good little I wonder I wonder why doing on such the run up because you can see the stock chart is like you know it's going up like crazy and then they can use that money for for acquisitions and this guy he writes these annual letters that are actually pretty interesting so like if you're like me you I like to read Bezos his annual letter I like to read Warren Buffett's annual letters this guy is a new one I'm adding to the sort of arsenal of annual letters and he has a lots of really interesting sort of views on business and then of which are like totally groundbreaking but he does something that I think most people fail to do which is the same thing Warren Buffett does which is take a very simple principle that everybody would nod their head and agree with and then like actually stick to it and do it for like 40 years and that's like a winning formula most people you know nod their head and then go do some other [ __ ] and they get there under lack of discipline than lack of focus and so I also like you know trying to read a little bit more about the company and you know they have sort of a focus on what they call vertical software so they'll go for like within one vertical are sorry they looked at they said hey some companies are horizontal like a slack every company can use slack as a messaging service and slack will be a multi-billion dollar company but what about all these vertical things that are like better software specifically tailored software for uh you know what if you're a golf club you need to manage bookings T times memberships and whatever else every golf club you will pretty much use whatever the best software is and they'll pay for it everybody every month reliable you'll never churn so they'll buy like that Clubhouse software they'll buy healthcare software public transit software law software and that's been their focus I don't know if that's change over time but when I was reading about them they try to consolidate vertical market software which I thought was a pretty interesting approach what do you think of this guy I love it I'm reading about what you have here so I love doing these things and I love that what he's doing and I actually I'm gonna bring up a different point and I don't want to address it yet but I want to ask your opinion of it in a second but more so what I'm interested in is tonight I don't want to refer to like things I tweeted that sounds super lame but I was tweeting earlier about how I hired an operator so basically Adam Ryan works at the company and he kind of handles a lot of the operational stuff and I work sometimes down in the weeds sometimes high up revisions up and it's hard finding someone who's competent to run a business and so if this if this guy it's if he might have I would just say I'm in companies he has it could be like 200 right so I don't know if their model is really keep the existing management or if they replace them I'm not I'm not one percent sure what they do I'm sure there's some some mix and blend there one thing I saw that was interesting was so they like Berkshire Hathaway the execs of the companies do not get share options as their compensation which basically you know incentivizes you just boost the share prices as you as much as you can which is often somewhat short-term so instead they take you know 75% of their after-tax bonus and they can buy shares on the open market and then those shares are held in escrow for four years so if the shares if the stock is overvalued because they are sort of temporarily pumping you know enthusiasm energy or doing buybacks or whatever they're buying overvalued stock and so I don't know if this is perfect cuz maybe the other thing happens where they actually you know when they're about to buy they sort of oh you know bad news dips the state share price temporarily they could buy it on the discount so I'm not sure if any incentive system is perfect but I thought it was interesting that they've thought through how should we compensate everybody and and not sort of follow the traditional playbook so I want to dig in more I've just scratched the surface of this guy I think there's a lot to learn here but I wanted to bring it up because I think it's very interesting and I like that he's a sort of mysterious character I think that adds to it so here's an interesting take away and in this what I'm about to say actually kind of changed my business game and I'm gonna name-drop here but when Tim Ferriss invested in us he told me he goes one thing that I've learned from I don't know who we learned it from but he goes there's this thing that I like to use called um did he I think he called it inverse incentives or but basically the idea is if you when you incentivize employees to do something you need to actually have an opposite incentive that makes sure it's balanced so for example if you're gonna tell your sales team you have a quota of this number and it's huge you also have to have an incentive it's kind of like revenue collections which means you only go after quality people who can pay bills or RAM retention which is you only get paid if you sell people and you're you treat them well and they want to come back to basically and so yeah a counter incentives I think that's what they called it uh and that actually changed the game for me a lot because what I've noticed is with people if you give driven people incentives the right type of person will kill to get that done and you want those input you you want those people but you actually really need like that second incentive in order to make sure that it's quality and quantity and so I love this incentive but what I want to know is how on earth did they recruit all these people who are talented enough to run a business I've hired CEOs for a handful of small businesses that I've had most all except for one or two have been horrible yeah and which maybe I'm hiring but I think it was also it's really hard to find these types of people and so in my mind this company constellation they're more like a recruiting company than an innovative software company yeah you know I think that is sort of the make-or-break I think you also invested in in our friends who are doing enduring ventures and so these guys are basically starting a modern-day version of constellation or what Andrew is doing or whatever where they're flying companies to hold forever that have strong cash flows and they want to own great businesses and you know they've already closed they bought the first business they bought was a business up Council ironically I believe this was sort of outside the model which is you know my point earlier of say a simple thing nod your head and agree and then go [ __ ] do it I think that they did not do that with up council because up council was not a great business it was a it's a potentially great business but it was currently sort of in a rotten rocky waters but they got that it's such a great deal and they structured the deal in such a smart way that I think they'll still end up making a lot of money from it but anyways you know they're doing the same same sort of thing and their biggest challenges is is how do you find operators so when they bought up council you know the CEO that they placed was you know you know somebody the Savior had worked with and knew knew very very well anyway they brought in a team of operators but you know they're pulling from their personal networks that's what Andrew said he did as well which was he pulled from people he knew or you had worked with before in the past but I think that is the the largest challenge with this business model is being able to maintain a keep a great business a great business by having good operators in place because when you buy out the owner sometimes you may lose that great operations and if this interests you I think that there's a few giants that you can look up and one of them is AltaVista or Navi so that's a not that visa equity it's owned by this guy named Robert Moore I believe he's the richest black man in America he is the guy who's famous for what he's well he's the guy who's famous for paying the tuition of everyone at Morehouse when he gave a an address he said by the way all your guys does debt paid off so he's he's cool but that's what he does he does the same thing as does trilogy software so look up Joe Lamont who we've talked about all right you want to talk about oh here's what I'm gonna talk about ok so there's these companies like Tesla and basically a lot of stuff that Elon does which is like this like super sexy stuff I mean I'm not interested in in it but it is quite sexy to say you're gonna send a you're gonna go to Mars or you're creating these cars that are neat and fun and that whenever I think about these companies they're like the coolest companies where you create a hype video at the end of the year and you see everything they've done and you're like oh my god that's so sick like when they created like a video of Elon celebrating the one of his rockets taking off I was like and so anyway constellations not that he doesn't do a video of him like looking at his golf club software right and it's pretty boring but it's still fascinating because like a fun puzzle how do you Shawn about like where are your aspirations like do you say like I want to do something that's full of excitement or do you find excitement in the boring so I used to be a pretty hardcore about this where I was like dude the only thing worth doing like if I'm gonna spend my time and I used to be really like dismissive of people who were wasting their time doing things that were not sort of the peak of the peak so I was like okay I'm gonna do why would I do a job when I can own my own business then I was like why would I own a small business when I can own a big business they're both gonna take up all my energy my time and as I can I'm gonna do a big business why would I do a boring thing might as well do an exciting thing and that train of logic made sense to me and I did that so at Monkey inferno it was we are here to try to create the next hit consumer thing we're like we don't give a [ __ ] that that's low odds of success we want to create you know Michael had created Bebo and which was like sort of like almost Facebook yeah it's like come with in sort of inches of creating a Facebook but instead ended up in the myspace pile and you know did well financially but he didn't change culture and so we were like dude we can do this we could change culture and so we tried every you know messaging apps live-streaming we tried all these different consumer things and failed like crazy and you know even things that like kind of worked they ultimately were not successful because there was they were so homerun driven they were grand-slam driven so I backed off that and I backed off that maybe because I'm just burnt dude I just want to get wins like I don't need to change culture like I didn't need to change my bank account and my lifestyle like so I don't know to what extent I'm it's it's like I can frame it either way am i more mature because I'm like look I don't I have I'm not as attracted to the sexiness of it I just want to build you know great things great businesses or am I just fearful and burnt out from failure it's hard to say for me right but my view definitely has changed where now I'm like oh that you on path I don't know that sounds like a lot of effort why don't I just do this simple thing that's gonna like work yeah and part of me is like okay I agree and I agree and I am the same and then the other part is like yeah dude but you're just kind of being like a puss like what would the twelve-year-old in you like think is awesome and every once in a while you gotta listen to that and so I don't know how I feel like because the other day I was thinking about making a purchase and I I sound like a like a kind of entitled rich dude right now which I'm not implying I am either of those things but I was gonna buy like a car like a cool car and it wasn't expensive it was like a ten thousand dollar car and it was not practical and I was like weighing the like pros and cons of it and then I was like yeah but here's this Pro which is like this is fun and cool and I want it right right and I'm like what did I could become such an old man like where I'm not just doing [ __ ] just because it's exciting and I do think that like you we have to give in to those urges a little bit more you laundries anyway about this I think on was but he was I was talking about he was like yeah like Warren Buffett like he's like I'm not a huge fan of the guy not the biggest fan but he didn't say he disliked him but he was like you know what he does he's a capital allocator like he spends his time trying to figure out do I buy dope whirring today he's like yeah he's like put ten billion dollars into Pepsi or coke he's like yeah like that's boring to me like I want to change the world and you know I'm gonna make cars electric so we don't have to depend on fossil fuels and I'm gonna get us to Mars so we're interplanetary species and I'm gonna do neural link so that our brain can control you know you know a brain can download information and upload information like we're a computer in the brain and I'm gonna do boring company cuz I [ __ ] hate traffic and I want to get you know from place to place and you know fifteen minutes rather than two hours and I'm like okay you know respect like when you hear that you're like yeah that does seem like the maximum of winning but you know I guess my view is my views have broadened but I'm like you wear when I hear myself say it I'm like don't be a [ __ ] dude just like come on go for it don't do what you would do at the beginning you know like don't don't lose that sort of dream just because of practicality so I'm a fan of motorsports and motorcycles and I like like some of these adrenaline stuff I like old Porsches and all these exciting things and I see these guys on YouTube like ken black and he's got this like compound or I'll see like travis Pastrana and he's got this compound it's just like grown-up playground and I'm like oh one day that would be cool and then I'm like no no no no now like why why can't I just do that [ __ ] now and I so I constantly have to battle that in my head and so it sounds like yeah it is about I have what's prudent like prudent versus like excitement and the balance between the two okay let's let's leave with one or two little ideas real quick all right so I have one idea so are you familiar with kin duo duo okay no this is one of the largest companies in China I think like a 30 billion dollar company that grew in the last four years or so all those numbers could be wrong but you get the idea big-ass Chinese company so what the hell is pin do it do it pin do is like Groupon but it's with your friends so what happens is you go on pin do a duo and there's like an item the number one selling item tissue boxes number two selling item is like a vacuum or some [ __ ] but it'll be like tissue boxes here's these two boxes you can get them for let's say you know $20 you can get these tissue boxes but if you buy with your friends you can all get them for eight and it's like create a team to buy and so you see the item you want you create a team the way you create a team is it just gives you a link and you share that link through WeChat or whatever your messaging apps are and if your friends are like yeah cool I'll join the group I'll buy an eight like I'll pitch I will contribute to the cause helping you get a lower price and I get a lower price too there's these team buys basically so this thing has become really really popular in China and I don't think it's become popular really anywhere else I know there's a couple of companies trying to do this in India as well and like you know God knows Indians love a good discount so I do think this will work in India as well but I was thinking about this so I was like okay you know if I was an entrepreneur you know just sitting on my you know my desk and there was nothing on my desk I would just write the word pen duo duo for X and I would just figure out what the hell X is I would spend a day on that brainstorm and so so bright I love it can I give you sure you don't I know I like listening to it while you're talking I'm like it might have my brain it wasn't so you know tilt comm tilt got tilt fault it was a joker it was called up tilt so James tried to watch this he raised a lot of money it crashed and burned was crowd talk was not a discount it was just hey we need $500 for a kegger everybody pitch in your 10 bucks if you're gonna come to the party so it was a way to collect million but it wasn't discounting you're right so let's get rid of them drop do you know drop formally from known as mass drop they do that's right so I have yeah kinda it's similar you know you know I think to make this work it's all about the packaging and the positioning like so mass drop and this other company can offer the same technology do the same thing but you really got a it's really you gotta get that angle exactly right I think and mass drop has is trying this and from my friends who have inside information which I don't have they claim that mass drop is booming mass drop has raised close to 50 million bucks and everyone I talked to who is knows about the space says that it's a sleeper and it's doing wonderful and they do a little bit similar stuff so I think that that's cool another bit of information is something like master class so master class actually allows you to share passwords to one or two people and someone someone in our trends group said about it and said like hey does anyone want to split master class with me and it was our most engaged post ever right and so I completely see the validation here this is incredible so yeah and back in the day I think woot was like this and there were some others where it's like hey this TV is you know cheap and they it wasn't exactly like it wasn't the exactly the same I think the magic of this is that it's your actual friend group that you use to do this so with the problem with Groupon and all these others is you get to deal hunter so there's just this population of deal hunters they're getting everything at a discount and they're not necessarily like the best customers long-term they're not retaining a long-term all that stuff what's cool about this is you know one of the challenges for any business is you have to acquire customers so here's how I would do this today I think you can create pin duo duo for Shopify what does that mean so there's all these Shopify stores out of them let's call it a hundred thousand Shopify stores every single one of these Shopify stores wants more customers they'll try to get those customers through either Google SEO or Facebook Ads two primary ways and then word-of-mouth let's say let's beyond that so you know they go and they go to Facebook and they'll pay $15 for a customer to come purchase from them if they want another customer they got to go pay another $15 and that's unfortunate right and they'll offer discounts and they'll try to do a referral program or whatever but what I think they should do is one of the largest sort of booms in Shopify is this thing called after pay or a firm which basically says hey when you're checking out instead of paying $85 for this you can do monthly payments for nine dollars and that increase the checkout rate because people can pal at nine dollars a month better than they they can do $90 today upfront and so adding an after pay button increased sales so I think if you added a buy together save together button you would increase sales so the way it works is you're about to check out and it says great you can either have this item for $80 but if you get five friends to buy you all get it for 60 you're you all get it for 50 or whatever it is some discount there and you basically are saying rather than paying $15 per customer and Facebook Ads I will pay you know 15 I'll pay 10 dollars right now to discount this item for you because you're gonna go acquire five customers for me right so like if I reduced it and I'm you know I'm basically producing like my cost by are my my revenue by 20 20 bucks per customer I'm able to sort of acquire customers through a new channel besides Facebook Ads which is sort of steadily price rising over time and also the way that if you get introduced to a product through a friend I think you sort of have a better relationship with the product and better experience better retention than if you are only being advertised through by the company so I would try fit I think this is I think this is the best it's very hard very hard because you have to you're building something from scratch here and it's all about like this is this is definitely a all-or-nothing type of thing in my mind where you have to get the positioning really really right and but I think if you do you're onto something right you know it's it's kind of its kind of like a live streaming thing it's like live streaming isn't like hard to make I mean there's so many of them but you really got to find that angle that like it gets people this is more big business than small certain success big business most likely to fail the other thing that I think is interesting here I think that's thing about Shopify and I was like okay what other buttons would I put at checkout that I could basically offer that's a great that's a great framework so like for example in mobile games they do this all the time you run out of lives and it's like hey you could buy another life you can share this with a friend and get in our life or you can watch this 30-second ad and get in our life so the mobile games are like you know it's like a little you know wizard sitting inside a slot machine just trying to figure out how to take your money your time or attention and they've optimized the [ __ ] out of this and so what can you learn from that so maybe if you're at Shopify or you have a Shopify store maybe there's a plug-in that you can add to your checkout which says hey if you want an extra you know dollar off or $2 off just click this button and like us on Instagram and boom now my Instagram is growing with every customer that joints or whatever yeah there's a bunch of there's definitely a bunch of tools that allow you to do that but I entered the most popular one is email like give us your email and you get a you get a 15% off or whatever and I think that's cool that's like level one but like this idea of team buying of sharing to your Instagram liking us on Instagram I think there's just more things that you could do at the checkout page that would say how do I get your time money or in some way that you're not currently giving me and so I don't know if there's there's a lot there because Shopify so big now that if you build something that works on Shopify you can build a you know 10 million 20 million dollar business pretty quickly because every store will just adopt these like best practices fairly quickly I think that first thing your time up group buying is incredibly interesting I've always thought that group hon I love Groupon I think that their valuation is [ __ ] and I'm like that there's gotta be a better way to make that happen and I love coupon I love group Hana I'm also familiar with appSumo which does group discounting for software and then social stack I think it's called great comedies where else could you do group buying is there any other like sort of space like absolute was a great example where they're like okay cool sort of software are there like I don't know you well so a lot of this stuff has been tried and it doesn't always work but you definitely could do it I mean this is what Kickstarter is right you did it with brand end of brand their land kept a tilt we have to cross this threshold and I don't know what it could work for I'd have to really think about it I just I feel so ignorant on what works or not the thing about it is it works better when the thing cost the maker nothing then when it costs to make or something right so software is great because every incremental sale of a piece of software cost the maker zero vs. like if it's a physical item and like well now I'm every TV if the more people that buy this the more people more TVs I have to sell out at loss and so I think digital works better than physical that's one like premise I would make I would I would hold what when it comes to this and I mean the other one is like where maybe I don't know if it works better for low price probably higher priced items because a the discount matters and B maybe there's just more margin you know to be captured even after discount verses and low price item so maybe you would be looking for sort of high price digital digital services software yeah I mean I think that you could definitely what about using it so what I would want to use it for what businesses buy so like for example I want to buy pitch book but it's 20 grand a year and I'm not gonna use it that much but I would love to split it with someone so I think that's incredibly interesting one weird idea is I think that I would want to figure out a way to use it for lawyers so instead of having a legal firm be my lawyer I split a lawyer with you and five other people and that that by that's a great name split it or split it would be a great name for a company that was trying to do this it's like hey you can do this but or you want you want to split it with four others and hey you all save you have to have a ton of volume to make this work the way you could make then is if you make it to that cool let's say the price is a hundred bucks and if I'm gonna split it with five people I think what ends up happening is that everybody gives it for less than 100 but the total adds up to more than 100 right like like they're totally I end up making more than I would have off of a single customer paying full price by by letting you great it looks good at first for 70 and now I get 140 and you get hundred right it's like how personal trainer does group training they're like if you want one-on-one it's a hundred dollars an hour if there's two of you guys you each pay 70 bucks an hour and it's like I now make more per L it's a great idea that's a great idea I love split it I'm never gonna create this because that it seems way too hard but I understand the need in the problem and I would love to be involved and as a customer or some capacity great all right split your brain some rain we'll be back in a couple days with another brain storm people said you can't keep up this pace how can you keep coming up with new ideas every week twice a week are you crazy but they don't understand they don't know how this brain works did if you spend enough time doing it which we definitely don't always do but a lot of times we do it is not and if you lower the bar on what you call an interesting or good idea so I know things you lower the expectations and practice that is the that is a criteria it's that easy leave us review tell us what you think tweet at us or whatever we're talking about [Music]

I won't give you feedback that I got from from listeners Sean you ready am I prepared for this is this harsh critical whew that's good - okay great no okay so what I'm noticing with this podcast is we have a similar amount of views each week and I think it's the same people over and over I think we're like part of people's routine which is cool and the I think that one of the secrets to growing a podcast is do you have to have guests so when we had Andrew he shared it I saw people who like him came and listened and I hope we've got him hooked and they're gonna listen from now on and so the way that we're gonna do this is we're just gonna get more guests but here's what people keep telling me and this they weren't saying this about Andrew but they like it when it's just you and I rip in it and just making [ __ ] up on the fly yeah yeah I felt that and I think it's even more on these zoom calls because the zoom called pace a little slower when we're in person it's a little bit better I think to have that third guest on the seat and it definitely depends their guests got to bring the bring to energy you can't just be successful in smart that is not enough you have to bring energy you got to know what people want to hear about and get to the point and so you know that's the the rubric for guest which is hard when you're also trying to find famous guests because they help to show grow and just for the record Sean and I have recorded with I think we've done a bunch of times I personally have done it a bunch of times and it was wonderful people who I like and it just turned out to be bad and we just don't publish yeah we throw it away and we don't even talk we just throw it away yeah and I've done it like four throughout the years for whatever I don't even remember what I was recording stuff for I've interviewed someone who was like an amazing operator and the content was wack and I'm like well trash it so anyway the feedback that we're getting so is that people like us because they say that I'm more optimist and you're more like down-to-earth and that we're if and they love that and that they can't get that anywhere but you and I are like let's go get more guests and people don't like to guess unfortunately that helps us grow yeah well we'll keep mixing it in dude I had a call yesterday that I was like if I had just recorded this this would have been like one of the dopest podcasts ever it was just me and for a con we have a call every once a week now that's just called cool [ __ ] and he lives in like the edge of like technology he's like in the dark web basically that not in a legal way but sort of like he's on the forefront of what's interest like an he's just a nerd he's just like a very typical Silicon Valley engineer just yeah he knows reality a good way he knows me well enough and also he loves money enough where he knows how to take that stuff and bubble up the bits that are interesting the bits that are relevant and not just get lost in the weeds of technology so that cover was amazing but unfortunately didn't record the other thing was gonna say about the guest is being guest on other people's podcast is the other way to grow so I had a Shawn let yesterday reach out to like 50 podcasts and just be like hey I'll go on and talk about it right like I'll go on I just sold my company I can go on and talk about that hey we built a podcast that did a million downloads in the first six months we could talk about how we did that and so I think guesting on other people's podcast might be a good way you did this with Gary Vee with pomp so yeah I probably so there's a caveat there I've I've probably been a guest a hundred times and there was a period like over the trailing six months I have it set on my calendar from three o'clock to five o'clock that's only guessing on podcast and I would do it and some of the small ones just drove nothing right like it was total hit or miss and so I would spend like three weeks doing it and it's almost like and you probably like this it's like being the comedian you just say this same [ __ ] over and over and you kind of figure out what hits and it's fun it's almost like therapy you just talk about yourself it's cool but it definitely gets a little repetitive and it the results are not always there but they are sometimes yeah and you know the thing you said at the beginning which is for podcasting you get this base and it's the sticky sticky base of people who want to listen to it all the time it becomes a part of the routine they start to really love you that sort of thing it's very different than other products I built where I'm like alright I want to get millions of users to just visit this page or like just use this once a week or subscribe to this and kind of like that's been a lot of the products I built this is the opposite it's like an army of a hundred thousand people who will like go to war for you I think there's people in this group that would if I said hey I need you to beat this person up they would go beat that person up like there's people who really have your back and when I started this I remember I was talking to su Lee who's the very first guest on the pod and he was like you know what do you think it makes you just sold the company and I was like you know I really like this podcast thing it was okay like is that a business like in some ways it's a step down right it's like I'm gonna wait way less doing this than I did my last business or any other business I want to do and I was like look I want to just be in like a million people's ear balls every morning if I did that I just know that that's a good thing and I don't know how to get there but I'm gonna do that I'm gonna get into a million people's ear balls every morning on their way to work and the way to work I think that's powerful yeah I mean it may or may not be a business but it definitely will lead to way more opportunity yeah I've had a lot of I mean I've been doing the content thing a little bit like before the podcast so I kind of understand it but the podcast definitely is different I remember I went to New York salon and I just tweeted I was like I'm we're gonna be over I'm gonna be over here because I was there for a hustle advertising crap and I just tweeted as like yeah I want to be here I had 200 people want to come and so we only let maybe 20 come and because we're in people's ears dude like these people this kid Ryan said something to me and he's like yeah you know cuz you said how much you liked this thing and I was like I don't remember what you're talking about and like they think they know you and you know the other thing I like is that people or the people who is this are actually pretty really really smart and successful you know I think a lot of podcasts that are about business they cater to kind of lowest common denominator so it's like oh the waltrip renewer is their core market and you know in our facebook group for this podcast I posted something saying hey I'm doing something cool for people who have a business that does over a million dollars a year and there's like a hundred plus replies just in that Facebook group of people who have businesses doing over a million dollars a year right so these are not like kind of like the want reproduce you know they're not job or a college kid or something like that like of course there are people like that but the audience also is mixed with a lot of interesting successful people there's a bunch of VCS that listen to this it's crazy so anyways enough about the podcast let's give people some some other topics or ideas [Music]

me and Sam are here Sam you wrote something at the top of this I want to hear what you have to say which is people's reply about what we talked about last time Gracia let's jump in with that all right you want to I'm gonna read just word for word I have it pulled up on my Twitter okay you ready I'm not gonna read the guy's name he goes I'm a modest-sized mid seven-figure Amazon seller and a network of guys that range from 1 or 2 million to probably 50 million plus we have a few guys in our network that actually sold their company to throw out how do you call it gracias yeah de Rossi oh happy to chat about Amazon ecommerce sometime ok so I'm gonna read his replies now for those of you listening the background is is that on Tuesday Sean and I had talked about the ratio it's a company that raised money they raised 100 200 million at a 750 valuation I don't remember yeah close to a hundred million at Amelia dog nation a big company you can they're only tears old there and what they're doing is buying Amazon Fulfillment and filled by Amazon company fulfilled by Amazon companies and they are making the brands better and just owning them they're doing a bunch of stuff and so I had a guy reach out to me and he's I go that's great tell me what's the I asked him what's the cash flow situation like for most guys sub ten million dollars they're probably working with zero to a handful of US employees still actively involved in the day-to-day large team in the Philippines and in cheap locations and are probably netting between 10 to 20 percent a year and and so the typical size for 3 to 5 million the typical size is 3 to 5 million in revenue and they're probably pulling in 500 to a million dollars a year for themselves but the problem is is that it's getting harder and harder in 2013 you could sell almost anything and scale seven figure business now there are a lot more dominant more sophisticated players and it's incredibly hard to enter in the business the Amazon algorithm is much smarter and it makes making incredibly expensive and difficult also Amazon treats their sellers like trash so it's kind of a mixed bag I could take a month and do nothing and let my team run it and it can go perfect or I can get an email tomorrow saying my account has been suspended or killed and I need a lawyer to reinstate everything or I'm just crushed so anyway Sean I wanted to fill you in on this because I thought it was cool inside I didn't know about yeah that's that's a good insight so a couple of thoughts on that so the first is I think he's right you know back 2013-2014 it was a lot easier to do it than it is today that seems consistent with what I've heard in fact it seems like the formula is build a successful Amazon business in 2013 14 15 then start teaching other people how to do it because it's too hard to do anymore and so now you start giving away the sort of secrets and you become a TV for the next three years so I think that's the the career path right now the other thing that comes to mind we were talking I was talking to Andrew Wilkinson about this and he was saying he used the I think it's a it's a Charlie Munger quote which I oh no it's a Nassim Taleb quote which is it's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller so the you know there's a high probability you can make a little bit of money um you know consistently every single time you reach down and you pick it up and then there's you know a low probability of complete death and that's what he's talking about when he says you can get a letter tomorrow that says your account is suspended goodbye and and that's it or Amazon cuts the rates of your category like I have a friend who was doing millions of dollars of book sales as a third party book seller on Amazon and the name was almost like you know what now our take rate on books has you know not 10% we're gonna do 25% things and that like killed that happened to me this that happened to me the other day so in our we have in the trends group someone was like just so you know Amazon changed the feet so basically I have various blogs like my personal blog or something like that and it makes just like small amounts of money like three to five thousand dollars a month off Amazon affiliates and I don't even check it it just runs because because I write just written a lot of content over the years they changed their rate and someone told me in the I think I forget what I was earning I don't even check it I think I was earning 6% to 9% for affiliate revenue and then they changed it to they like halved it so that money just haft and it's no big deal because it wasn't a bit it wasn't like a big income stream for me but if you're a wire cutter or if you're BuzzFeed and you made a hundred million dollars from this it's a huge deal right yeah that that 20% cut makes it makes a really big difference no no no it wasn't at all it wasn't a 20% cut it was way bigger than that it was like half they have out and what category are your links mostly and is it electronics is it some cat is one category was just across the board they rate they lowered it across categories but across the board it's close to half my categories were probably personal care and electronics I mean just anyone who ya I'm booked a lot of books right okay I want to know another topic so we're good on terasi oh you want to add anything else no you do not want to know I think it's it's consistent with what we thought you know I like when people fill in the gaps with information that we don't have I'm not an FBA seller I don't know the ins and outs of that market I just think it's interesting we talked a little bit about it and then people fill in the gaps in the next episode we come back a little smarter that's a nice little formula we have going so I appreciate that or you ever talk about stuff you know tell us that was more about what what you know that we don't [Music]

so I don't think this would work so let me start with that but there's something interesting here we're so Netflix recently left folks in the last few years started going heavy into comedy so comedy used to be like HBO kind of owned the space where they would do you know HBO specials and then that kind of dried up and comics are like cockroaches they'll always survive it's like okay we'll go play in the dingy estroux meeee we'll go onstage we'll get it Netflix special we'll get HBO special okay we're back to the dark room again like they won't quit cuz they're like degenerates and now podcasting has been a huge boom for them so Chris D'Elia who also just had a Netflix special come out these guys make tons of money right so Netflix started cutting like 10 20 million dollar checks I believe to these comedians because they know that comedians have these like rabid followings and the content is good it's unique sort of proprietary content but I think that there's a product out there sort of like a crunchy what crunchyroll did for anime I think somebody could do for the mid-tier comedians I think you can make a sort of $5 a month $7 a month subscription to the comedians that are not going to get met flick specials right so not Chris Rock and not Seinfeld and Chappelle and and all those guys but like the next tear down like even you know one level below like the Whitney Cummings of the world right because they are still getting Netflix specials and I think you could add them up and it doesn't want to be the hour-long special it could be like a 10-minute set set or a 20-minute set or something like that and I think you could get I think each of them have a few thousand fans that would pay to be able to access that exclusive comedy content and and so you would act if you just aggregate all the comedians then it's a sort of all-you-can-eat pass where as a viewer I can discover other comedians too so anyways I think that there's a business potentially for a mid-level Netflix for comedians where you aggregate them what do you think great I'm looking up information so I can my brains rolling and I'm gonna let me let me tell you what I think so first of all kwibi I imagine trying to do something that so kwibi is that even how you say it yes it's pretty stupid I mean look I think with kwibi it actually can be great because the people who are running it are like super smart but it does not look like a good bet now but it still might be anyway they're trying to do something like that second I think that that is a great idea and I think the way that I would find out how to do it is I would look up quelle au q e ll Oh have you heard of Cuomo I've never heard of it okay well o is is it's a it's I think it was started way before its time it's an app on Apple TV and all they have is live concerts and so it was started in 2010 and it's available and it's like a it's a app for your phone but I think it's best on Apple TV and you could download it and you pay ten thousand or is it maybe ten dollars a month and sometimes does about Elizabeth I think it's ten dollars a month and you just get access to a library of live concerts have you ever wanted to do that or is that just me I kind of do this on YouTube but YouTube like has enough free like I listened to a bunch of like Red Rocks concerts right because there's a concert venue Club Red Rocks which is awesome and like anytime I'd musician goes there they film it in like epic with epic cameras and sound and they're just like available on YouTube for free but this is cool I like this it's awesome and it's it's better than YouTube but YouTube is great and the reason it's better is because like if you buy like a concert DVD the camera works a little bit better and the sound is a lot better and I love live music and so I am a big fan of this and they have 70,000 paying subscribers they were recently acquired by stingray communications which is a publicly traded company in Canada it's a cable company so if I were you Sean and I wanted to launch this or if I was a listener I wanted to launch this I would look up stingray communication and I would go and read the the filing for that company and I would figure out exactly what quello does that's what I would do and I would learn about how they did it because it's a relatively niche thing they only have 70,000 subscribers it's not huge and they've been at it for ten years so it's not a big number and I think it is incredibly viable business and I think it's great another thing another thing that I would do is I would look up Discovery Channel and then National Geographic are you familiar familiar with National Geographic or obviously right okay National Geographic is still a huge company and Disney recently bought into it at a billion dollar valuation it may still make they still make hundreds of thousands or hundreds of millions of dollars a year from their magazine subscription is that crazy then and so I would put date but here National Geographic was a non-profit and and so the good thing about nonprofits is you can go to see all the numbers and so what I would go and look at I would look at Discovery and I would look at National Geographic and I was looking at koala and I would see what they are doing because those are relatively niche subscription companies that crush so long story short great idea [Music]

what a baller I was gonna save this guy for next week but we're gonna do a double billionaire of the week so we're doing a double Billy special get your get your Billy's right now Richard Burton okay say have you heard of this guy Richard Burton is it Burton Snowboards no so this guy I started a couple of different companies so it's just if you're just Google Richard Burton I did earlier and nothing came up did I saying his name wrong I think you got it wrong cuz I did okay he Barton sorry Barton not Burton okay so Richard Barton so this guy started Zillow he also started one of your favorite sites class door also started he has three so he has Zillow he has glass door and what's his other one I was just research this for next week so we're just gonna do this live here and he did Expedia he did Expedia order directors on Netflix but you did Expedia Zillow and Glassdoor what a baller like okay yeah yeah so okay so how did this happen so I've listened this interview with this guy like five years ago before this podcast even started before this podcast was even a little you know sperm in my balls and when I when I looked at this guy the one thing that stood out to me was he had a very simple thesis that he used to start all these companies which was information wants to be free so okay what does information wants to be free man so he was basically like I'm gonna bring transparency to industries that are better not transparent and so he said you know let's take Zillow for example before Zillow when they sort of online house property and house search companies existed like Trulia and all this red fan stuff like that the MLS listings were something that only the agents and brokers had access to and so this is they were gatekeepers they were like oh you want to know what's on the market let me literally print out the MLS papers and I'll show you they show you these and all all tore you through these companies that's so great line dude information that was an information once you got information wants to be free and so so then he did the same thing in travel right we had travel agents who were the brokers who you had to call and be like hey I'd like to get a flight I don't want to mention that you just trusted hopefully this agent is gonna do we were gonna do their job they're gonna know all the different options different times different airports and they're gonna find me something that fits my needs and Expedia was just a search bar that would just tell you here's all the flights you decide here's the information you don't need to go to a travel agent anymore and Glassdoor is the same thing you wanted to know what's it really like to work there and employers have no desire to put that out there they don't want anybody to know any of the bad things that happen you know the working environment of their company and employees were often scared to do it because they would sign things so it'd be like you know non-disclosure whatever non slander if you're the term for it is non-disparagement and so Glassdoor was unleashing the information about what's it like to work at X company and so I love how this guy literally on one thesis has started three multi-billion dollar companies off that one premise and so that was when I when I did what you're talking about I reverse engineering how did this guy do it it wasn't oh how did he build Expedia how did he build illah it was how did you even get this idea okay what other industries today lack transparency where I can open them what are they do well if now that's a billion-dollar idea I need to have let's think of some one of them is pricing for enterprise software right what is find out how much money your company makes and then they go okay we're gonna charge you this right like that like like I hate that call for pricing model I mean I I hate it but it works we do it so AngelList did this in a way as well when you were able to figure out who's invested in what that used to be like sort of not easy to find information it wasn't sort of like totally guarded but I crunch mice as well I'm literally just looking at the tabs that I have open right like Yelp yeah I'll put something like that to you know how was it what is like to eat there the review system it organized and made public information that people wanted that was not super transparent before this yeah I mean housing he did that there's a lot there's so many good ones um salaries he did that with class door those last reduce salaries yeah so there's there's one that I use that's in the tech world called levels I think we talked about it what's before but they do it where with just the like kind of tech companies it's like what do people had tech companies make and a lot of people have been doing this on inside companies so inside Microsoft for example they created an anonymous Google Doc where you could just put your level your job category like engineer or design or product person whatever and your salary your pay and then people that's yeah you can figure out am i underpaid but this was even in like more specific it was like in a company these are people now like and it's not just classed over it's like just a few who kind of go and poke the stuff but there get like these these companies are having all these like really rich documents with thousands of people contributing in and right now those are just Excel Docs I wonder if you could take the just a salary component of maybe what's in glass door and do it in a better way inside company so people make sure they're not getting the short end of stick within their own company right now that's interesting another one is freelancers so the answer is what freelancers and agents these so the problem with a lot of the stuff is when we're trying to hire some agencies to WordPress to bail on it I have to back-channel and go find out from people who worked with them what they were like once I sign up to and agree with them I can't I won't find out unless I'm on a weekend if they suck or not right I can't believe I'm in and that's the same thing with like payroll software to like gussto looks good but when you sign up to it you don't realize like what you like and what about it so we have a couple friends who are doing things that are trying to put out you know they're trying to make information will come free of what software do companies use so like a lot of people would want to know what does the hustle use what do you guys use to send email what do you guys use for analytics what do you guys use for your payment paywall what are use for trends and like I know Ryan at producthunt they're doing this with something called stacks or your stacks and they want to know what's your software stack that your company runs on and it's an interesting idea he's designing it kind of like a social network but the value in the air and if you did if you get there is oh cool I can now go see okay if I'm building an Airbnb type of company what do they use to run their company what do they usually do you think that that is not working well it's really tough to build right it is one of those things where really valuable if you get they're really tough to get the information in because you have to get the incentives right later on you have the incentive to come to the site because you want to see what other people use but what's the incentive to post and so he's trying to make it fun and interesting and cool to post by making it like very visual like sort of a get it doing that a profile for your company right like like yeah we use this stuff and so I don't know the numbers on how it's doing but I do think it's an interesting experiment and I think if they did it it would be the most valuable thing that producthunt has built because it's a it's just inherently surely there's a great business model on top of that if you can show what software people will use that's cool I agree that's interesting I love this idea of information needs or information wants to be free yeah let's think more about that so I think we'll come back with an example of information today that is either behind a walled garden or it's incomplete and if you set it free it would make people make better choices or save them money or whatever it is like maybe it's something in the insurance space maybe I don't I don't know exactly what but I'm gonna think about this because I think this is a formula for building really big companies yeah for me it's how much things cost like like freelancers and lawyers and things like that that's it's always bothered me I don't like I like my lawyer could be like yeah we charge $700 an hour and when I was first getting going I was like have no idea is that normal right and on the other side it's also how much companies make right like you love it when you hear that a company's public or it's a non-profit cuz you're like yes I'm gonna get to their financials because they have to report you know yeah well and they do in a really interesting way and they're owned by a publicly traded company they do about a hundred twenty million dollars a year in revenue what they see is like 25 grand for a pitchbook subscription right really expensive and they do about 120 they're owned by is it called Morningstar or engine right SR I think it this morning star or morning source like the mutual fund thing it's yeah it's all about one of those things and I just rather their earnings thing morning's target is morning soccer and they are the mutual fun thing to and what they do is they do a bunch of different things the first thing they do is they crawl the web and they find SEC documents and they find like all time they just crawl and find data and they have a team of like 300 people who just hit the phones all day and call people and get the information okay and then the other one that's like that is you know even for podcast when we look at the top charts and we're like alright how do we become the number one business podcast we don't know how much you know how many downloads they get right there's this idea of how much something is how much is being earned how much is something making and how much does something cost I think that just generally would apply to a whole bunch of different spaces that you could you can use for this yeah that's why I use a similar web because they show me how much like traffic they guess traffic one of the dope ones of this do you use second measure yeah they're great they're great I think a little bit extension oh they are yes if you don't know what they are so second measure takes credit card spending data and can tell you essentially like how much money something is making just by analyzing how many people are charging Spotify per month and then I got really cool right imagine spot if I was not public company you'd be able to see here's how much revenue that they're making or they do this with like the delivery companies which delivery companies winning well they can just check this huge data set of credit card spending and say okay it looks like grub hubs in the lead and then second is door - or whatever and so second measure is super powerful using a source of truth which just credit card data all I want to do is like and the podcast and make my days 50 hours long and just start a search everything this whole this whole data or make information or finding information wants to be free that whole concept that's amazing that's the test I want people to listen this podcast and be so excited and then I want you to feel anxious I want you to feel stress that you don't have 50 hours in your day to go do this and that's that's how this should feel I've heard about people say like yeah I have to keep pausing the podcast to like a write down B take a breath C think about what's going on and then I was and yeah that's what one set that high value [Music] you

we're on we're back what's up me and Sam are here Sam but you wrote something at the top of this I want to hear what you have to say which is people's reply about what we talked about last time Gracia let's jump in with that all right you wanna I'm gonna read just word for word I have it pulled up on my Twitter okay you ready I'm not gonna read the guy's name he goes I'm a modest-sized mid seven-figure Amazon seller a network of guys that range from 1 or 2 million to probably 50 million plus we have a few guys in our network that actually sold their company to throw up well how do you call it gracias yeah they're a co happy to chat about Amazon ecommerce sometime okay so I'm gonna read his replies now for those of you listening the background is is that on Tuesday Sean and I talked about the ratio it's a company that raised money they raised one hundred two hundred million at a 750 valuation I don't remember yeah close to a hundred million a dog - a big company you can they're only tears old there and what they're doing is buying Amazon Fulfillment and filled by Amazon company fulfilled by Amazon companies and they are making the brands better and just owning them they're doing a bunch of stuff and so I had a guy reach out to me and he I go that's great tell me what's the I asked him what's the cash flow situation like for most guys sub ten million dollars they're probably working with zero to a handful of US employees still actively involved in the day-to-day large team in the Philippines and in cheap locations and are probably netting between ten to twenty percent a year and and so the typical size for three to five million the typical size is three to five million in revenue and they're probably pulling in five hundred to a million dollars a year for themselves but the problem is is that it's getting harder and harder in 2013 you could sell almost anything and scale seven figure business now there are a lot more dominant more sophisticated players and it's incredibly hard to enter in the business the Amazon is much smarter and it makes ranking incredibly expensive and difficult also Amazon treats their sellers like trash so it's kind of a mixed bag I could take a month and do nothing and let my team run it and it can go perfect or I can get an email tomorrow saying my account has been suspended or killed and I need a lawyer to reinstate everything or I'm just crushed so anyway Sean I wanted to fill you in on this because I thought it was cool inside I didn't know about yeah that's that's a good insight so a couple of thoughts on that so the first is I think he's right you know back 2013-2014 it was a lot easier to do it than it is today that seems consistent with what I've heard in fact it seems like the formula is build a successful Amazon business in 2013 14 15 then start teaching other people how to do it because it's too hard to do anymore and so now you start giving away the sort of secrets and you become a teacher for the next three years so I think that's the the career path right now the other thing that comes to mind we were talking I was talking to Andrew Wilkinson about this and he was saying he used the I think it's a it's a Charlie Munger quote which is it said Nassim Taleb quote which is it's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller so the you know there's a high probability you can make a little bit of money um you know consistently every single time you reach down you pick it up and then there's you know a low probability of complete death and that's what he's talking about when he says you can get a letter tomorrow that says your account is suspended goodbye and and that's it or Amazon cuts the rates of your category like I have a friend who was doing millions of dollars of book sales as a third party book seller on Amazon and the name was almost like you know what now our take rate on books has you know not ten percent we're gonna do 25 percent things and that like killed that happened to me this that happened to me the other day so in our via in the trends group someone was like just so you know Amazon changed the feet so basically I have various blogs like my personal blog or something like that and it makes just like small amounts of money like three to five thousand dollars a month off Amazon affiliates and I don't even check it it just runs because because I write just written a lot of content over the years gay changed their rate and someone told me in the group I think they I forget what I was earning I don't even check it I think I was earning 6% to 9% for a affiliate revenue and then they changed it to they like halved it so that money just haft and it's no big deal because it wasn't a it wasn't like a big income stream for me but if you're a wire cutter or if you're BuzzFeed and you made a hundred million dollars from this it's a huge deal right yeah that's what that 20% cut makes it makes a really big difference though it wasn't a it wasn't a 20% cut it was way bigger than that it was like half they have out and what category are your links mostly and is it electronics is it some cat is one category was just across the board they rate they lowered it across categories but across the board it's close to half my categories were probably personal care and electronics I mean just anyone who yeah or books a lot of books right okay I want to know another topic so we're good on Thor a CEO you want to add anything else no you do not want to know I think it's it's consistent with what we thought you know I like when people fill in the gaps with information that we don't have right I'm not an FBA seller I don't know the ins and outs of that market I just think it's interesting we talked a little bit about it and then people fill in the gaps in the next episode we come back a little smarter that's a nice little formula we have going so I appreciate that before you ever talk about stuff you know tell us tell us more about what you know that we don't before we go deep into serious stuff do you want to talk about I want to give you feedback that I got from from listeners Sean you ready am I prepared for this is this Harshal critical for you that's good - okay great no ok so what I'm noticing with this podcast is we have a similar amount of views each week and I think it's the same people over and over I think we're like part of people's routine which is cool and the I think that one of the secrets to growing a podcast is do you have to have guests so when we had Andrew he shared it that's all the people who like him came and listened and I hope we've got him hooked and they're gonna listen from now on and so the way that we're gonna do this is we're to get more guests but here's what people keep telling me and this they weren't saying this about Andrew but they like it when it's just you and I rip in it and just make it [ __ ] up on the fly yeah yeah I felt that and I think it's even more on these zoom calls because the zoom called pace is a little slower when we're in person it's a little bit better I think to have that third guest on the seat and it definitely depends their guests got to bring the bring to energy you can't just be successful in smart that is not enough you have to bring energy you got to know what people want to hear about and get to the point and so you know that's the the rubric for guest which is hard when you're also trying to find famous guests because they help to show grow and just for the record Sean and I have recorded with I think we've done a bunch of times I personally have done it a bunch of times and it was wonderful people who I like and it just turned out to be bad and we just don't publish yeah we throw it away and we don't even tell we just throw it away yeah and I've done it like four throughout the years for whatever I don't remember when I was recording stuff for I've interviewed someone who was like an amazing operator and the content was wack and I'm like well trash exactly so anyway the feedback that we're getting someone is that people like us because they say that I'm more optimist and you're more like down-to-earth and that we're if and they love that and that they can't get that anywhere but you and I are like let's go get more guests and people don't like the guess unfortunately that helps us grow yeah well we'll keep mixing it in dude I had a call yesterday that I was like if I had just recorded this this would have been like one of the dopest podcasts ever it was just me and for a con we have a call every once a week now that's just called cool [ __ ] and he lives in like the edge of like technology he's like in the dark web basically that not in a legal way but sort of like he's on the forefront of what's interest like an he's just a nerd he's just like a very typical Silicon Valley engineer just yeah he knows a reality a good way he knows me well enough and also he loves money enough where he knows how to take that stuff and bubble up the bits that are interesting the bits that are relevant and not just getting lost in the weeds of Knology so that comet was amazing but unfortunately to record the other thing I was gonna say about the guests is being guests on other people's podcast is the other way to grow so I had he Sean let yesterday reach out to like 50 podcasts and just be like hey I'll go on and talk about it right like I'll go on I just sold my company I can go on and talk about that hey we built a podcast that did a million downloads in the first six months we could talk about how we did that and so I think guesting on other people's podcast might be a good way you did this with Gary Vee with pomp so yeah I probably so there's a caveat there I've I've probably been a guest a hundred times and there was a period like over the trailing six months I have it set on my calendar from 3 o'clock to 5 o'clock that's only guessing a podcast and I would do it and some of the small ones just drove nothing right like it was total hit or miss and so I would spend like three weeks doing it and it's almost like and you probably like this it's like being the comedian you just say the same [ __ ] over and over and you kind of figure out what hits and it's fun it's almost like therapy you just talk about yourself it's cool but it definitely gets a little repetitive and it the results are not always there but they are sometimes yeah and you know the thing you said at the beginning which is for podcasting you get this base and it's the sticky sticky base of people who want to listen to it all the time it becomes a part of the routine they start to really love you that sort of thing it's very different than other products I built where I'm like alright I want to get millions of users to just visit this page or like just use this once a week or subscribe to this and kind of forget about it like that's been a lot of the products I built this is the opposite it's like an army of a hundred thousand people who will like go to war for you I think there's people in this group that would if I said hey I need you to beat this person up they would go beat that person up like there's people who really have your back and when I started this I remember I was talking to Sully who's the very first guest on the pod and he was like you know what do you think it makes you just sold the company and I was like you know I really like this podcast thing it was okay like is that a business like in some ways it's a step down right it's like I'm gonna wait way less doing this than I did my last business or any other business I want to do and I was like look I want to just be in like a million people's ear every morning if I did that I just know that that's a good thing and I don't know how to get there but I'm gonna do that I'm gonna get into a million people's ear balls every morning on their way to work and the way to work I think that's powerful yeah I mean it may or may not be a business but it definitely will lead to way more opportunity yeah I've had a lot of I mean I've been doing the content thing a little bit like before the podcast so I kind of understand it but the podcast definitely is different I remember I went to New York salon and I just tweeted I was like I'm we're gonna be over I'm gonna be over here because I was there for a hustle advertising crap and I just tweeted as like yeah I want to be here I had 200 people want to come and so we only let maybe 20 come and because we're in people's a years dude like these people this kid Ryan said something to me and he's like yeah you know cuz you said how much you like this thing and I was like I don't remember what you're talking about and like if they think they know you and you know they are like is that people or the people who is this our actual pretty really really smart and successful you know I think a lot of podcasts that are about business they cater to kind of lowest common denominator so it's like oh the waltrip renewer is their core market and you know in our Facebook group for this podcast I posted something saying hey I'm doing something cool for people who have a business that does over a million dollars a year and there's like a hundred plus replies just in that Facebook group of people who have businesses doing over a million dollars a year right so these are not like kind of like the want reproduce you know at their nine-to-five job or a college kid or something like that like of course there are people like that but the audience also is mixed with a lot of interesting successful people there's a bunch of VCS that listen to this it's crazy so anyways enough about the podcast let's give people some some other topics or ideas Allen says my video looks good now and yeah one other thing you have you kind of have the mic to the side of your mouth and when you turn so your voice goes in and out so just keep it like just talk directly into the mic let's talk one more thing about the podcast which is my house looks like it's crazy right now I had to go and buy this mic I've at it like to set this all up dude it's been so hard to set up like a zoom thing and it's hard I hate this yeah I know you want you want that business to exist which is push a button give me like a dope podcast like turnkey yes oh and for anyone who's listening this is podcast related a little bit I promise I'll finish up with this but this is awesome so my friend Neville Medora he sponsored last podcast copywriting course calm I plugged him he I did like a happy hour with him I mean I don't know and dinner where we just were just shoot the [ __ ] because we haven't been able to see each other because this stuff he use a DSLR as his webcam and it was awesome it was so easy it looks amazing it made him look like a Greek god it looks like he's like it's all like it's like does that I don't know about cameras where it does like you're blurry in the background it gets cold like this bouquet or something like that so so I saw on YouTube there's this guy Gary tan he's an investor in Silicon Valley he's like yeah one of the Y Combinator partners and he did this YouTube video that was like how to look like a [ __ ] amazing on zoom and I was like dude this makes sense this is the new like this is the equivalent of wearing a suit to work down right like yeah hang on zoom and not looking like [ __ ] with your room looking like [ __ ] and so this video only had 1500 views but he's like look this is the camera I used this is the mount this is the lens here's how you get the that blurred background look and like he looks amazing and then when I saw that photo you'd the screenshot your head of Nevel I was like I bet you he watched that video and there was only 1500 views but I was like anybody who's watching this and the other guy who who did it was a Neve drawer who's the founder of he was that product now unit Shrunk capital and he does it too and it really doesn't look amazing and what I saw that I was like I should do this I should so I was gonna do it I didn't know about this video last night I bought $700 for the stuff I bought so I already have these Phillips you light bulbs know what those are yep yep where you I just say Alexa turn the lights on right there like smarsh yeah it's gonna turn the lights on so I bought those but you see back here behind the couch I'm gonna put them there and so it's gonna like shoot up and I hope it's so like I we have like a room oh wait I forgot I'm not using the camera we have a room clean anyway you'll see it so I'm into aemond on this I like it so this guy reached out from Twitter who he's done a couple of e-commerce things that are kind of interesting and so I was talking to him and he his new thing so he's basically he initially was targeting twitch streamers because he's like look when you're a streamer you're basically broadcasting from your bedroom and streamers invest in all this like artwork cool lights wall panels smart speakers all this stuff to make the room look good and he's like I'm gonna make an e-commerce store that's like just gonna do that look at all I'll find the name of it I don't know if he wants me to kind of out him so we may have to believe this if if he's not into it but I'll say it right here it's called visual candy and this guy's smart I like this guy a lot and so said it was but now with the work from home I think this extends a lot past where his initial market was which is youtubers and twitch stars and now it's you know any professional who's gonna spend some amount of time in a home office and just think about the amount of home offices that are being built out right now because people are needed infrastructure for this but that's gonna stick around once kovat goes away yeah I have loved I'm really into it I've like gone to Amazon and I've tried buying like all the stuff and it's it's kind of complicated because I didn't know which batteries do this I was like how do I just I was like where does the camera need to be so I'm doing this there's another thing called a cam link I just looked this up it's got Oh makes it Elgato yeah and it I went and looked at it and it was they built this entire thing for streaming for gamers and it looks awesome I'm gonna I definitely go to start buying this stuff I'm probably gonna drop two grand on all this crap um I think we'll turn our but we have another bedroom I'll turn that into an office so I'm I like all this crap dude I love buying [ __ ] when you buy and when I just get on a buy streak and I'm like yeah you know what I deserve this I need that and like you know what's the problem here and and actually buying stuff is not I don't know there's something like cathartic about it like just the act of buying it feels [ __ ] great and I love it yeah but for me I've been having a call 1-800 junk and having to spend like if I buy like a new desk the boxes are so big I gotta pay $100 just a box problem is insane especially here in San Francisco the box problems insane I [ __ ] hate it I hate it it's one of the reasons why I moved I live in a house now I used to live in a building and one of the reasons was is because I didn't have to worry about the trash right well but no matter how much space I have because I thought oh I got this new house I was like now have a garage I got this like tradesman Ally I got this extra closet but it's that same principle I think it's like the Parkinson's law or whatever which is time will work will expand to fill the time you give it so let's say you have a week to do the project guess what it's gonna take you a week if you had a day to do that same project you would have only taken you a day and in the same way like junk your [ __ ] will expand to fill the space you have and so here let me let I've thought about this a lot let me get wise here okay I'm a amateur beekeeper so I have bees do you know this no you know this okay sure how they don't have your bees the right now so they actually went away but since 2013 I've kept bees so I've always for the most part so listen I'll tell you all about this for the most part in my lot in my San Francisco life for 10 years I've lived in Glen Park it's a nice neighborhood in San Francisco it's like residential no and I've always had a backyard and I wanted a hobby that was not expensive and I didn't want it to turn into a business and I just wanted something fun that I could be outside and I made a list of hobbies that I could pick and pick the lamest one and top because it doesn't cost a lot of money to start if you want to you can just leave it alone and not do anything or if you wanted to you could poke around with it and like be active with it so low maintenance low maintenance it does it only cost three to five hundred dollars to get into the Hobby you don't have to buy a bunch of [ __ ] to keep up with it and it was allowed me to be outside and so I became a beekeeper in 2013 I think and so how do bees live like do somebody that's around from then no no no they make I think they might only live for like a few months they cycle through and so I bought about 10,000 bees and I get honey from and I just give it away and I I caught southern Sam sticky icky and and so I've had bees for years and when lived in Soma i only live in someone for a year and then I went back to Glen Park and I just kept it on the roof at my office so you can have bees I would have 10 10 thousand bees just on the roof of our office and no one would know they say to themselves mostly and they go out and get honey or it get pollen and they turn it to a nectar and it turns into honey and anyway but here's the interesting thing that I learned see this has been like this is my board the wisdom comes like here's the interesting things that I've learned with bees as bees fill the space that they are given with honey so if you give them a lot of space they will always fill it if you don't give them a lot of space then they just won't make it right so it's the rule little sticky icky and so I've learned this through bees that humans are the same way if you give them a lot of space then they will fill it with a ton of stuff if you give them not a lot of space they just won't buy stuff you just won't you just won't get stuff and so that's the important thing so when you think of like I'm gonna get this huge house so I'll have a ton of room and I'll have more space you're gonna fill it to the brim with crap and you will no longer have space it always works okay that's amazing I love that story didn't know you were beekeeper I've known you for like six years I had no idea by the way we both studied abroad in Sydney and I took a class because when you study abroad you're trying to have a good time you're not trying to learn and so I took the easiest class I could find which was a bee a bee class and so I learned all this [ __ ] about bees and bees have some crazy things like just too quick be facts if I remember correctly from ten years ago I learned that when a when the queen bee goes to mate she leaves on an expedition and she will mate with as many male bees as she can along the way and she basically has sex with them and then kills them right after which breaks their back and they die and then she sort of it gets impregnated by all these bees and then there's this other thing which is really interesting that that people have learned from bees which is like a big evolutionary learning which was in a bee hive many of the bees could be fertile but they choose to be sterile and they choose to just take care of the queen bees kids because they're all related by like some 25 they're all like quarter sisters or something like that they're all like 25% related and it turns out like in a Darwinian sense you are better your genes are better off so if you just take ten to these half-sisters and quarter sisters that you have rather than trying to have your own kids and survive and so that's the crazy thing about bees bees are awesome man it's a great hobby you can get into it for two or fifty dollars all you got to do is go to Amazon and you type in beekeeping kit and someone will send you the kit and then you go on your critical Craigslist you might even be able to buy them online but that might take like a few weeks but if you go on your local Craigslist you type in bees there's a farmer nearby but you can pay $100 and they'll give you 10,000 bees and they'll set it up for you it's so it's super easy to get into and it is so fun bees you could eat I get [ __ ] I mean I'll get like I kind of think about this like probably five to eight gallon milk jugs like what's the how BIG's a bug is that a gallon of milk yeah like that that worth a honey maybe five to eight a year they're introducing okay cool lots of money also related to this idea of like people buy stuff and people love stuff and people fill their space with stuff and bees will fill their space with stuff if you want a good five minutes go on YouTube and type Chris D'Elia girls love things and you will have a great time for five minutes okay and now that brings TV to a random startup idea so I don't think this would work so let me start with that but there's something interesting here we're so Netflix recently left hooks in the last few years started going heavy into comedy so comedy used to be like HBO kind of owned the space where they would do you know HBO specials and then that kind of dried up and comics are like cockroaches they'll always survive it's like okay we'll go play in the dingy estroux meeee we'll go on stage we'll get it Netflix special we'll get HBO special okay we're back to the dark room again like they won't quit because they're like degenerates and now podcasting has been a huge boom for them so Chris D'Elia who also just had a Netflix special come out these guys make tons of money right so Netflix started cutting like 10 20 million dollar checks I believe to these comedians because they know that comedians have these like rabid followings and the content is good it's unique sort of proprietary content but I think that there's a product out there sort of like a crunchy crunchyroll did for anime I think somebody could do for the mid-tier comedians I think you can make a sort of $5 a month $7 a month subscription to the comedians that are not going to get met flick specials right so not Chris Rock and not Seinfeld and Chappelle and and all those guys but like the next teardown like even you know one level below like the Whitney Cummings of the world right because they are still getting Netflix specials and I think you could add them up and it doesn t want to be the hour-long special it could be like a 10-minute set set or a 20-minute set or something like that and I think you could get I think each of them have a few thousand fans that would pay to be able to access that exclusive comedy content and and so you would act if you just aggregate all the comedians then it's a sort of all-you-can-eat pass where as a viewer I can discover other comedians too so anyways I think that there's a business potentially for a mid-level Netflix for comedians where you aggregate them what do you think great I'm looking up information so I can my brains rolling and I'm gonna let me let me tell you what I think so first of all kwibi I imagine it's trying to do something that so kwibi is that even [ __ ] how you say yeah it's pretty stupid I mean look I think with kwibi it actually can be great because the people who are running it are like super smart but it does not look like a good bet now but it still might be anyway they're trying to do something like that second I think that that is a great idea and I think the way that I would find out how to do it is I would look up quelle au q e ll Oh have you heard of Cuomo I've never heard of it okay hello is is it's a it's I think it was started way before its time it's an app on Apple TV and all they have is live concerts and so it was started in 2010 and it's available and it's like a it's a app for your phone but I think it's best on Apple TV and you could download it and you pay ten thousand or because it may be ten dollars a month and sometimes does about Elizabeth I think it's ten dollars a month and you just get access to a library of live concerts have you ever wanted to do that or is just me I kind of do this on youtube but YouTube like has enough free like I listen to a bunch of like Red Rocks concerts right cuz there's a concert venue called Red Rocks which is awesome and like anytime I musician goes there they film it in like epic with epic cameras and sound and they're just like available on YouTube for free but this is cool I like this it's awesome and it's it's better than YouTube but YouTube is great and the reason it's better is because like if you buy like a concert DVD the camera works a little bit better and the sound is a lot better and I love live music and so I am a big fan of this and they have 70,000 paying subscribers they were recently acquired by stingray communications which is a publicly traded company in Canada it's a cable company so if I were you Sean and I wanted to launch this or if I was a listener I wanted to launch this I would look up stingray communication and I would go and read the the filing for that company and I would figure out exactly what quello does that's what I would do and I would learn about how they did it because it's a relatively niche thing they only have 70,000 subscribers it's not huge and they've been at it for 10 years so it's not a big number and I think it is incredibly viable business and I think it's great another thing another thing that I would do is I would look up Discovery Channel and then National Geographic are you familiar familiar with National Geographic or obviously right ok National Geographic is still a huge company in Disney recently bought into it at a billion dollar valuation it may still make they still make hundreds of thousands or hundreds of millions of dollars a year from their magazine subscription is that crazy and so I would put date but here National Geographic was a non-profit and and so the good thing about nonprofits is you can go to see all the numbers and so what I would go and look at I would look at discovery and I would look at mass National Geographic and I was look at koala and I would see what they are doing because those are relatively niche subscription companies that crush so long story short great idea okay cool all right what else we got you wanted to talk about this card I think yeah so I am a user Carta I think the products only okay it's still quite frustrating to use but Carta laid off a bunch of people the other day more than 67 people yeah and they raised money and their CEO Henry wrote this message that he made public and he said something like it was not your man managers fault for laying you off it was 100% my fault in fact it was the opposite your managers tried to help you and I'm on the one who reviewed every list and I said we're gonna fire this person so blame me and I think that was great I thought it was a great message so so high level he was basically saying hey we laid a bunch of people off and I'm going to publish the announcement I made to the company so that you know presumably other CEOs and other companies can kind of learn from this use this or take solace in the fact that I did this - I don't know whatever yeah content marketing and he published this and I typically and fall into the category of all press is good press go ahead and do it I thought this was kind of lame did you do you agree and and I and I tweeted that Henry and I want him to come here and I'll say this to his face I think he seems like a cool guy this move I think was kind of lame right I would agree I've kind of followed this guy for a little while like I've read some of his other stuff we're seeing some interviews seems like a good guy seems like a smart guy and I think Carter is a good product and I like some of the other stuff they've done like they have a next chapter program basically to help people who want to people want to leave the company they don't make it this like awkward exit they like celebrate it and whatever you know in theory so I thought this was lame mostly because I thought two things I thought it was tone-deaf and secondly I didn't think the actual statement was very good so I thought oh just a part the premise of what he was trying to do like what is the upside and what is the downside it to me it looked like he was trying to Pat himself on the back and I know he would he would say that's not what I'm trying to do blah blah I think I was trying to Pat himself on the back and also like you know give a little bit of sort of you know put card his name out there again like just like it's kind of like the buffer wave like publish everything and the good the bad the ugly and you get attention but I just thought it was tone-deaf and also it seemed like what he wanted people's reaction to be was like wow great leadership way to take responsibility great CEO ship and he got that and both not from me when I read this I was like this was a pretty horrible way to do the announcement and I'll tell you why he started okay so here's like I'm just gonna bullet point the the summary so he goes over the last few weeks we're talking about recession planning I said layoffs were likely and today is the day I can't delay it any longer okay weird start but alright then he says I'm sorry if I apologize if I sound robotic I'm reading off a script because I don't know if I could get through this without something to lean on okay you're not the victim don't say that that's also kinda yeah that that's pretty late yeah blame is [ __ ] then he says okay let me start with the details we're gonna lay off 161 employees that's 16% of our company it's gonna be different across the company all right whatever then this was weird I thought it was just like if you heard one of those affected you'll receive an invitation from your manager if you do not receive a meeting invitation you are safe and I was like okay Hunger Games a little odd way to do it but you know in a zoom world I don't know if there is a better way to really like kind of mass do this where you can't have the information come out until it needs to come out but I just thought like it's anxiety that's a very like anxious feeling thing and also you got to know if you're the CEO and you say that people's minds just start racing in that direction they're just imagining what the next hour of their life is gonna be they're not even gonna hear the next three paragraphs you say like their mind is gone they checked out it's thinking about themselves and said whatever the next three paragraphs are ignore it so then he goes alright the moral conflict this is the part I thought was wack so he's like in a couple of town halls ago I said there was two perspectives around layoffs the first of the shareholder perspective we're reducing costs and protecting cash or what matters the second is the employee perspective with nothing matters more than saving jobs and helping employees in a you know in a time where it's like unemployment at levels of the Great Depression so each of these are clear they're unambiguous and they're correct from their perspective but they are diametrically opposed this creates a conundrum for CEO CEO sit between shareholders employees and wish that they could do both for every CEO they have to deal with this conflict I chose to manage this conflict by taking the shareholder perspective in deciding who should leave and take the employees backed it on how to help to me I was like what is this paragraph like dude yeah what the [ __ ] dude it's all the same you're just trying to build a company that makes profit and does work with good people that's the same thing yeah and like think about you have to think about your audience do you think your audience gives a [ __ ] about the shareholder perspective and the dilemma you have as a CEO and how you've chose to straddle this as a CEO it's not even about you so I just thought this was the part that was really odd to me that like see it seemed like he I don't know I wouldn't have included this in the statement and I thought that this made it look quite bad and I would not want other CEOs emulating this part of the statement because what matters is your audience as your employees and you need to know hey this is really hard for us we tried to analyze every situation cut every other dollar we could before we cut anyone's jobs and we did that but this is the this is the path we have to go you know this is I'm terribly sorry like I did not manage the company in a way where we had enough buffer this is a failing on my part this is the worst you know the worst day in my my time as a company and it is for all of us and so like here's what this means for you and like all you have to say is like this sucks we tried everything we could do this was the last resort and you know here's how we're gonna make it right by you and not like this theory about how shareholder value matters and the CEO has to like straddle these things it's like yeah I I think that and I think that that's not only does nobody care I think that that is just a silly way to look at it which is when you're building a company like step one is create something that people want and get it and get it into the hands get it into their hands in a profitable way okay that's step one like that that is just the the that's the basics of a company which is you make something that someone wants to give you money or you make something and you make a profit off of it right and if I was I don't think that's step one but that is the fundamental premises that's the fundamental that's a fundamental premises what I mean and so if I was him I'd be like look here's the deal like we expect we expect it to grow a lot faster and we're investing in this and the plan would have worked but this thing slowed everything down and so we just have to cut things that are not profitable right and that sucks and I'm sorry that that sucks but that's what's going to happen and think that if you just say that and a more straightforward way instead of all this shareholder value [ __ ] like you already know that you know they're all adults in the room to understand this [ __ ] crazy virus is happening in companies across the board or having trouble some companies have no revenue now like people get that that that's happening and it's just like okay so what's gonna happen at our company Oh at our company we they tried everything they could they're making the sort of this is what do you need to say was this was our last resort we did this in a way where we're not gonna have another round of layoffs because that creates you know I wouldn't say that I would I would say we're gonna try not to yeah like you know that is our goal and how we did this but even then that's speaking to the people who are staying you know really at this point you just have to speak to the total group and just say some of you gonna be affected here's how it works here's how we're doing our best to to make it right to do right by everybody who's done right by us this is no fault of your own this is a fault of ours in running a company that was not did not have the margin of error to do yeah I think that like what I would just say if I had to do this which I hope I never have to but me I probably really will have to one day not like I'm saying our company but well I'm not implying anything I'm just saying what if I have if I have a long career which I will that you gotta say look I have a hundred percent of the flock that I have to manage and take care of and sometimes that might mean that I have to fire 30% of the flock in order to take care of the other sixty and that it's just how life works and this just sucks and I'm trying to make this hat in such a way that the 40% are not completely hung out to dry but this is just what I have to do and I'm sorry that this is is the situation and if you want to blame someone blame me and that's that and that's pretty much all you have to say yeah exactly like you don't need the the epic speech and you know right now we're kind of like look I think we're clear that hey personally for us this didn't like come across great and we weren't like oh wow that was epic on the other side you know we're just kind of off the cuff coming up with what a what a better speech might be but the reality is that in this case they you basically have a speechwriter you have a multi-bit you have a billion-dollar company and you have time to think about this and this is the what we're reading is his output after thinking about it and so that's the part that I thought was also I wouldn't have published it I want to publish this because it's like you take this [ __ ] it take this on the chin like and by the way I know I'm criticizing this guy I don't know him he and I will tell us - I'll say this to his face and I'm sure he's actually a good good dude this is just a big Mis but I would say like dude you got to take this one on the chin and just like this is a loss and and say be a man and say what you want to say to your people which that's your fault that's wonderful I wouldn't publish this agreed I didn't understand that and also I'm not sure yeah I'm not sure what the with this world upside of was of that was now on the other hand I think they did something's great right so like the actual actions that they were taking it for people I thought were great they're like look we're gonna extend the Cobra health insurance till the end of the year because health insurance is super important especially right now and so they didn't have to do that but they did they remove people's cliff and they invested their shares that didn't have to do that but they did you know they they gave them I think about a bit of severance didn't after that but they did and then they have this sort of alumni network where they're trying to help people get jobs cool I like all of that like I liked all of that action I just didn't like the preamble and I didn't like the sort of pat on pepper seemed a little bit like pat me on the back please can I show you my leadership during this adverse time so you could like get tell me I did a good job and that's the part I didn't like I liked a lot of the action yeah and like you I don't know this guy so you know this is not no no personal thing again I I have friends who work with them and I've heard a lot of positive stuff I just think that like and III value I applaud Cardiff for raising this money and going big and trying to make something happen and I plod them from over for over hiring in hopes of like it working like I I applaud the risk-taking and I want people who are listening that just because Sean and I are criticizing this guy you got to take risk still and you got to try this big [ __ ] and it's not gonna work all the time good I mean not good but like whatever that's just you got it comes with the territory and I just wouldn't she would have took it on the chin a little bit more right okay I got another one more topic that's on a more positive note okay so I'm gonna wash I feel like I got a had some haterade spilled on me there I gotta wash that off yes by the way but Ron you and I typically are I'm rarely a hater exactly we're rarely haters no I really like yeah so I want to end this by saying I hope these guys crush it I hope they do wonderful I believe I think they actually will I just think that this one move was a stupid move and probably a very long and positive journey right and and look you know there's a big difference of criticizing a person versus criticizing an action or criticizing a you know something that was done and this is definitely like you didn't like the message not the dono don't even know the messenger can we just say by the way that a lot of people in media like in who have these podcasts and newsletters and they're all [ __ ] haters of the people they're covering it's not about the craziest thing ever yeah well I think it's like it's like a fair trade so so there's a guy Eric Weinstein have you heard this guy's podcast yes I like it it's called the portal smart guy I don't know too much about him he runs like Peter Till's fund and so he's been talking about this concept lately that's called kayfabe have you heard him talking about this no okay so he's like hey there's this wrestling term called kayfabe ka y fa b and he's like what kayfabe is is like you know in wrestling it's basically wrestling is a fake fight right WWE it's like a pre-arranged sort of agreed-upon fake fight where I'm the hero and you're the heel or I'm the good and you're the bad whatever and in it it's like the dialogue is sort of an agreed fight for both of our betterment like the more we feud the more popular we both become and the fight itself like okay we agree sort of agree to do this and so he talks about how this happens in the real world too like right now I see this whenever Trump goes and does his briefing and then there's that one guy from CNN gym off cost I think is his name yeah and he's always there and he Trump's like okay yeah you're next and it he asked this question and Trump like rips him and then that becomes like the seven-minute YouTube clip and CNN talks about it all day and like you know on one hand it's like why doesn't Trump just kick this guy out or like you know remove revoke his press you know credentials here on the other hand why doesn't this other guy you know either you know fight back or start or like take some other action every day the same sort of thing plays out and I think in reality it serves them both extremely well where CNN gets awesome content that people want to watch because it's juicy to see the president fight with somebody and Trump also loves the attention on the left on the right good and bad and then he drums it up as dude those liberals are always trying to say this and then the right supports him more because he has an enemy that's attacking right and so there's like this dance that they're doing so I get that and I get that but here's what I don't get so I'll give you a very specific example this pissed me off so much there's this woman named the Natasha t22 I forget what a Natasha - I don't know how to pronounce my last name I forget it though it's like his anyway she was a blogger for Valleywag which Valleywag was pretty funny and all but they took it too far all they did was made fun of Silicon Valley and then she worked at BuzzFeed and then Wired magazine and now she's at Washington Post and she had this article that says Silicon Valley now deems luxury housing and essentials and essential good good and so people are still building multi-million dollar condos and in the first [ __ ] line of the article it says the mayor has deemed luxury housing as well as all other types of housing including including housing projects and this other stuff as essential and it was in the technology section of the Washington Post yeah here is Natasha - tea - yeah Tiku tik you and I've better before and and I was like what the [ __ ] that's like saying like I'm gonna write an article in TechCrunch and be like can you believe this billionaires are able to buy 1 million dollar cars and then in the article humble but also anyone can buy any car including a $1,000 Mazda including a $20,000 Honda Civic including a $50,000 Mercedes I think what and then why is it in the tech section of Washington Post oh my god this pisses me off and so I looked this woman up and she's very educated she went to NYU and then like Columbia Journalism or like just like Ivy League just really smart woman and I'm like why would you study for eight years or however long it took and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars when you're just gonna to do this hey you're just gonna hate the people who you write about I don't understand it why not just go and write about something that like who you want to celebrate of course they'll say we don't hate them we're just you know we're reporting on that we're reporting the stories we don't have we don't hate them so there was a really interesting thing that happened recently where for coronavirus there's this guy Balaji who's on Twitter pretty popular guy he was at Andreessen Horowitz a bunch of stuff there's a coin base and things like that so he's kind of one of those like on the forefront of things guys so back in January he showed up at a crypto Meetup he was wearing gloves and a mask and this was January when nobody in the US was really worried about this and everyone's kind of laughing like what are you doing he's like well you know I think that's just a you know you know maybe small probability but that this coronavirus thing that's happening in Wuhan is gonna be like a major you know global pandemic and people okay Balaji all right thanks and so this writer came out and about box bought the Vox of RICO writer yeah so Rico Dreamcoat oh my god this imperious me so the quick story here is the recode rider reaches out to Paulo G and says like hey I want to get your comment on a story we're doing about you know Silicon Valley's reaction to the corona virus this was again early on and he was like yeah I'm not interested why don't you report on like who cares about Silicon Valley's what the Silicon Valley elite think about coronavirus like you should report on the state of testing the state of the the you know the spread of the virus and all these other like kind of like important facts that should be reported on and he tweeted out that he did that that happened he screenshotted heard E and tweeted it and then all the journalists were like dude she was just asking for comment why are you putting on blast this is why people hate Silicon Valley and he was like no no no I know this game and he so he talked about this he's like this is a strategy called befriend and betray where the journalist comes to uses hey Balaji you're an expert I would love to get your take on this thing and all they're trying to do is write the story and what the headline of the story came out was something along the lines of like you know why Silicon Valley's not doing handshakes anymore and it was like laughing at Silicon Valley sort of for overreacting to the corona virus this was early on before all the long time he said he goes I promise you the headlines gonna be right lookin Valley nerds refused to shake hands and I never what it was pretty much what it was now the body of the article I went back and read it was actually you know somewhat fair was just reporting what was going on how whatever but he was right about the headline and the headlines often written not by the journalist but by the editor cuz editor need to drive clicks blah blah blah anyway so this is pretty interesting feud if you want to hear more the Jason Calacanis did a podcast apology that I thought was pretty awesome so I can't I can't stand that at particularly given like me like people always like oh you're a tech bro and the odd some journalists will say that I'm like you work at Vox if I'm tech so are you like what does that mean like like I have a journalist in New York Times come and interview me she's like so what do you and you're like tech bro friends talk about yeah I was gonna ask you to do this so tell the story your New York Times story this is an amazing story you've told me yeah so first of all like I made sure I recorded it in a head because I knew so I knew that this person was gonna take me out of context what was the context you went to New York or no she came here she goes hey you seem like an insider I want to come and learn all the things that people are gonna are talking about befriend yeah and I go okay fine come I know what you're doing come on and but maybe it could be positive like maybe we'll become like we can exchange cool information maybe you'll write something positive about me maybe I'll just whatever it may be it'll turn out good and she comes she goes can I record this I go yeah I'm gonna record it too and and because I didn't want anything to be taken out of context and she goes so like you're like a tech bro like what do you and your tech friends talk about and your bro-friends and I was like first of all why are you calling me a bro like it what are you and your tech chick friends like why would you ever say that to me you don't know me and that's just rude to say anyway and I and she I go well I don't know you I go your attack you tell me she goes no I work at New York Times I was like you guys just announced that most of your revenue comes from digital like Europe why am i tech and you're not tax like you are attacking Jews well it's just different I was like well you tell me what you you you and your tech friends talk about and she goes well we're not what ever she like reddit I was like anyway I go well we talk about uh just like you know sports and I was like I don't know we just talk about normal stuff like cool diets or like cool food like all types of weird stuff and it was just so odd she was just so trying to like it was so much like an other like I am an other from you and I'm like I don't I don't understand this this this this dichotomy here like we are actually in the same industry I work in publishing so do you we both make most of our money from the internet like why are you calling me this tech bro I you don't even know me and she's like what you don't listen to Joe Rogan do you I'm like well yeah I do I listen to a lot of cool stuff I I read and this is true every morning I go to CNN and then I go to Fox News and then I go to HuffPo and then I go to break part because those are all like kind of the opposite I read all types of stuff I like to orokin I like Oprah I do all types of stuff why are you trying to like set me up for this gotcha moment right and it was horrible I hated it and so to sum this up the headline by the way we have it multi-million dollar mansions high-rise waterfront condos and a stately Victorian all deemed quote essential under public health orders in San Francisco and Silicon Valley that was the headline and then in the first paragraph it said it said restated the headline and then added as well as housing projects and low-income housing all deemed essential right oh my god I can't stand it I'm like why would you I love those we bought when we bought Bebo back so we had bought Bebo from me out of an auction and we were gonna relaunch it as something and so nobody knew that we had bought it back it was like done in a court room was like kind of on the low and there was a new reporter and we you know we were kind of friendly I guess we had friends of friends that were mutual and so I was like okay hey you know I want to give you a scoop and you know on the embargo and like come to an interview and whatever so she was like great comes over doesn't an interview explain the whole thing where you talk about what we're doing blah blah blah next day the article comes out and this is the person we gave the scoop to we could have given it anyone next day article comes out headline was remember Bebo yeah that'd be but it was like it was something like you know remember Bebo yeah it's dead but maybe you know it was like something like Bebo is dead remember Bebo literally it was like lol was like in the headline it was like making fun of and then the whole article was our conversation we talked about it was like legit it so I'd text her I was like what the [ __ ] what is this headline and she was like I'm sorry like I don't get to do the headlines my editor does the headlines and he just like you know he's gonna do what's gonna drive the most clicks and like he decided the thing that would drive the most clicks is talking [ __ ] about the buyback and like yeah right like it's like buying my space back and trying to relaunch it and so I was like you know that's that's fair but wow what a shitty moved to pull when you're sort of given a embargo you and you have all these other elements of the story that you could have like used as the lead shut eye I don't blame I don't blame her or him because like I think that if you just because you gave her an embargo like she should be still say the truth and say her opinion like and she sent the hole back if she thinks you're stupid and what you're doing is stupid she just because you gave her that she should say it that's that's true the two things that I thought were weird were number one the headline and the story were so disconnected the story was what she actually thought in the content about interview which I posits frustrating and then the headline was just something completely different that was written by a completely different person and just shows kind of like the way that those organizations work the second thing I thought was kind of whack was like no heads up like there's a sort of a human connection to this - right like if I've done you a favor by giving you an exclusive piece of news even if you're gonna write something that you know I'm not gonna like when you're like lol this thing is dead Yeah right it's not gonna come back then you know to surprise the person I think is an unnecessary extra slap versus like just I so disagree with you out I totally grew at your first point but I don't agree at your second point which is if I'm gonna say something negative about you I'm not gonna give you a heads up I'm just gonna say it but let's dum-dum business right you you cut yourself out then go on forward right like we had a bunch of other stories that came out in the coming years and guess who like never got a word right her she doesn't cut herself out for no reason yeah I mean I think it's a it's definitely it's a hard thing to balance and this is why some people like for example if someone says that they're a conservative news site well the reason one of the reasons why they probably could keep giving conservative people a good look is so they can get positive they can yeah so it's definitely hard but me personally if you if like if someone comes on this podcast and they go like oh like will you make me look good I'm like no I'm not gonna make you look good I'm not gonna make you look bad like we'll talk and if I think you say something dumb I'm just gonna tell you that's stupid right like I'm not so III think that I think that if I agree with that game I've got to suffer the both the positive and the negative consequences and the positive consequences is maybe they're gonna think I'm great and they'll tell the truth and also as a quote journalist or I don't know what you want to call me or both of us we're gonna like find the truth but also if someone thinks that about us and it's negative we got to live by that yeah I don't mind getting negative press I did mind the sort of dissonance and also I don't know like I just think like it is again bad business for that person because you burn your own bridge whereas if you're like hey look like just wanna let you know like the articles gonna talk about this and it's gonna mention this right it's gonna be there's gonna be some negative parts which were skeptical about and the disease cool could have kept that relationship didn't lost the relationship maybe doesn't affect me it affected them maybe telling you ahead of time is gonna be negative is that but like if I think that what you say is [ __ ] I'm gonna say no matter what yeah that no but nobody wants the other side right otherwise nobody will read the [ __ ] if you're not telling you like it is if you're not telling your actual opinion then the you know the whole ecosystem doesn't work but all right anybody do we have any other ones we want to talk about yeah well I was gonna say didn't someone come on the show and I was like I'm gonna tell this person I think there's that that that what they're doing is really stupid and it's definitely awkward what did that happen you remember that remember that no man I think Henry was here oh oh I know what it was it was the the woman from Everly well I think she came on with the tests oh I know I was like I think nutritional testing is [ __ ] right and you said it straight to her face and she answered I'm gonna trying to Pat myself on the back I'm trying to say like I don't even remember like did we call her out you literally said it to her I kind of facility pot out oh yeah you did why don't you tell her what you think about tell her what you were saying like you know just get it say yeah definitely set it up it's definitely awkward like before and after you're like be nice like I'm definitely gonna roast you right now it's super awkward but I think if you do in a certain way sound that bad it's like because and they should understand okay one last thing we but we wouldn't totally went off the rails here go ahead well I think what yeah we did go throw this bike can talk about like beekeeping and like all kinds of [ __ ] but whatever so I'm gonna take my hat off and so I clearly need a haircut my friend Greg launched this company or a text night company he just create a website called you probably need a haircut calm and it's basically surfing quickly off the the the quarantine stuff where people are locked at home everyone's hairs growing out nobody Erica you shaved a mohawk what he's doing is he's barbers who are also out of work they're at home they can do a zoom consultation and basically help you cut your own hair and so that's awesome if you need a haircut you prop your hair looks good did you cut it no I'm gonna cut it dude it's awful it's yeah right now I agree actually it does look good man but I looked at it before this hat was on it and it looked awful so I'm gonna come I've been cutting my own hair for ten years now I have I've had the Clippers I can tell you all that I know how to do a fade the other day I did shave it completely bald because I wanted to feel about Sarah my wife will help me but for years I would do to my own and admittedly it probably didn't look great but I watched videos on how to like give a fade right and I it's not that hard but I I've been doing it for years just because for a long time I was poor and I didn't want to pay money but now I do it cuz I'm like aha I don't want to like to drive they're annoying to go and plus they always make me take my headphones out and I'm like well now I'm bored like you don't understand I constantly have information going in through my eyes or my ears and now you're making me just sit here like yes and also I just don't want to talk to them and I'm like I don't know like so so what I do is I close my eyes and that's a sign for now but I but I wish that there was like an app like further out of certain barbers words like click like do not talk to me or talk to me right because like for weird like people like me I'm like I'm just super I don't like the confrontation I just don't want I don't want to talk to leave me alone I might have a conversation dude I'm like that a [ __ ] grocery stores you know Jack Jack Smith he we're like the same way we go to grocery stores and I'm like if I don't see what I don't want to if I don't see what I want to buy even though they probably have it but in a different section I don't buy it I just won't buy it instead of or if I'm with Sarah be like Sarah we go ask for this like I don't even want to talk to anyone right I think a lot of people are like that yeah add this into Eber where you could get in and be like yo let's not let's not do that thing where we talk yes yes it's awesome I just don't I'm just like uncomfortable and I don't want to [ __ ] do it more Barbara so yeah you know the last thing to know what they need at Barbara's is it just need like six different haircuts for men and you just like give me the four but they do have that a lot of a lot don't and you say the same thing like short on the side a little bit off the top like everyone's like you just like show me a picture of like five people and I'll just point a lot of barbers don't have that yet or dude it could be unspoken it's because everybody just wants short on the side a little less fluid on top but shorter than it is currently and you should only have to say anything if you want some other [ __ ] like oh I'm going for this other look I wanna have a look okay then I told me to tell you about the look but if not I just want to sit down no words just do the short on the sides a little short on top same just like give me like three options like completely bald like a whatever the three are and I'll just point at one of them and by the way just don't talk to me and once I initiate conversation and do my eyebrows because they're getting a little longer I got long eyebrows everyone knows that that's number four and also they say like do you want your you want the back your neck around it or squared I'm like right I don't know I don't know there yeah like I don't see it you you be the judge right exactly and I've at one time I asked him I was like what's the deal with this question because I don't know and like is there a difference what's the deal and then someone told me actually one of the barbers actually taught me they were like look if you do square when it starts to grow back out it's gonna look shitty so it looked good initially but then it looks it'll look obviously not square after it starts to grow out he's like do the round because then even as it grows back it's like blends in it's not so bad dude this sounds like a Larry David episode like a like so what's the rounded square what's it like I mean we tried right so this one went off the rails I think people this is gonna hit with some people so tweet at me and Sean and let us know if this like random [ __ ] yeah just tweet like yo stick to the script if you want us to not go off the rails as much or just say go off the rails if you want to sell the goods the good news is Sean is we don't have to do that much work to research for next Tuesday because we I actually had some stuff to go over because we got stuck on journalists and beekeeping and a bunch of stupid [ __ ] yeah I'm mad again about that article from 10 years ago now I'm like still me too I got bad I'm friends with the woman who I talk to my own friends with her on Facebook and I like called her out and it never [ __ ] wins when I argue people online I'm gonna die end up looking like it I look like an [ __ ] and it just doesn't work and I do it all the time okay [Music]

what happened you've lost five million dollars back another episode of the greatest podcast ever created my first million oh what's going on how are you I'm thriving I'm actually really hot in this room but I'm thriving you want to talk about Andrew will consider I've been thinking about him a lot he's on your mind got a crush let's see on your mind yeah I mean we did an episode with him I thought was great I think he's great and the reaction was great so that's triple great for Maya and what's on your mind I just think he's great in say think it's you I just think that he was smart good attitude I think that the reason I like talking to him is because as I'm in San Francisco there's this constant mindset that I'm so thankful that I've surrounded myself with which is all these people who like have these ideas and someone were really dumb ideas and they raise a lot of money for them and they become huge and some of the dumb ideas become awesome and that's fantastic and a lot of the dumb ideas remain dumb and just a lot of money was wasted and there's just a lot of mentality things that are in San Francisco that I love but a lot of it has downsides it's nice to hear something from Andrew who just totally does not do anything that I'm used to and I love it yeah I also like how he's kind of a one-man crew like I know he obviously has CEOs for companies and it sounds like he has a partner but like I read his blog that Tim writing when we were you know when we're talking on the phone the strategy is like he thought it was he's an original thinker so he basically decided how he wanted to live his life and then lived his life that way and his decision was his it was not like oh I just chose of these five popular paths I picked path for it's like now he picked path 7 which was just a path they you know him and few other people have made for themselves yeah I just always think it's great to hear from people who do things totally different than what you think you should be doing and it's just nice to hear there's a fresh perspective and for those who don't know didn't listen didn't care the things in my opinion that he did differently sort of like okay where did he say who andrew is oh yeah so Andrew he owns his company called tiny if you go to tiny capital calm you could see it and he's trying to do this sort of Warren Buffett model where he buys what he thinks are wonderful businesses he plans to hold them for a long time he has operators who run them and he has a holding company that owns all of them and sort of the net value is you know over a hundred million dollars for these companies down he's he basically had nobody in the way that he financed it was he started an agency when he was nineteen he's probably thirty-three thirty-four now right and so that like a little cash cow exactly so started that agency kind of in his parents basement type of thing did that for many years like I don't know a decade or so and then got it to the point where he had a bunch of free cash flows like okay what do I do with this money and decided to invest it buying business so well the way I think he zigged what everyone else sagged was the Canada decision so contrary you know so what conventional wisdom is you gotta be in Silicon Valley you got to be New York LA wherever wherever the hubs are and he was like no I'm gonna live where I want to live and I'm gonna take advantage of some of the arbitrage opportunities of you know he charged San Francisco rates to his companies he was doing designs for but he paid his people you know local rates for doing the work that they were doing and so his agency was wildly profitable and that compounded over like a decade which is great so Canada was one contrary decision the other one was buying businesses for just building them so building businesses very sexy heroic you're a genius you're Steve Jobs by business buying you know a business that does two million dollars in revenue and 1 million dollars or even uh you don't get that same sort of props but his take was like I think that a building is sort of fun and he still does it but overrated and over indexed on versus buying where there's way more opportunities so I thought that was another one and I went to Canada I went and hung out with him for a couple days we almost did business together and I was like I can't find a flight to directly to Victoria so Andrew lives in Victoria which is like a it feels like a small European town I don't know how many to live there maybe 300 thousand maybe less maybe maybe less actually maybe 200,000 and I was like I can't find a direct flight it's okay we'll get you up here and he chartered a jet for me it was awesome it was great so I'm happy I'm friends with him yeah he was a good guy I think we should have on the punch yeah it's like once a month at the minimum and it should just be a friend friend of the show do you want to talk about something that is that I found on the Internet I think is I don't know if it's real or not tell me more okay so there's this guy named Sam Evans have you heard of this person you know you had mentioned his name and I was like Sam instead of heard of it sounds like a fake name and then I googled him and I saw his face I was like oh I've seen this guy on my Facebook feed this guy advertises a lot so tell me about I don't know much about tell me yeah so the way it started was he's a New Zealand guy he's maybe 30 years old and he started what he claims is a consultant consulting business which basically he would talk to small barbers or I don't know what type of small companies small local things that wanted more leads and he would help them like optimize Yelp or something like that and I think that was mildly successful and from there if he goes well I'm just gonna teach other companies how to do this and so he created a course and he named it consulting.com and at this point now there's three courses so the first course is creating a consulting business which is like you do stuff for local companies like to be a consultant yeah this course teaches you how to be a consultant obviously that's like the model lets you make more money teaching people and then actually doing the thing and so he it's cost two grand and they started making money off that and then that teaches you how to go from zero to some sustainable business and then from there there's a $5,000 course which teaches you how to go from a hundred five hundred thousand dollar company to a million dollar company and then there's a higher end which is 50 grand and that teaches you how to go from 1 million to eight figures right and his website like I don't know if this is like a get rich scheme like I can't tell because it is so elaborate that it could be true but it seems so good to be true and he claims to do something like 50 or 60 million dollars a year in sales with 50% margin on his website is consulting.com yeah great man yeah but like when you click through it it all seems so good to be true like there's like video reviews and I am I know how to like hack that together yeah of course you can make something look totally legit in like 6 hours with two rebels but his stuff is so it's so elaborate so if it is a scheme and then I looked at his Glassdoor reviews and like none it some sometimes I think this adds up to be legit or this adds up to where this is just a massive fraud or scam it's very interesting and so he says on the website 20,000 active students if we take the lowest paid plan that you mentioned mm that's 40 million a year of recurring revenue well no it's not recurring it's just a one-time okay that's 40 million in sales right not over not and the sale is a digital course great yeah so it could be very profitable - ad spend right so maybe you percent margin or something like that yeah it's super interesting it's very interesting but like so you go from level one beginner level to master to level three god damn don't you just want to spend that 50 grand to become a level 3 god but it's so interesting because if you like if you had cash flow each year like what's the amount of cash flow that you need each year to where you think that you don't like that you couldn't spend that amount like 20 million dollars probably right oh yeah I think that's high I don't think he'd spend more than 5 million dollars a year net taxes like after time for taxes yeah maybe you could dude I think what's two hundred thousand dollars a month that's a three million dollars a year I could spend three million dollars a year pretty easily doing what I've got a friends who live in Long Island what would you do and they spent 80 grand a month I mean I would I would just have two huge houses and a full staff to take care of me I mean would be a company right I would have a handful of cars into a nice house and then another house and the warm weather right and I would fly private and you're still under the five million right that's three point six million that you said so okay maybe maybe you need tena as a buffer I just think that you could do it so you're saying this might be a tremendous business and it's a little discussion about detectors go I wanted to know if you had ever heard of this or if the listeners ever heard of this and if this is legit some of our trend subscribers told me they subscribe to it and they're like I got I got a lot of value out of it yeah I would believe that so so I'll tell you kind of my closest experience with something like this so first of all no I've never heard of this and I don't know any entrepreneurs in San Francisco where all my friends are from that do anything like this but the I mean it's not valuable the closest thing I did to this was sort of going into the Tony Robbins pipeline and so I've tried but much times about Tony Robbins how great he is and blah blah blah I like him a lot I got a lot of value got to go into his workshop it was all with you and I bet well because it freaked me out yeah and a lot of people get freaked out of people's preconception is just this is like a cult this guy's a snake oil salesman or whatever yeah like what am I getting myself into and I gotta admit like when I went there I was like okay cool I'm going but I'm not doing any of that dancing [ __ ] I'm just uh I'm just here for the information I'm gonna sit down I'll be quiet I'm not gonna yell not gonna hug I'm not gonna dance and he sat separately so you wouldn't be embarrassed if you do well my brother-in-law and we just agreed beforehand we're like you know we might end up doing the dancing [ __ ] so you sit on that side of the room I'm sitting on this side of the room and let's see we didn't see each other except for at the end of the night when the event would end each day and we would get back together but anyways by you know our one I'm dancing and doing all the good stuff too but anyways it was a lot of value and you know it cost me like a thousand bucks to go do this thing I thought horrendous and then in the thing like he up smells just like this guy does right so he's like you know one of the first kind of I don't know coaches lifestyle coaches business coaches out there and he's been doing this for 40 years now so he went from audiotapes two books two infomercials now the internet like whatever the channel was he wrote it and was like I'm the business cares I'm the lifestyle coach and you know I got a lot of value and at one point he upsells his business mastery class or his business mastery thing it's like okay if you like this if you like how you're feeling right now and right after he makes you feel great he's like you know that table over there is for anybody who wants to grow their business it's ten thousand dollars you spent five days with me and if you don't get a million dollars of value from this thing I will give you all your money back and in the moment I was like dude I got a million dollars of value today you know of course I would do that so I didn't actually sign up for it but our buddy see him it did and winter he did so I believe so and so you know sorry see if I got that wrong but I'm pretty sure he told me he did and I have several friends who actually did it as well and they said they're like yeah it's great and if you have a business that's doing you know if you have a business your size right your business is worth tens of millions of dollars if you can get a sort of 2 percent 3 percent 5 percent lift yeah in your business just through improving your own psychology your own enthusiasm your own tactics it's obviously paid itself off right so how does the infrastructure of this work like I'm looking at it now does you just Tony Robbins literally have to be at all the things no so well he does his live events yes so he's the Traveling Salesman that does the live events and he probably does I don't know I'm gonna get it wrong but like let's call it 20 to 40 live events a year a lot that's a lot you know every week he every week or two he's somewhere and then he has his sort of like army of like coaches that are trained under him bit by the way they all seemed garbage and so he has this you know the people who are the actual coaches that will call you and do all this other stuff with you they are you know like there's like a fleet of them I don't know a hundred and hundred people that and just need a coach structure is garbage those people are garbage when I met them I was not impressed in fact on the days so tell her I'm gonna do this for 40 years to the point where he's been public speaking on stages hype and crowds up for like 40 years right so he can't actually do two days back-to-back so he does day one and it goes from 8 a.m. till 1 a.m. and there's no breaks you can go to the bathroom but you missing the action when you go it has just talk and the whole time he's on stage he's talking and he's got 10,000 people in an audience I've been twice now I should have been three times that so the first time I was just experiencing it the second times I was observing it because I took a fleet of friends I bought tickets for my family and friends I was like this is the best gift I can give you and they loved it most of them and so anyways he holds people's attention for like 14 hours straight which is incredible you know you can't most people can't you know listen to a six-minute youtube video and have their attention held but then the second day it's not him on stage because his vocal cords are shredded so he can't speak the next day and this like his number two comes up and this guy is a good public speaker but he's not like it's like Michael Jordan and then you go down to BJ Armstrong and it's like oh no I came here to for Michael Jordan and so literally this guy just he says stuff and then he tees up a video of Tony talking 10 years ago when he used to do this like he used to do all four days himself oh my god he queues up the the video of telling me and you sit there and you're watching youtube videos with 10,000 other people and this guy is just moderating it it's like this bizarre experience that's crazy I didn't really sell it very well but I'll tell you this that was probably the best the best money I've ever spent on anything self-improvement wise if you add up all the books or anything else it's not even close maybe I should do it you stole you should totally do it I took about 20 people so I paid for 20 people's tickets to go see gran yeah I basically became an affiliate for him I didn't get paid I just I believed in it so much I paid for 20 other people to go and since then and it's been four years since then and of them I would say four people were like me where they were like a holy [ __ ] life changed that was the most valuable thing it's a 4 out of 20 let's say and then another let's call it I don't know 15 were kind of like that was amazing and I talked to him a year later they're like disappointed in themselves that they didn't carry it forward they're like God it was so good and I had so much clarity and I had so much energy but I'm kind of mad at myself I just kind of let it fade from there like I really remember I just remember what I felt then and yeah I guess I didn't really get too much value because I'm not doing any of the things I wanted to do you know after that weekend well and then there's no three or four people that literally left they were like this is way too culty this is pop science I don't like this I don't believe this I don't like how he's manipulating everybody I'm out and I was like okay that's the spectrum anyone I know um Alex from calm the founder of calm he hated it and so he just went for a bike ride and I think in the middle of one of the days because he was like it's just too much for me he's like I don't I didn't I didn't feel good and what was going on and so I left I rode my bike around the city and I had fun doing that and what was the number one takeaway for me oh dude I have a notepad full that I call the Bible cuz I was like this is the closest thing that I have to religion right it's like religion and it smelled like God religion is like an operating philosophy for life right that's what that's what people use religion for them anyways like you know don't harm your neighbor blah blah blah like it's an operating philosophy so this was an operating philosophy so I'll give you two of the Nuggets right so the first one is the quality of your life is equal to the quality of the emotions you have on a day to day basis so what is that mean it's kind of a mouthful but like we're both in a good position we're very privileged or more successful than we ever thought we would be seven years ago probably like the position we're in now seven years ago us would have been envious of that but your happiness is not like ten times more than it was seven years ago right like you're probably feeling about the same and the reason why is that you know life is not about you know what you have and what you've achieved it's about who you've become and so what most people what most people miss is that if you are it doesn't matter if you're rich doesn't matter if your family doesn't matter if you have a you know if you're famous if the emotions that you're feeling on a day-to-day basis are stressed then you have a shitty quality of life if you're feeling anger or upset then you have a shitty quality of life regardless of everything else and so then the question is how do you figure out how to like change your emotions on a day-to-day basis so you're feeling good every day regardless of your situation it's the ants and select so he gives you three three you like to lose all right here's the three ways you change how you feel the very first thing is your butt is physical so if you change your if you have a radical chains and your physiology calls it which it basically means if you did a bunch of push-ups if you're exercised if you ran if you jumped into a cold pool or or why people like taking out hot showers it's a relaxed the fastest way to change how you feel is to physically change your body in fact Emmett who's the CEO twitch was telling me the other day or he was kind of talking about this on Twitter people have panic attacks and when you have a panic attacks really uncomfortable feeling and most people panic attacks really want a solution of like how do I not get these and I take medicine and so some people take medicine and that's one way to change your physiology is chemically changing your physiology what most people try to do is like people try to help people think their way out of it they're like oh just no don't be so anxious and you need to just relax I'm like as if that can help that's like best if that was that easy yeah we would all do it and actually what science has shown is that the fastest most effective kind of quick and dirty way to stop a panic attack is to plunge your face into really cold water if you do that right at the start of panic attack it will stop it because your fight-or-flight will kick in and it'll override that and so one time one time I accidentally ate brownies up my roommate made and they turn out to be edible brownies and I don't smoke weed and I hate weed so much like I don't do any of that and I was like James I'm flipping out he goes yeah I'm sorry those were weed brownie and I I started having a panic attack and I went and gotten a cold shower and that was no help oh nice okay yes so that's fastest way to change what you feel is your body either through heat cold or getting your heart rate up and exercising and it doesn't be like go to the gym it can be like if you did ten jumping jacks you will feel different than you did but right before that the second one is focused so what are you going to focus on so you you know where you place your focus is going to judge how what your brain is what your brain is basically signaling to your body of how to feel so if you're focused on pain then you're gonna feel shitty if you focused on how somebody did wrong how this cut you off in traffic you're gonna get outraged but if you focus on things you're grateful for if you focus on things are going well if you focus on things that are that you can trust that you can rely on you'll feel different and then the last one is I think it's like language so you language your story which is basically the words you use in the store you tell yourself the big the big idea and I recommend this to anybody who's in business which is the quality of your results is linked to your quality of your decisions and the quality of your decisions is linked to the quality of the internal monologue you have so the conversation you have with yourself ends up dictating the decisions you make which ends up dictating the results you get and that's kind of what I pulled away from the whole thing and then it's a whole bunch of strategies to do that better I think you just saved me a thousand dollars well you got to get up and dance with the wise in the state this is awesome oh yeah I always hesitate to talk about it cuz it's like I'm a preachy but I think it helps some people it's never preachy when you can make fun of it so like you you do a good job of making fun of something and then you explain what it is so that's never preachy all right let's do let's do a little different let's do we started this joking segment called the billionaire of the week Billy of the week and I think we should actually continue it I loved it I owe your guys save your Neil I went and look you talked about him two weeks ago and I went and read all about him he mostly speaks French and all this talks on YouTube so it was kind of marred - you got to read along he's badass I love that guy okay and you had one that you were thinking about who's the week yeah let me pull my note so his name's Michael lo have you heard of him I had not okay so Michael Loeb in the 90s I'm pulling up my notes he started this thing called synapse group and basically what they did was this was before a lot of things were popular on the internet and so they patented I don't know how they did this there must've been something unique about it but they patented the subscription model I don't yeah I don't know like how that there's some really maybe great things that are a little bit beyond what I'm able to understand but whole day it made money off that patent or the but everybody does it well so they they just trade a unique way to do it and I think I don't know exactly how it worked but basically Time magazine Meredith which is a huge magazine publisher all these magazine publishers would pay them money to get them more subscriptions because this way in which they were able to get people to renew subscriptions must have been fantastic and it worked really well I don't understand how it worked then basically what it seems now is like a really robust affiliate network so like Meredith will cross sell Meredith which is a three billion dollar company based out of Minnesota I believe bought the company synapse for a lot of money and they deployed it across all their brands so it's kind of he made it big through the synapse group which was a magazine subscription thing yeah it definitely made him wealthy he didn't make him a billionaire but it made him he definitely got wealthy what made him really wealthy was with his co-founder of synapse he wasn't sort of Christ flying and Priceline eventually I think are they are they owned by Expedia or they don't think I'm not sure looking looking so it now it's just a huge you know huge thing so that made them very wealthy but what's interesting is after that he started like the what used to be part of just like a rich entrepreneurs playground where they just launched companies right it's called Loeb and Loeb NYC and they've started a whole bunch of companies including a company called I believe it's called scrip relief do you know what that is no so what you do is you go to it they started companies like or they use they used to own script relief and then they renamed it just something else but basically what you do is you go to the website and you can get discounts off of your pharmaceutical drugs and so like if you want to buy if you have Zanna X or some type of acne medicine or something like that somehow they they they get access to these deals and use that coupon code at CVS and you get a discount and it's paid for sending CVS business and they made that business we talked about on the podcast call oh thanks that'd be to be gifting things which like it's in their area yeah so they and he owns a lot of them and a business-like script relief was making something like 100 million dollars a year in profit and so some of his companies are really big now here's another reason why he's interesting do you ever watch that TV show billions of it you know the house at Bobby Axelrod okay that's his house that's Michael Loubs house okay last year or two years ago Michael Loeb had a big party like a fundraiser like a sophisticated thing and his son brought some friends along and some of the 18 year old friends got drunk and started kissing on the front yuan and just looking like a fool and soullow punched one of the kids in the nose and broke his nose and might go to jail for it he just punch this kid one time but he hurt him pretty bad he's a bit of jail for just that they're they're trying to get him to go to jail for that I mean that's a salt if you Burt if you hurt someone you can get one if you weren't a billionaire you definitely could go to jail for that they're trying to get him to go to jail I have a feeling he's just gonna write a fat check I mean yeah like kid was it's probably just a rich snobby so where do you see this Scripps thing there's not even on their website I talked to people who work there ah Sam doing this thing investigative journalist Sam I like it there so Google and let's see Michael Loeb Google Michael Loeb scrip relief it's it's on his LinkedIn yeah I see it now it's renamed something else though do you say what it's renamed to I'm checking but you know it's logging into LinkedIn is like you know taking the first ten steps into Hill so I'm gonna try this now scrip relief was recently sold to United Healthcare over five million users yeah so it was sold to someone else and now it's called something else but he just has like a web of companies and he's just super interesting because this is gonna sound weird when you look at this guy do you do you think this guy looks like a billionaire does this guy look like a successful guy no that's why he doesn't he looks like a guy who would punch a kid in the face yeah he looks like a guy he's like better about his life and punch the kid with face for that reason not punch a kid in the face because he's a billionaire and the kid Distan his pool oh he looks like he would be punching kids in the face regardless of what his financial status was that's why he's interesting to me so I have such a mugshot Google is able to go looks like he looks like he looks like a tough guy yeah he looks yeah he looks like a tough guy he looks like an enforcer that a billionaire would have he's a building of he looks like a billionaires enforcer yeah that's why I think this person is interesting because dang they have a picture of the kid who did not expect to just see those two side-by-side that's yeah this is quality this is quality Google when they are searching it's good right look at that kid he definitely has a punchable whole face yeah well the kid looks like he did something he's even he's like kind of smug in the picture he's a broken nose he's in the hospital shirts covered in blood he's got a little smirk on him yeah super interesting person right yes okay I like this guy I never even heard of this guy I feel like you know a bunch of these guys that are like the either media Titans or like these other like New York you know New York rich people I only know like San Francisco were like Dubai rich people I know them because I spend time I'm a Wikipedia because my way of building businesses is I'd like to see what has worked and I I reverse engineer how it worked and I'm like I'm gonna deploy that on my company right and when I'm reverse engineering things I'll like read about the company right well now see who started it and I'm like no wait that guy started it oh but he was friends with this person and they partnered previously I bet he had access to that's probably how so like I like under so I just like reverse engineer things yeah I like that and then you call people which most people don't do you get up the phone you start calling people work at the company you get that extra 10% that you needed right to get lots of helps because oh I've made friends but someone who started his thing so now if I want to meet him I have it in right so okay so I have another example of what you just said I was gonna save this guy for next week but we're gonna do a double billionaire of the week so we're doing a double Billy special get your get your Billy's right now Richard Burton okay say have you heard of this guy Richard Burton is it Burton Snowboards no so this guy I started a couple of different companies so it's just if you just google Richard Burton I did earlier and nothing came up did I saying his name wrong I think he got it wrong because I did no no okay he Barton sorry Barton not Burton okay so Richard Barton so this guy started Zillow he also started one of your favorite sites class door he also started he has three so he has Zillow he has glass door and what's his other one I was just research this for next week so we're just gonna do this live here and he did Expedia in Expedia board of directors on Netflix he did Expedia Zillow and Glassdoor what a [ __ ] baller okay yeah yeah so ok so how did this happen so I've listened this interview with this guy like five years ago before this podcast even started before this podcast was even a little you know sperm in my balls and when I when I looked at this guy the one thing that stood out to me was he had a very simple thesis that he used to start all these companies which was information wants to be free so K what does information wants to be free man so he was basically like I'm gonna bring transparency to industries that are that are not transparent and so he said you know let's take Zillow for example before Zillow when they sort of online house propane and house search companies existed like Trulia and all this red fan stuff like that the MLS listings were something that only the agents and brokers had access to and so this is they were dick keepers they were like oh you want to know what's on the market let me literally print out the MLS papers and I'll show you the show you these and all tour you through these companies that's so great line dude information that one information once you got information wants to be free and so then he did the same thing in travel right we had travel agents who were the brokers who you had to call and be like hey I'd like to get a flight I don't want to pay too much and that you just trust it hopefully this agent is gonna do we were gonna do their job they're gonna know all the different options different times different airports and they're gonna find me something that fits my needs and Expedia was just a search bar that would just tell you here's all the flights you decide here's the information you don't need to go to a travel agent anymore and Glassdoor is the same thing you wanted to know what's it really like to work there and employers have no desire to put that out there they don't want anybody to know any of the bad things that happen you know the working environment of their company and employees were often scared to do it because they would sign things so it'd be like you know non-disclosure whatever non slander if you're the term for it is non-disparagement and so Glassdoor was unleashing the information about what's it like to work at X company and so I love how this guy literally on one thesis has started three multi-billion dollar companies off that one premise and so that was when I when I did what you're talking about I reverse engineering how did this guy do it it wasn't oh how did he build Expedia how did he build illah it was how did you even get this idea oh okay what other industries today lack transparency where I can open them what are they do well if now that's a billion-dollar idea I need to have let's think of some one of them is pricing for enterprise software right what is find out how much money your company makes and then they go okay we're gonna charge you this right I like that like like I hate that call for pricing model I mean I I hate it but it works we do it so AngelList did this in a way as well when you were able to figure out who's invested in what that used to be like sort of not easy to find information it wasn't sort of like totally guarded but I crunch mice as well I'm literally just looking at the tabs that I have open right like Yelp yeah I'll put something like that too you know how what is like to eat there the review system it organized and made public information that people wanted that was not super transparent before this yeah I mean housing he did that there's a lot there's so many good ones um salaries he did that with glass door there's cost reduced salaries yeah so there's there's one that I use that's in the tech world called levels I think we talked about it what's before but they do it where with just the like kind of tech companies it's like what do people had tech companies make and a lot of people have been doing this on insight company so inside Microsoft for example they created an anonymous Google Doc where you could just put your level your job category like engineer or designer person whatever and your salary your pay and then plaster that's uh yeah figure out am i underpaid but but this was even in like more specific it was like in a company these are people now like and it's not just glass door it's like just a few who kind of go and post this stuff but they're get like these these companies are having alleys like really rich documents with thousands of people contributing and and right now those are just Excel Docs I wonder if you could take the just a salary component of maybe what same glass door and do it in a better way inside company so people make sure they're not getting the short end of stick within their own company right now that's interesting another one is freelancers so the answer is what real answers and agents these so the problem with a lot of the stuff is when we're trying to hire some agencies to WordPress development I have to back-channel and go find out from people who work with them what they were like okay once I sign up to and agree with them I can't I won't find out unless I'm on a weekend they suck not right I can't believe I'm in and that's the same thing with like payroll software to like gusto looks good but when you sign up to it you don't realize like what you like and what about it so we have a couple friends who are doing things that are trying to put up you know they're trying to make information would come free of what software do companies use so like a lot of people would want to know what does the hustle use what do you guys use to send email what do you guys use for analytics what do you guys use for your payment paywall what are used for trends and like I know Ryan and producthunt they're doing this with something called stacks or your stacks and they want to know what's your software stack that your company runs on and it's an interesting idea he's designing it kind of like a social network but the value in the end and if you did if you get there is oh cool I can now go see okay if I'm building an Airbnb type company what do they use to run their company what do they usually do you think that that is not working well it's really tough to is one of those things where really valuable if you get they're really tough to get the information in because you have to get the incentives right later on you have the incentive to come to this site because you want to see what other people use but what's the incentive to post and so he's trying to make it fun and interesting and cool to post by making it like very visual like sort of a get it doing that a profile for your company right like like yeah we use this stuff and so I don't know the numbers on how it's doing but I do think it's an interesting experiment and I think if they did it it would be the most valuable thing that producthunt has built because it's a it's just inherently surely there's a great business model on top of that if you can show what's off for people who use that's cool I agree that's interesting I love this idea of information needs or information wants to be free yeah let's think more about that so I think we'll come back with an example of information today that is either behind a walled garden or it's incomplete and if you set it free it would make people make better choices or save them money or whatever it is like maybe it's something in the insurance it's base maybe I don't I don't know exactly what but I'm gonna think about this because I think this is a formula for building really big companies yeah for me it's how much things cost like like freelancers and lawyers and things like that that's it's always bothered me I don't like I like my lawyer could be like yeah we charge $700 an hour and I was first getting going I was like I have no idea is that normal right and on the other side it's also how much companies make right like you love it when you hear that a company's public or it's a non-profit cuz you're like yes I'm gonna get to their financials is they have to report yeah well and they do in a really interesting way and they're owned by a publicly traded company they do about a hundred twenty million dollars a year in revenue but they do like 25 grand for a pitchbook subscription right really expensive and they do about 120 they're owned by mmm is it called Morningstar or it's a company right SR I think at this morning star or morning stores like the mutual fund thing it's yeah it's owned by one of those things and I just read their their earnings thing morning's target is morning server and they are the mutual fund thing too and what they do is they do two different things the first thing they do is they crawl the web and they find SEC documents and they find like all type they just crawl and find data and they have a team of like 300 people who just hit the phones all day and call people and get the information okay and then the other one that's like that is you know even for podcast when we look at the top charts and we're like alright how do we become the number one business podcast we don't know how much we want my downloads they get right there's this idea of how much something is how much is being earned how much is something making and how much does something cost I think that just generally would apply to a whole bunch of different spaces that you could you can use for this yeah that's why I use a similar web cuz they show me how much like traffic guess traffic one of the dope ones of this do you use second measure yeah they're great they're great I think a little bit expensive they are yeah if you don't know the arts the second measure takes credit card spending data and can tell you essentially like how much money something is making just by analyzing how many people are charging Spotify per month and then they're like oh cool imagine spot if I was not public company you'd be able to see here's how much revenue that they're making they do this with like the delivery companies which delivery companies winning well they can just check this huge data set of credit card spending and say okay it looks like grub hubs in the lead and then second is door - or whatever and so second measure is super powerful using a source of truth which just credit card data how they get out we talk about this stuff all I want to do is those like and the podcast and make my days 50 hours long and just start a search everything this whole this whole data or make information or finding information wants to be free that whole concept that's amazing that's the test I want people to listen this podcast and be so excited and then I want you to feel anxious I want you to feel stress that you don't have 50 hours in your day to go do this and that's that's how this should feel I've heard a bunch people say like yeah I have to keep pausing the podcast to like a write [ __ ] down B take a breath C think of it think about what's going on and then I resume it and yeah that's what we want it's that that high value you don't think about one more thing yeah which one you see you you look at the list tell them which one you want to do what happened you've lost five million dollars all right I didn't exactly lose five letters but I did not make the five million dollars that I could have made all right so this is called Shawn's shitty investments this is a new segment we created just now and I'll tell you about two bad investments in one good investment I made so I was talking to a friend of mine a guy had been aided in advising this guy about his startup this is maybe four or five years ago I've been advising him he didn't live in America he was building a product for international his product was around international students applying to US universities and making it easy if you don't know if you live overseas like I finished high school in China so I saw this firsthand if you're in China you're in India you're in Malaysia the goal like your life goal is to go to a u.s. University don't even matter if it's a good one but it's to go to a u.s. University and even if US universities overcharge for for that and and they get in trouble about - sometimes yeah actually right now there's bunch stuff in the news because they charge like three times more for the state is in trouble because they have like 60% Chinese nationals there and they're like right what the [ __ ] you guys are charging 60 grand for these kids exactly so so anyways I was helping this guy great founder really like the company was really interested but I was at a point at that time financially where I was like okay if I'm investing in startups it's pretty irresponsible investment because you know when you invest in startups high likelihood of failure so you need to place like 25-30 bets and so if you say okay I'm gonna place yeah 25 30 bits and each bets gonna be 25 grand like I'm basically I need to have five hundred thousand I don't have $750,000 that I'm gonna put into this which means that can't be like your whole net worth which is like well this would that would have been 75771 fifty grand at that time would have been more than my whole net worth and so I knew I didn't have the the sort of bankroll to do it but that was an excuse I could have found a way I could have thought to check any ways I could have banked on myself making more in the future like I did and bottom line is I didn't so I would have been the first check into this guy's company and my sort of $25,000 check which I was very very close to writing would have become five million dollars this guy's business by now wait what's the name of the company say the name and how big is it now I'll just tell you the name we'll bleep it out so it's called and so he told me that they just crossed it you know the billion dollar valuation and and so I don't know if they're exactly at that onething a little over a little under but the point is they're they're doing well and and so yeah I was kicking myself because that would have been a big investment he's happened to me this has happened to me now two different times where I could have I could have been one of the angel checks into a business I thought it was a good business I didn't pull the trigger and those two would have combined to be worth you know ten million dollars plus by now what was the only one calm yeah so this company this studying abroad company they're do they make a lot of revenue or is it just yeah revenue and even then like this was they were preview at the time but I was doing the math and I was like wait like they had an LOI signed by a bunch of universities and I was like wait so if they just matched the supply and demand like this things there make money do them enough conviction and it's just a bleach insight no no it's a full software tool that let that actually does the application for the student the University of was a SAS company it's a free SAS tool for the user and then it's a lead gen on the other side when a kid gets accepted they get paid that way got it and they charge to universities money yeah like thousands of dollars per student yeah so okay so they don't charge the money for the software no this offers used by the actual student and customer so anyways it was a it's a great business big mess on my part happy for the guy though he is an awesome guy and I really I like this guy's energy a lot kind of sometimes you meet people who got I just have good energy I don't know how to describe it he was one of those people's and you know MGM so not again so basically I haven't talked about this on the podcast but I during co vid I decided to mess around with option trading which you know famous last words and so I was literally this is how dumb I am right so so I don't play in the finite that public markets that launch I just do very simple things I just buy companies I think are good for the next 10 years or i buy index funds I don't do a whole I don't do like day trading I don't do their leverage buying or I don't do shorts but I was like you know what I don't see any way that MGM which is MGM Resorts I was like I don't see any way that their business doesn't go down with this coded thing and so I was thinking about it and it got cut by like 75 percent so the stock price dropped from I don't know it was like 25 dropped from 30 down to like 12 and and I was like yeah I still think that this thing is gonna go down and so I'm literally on one tab I have like a Khan Academy video of like what the hell is a put and on the other hand I've got my Robin Hood account and I'm like just pushing buttons and so I pushed a bunch of buttons and I placed this trade which basically said okay I think I'm James gonna go down and yeah about $2,000 with options and like let's see what happens and it turns out MGM didn't go down but I needed it once I understood my own trade which was like after I placed it cuz I was again just put your buttons what I was looking at the like confirmation I was like should this a horrible trade like I I just basically said that this is gonna go down 40% in the next seven days didn't you lose stupid so that's my bad the two bad investments I want to share on the other side other side I've been really big into Bitcoin and when it dropped to like 4,500 recently and now it's back up so that one made back money from for the buy shitty option trading in Spain I I completely stay away from stocks I only buy S&P 500 or Facebook stock and about two weeks ago when it was at the bottom I was like I was like well no when the whole market was real low like the lowest point maybe ten or two weeks ago I sold most everything and I was like I was like I think it's just gonna get worse and worse and worse because unemployment and unemployment comes out and it's the highest it's ever been and or the unemployment where claims and then the stock market goes up 20% I like I just don't understand how this I know I don't understand how this works at all because and then I applied for the loan for for that Trump enacted and I'm like so you telling me we get free money that sounds great but you start thinking about it you're like I'm gonna pay for this eventually like somehow I'm there's no such thing as free or we're gonna pay for it eventually and so this money it's just this whole situation it doesn't make sense to me because the stock market should be going down yes this is a dead cat bounce or like sort of a false rally but forgetting forgetting the market right now because I don't know [ __ ] about it and who also who cares not that interesting it's a speculators game though there's a phrase I learned that I thought was pretty cool it's called a Kings EMU he contests you know two kings in beauty contest is okay so have you ever heard of this sort of economists full names like Maynard John Maynard Keynes or whatever anyways he's famous guy in the world of economics Keynesian economics and a Keynesian beauty contest describes this phenomenon where let's say there's a what you think the stock market should be is here's the asset here's a company you can buy some of their stock and you buy it if you think that the companies cannot become more valuable than it's priced at today that's what we think should be happening but what's actually happening is this as a speculator market right it's a speculation driven market and so you don't in a short time horizon you don't you're not betting that the company is going to improve and actually generate more revenue and what not you're just betting that other people are going to think this is more attractive but they're also bidding that other people are going to think more attractive so it's qingzi beauty contest is where you're not actually judging the beauty of it you are thinking what the other judges would think about this thing and they're thinking about what the other jesters think about this thing and it becomes this sort of speculative loop and that's my sort of Wikipedia page of the week that's exactly how things working and it just annoys me so much you have so much more control over your life when you actually run the business right and there's also a great phrase which is sort of in the short term the stock market is a popularity contest and in the long term it's a weighing machine and I think that really describes it well right so like is this also for private companies as well and when you're you're raising a Series A in your hyped company it's a popularity contest and what how did this valuation that doesn't make any sense like yeah it makes sense if you if you understand that this is currently a popularity contest but over the long haul it does not remain a popularity contest it becomes a weighing machine and if you're a full of air and there's nothing there like your value will go down and so for all those people who don't understand those valuations that's why it's frustrating I'm just so I don't I don't do anything in that world because I just nothing I I don't know anything about it and I don't want to know like it makes me too angry okay cool do you want to squeeze anything else in or you want to we could wrap it tell people about the other podcast you guys are doing yeah we just launched one with Moyes Ali which you should go on it Sean I had a I went on it to help Moyes interview better but it's called exit strategy so Moyes started this company called native and he started it me and Moyes started our companies in the same name office and so I saw him started from nothing so I'm get the idea and start this thing and he started this deodorant company called native in 20 months after starting it he sold it for a hundred million dollars in cash I've been 28 months months and so he decided to launch a podcast because he is looking for a new project where he's interviewing other DDC founders and it was talked about scaling and selling their companies it's called exit strategy the Google the hustle exit strategy or just look it up in on the Spotfire podcast or you'll see it yeah I started listening to it I'm like five minutes in but so far so good we'll see you crazy I told my feedback to him was for the next episodes Beacon to lean into being crazy don't hold back yeah that would be my advice as well which is don't I think when you're when you're a really interesting person and actually your opinions are more interesting than your questions in many ways you need to make it a conversation a debate more than a interview because I think what's gonna end up happening is that Moyes is gonna be end up being more interesting than most of his guests and so what he should do to raise both people's levels is for him to just act out we would normally act in a conversation with that there's anyone would rather he like he says the craziest stuff ever and he's a great guy but he's a loose cannon and I love that about him so I need him to remain as a loose cannon right so check it out exit strategy we want the gasps family to get bigger stronger better every badass entrepreneur who wants a podcast needs to go to the hustle and push a button and start their podcast with the hustle but like it should be badass interesting entrepreneurs not you know sort of judgment I want to start a podcast yeah but that should be the least interesting thing you've ever done in your career yeah we want experts we want experts who are charismatic not charismatic people who hope to be experts right and also not experts were not kids Matt because nobody wants that either yeah but yeah that's out and yeah and people even reviews I read all the reviews everyone could see yelling at me because they say my mic sucks I so I ordered a new one but everything's back ordered you might have a new mic coming doesn't know essential the essentials are micro sorry let's read one review let's do it a reviewer of the week let's give somebody a shout here so I scan these for one second okay so three stars Sam can learn how to talk into a mic but both these guys are very knowledgeable and give infesting a fresh young spin I've been listening just since it was just Sean spelled my name wrong and loved it but when Sam came on it became different Sam gets excited his voice pops into the mic yeah but come on that's the excitement Sam she loses the podcast not gonna do it you've got to listen to yourself you can tell Sean speak softer Sean misspelled again and tries to get Sam to quiet down but it's not working that's not true okay let's look at another below these are interesting that the hybrid Hughes although I want the high reviews but well we have like 800 reviews and almost all are 5 stars the only ones that are 5 stars are the people who cost unethical which is [ __ ] there are people who say that my mic sucks which is [ __ ] and the people who just call us bros also [ __ ] well no mess I'm [ __ ] I am a bro means a man yes that's that's me all right see s value says very smart guys would not recommend hello the title for a review these guys are very smart and you'll certainly learn the finger to about making money by listen to this podcast that said it's not worth the subtle recalibration of your moral compass I don't know that's a decision for each listener to decide ok so then they say these are not high integrity people here's their examples of why were not high integrity we asked people to sub an unsub to game the podcast algorithm give me a break yeah a joke laughing about lying on a job application and getting caught I didn't laugh because I thought it was good I laughed because that's the way you deal with heartache I laugh to cover the pain don't you understand yeah like I said how I said how that was a horrible move and I got what I deserved right casually dismissing a host criminal record a host yeah no one dismissed my criminal record they said it's stupid I shouldn't have done it and that's why I changed my lifestyle gotcha these guys are sharp guy is a good at hustling hacking and scheming but this is not content I would recommend anyone put into their brain you know what welcome if that doesn't make people want to listen to this more I don't know what will that's there's our clip for Instagram like are you looking around like are we still in the studio and we have our staff to like whip it it's just your wife behind you okay cool let's get out of here we'll be back at Tuesday and yeah see ya enjoy share the pod [Music]

I'm checking but you know it's logging into LinkedIn is like you know taking the first 10 steps into hell so I'm gonna try this now scrip relief was recently sold to United Healthcare over 5 million users yeah so it was sold to someone else and now it's called something else but he just has like a web of companies and he's just super interesting because this is gonna sound weird when you look at this guy do you do you think this guy looks like a billionaire does this guy look like a successful guy no that's why he doesn't he looks like a guy who would punch a kid in the face yeah he looks like a guy who's like bitter about his life and punch the kid in the face for that reason not punch a kid in the face because he's a billionaire and the kid pissed in his pool oh he looks like he would be punching kids in the face regardless of what his financial status was that's why he's interesting to me so I have such a good mugshot google his name he looks like he looks like a tough guy yeah he looks yeah he looks like a tough guy he looks like an enforcer that a billionaire would have he's a building up he looks like a billionaires enforcer yeah that's why I think this person was interesting because it was dang they have a picture of the kid who punched I [Laughter] did not expect to just see those two side-by-side that's yeah this is quality this is quality Google is searching it's good right look at that kid he definitely has a Punchbowl whole face yeah well the kid looks like he did something he's even he's like kind of smug in the picture he's a broken nose he's in the hospital shirts covered in blood he's got a little smirk on him yeah super interesting person right yes okay I like this guy I never even heard of this guy I feel like you know a bunch of these guys that are like the either media Titans or like these other like New York you know New York rich people barely know like San Francisco or like Dubai rich people I know them because I spend time I'm on Wikipedia because my way of building businesses is I'd like to see what has worked and I I reverse engineer how it worked and I'm like all right I'm gonna deploy that on my company right and when I'm reversing name things I'll like read about the company right well I'll see who started it and I'm like no way that guy started it oh but he was friends with this person and they partnered previously I bet he had access to that's probably how so like I like under so you I just like reverse-engineer things yeah I like that and then you call people which most people don't do you get off the phone you start calling people work at the company you get that extra 10% that you needed right that's of helps because oh I've made friends someone who started his thing so now if I want to meet him I I have it in right [Music]

like it's like Michael Jordan and then you go down to BJ Armstrong it's like oh I've had but much times about Tony Robbins how great he is and blah blah blah like him a lot I got a lot of value out of going to his workshop it was all with you and I bet well because it freaked me out yeah and a lot of people get freaked out of people's preconception is just this is like a cult this guy's a snake oil salesman or whatever yeah like what am I getting myself into and I gotta admit like when I went there I was like okay cool I'm going but I'm not doing any of that dancing [ __ ] I'm just uh I'm just here for the information I'm gonna sit down I'll be quiet I'm not gonna yell not gonna hug I'm not gonna dance and he sat separately so you wouldn't be embarrassed if you do one with my brother-in-law and we just agreed beforehand we're like you know we might end up doing the dancing [ __ ] so you sit on that side of the room I'm sitting on this side of the room and let's see if we didn't see each other except for at the end of the night when the event would end each day and we would get back together but anyways by you know our one I'm dancing and doing all the good stuff too but anyways it was a lot of value and you know it cost me like a thousand bucks to go do this thing I thought a tremendous and then in the thing like he up smells just like this guy does right so he's like you know one of the first kind of I don't know coaches lifestyle coaches business coaches out there and he's been doing this for 40 years now so he went from audio tapes to books to infomercials now the internet like whatever the channel was he wrote it and was like I'm the business coach I'm the lifestyle coach and you know I got a lot of value and at one point he upsells his business mastery class or his business mastery thing is like okay if you like this if you like how you're feeling right now and right after he makes you feel great he's like you know that table over there is for anybody who wants to grow their business it's ten thousand dollars you spent five days with me and if you don't get a million dollars of value from this thing I will give you all your money back and in the moment I was like dude I got a million dollars of value today you know of course I would do that so I didn't actually sign up for it but our buddy see him it did and went to he did it so I believe so and so you know sorry see if I got that wrong but I'm pretty sure he told me he did and I have several friends who actually did it as well and they said they're like yeah it's great and if you have a business that's doing you know if you have a business your size right your business is worth tens of millions of dollars if you can get a sort of 2 percent 3 percent 5 percent lift yeah in your business just through improving your own psychology your own enthusiasm your own tactics it's obviously paid itself off right so how does the infrastructure of this work like I'm looking at it now does you just Tony Robbins literally have to be at all the things no so well he does his live events yes so he's the Traveling Salesman that does the live events and he probably does I don't know I'm gonna get it wrong but like let's call it 20 to 40 live events a year a lot that's a lot you know every week he every week or two he's somewhere and then he has his sort of like army of like coaches that are trained under him bit by the way they all seemed garbage and so he has this you know the people who are the actual coaches I will call you and do all this other stuff with you they are you know like there's like a fleet of them I don't know a hundred and hundred people that and just need a common structure is garbage those people are garbage when I met them I was not impressed in fact on the day's so tell her I'm gonna do this for 40 years to the point where he's been public speaking on stages hype and crowds up for like 40 years right so he can't actually do two days back-to-back so he does date one and it goes from 8 a.m. till 1 a.m. and there's no breaks yeah you can go to the bathroom but you were missing the action when you go it has just talked and the whole time he's on stage he's talking and he's got 10,000 people in an audience I've been twice now I should have been three times I just did that so the first time I was just experiencing it the second times I was observing it because I took a fleet of friends I bought tickets for my family and friends I was like this is the best gift I can give you and they loved it most of them and so anyways he holds people's attention for like 14 hours straight which is incredible you know you can't most people can't you know listen to a six-minute YouTube video and have their attention held but then the second day it's not him on stage because his vocal cords are shredded so he can't speak the next day and this like his number two comes up and this guy's a good public speaker but he's not like it's like Michael Jordan and then you go down to BJ Armstrong and it's like now I came here to Michael Jordan and so literally this guy just he says stuff and then he tees up a video of Tony talking ten years ago when he used to do this like he used to do all four days himself oh my god he queues up the the video of telling me and you sit there and you're watching youtube videos with ten two thousand other people and this guy is just moderating it it's like this bizarre experience that's crazy I didn't really sell it very well but I'll tell you this that was probably the best the best money I've ever spent on anything self-improvement wise if you add up all the books or anything else it's not even close maybe I should do it you tell it you should totally do it I took about 20 people so I paid for 20 people's tickets to go see gran yeah I basically became an affiliate for him I didn't get paid I just I believed in it so much I paid for 20 other people to go and since then and it's been four years since then and of them I would say four people were like me where they were like a holy [ __ ] life changed that was the most valuable thing it's a 4 out of 20 let's say and then another let's call it I don't know 15 were kind of like that was amazing and I talked to him a year later they're like disappointed in themselves that they didn't carry it forward they're like God it was so good and I had so much clarity and I had so much energy but I'm kind of mad at myself I just kind of let it fade from there like I don't really remember it now I just remember what I felt then and yeah I guess I didn't really get too much value because I'm not doing any of the things I wanted to do you know after that weekend well and there's no three or four people that literally left they were like this is way too culty this is pop science I don't like this I don't believe this I don't like how he's manipulating everybody I'm out and I was like okay that's the spectrum anyone I know um Alex from calm the founder of calm he hated it and so he just went for a bike ride I think in the middle of one of the days because he was like it's just too much for me he's like I don't I didn't I didn't feel good and what was going on and so I left I rode my bike around the city and I had fun during that and what uh what was the number one takeaway for me dude I have a notepad full that I call the Bible because I was like this is the closest thing that I have to religion right it's like religion and it smelled like God religion is like an operating philosophy for life right that's what that's what people use religion for in many ways like you know don't harm your neighbor bla bla bla like it's an operating philosophy so this was an operating philosophy so I'll give you two of the Nuggets right so the first one is the quality of your life is equal to the quality of the emotions you have on a day-to-day basis so what is that mean it's kind of a mouthful but like we're both in a good position we're very privileged or more successful than we ever thought we would be seven years ago probably like the position we're in now seven years ago us would have been envious at that but your happiness is not like ten times more than it was seven years ago right like you're probably feeling about the same and the reason why is that you know life is not about you know what you have and what you've achieved it's about who you've become and so what most people what most people miss is that if you are doesn't matter if you're rich doesn't matter if your family doesn't matter if you have a you know if you're famous if the emotions that you're feeling on a day-to-day basis are stressed then you have a shitty quality of life if you're feeling anger or upset then you have a shitty quality of life regardless of everything else and so then the question is how do you figure out how to like change your emotions on a day-to-day basis so you're feeling good every day regardless of your situation it's the intent select so he gives you three three you like tool he's like alright here's the three ways you can change how you feel the very first thing is your butt is physical so if you change your if you have a radical chains and your physiology calls it which it basically means if you did a bunch of push-ups if you exercised if you ran if you jumped into a cold pool or or why people like taking out hot showers it's relax the fastest way to change how you feel is to physically change your body in fact Emmett who's the CEO twitch was telling me the other day or he was kind of talking about this on Twitter people have panic attacks and when you have a panic attacks really uncomfortable feeling and most people panic attacks really want a solution of like how do I not get these and I take medicine and some people take medicine and that's one way to change your physiology is chemically changing your physiology what most people try to do is like people try to help people think their way out of it they're like oh just know don't be so anxious and you need to just relax I'm like as if that can help that's like best if that was that easy yeah we would all do it and actually what science has shown is that the fastest most effective kind of quick and dirty way to stop a panic attack is to plunge your face into really cold water if you do that right at the start of panic attack it will stop it because your fight-or-flight will kick in it'll it'll override that and so one time I one time I accidentally ate brownies at my roommate made and they turn out to be edible brownies and I don't smoke weed and I hate weed so much like I don't do any of that and I was like James I'm flipping out he goes yeah I'm sorry those were we brown and I I started having a panic attack and I went and gotten a cold shower and that was the only thing that helps oh nice okay yes so that's fastest way to change what you feel is your body either through heat cold or getting your heart rate up and exercising and it doesn't be like go to the gym it can be like if you did ten jumping jacks you will feel different than you did but right before that the second one is focused so what are you going to focus on so you you know where you place your focus is gonna judge how what your brain is what your brain is basically signalling to your body of how to feel so if you're focused on pain then you're gonna feel shitty if you focused on how somebody did you wrong how this guy cut you off in traffic you're gonna get outraged but if you focus on things you're grateful for if you focus on things are going well if you focus on things that are that you can trust that you can rely on you'll feel different and then the last one is I think it's like language so you language your story which is basically the words you use in the story you tell yourself the big the big idea and I recommend this to anybody who's in business which is the quality of your results is linked to your quality of your decisions and the quality of your decisions is linked to the quality of the internal monologue you have so the conversation you have with yourself ends up dictating the decisions you make which ends up dictating the results you get and that's kind of what I pulled away from the whole thing and then it's all a bunch of strategies to do that better I think you just saved me a thousand dollars well you got to get up and dance with the wise it's gonna sting this is awesome I like this yeah I always hesitate to talk about it cuz it's like I'm a preachy but no I don't think it helps some people it's never preachy when you can make fun of it so like you you do a good job of making fun of something and then you explain what it is so that's never preachy [Music] you

the way it's working is that some states are choosing to close like the developed campsites and their national forests and then others are actually keeping them open so you really have to go forest by forest and look to see what's going on [Music] everybody this is Nick De Santis from the hustle welcome to another episode of behind the hustle the show where we take you behind the scenes to tell you a little bit more about some of the stories that were working on and I'm really excited about today's episode because we're here to talk about van life and this is a trend that you may have heard of on Instagram or on social media people who essentially live life from the road and we actually about a week ago we wrote a story about this in our daily email and it was not something that I obviously had heard the Instagram hashtag and has read a little bit about this trend but didn't know a ton about it but luckily we have a contributor who writes for us out in San Francisco her name is MIA Sullivan and it turns out that she is actually planning as soon as the shelter and place orders list to hit the road and live a little bit of the van life herself so I wanted to invite her in to talk a little bit about where the idea came from and and what she was planning so thanks a lot Mia for joining us I really appreciate it yeah of course hey everyone so you know now he's kind of feels like a strange time to choose to move into a van but me and my fiance planning on doing that in the summer so we're we're hoping to still go and just a little bit of background on how the idea came about for us we were really interested in taking a year off and and traveling living a more simple life and we're big backpackers so we thought we'd be pretty good candidates to move into a small space and we have a big dog who's gonna be traveling with us so we're designing our van with him and kind of our our lifestyle in mind yeah one of the things that you had called out in the story that you wrote for us a couple days ago was the fact that there's sort of a wide variety of vans and there are certain people who sort of do a more low-tech version of it and then there are other people who have fans that use sort of called kind of mini bunkers so you sent me a couple pictures of the van that you're actually like building out it looks like tell us a little bit about what that looks like yeah so it is a 2015 Mercedes Sprinter van it is it has a 170 inch wheelbase so it's it's one of the longer ones there's like a shorter one than a bit of a longer one I would say our build out is gonna be more definitely more like the bugger than bare-bones so we'll have running water we'll have heat we won't have a full bathroom but we will have a toilet and we'll have a like an outdoor shower situations so it will be pretty pretty contained we won't have to rely on gyms or you know bathrooms and in random random town so I'm feeling pretty good about that especially now and we were gonna get a smaller water tank but we're opting for the bigger 35 gallon tank given the pandemics so how how how's the renovation going like you sent me some photos has it been challenging have you run into headaches I'm curious about sort of how what that process has been like yeah so it's going well it is very challenging for me my fiance is the Builder out of the two of us so he's been the one who is figuring out you know like what to do and what to buy and then I am the assistant so the other week we cut out a window in our van we've it's the third window that we've installed and he was the one who was doing all the cutting and the planning and the measuring but I was basically you know helping him handing him things cleaning so it's going well but there are certain things coming up like the electrical wiring that I know he's pretty nervous about you know cutting a window into a man is nerve-racking and I think he handled it well so so far so good good I mean it certainly looks it was I was surprised at how big the man was it's but it certainly looks like things are going well yeah it's it's pretty big I think that um you know with our with the two of us and our dog it will probably be a good size and probably won't feel very big we have no it's just an empty box with insulation and a few windows so tell us a little bit about like your your plans one of the other things that you had written about last week was sort of where people are allowed to go and how there's national park land and national forests where maybe some of those sort of more common camping facilities in those places are shut down to visitors but you know there's sort of more wide-open spaces that are very people can go so I'm curious like what does your route look like are there particular landmarks or places where you want to go yeah so um we were planning on doing more of a we're gonna start going up the west coast so I live in San Francisco we are gonna go up the west coast and hit Oregon and Washington State however much of the land right now is closed in Oregon and because we're starting a month later than we wanted to we're gonna actually skip that for now and do that on the back end of our trip so we're gonna head to Montana Idaho and Montana first and hit national forests it's pretty confusing it's not like oh all national forests are closed right now um the way it's working is that some states are choosing to close like the developed campsites and their national forests and then others are actually keeping them open so you really have to go forest by forest and look to see what's going on what I have found is that most national forests are open to dispersed camping so that means you can just drive your van somewhere on this huge piece of land and encamped and be alone and so that is what our trip is going to look like especially in the beginning you know there might be I think that you know there are some states that are reopening maybe they'll be like small towns in Montana that we can check out and just you know be really really careful but especially in the beginning with the pandemic still you know kind of raging we're gonna be in mostly like isolated we might even stay in a knot in one National Forest for like two weeks and then kind of continue on and just you know hike and and explore have you thought about if you do run into other people on the road how you'll handle that given all the concerns about social distancing that aren't gonna be going away anytime soon yeah so we bought we bought cool masks with with mask filters so we're definitely gonna be wearing those yeah we'll have gloves and you know we'll just kind of keep our distance from people I think that it actually we're gonna be interacting with a lot fewer people then we kind of happen to interact with now just going to the grocery store and like being in a city so you know I'm I think that aisle if antibody tests if and when antibody tests are available that's up you know obviously something that will be interested in in doing so we can you know feel more safe meeting people but I think for the beginning you know it's gonna be like masks keep our distance but another thing thinking about is it'll be interesting we might go to certain places where no one's wearing a mask you know we might be in a small town in Montana and like people will look at us like we're crazy well I'm really interested in how all of those dynamics will play out and are you planning to document your travels in any way I think one thing that we had talked a little bit about is you were maybe hoping to write some stories from the road or I'm curious about like are you gonna be trying to tell any stories of people who are in who are dealing with the pandemic and I'm curious about like are you are you gonna try to document this trip in any way oh yeah so yeah as a journalist it will my aspiration is for it to be incredibly documented so the main thing I'm doing is is a podcast it's called places it will launch in June and it's gonna be about it's gonna be stories about like small towns across the US that was my original plan for it and I'm already a few episodes deep just on on the background from from kind of how we're planning to go about the trip however I do think that with the Krone of our situation the focus may change a little bit that's that's still to be determined from my end but yeah the podcast will also weave through our experiences traveling on the road so that's one yeah that's one thing I'm doing and then yeah I would I am planning to collect stories on the trip and yeah want to write about like what it's like what kind of like how people are living in smaller towns because I think that the view that I'm getting is this is how people are living in cities and I think that's a lot what's being reported on but like how are people approaching it in in small towns are they afraid of it are they like this is ridiculous so I'm really interested in that and kind of the rural urban divide of fear in the crisis in maybe some places that haven't been quite so hard as it hit as places like San Francisco or DC where I am yeah I'm also curious like as you talk to friends and family about your plans are there misconceptions that come up or things that you where you have to sort of people try to talk you out of it or they have concerns that they raise I'm curious you know what is the reaction when you tell other people about your plans have they been supportive or there are the things that you have to sort of explain what is some of those conversations look like yes so in like before the pandemic I think everyone was extremely supportive even to a point that it really surprised me that people are so supportive um but at the same time I think that you know a lot of the people I was telling know me very well and it's the type of thing that's like oh that makes sense that you would want to do that maybe like they wouldn't want to do that but it makes sense for you so yeah I felt really lucky for people to be supportive I think now honestly it's surprising but no one has said oh I think that you should postpone this trip I don't think it's a good idea to do it you know this year anytime soon but I wonder if people kind of think that but they don't want to burst our bubble but it but some people some people have said oh well you know we just want to make sure you have a great experience and we don't want you to like not be able to to go to the places that you wanted to go and do the things that you wanted to do and so that I get that but the other people say oh well that seems like the most socially distance thing you could do right now like live in a van just with your you know partner and boyfriend and Mike hiked around in places that there aren't people so as if you're getting on a bunch of airplanes yeah so I don't know I mean no one's come out and no one's come out and said I think this is a horrible idea yet you're like most looking forward to obviously circumstances are different now but you know what's the thing that you're most excited about so I think a combination between like a slower pace of life and being able to connect with people and tell stories about places that are foreign to me I think the connecting with people part is one thing I am anxious about what that's a huge part of the trip and if we can't like interact with that many people I think it will be very unfortunate but I'm optimistic that we can figure out creative ways to still connect cool that's really good well thanks for taking some time to tell us about it obviously with you know there's the you're still sort of waiting on the green light I think but we're going to be excited to to follow some of your trip and I'm sure we'll we'll talk more and and I think you had said the other day that we might when the van has finished get a little bit of a visual tour so I'm looking forward to that as well yeah absolutely yeah I'd love to show everyone around it should be done at the end of June so well good luck with the rest of the renovations I hope everything goes well and I'll talk more soon thanks Nick thanks bye everybody [Music] you

Sam how you doing man why you so angry dad [ __ ] [ __ ] nothing works I hate everything my Apple TV's not working quick times out lurking I hate zoo but your Mohawks working that didn't even work I meant to shave the whole thing and I just forgot that up there you did not forget the top dude I hate working from home I hate it so much don't worry just like I don't know six to eight more weeks of this and then we're back if we're lucky if we're lucky okay so let's do this is what we got let's jump right in people need okay we are as photovoltaic up today but I found I want to talk about something that I think is more interesting but you want to talk about some light-hearted stuff which is what's the sway thing yeah what is this way thing I saw you I saw a video of you dancing we got the first time you'd seen this dance pretty well no I'd seen it Ryan Hoover had posted one of him dancing and when he posted it looked very real to me yours did that looks as real I think is where you were in your room but when I saw that I was like holy [ __ ] Ryan could dance and then I saw the comments and everyone was like nice app nice how do we get the beta of this app and I was like oh [ __ ] there's an app that makes you dance wait so you have this app I think it's pretty popular it's called sway and what it does is you record yourself for 10 or 20 seconds you just stand there and you like walk around and move and then it uses AI or I don't know what it is but or not AI it's called um oh is it oh yeah yeah and then makes it look like you're dancing like really good and I send it to my family and some like 20 of them they thought I was dancing it was hilarious yeah it's a it looks pretty it looks pretty funny K if they actually just made it a little bit less good of dancing it would look real people believe it but it's like so good that you're like no way no it's pretty amazing and so when I downloaded it it was number 50 in the App Store and like as I was playing with it I thought it's big climbing up the charts did you just download it cuz you were browsing the App Store you saw somebody do it so I all I do I browse the App Store and I like to see the fastest growing apps yeah and I like to figure out what's going on I do that with gaming all the time so I have to figure out the games that are growing fastest so yeah we're just browsing you gotta and but it is viral like when you see somebody post it all like yeah you're like oh this is great I can I can like I should do that so it has this kind of like monkey-see monkey-do virality that i like well you remember that app that um you you would take a picture of your face and it would make you look older right then it'd turn out that that was owned by a Russian company and they were like doing funny stuff with your pictures well I don't know if they were actually doing anything but people were definitely sketched out by it they're like wait I just gave my camera access to some random Russian developer so did like 50 million other people like justice just to make this like old filter or baby filter yeah so download that app it's called sway dance is it called swayed it's called sway for sure SWA why it's a cool little app it's good for little pranks and actually you know that is a light harder way to start because it's just funny and people should just go to your twitter and they'll find the video of you doing it but but this is also like part of this deep fakes like this deep fakes problem and so if you don't know what a deep fake is a deep fake is basically people can now use technology to make a video look real you can make anything look so for example what they do is they'll take Obama Obama's talking yeah but I can just say any sentence I could just be like hey hey my name is Barack and I'm the worst president of all time and it'll make it look like his lips are moving to my sentence because they basically feed in a bunch of footage of Obama talking normally and it basically the algorithm learns okay here's how Obama's face moves when he says certain things and then when I I can input any audio and it'll make it look like he's doing it now right the technologies where it looks a little off but it's not that far off like if I showed it to my not all of it leave that off right but it's just getting better month over month so they just showed a like a paper just came out with a new one and it's literally just taking a still photo so they took the Mona Lisa and then they do the same thing I can go say a sentence and it will make the Mona Lisa say it in like the voice can we can is that good it's so like it's pretty crazy that they can just do that off a still photo you don't even need like hours and hours of raw footage of the person in order to do this now so I downloaded an app that does that with the Mona Lisa which app is that do you remember yeah it's amazing I'll tell you what it's called it's really neat and I think that everyone should download this stuff I paid $5.00 for it it's called no I don't remember the name of it I got no worries but what do you think of this whole defacing cuz it's a big problem like your sister's a lawyer and I think she was she was like a DA before right nurses yeah well I mentioned the public defender in the Bronx and and people yeah now it's like if you can't trust what you see right if we don't have photos that could be Photoshop audio now that can be like live bird I think is the name of it where basically you just you just ha you can't you you can train you can train this system to where you could just type anything and it will say it in your voice or it'll say Anna Donald Trump's voice so if you can't believe what you see what you hear or what's in video then how does that like mess up the world like fake news is gonna become a bigger problem yeah it's gonna become a problem why are we defaulting to that why are we worrying about I mean yeah it's gonna be a problem but also let's think about all the amazing things like like act like there's gonna be fake actors like my dance like your dance video it's gonna make movies amazing like like Brad Pitt won't exist they'll be it will be it'll be AJ Pitt and it will be some fake person and I think that's awesome so here's a future world you literally are just looking at your computer and instead like today if you want to make a movie or an animation you have to like be an animator or a movie editor or an artist to be able to draw you're just gonna be able to say things and it's gonna be able to create what you're what you're saying so you're gonna be able to say okay what if Donald Trump was talking to you know whatever Barack Obama and then Donald jumped in the air and he said this and then literally it's just gonna be able to animate that's how that's how far this is gonna go and that's gonna unlock the ability to create stuff to people who don't have the technical skills to do it today yeah I mean I'm I'm not too worried about how they're gonna regulate it because like if you have a political ad now it like anyone can run an ad on Facebook or on TV and it says Donald Trump I'm Donald Trump and I hate Mexicans anyone could do that now but I mean like literally the tech like you could buy ads but there are ways to say like well no that's not allowed and it has to say like I'm Donald Trump and I support this you know what I mean like there are ways to like would even like if you run a TV a political TV ad right now it has to say who pays for it sure it has to say is this but it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be a political thing right this can go for anyone someone in high school could just bully somebody else like right now the thing that yeah I think thanks deep fakes got famous because people were putting other people's faces on porn actors and you could make it look like I could take a photo of your mom and I could put it on it put it into a porno and it would look like your mom's in the porno and people were doing this with celebrities people were doing this with their classmates and you know the reddit the subreddit for this got huge is our slob fix our slash deep fakes and so this is how we got popular because it was like this incredible bullying tool like forget about political ads it's just like slander left and right it did it did it get taken down that subreddit no I think it's still up and I haven't been in a long time but when it first blew up you know it got really popular because people were you know if oh yeah it is banned from reddit now because it was like it was becoming a problem oh yeah but that they didn't stop the actual the actual problem it just stopped the subreddit where people were sharing it so so I think there's going to be a massive massive problem for evidence I think it's a bit gonna become a massive problem for just like slander and you know spin like I could I could take a video of you it'd make it say that you hate Mexican people and it's not Trump and and people would believe it because they would see your face and they would say I saw him say that yeah yeah I don't know and so I'll tell you what some people are trying to do to combat this there's a whole bunch of programmers who programmers in general I have a high bar for the truth they really want things to be true logical soluble rule up reliable and so when you take away evidence evidence which used to be a source of truth it's like well you're saying this but I have a video of you doing that thing so that's evidence but now it's like well this video could be anything this video could be faked so they're trying to solve the way that they think it can be solved so the theory is anything you make to sort of validate stuff the con artists will always be one step ahead and there's too big of a payoff to be able to fake this stuff well it's like a counterfeit er and so you're always a cat-and-mouse game which is not a winning solution so the solution that they believe is that the phone makers themselves the device makers themselves will need to put a cryptographic seal on the video when it's taken and it's like a tamper-proof seal like we have with medicine or whatever where it's like if this seal is broken that means this videos been edited in some way and so at some point people will only trust videos or photos that have this this cryptographic seal on them that says this has not been edited because it's it's on the device itself from when it got captured it gets instantly implemented on and so it was working on that well the problem is a startup can't do this right because it's actually Apple that needs to implement it it's actually Samsung that needs to implement this and so luckily apples are pretty privacy conscious company and they know that like if their tools are being used for evil they'd usually actually do stuff about it so hopefully Apple is working on this but I have a friend who was doing a start-up trying to do this and he was running into this problem which is like look the people who need to do this are all all the camera makers like you know the security camera itself needs to do this and that's the only like decent solution now some technical people will say Oh there's nothing that's actually tamper-proof you can still you can still you know get around but it's better and there they are right but there are still things where it's mostly it mostly works right exactly so I think that's the world that's the way the world is going to work later where you're gonna need to see this little you know icon that says it's like you know it's the gluten-free icon it's the organic organic icon it's gonna be this is legitimate and there's gonna be a legitimacy icon on any foot I can't business that's a good business you know JD Power no I mean I've heard of it but I don't know what you're gonna tell me right now but you know what it is so right it's like all I know eighty-five JD Power JD Power and Associates that's all I know what does that mean okay so JD Power the reason I looked into this because I wanted to create a business like this where I was like because I was like this is a [ __ ] racket and I'm like it does sound it does give a little it does give value if there if you but you have to be like a benevolent dictator where like you can like rule it but you really gotta be honest otherwise does a service right right and JD power what they do is it's a billion dollar company JD Power is and I mean what they do is they test different cars and they give it a wards but the way that they make money is the car companies are members of the organization so if you're like if you know if you only want the money you don't give a [ __ ] about like being ethical you could be like hey Ford like our new membership cost this much money are you guys in or out and just so you know if you're out we can't give you an awards that's crazy yeah that yeah if you could be in the business of being the rating agency that is gold in fact you know but one of the problems is like if people remember during the subprime crisis I believe what happened was these subprime mortgages the bonds that were the securitized housing bonds the mortgage bonds were rated triple-a and people were like well how was this rated triple-a this is like a junk bond well I wouldn't be ready to triple-a and I think I believed this the companies I think it was the banks that were funding Standard & Poor right so if Standard & Poor was the rating agency and they were the one sort of funneling money exactly the same thing it's the same thing and so they lost their or they didn't actually lose it they're still around they're still one of the kind of main reading agencies but like that's a breach of breach of trust when the only thing you're providing is trust as a service yeah it's the same thing so JD Power was sold to mcgraw-hill in 2005 for four hundred million dollars and then it was sold again recently in 2000 in 819 I think for north of a billion right I've really been wanting to do the same thing I was like you haven't wanted to create a credentialing agency so either in the standardized testing world so like you know the way SAT no these these things are a racket because they can charge whatever the hell they want because you need that credential to move forward and these credentials were you know for the most part all these credentials was created at one point in time and so I was looking into like is there another credential that I could create that literally all I'm providing is a stamp and I just get paid for for further stamp well you know what I've always wanted to do that similar is a vendors list so like Sean if you're launching something you're gonna come to me because you think I know a little bit about copywriting and you're gonna say you know any copywriters I'm gonna be like I know 102 but like they're hard to find and so in my head I'm like I just got to create Sam's list we're just have like approved vendors and now this is the best why are you saying this is the best are you saying these are 10 that you should check out or you think this is the best one like wire cutter well I don't think you could do the best one because if you have the best copywriter that person will always be busy but like there are definitely like dozens or hundreds that you can approve I mean I guess Angie's List was something similar and that's huge but like I've always wanted to do this for copywriters in particular I was I almost bought say I almost did Sam's list because people always like which copywriters should I do I'm like I don't know ma'am look I could post on my social media about like it's a lot of work for me to go and find them for you right but like the same thing with law firms the same thing with accountants right I'm like man I gotta go straight like a vendors of people who I'd know and approve of that's cool the version of this I wanted to do was around either IQ so I was like oh okay like mints I like can I basically create some [ __ ] tests that essentially labels people and they're you know if you're in the top 5% you get this extra little certificate and so people would pay to basically have that as as a bragging right or I was also thinking about it for developers like is there a just an extra credential you could pay $39 to get that basically says yes I know X language or I am competent I have this level of competency at this thing and I'm really a big fan of if anyone's out there creating a credential you know credentialing agency or trust us the service I'm very very interested in those because I think those are beautiful beautiful businesses extremely easy to run low cost low risk and the more you do it the more powerful they become because the more your the more times you see JD power even if you don't even fully know what it is it's like we need to go get that that's the that's the standard so I just looked up men so while you're talking they have a hundred and fifty they're a non-profit it's a hundred and fifty thousand members and they do about four point eight million dollars a year in sales interesting I'm not that big I wonder the back story yeah but like as a nonprofit you never know like what's the what was their motive how are they doing things well but you do know dude you can go and look at that all there they have to file a [ __ ] of government form and you can see how much the how much they pay themselves how much revenue and what their expenses are right guys I guess I'm saying as I haven't I haven't done that part like the same thing can be done for athletes by the way like you know how NFL players go through the combine which is basically this battery of tests you run a 40-yard dash you do this bench press 185 pounds you do a vertical leap test and so I really wanted I really think there's somebody could create a credentialing thing where you just have this facility in different cities and people pay to come in to get officially tested to get their scores it's like here's how good I am as an athlete and then they use that when they're trying to basically like get on a you teams or get college scholarships or whatever it is it's like today we only offer that to NFL players right before they get drafted but I think that this should be a sort of a standard service for athletes to say hey what's my reaction time what's my annuity test was my verticals I did that when I was a kid when I was in high school I did the same thing he was called spark and okay s PE a R Q and the guy who created it was a X he was a college a very elite college runner in the 70s and 80s I think his name was Rudy Rudy Chapa I'm remembering this off the top of my head Rudy Chapa he was a 2-mile ER from California in high school he I think he had the high school state rec or high school national record for the two-mile at like 8:30 something right and his name is Rudy Chapa I think am i right is his name Rudy Chapa I'm on the website right yeah I don't even look at his name but yeah this looks interesting and before me for this test and he was a Nike executive and then he created the spark test and what you did it was very similar to a combine and it was and I did it I crushed it it was a 40-yard 40-yard dash a broad jump a vertical jump how far you can throw a medicine ball right and maybe that's it and they would give you a score and that score and I went to this place called velocity sports in velocity sports was created by the coach of Ellis huge track and field and it was a chain of gyms that you can go to for high school kids and running straight like that and the velocity sports must have paid spark money to use it and then when you applied to college I would put my spark score to get a scholarship yes dude that's exactly what I'm thinking about and I'm looking at their website now looks very basic but this is interesting I think there's a lot of unused facilities like track track and field that are underused so much of the time that you could do this without capex probably as long as you say like you know when you run a race and it's like as long as the wind conditions are under this then it's in effect this counts and the official thing right so I bet you could use you know in the summer time schools that are empty you could use their track and field facilities and build and build a program like this because now people with sports are parents with sports or that become so crazy where people are doing travel sports at like age six eighty seven you're paying thousands of dollars for your seven-year-old to play baseball beyond this like elite team and this is like a multi-billion dollar industry of the travel sports industry and I think all those people would be people who would want to get their kid tested and you could drive Facebook Ads to say hey get your kid tested here's your school what's your score and then every year you want it upgraded because it's like oh I've gotten stronger and faster and taller so I want my official measurements that are that are sort of ratified and here's another example of this is this is kind of funny we're kind of ranking on this I didn't do research on this other than like I didn't prepare for this so I mean either I just thought of this idea of while we were talking that's how [ __ ] great we are dude just take a minute to appreciate that you know um Gallup I do know Gallup yes okay so yeah did my microphone are we it's a good okay so Gallup is is a polling polling company created by this guy named Joseph Gallup I think and the another company like a smaller company bought Gallup and it was a family-owned business and the founder of that company that bought Gallup his name was I forget his name exactly but do you remember strengths finder yes the guy who owned the family business that bought Gallup he is the author of strengths finder I see and so strengths tranqs finder it's hard for me to say they have a book that is popular little bit it's even though it's popular it doesn't make nearly the amount of money that the company makes the company makes about a billion or two billion dollars a year it's privately owned it's probably one of the largest privately owned companies in America like top 200 and they have a quiz so if you google strengths finders quit is it's a $29 or $49 quiz and it tells you where you rank on strengths finder right I've taken it because somebody sent it to me Jim Clifton is the name of the guy Jim Clifton Jim Clifton his dad Jim Clifton was the CEO of Gallup right and this was his thing and so it was like a survey they make hundreds of millions of dollars a year off that quiz yes exactly so I've taken transponders and I this is when I was like oh this is just [ __ ] okay gotcha like first of all it's a 10 you can't fail it's just saying which of these strengths do you have so you're just gonna get one of the 25 strengths or whatever it's like here's the 5 UK leadership determination and you know innovation and whatever and then the other person gets like empathy and you know thoughtfulness and whatever else so it's pretty genius and they sell these to companies who wanna basically take these personality tests for leaders to say hey we want to understand our employees better you want to understand your team teammates better and this will help you work together better and I believe strength finders was doing like a hundred million plus in revenue I have to go do double check that but but yeah it's like a tremendously successful franchise and the book is really just a it's like a code you get in the book that says go take these queries online and then the book is like kind of useless beyond that but you can yes it works really well using that book because like I said I've kind of talked about this me and Ramon we own this check this this this software for to us and we get all of our signups practically because one guy who has a book mentioned our service and it gets signups in the books not even popular that's amazing also like we you talked about that person in our Facebook group that my first million side hustles Facebook group basically who is doing a chess tutoring service any niche sport or niche niche thing like chess I don't know if it probably is already fits just is still widely established but probably is already some sort of benchmark or test you take but if I was him I would really create my own anyways which is like oh by the way for all my students like once a year we do this hundred dollar you know test and you get your chest chest q score and what your chest Q score tells you your adaptability your you know recognition cognition whatever and and as well it's not like total horseshit you actually are testing to see how good they are at certain things but I think it's a it's just a very simple way to make a lot of money off of kind of paper where there's nothing physical you're doing there paper where in that it's real but it's it's lightweight it's very simple to create it's very simple to maintain no like employees or assets you need to buy well because it's not someone in the reviews our latest review says that you and I are unethical and that you have to check your ethics at the door if you got to listen to this podcast it's totally [ __ ] but I just want to make them aware that would you say vaporware you be it's real or its substance but yeah vaporware is the wrong word for what I meant is a very lightweight thing to create and maintain and very low cost to create another example of this is Doug score do you know Doug score never heard of it dude it's just this guy named Doug tomorrow he's this nerd like he's like the nerdiest guy ever and he's got like 4 million subscribers on YouTube and like he's the type of guy who wears like a collared shirt but like you can see his white undershirt sticking out from like the sleeves you know he's like just like a sloppy dirty guy but he's amazing he has a thing where he reviews cars and he creates a Doug score which is based off of like is this fun for a weekend car or is this fun for a daily driver and now at this point he's got a thousand cars that he's ranked and I'm when I'm buying my car now I check it I checked the Doug score I like that okay that's cool like Kelley Blue Book prefer value and then Doug score for sort of enjoyment I like that and Kelley Kelley Blue Book great example so looks a multi-billion dollar company yeah but they provide a little different thing they have just like a data set that they're able to use to give you a price comparison which is like different than sort of an aptitude test but nonetheless I'm curious do you think we are low ethics do you think you have a sort of a looser ethical criteria than most people for business I think that we have a looser attitude yes but by the way I think it's it's significantly above the line of like good like right like for example most people are like I can't pre saw product that I don't have and I'm like in my head I'm like who cares just refund to people and like you haven't you something I'm not saying steal money I'm saying advertise something it doesn't exist you can get demand improved a man and then you refund the money I'm not saying you steal from them but yeah you are lying and so I think that's ethical right yeah I think we definitely have a looser definition than the average person I would say the average maybe the average business person even but there is you know I think the problem here is there's no standard right there's no there's no definition for what's ethical what's not it's completely subjective and judgmental and so the hard part is you know for us we think there's a line between right and wrong and we're on the right side we we think we have a safe margin of a buffer where we're in the right but for other people their line might be in a different spot yeah but that's because most people aren't aggressive but anything that I do I would I would suggest to my mom that she buy whatever I'm promoting or like it's like do I want my family to use this or or if I told them about what I'm doing what I like do I want to hide this right and I don't I'm I'm anything that I could do I'm not afraid to tell I met this guy once this guy had reached out to me about we're building this product called blab and blab was getting popular this guy reached out he said hey my name is Billy I'm from you know from like Santiago or the term X or somewhere and let him and he was like I'm coming up to California I'm coming to San Francisco I want to meet you and I want to talk to you about this company I was like okay I don't know about that like most of people who that are users of a product or not usually people I want to like do meetings with necessarily but he said a bunch of stuff in his email that made him sound amazingly legit he was like my family started the first television station in Mexico we you know I own all these different like music festivals and he said he sounded like super legit but his emails written with blue text font and like different sizes of texts yeah no no not like that like it was like IKEA Cho's like no I'm gonna my emails are blue and not the like copy-paste a little purple thing it was like this was just a style so I was like I don't know this guy's a joker enough anyways we go out to dinner and I have very low hopes we go to a sushi place and I walk in and I see probably the most handsome guy I've ever seen and this guy Billy was only well-put-together he's like in a suit and tie he looks legit he we sit down on the table he orders the omakase which is basically chef's choice like $200 each sushi dinner and he's like I got this don't worry and I'm like okay I'm starting to believe it but you know could be could still be someone who's faking it and he starts telling me a story and this guy is completely legit he's probably the most charismatic guy I've ever met my whole life I was like you know if if I swung that way I'd be in love right now like this guy is amazing so at the end of the dinner I asked him a question I said hey you know you're a very persuasive guy like this was you clearly are good at this right you're clearly very persuasive very charming I said I used to think I'm that way till I met you basically I used to think I was in the sort of top tier of that but I all sort of had this hesitation of like you know should I use my powers for good or evil type of thing like where do you draw the line on using this but this guy's look dead he was a real completely legit and so he really was wealthy very successful very smart very charming all that good stuff and so I asked him I said you know what do you think he goes my rule is this because if your intentions are good then it's all fair game and so he was like he was like it all the matters of the intent if you're trying to scam people if you're trying to con people if you're trying to not deliver value if you're trying to just get something that's a good situation for you and not for the other person then you shouldn't be doing it what you shouldn't be using all these powers of persuasion sake but if you think you are genuinely gonna help people if you think you are genuinely in the right if you think you're generally working for a good cause if your mission is pure if your intent is good then it's all fair game you should use it to the max and I was like aren't Billy thank you very much for this incredible I completely agree with him and if you study you know like persuasion and charm and I use it in the form of copywriting that's all some people are born better but it's a teachable skill and I always tell people like what I'm gonna tell you it's gonna sound like evil like I'm gonna teach you how to manipulate people but make sure you use it for good right because you can easily use this for bad and you know what here's a here's a weird counter to this this is where you know people are gonna be like okay this guy's actually evil okay so the other way of doing this so that's one way one other thing is to say what you just said which is use these powers for good the other thing I've been able to do is the opposite which is when I see somebody do something for evil but it works I try to learn from it and so for example remember the first time I saw I'll give you a recent example first no I completely agree so Trump is somebody who I'm not a fan of I think the guy is bad in all these different ways but when I watch him the guy is an incredibly effective communicator and he's not polished he doesn't use fancy $15 words he doesn't have a lot of substance behind what he's saying but the guy is like a master of of communication the guy knows how to get his point across in a way that resonates with people I completely agree Scott Adams who's the creator of Dilbert was talking about this when Trump was running if you haven't seen it go read Scott Adams his blog he's the creator of Dilbert and he was early on when Trump first announced his candidacy Scott Adams called it he goes this guy's gonna win and people were like what he goes I've been studying persuasion for twenty years I've been studying hypnosis I've been a communicator through cartoon I know an effective communicator when I see one this guy is a master he goes and he said he would come up whenever Trump would say things like low-energy Jeb or whatever and he would like called Jeb Bush Low Energy he was like these are linguistic kill shots these are when he would talk about the wall he bug it's a great big wall a huge wall and he's like he's painting a picture in people's minds which is much better than talking about policy and so you can learn from people that you think are using it for money he and he called not that he was gonna win he called he was gonna win months before anybody even took him seriously when 538 was like this guy's got a 0% chance Scott Adams was like this guy's gonna win and of course if he was wrong nobody would ever even really pay attention to it because you know but when you're right on a contrarian prediction you get all the credit and the other example of this was Hitler so Hitler when Hitler was rising to power I studied how did this guy get so popular what did this guy do because when you watch him speak he's not a very compelling guy but they did a lot of things so one thing I remember that stood out to me because I was in seventh grade and I'm never learning about this when Hitler was trying to rise to power all the political campaign posters were all like full-color lots of text people trying to explain their position on things and Hitler with the other way everything he did was black and white which would be normally it would not stand out but he was like well I will contrast everybody else who's do using tons of color on their stuff I'll go black and white the second thing was he would use only like big images and like really powerful images and not a bunch of text and then he would use movies as propaganda and you know fill the cinema with people to watch a movie but it was very much a propaganda thing behind it so even though he used it for evil those techniques and principles are interesting to learn from for me as somebody who wants to you know have a strong toolkit that I can use for good I completely agree I was reading I've been going on so many Wikipedia holes now that I'm home so much I wasn't reading about I read Hitler's Wikipedia I was reading about World War two and it let me like I was worried about the Mafia and then world war two and they're like it's like he's there like his rise to power was because he like would speak at these I don't know what what the equivalent of is now but just like halls where he drank like bars like veteran halls and I'm like wait a minute he started as a speaker that's it right it was kind of crazy so a couple of things we'll switch topics cuz people now are like what these guys are saying Trump and Hillary are good and I don't understand okay so I have an idea for you so I call this my new lambda school idea have you ever do you guys have like an office administrator or office admin I don't know if you guys are we have yeah I mean we have someone who handles stuff yes I do sar and things like that right I'm talking more like so I had been work or like an executive assistant or secretary do you have anybody like that have you ever so recently I'm at my work we're hiring an EI right so we had any a she left we had to hire a new executive assistant and so they put me on the hiring panel and I'm like okay I don't know what questions I'm supposed to ask like I don't really know what the background I should be looking for all that stuff so I started thinking about this store looking it up so it turns out that office administrators or secretaries or executive administrators EA's it's one of the most popular jobs in the country and it's also something where so there's about you know I'd say 600,000 I think in the US and they pay pretty well so it doesn't require tons of specialized skill that's pretty much anybody can learn to do this if you're you know somewhat competent but you can make 50 60 70 80 K doing this I thought that's a pretty good paying job and I know at our company the EAA is they're critical they do such an amazing job they they're they help and all the senior leaders do what they do and so I started looking about this and I said could there be a lambda school for EA's because I think this is something that in three months you could teach people the core skills that you need around calendaring booking travel you know note taking all the different sort of core components that you need to do to do this job well you know it's not rocket science you just need to learn the tools and learn the sort of do's and don'ts and then I think companies when you know like us when we're hiring for this there's no like school or degree that you look at or you like oh because you have this degree you're gonna do a good job and so it's usually like do you already have experience doing this or not but that's a catch-22 because how do you break in if everyone wants to hire for somebody who already has experience doing it and so I'm thinking that you could create a program that tells it offers people who says hey in three months we can train you for a job that'll pay you 50 60 or 70 K here and it's a job that has good you know work-life balance and all this other characteristics of it and so and you could use the lambda school model where you take an income share agreement you say great I'm training people for three months it cost me three thousand dollars to do this remote virtual school but I make back you know up to fifteen K 17 K per candidate that gets placed into a job over time what do you think of this idea [ __ ] love it and I'm looking it up right now org org dot Co have you heard of or gorg no we use it let's see how big their team is that can kind of tell us how big they are but okay what or org is is it's a community / to me unity slash job board it's not the cup I don't know how you would describe it in one word it's a or gorg is a 100% volunteer run organization we have job or blogs resources we have private groups an email lists and it's all for HR right executive assistants office manager HR departments and DIY admin assistant like you know whatever its and so my our old ei was on this and it was an email list and and they would send out blasts like hey I'm looking for the best IIT person our company small we only have a budget of $2,000 who do you recommend or like when I wanted to hire new ei I had a friend post a listing on there and I got tons of applicants what I would do with your idea is I would either buy this company man these these the lady who runs this I forget her name but she could be making millions off of this but I don't think she is I bet she's making hundreds of thousands of dollars so like I would buy that yeah I would buy that ID or become the platinum sponsor for you know fairly fair rate and use it for the sort of the user acquisition and there's this powerful thing because once you build the brand that hey yeah this is it's like a staffing agency right but it's a it's a big internet internet version of a staffing agency and once you place some people to good things happen the first is you get a reputation that says hey RTA's I've been hired by company a ABCDE and if we could come become a trustworthy source for good EA's but then also right now all the candidates in our current be a pipeline came from our existing EA's people they knew from their network and so is your alumni become your hiring become your hiring partners and so the more alumni you place the more opportunities you have for your own graduates and so I think that's like the real power of the lambda school model and unlike okay so the ladies girl model you gotta break that [ __ ] down lambda school model you're saying and you train them for free and then you get a percentage of their salary yes I love that model for everything not for everything necessarily but I think when you have a low cost of training it's a great model because it reduce is the friction to join because they say well it's free and so I only I only have to pay them if I get a high-paying job out of this so your incentives are aligned right because we want you to get a high paying job and you came to us to get a high paying job we only get paid if you get a high paying job and if you get a high paying job this is a reasonable payback for for us providing that service to you and so I think anyway any place where you have a low cost of training this is a very good mechanism it's not just a dent mechanism it gets a lot of hype but really it's just a debt vehicle and but I think it's a good debt vehicle for this okay do you wanna I have a few things that I want to go over do you want to wait until next episode or you want to let's do one more and then we'll call it and then we'll save the rest for the night okay then I don't want to bring let's not bring mine up yet the reason why what I wanted to talk about was Roger Dickies bathroom business that you brought up yeah made your maid renovation I think but I kind of want to wait you want to wait okay we can do it next time okay let's bring up let's let's Oh why don't you bring up this save your kneel story okay yes all right so Xavier Neil I'm sorry I feel like I've been talking most okay it's really interesting so Xavier Neil is my new favorite billionaire so this is my second section this is my segment of the show called my new favorite rich guy so this guy is essentially like a Elon Musk type of dude in France but instead of trying to send rockets to Mars this guy just operates in his own style but he's got the same kind of call like no [ __ ] given attitude like a Branson or an Elon Musk and I never heard of this guy so I'll tell you how I discovered him so I discovered him because he created this thing called 42 have you ever heard of the school called 42 No so it makes me in France he's in France he so I'll tell you his kind of like life story so age 19 he creates this business called minute L minute L is essentially a sex hotline a phone service you call it so colleagues on a sex line and at 19 he creates this thing and it goes gangbusters and so he's doing really well makes a few million bucks off this then he either creates or invest and bye-bye stake in something called world net sold a few years later for 50 million bucks right before the dot-com crash and then his big thing that he did was he created this thing called free and free was like a t-mobile it's like a mobile carrier and at the time in France all like SMS phone plans are all very expensive so he created that he undercut everybody he created a like lowest cost way to have you know a cellular cellular service and so 3d became this huge company so his net worth ballooned to like six point six billion dollars I'm looking him up now this guy is my favorite person ever yeah he's he's very legit and so he was like alright look what do I want to do now I want to do more baller [ __ ] and so he was like okay I'm gonna create this thing called 42 so he was like I'm gonna create a computer science school with no teachers and no staff so all he did was create this dope facility with a bunch of computers and if you get into 42 you just come and the computer is your lesson plan so it's like a video game there's like a challenge it's like hey you need to make a website that could do XY and Z you're like okay and it's like you have the internet and you have some people next to you and like you guys need to figure out how to get past this level and so you start doing the program and so it's self-serve you do it you do a bunch of like projects to level up plus you create your own you know like projects or ideas so somebody created I don't know like somebody could create like a coronavirus tracker right now because that's a timely little website you can yeah I'm looking it up now they have 2,500 students yeah and it's actually closed right now because the physical facility it closed here but it was a wild idea I don't even know how successful it's been I don't think it's been a wild success but I love his bet so he was like yeah I'm gonna put a hundred fifty million dollars into this so he built one in France and he built one here in Fremont for a hundred million dollars in California and it was just like so what a rep what a radical idea what a way to bet your money and try to like change the world over and over and over again and then he did this thing in in France he's like okay how do I build like startup ecosystem here so he created this thing called station F and if you just think it's like the [ __ ] NASA facility it's like this huge huge bike like I don't know how many football fields long office or hanger or co-working space and he's like alright I'm gonna make the dopest place for any investor to come when they're in Europe here here's some space to go hang out entrepreneurs you're starting companies come over here and build your company here's an office space restaurants come here at the bottom fill this place up you know gym whatever so he created his own little oasis how like Tony Shea did in Vegas this guy did in France this guy's a mainstay Chanel what what I just love this guy's style so first of all I've looked it up out he's not perfect 2004 he was indicted and detained for a month for misuse of company assets which occurred in several of his sex shops that he was a shareholder in and he ended up getting a two-year suspended prison sentence for misuse of company assets so he's certainly not perfect I don't know I'm just reading up this one thing though in addition to all this t owns the rights of the song my way by Frank Sinatra which I love the only one of the largest newspapers in France super interesting guy when I'm curious about people like this and Andrew Wilkinson is gonna be on the pot is he gonna be on on this Tuesday yeah next the next episode basically so Andrew kind of did Andrew not exactly but kind of does a soy in the same way as well until we have to ask him about this what I want to know is how do these people manage so many freakin projects like cuz like I I can't even manage what I have on my plate and like right so it's nice never live it so they you know they hire hire people to run their [ __ ] right so like I worked with a guy Michael birch who's kind of like this like billionaire type of dude and he created this incubator with his totally different model or everybody owns all the equity in all the projects and you know he picked me to run this run the show for him so he truck any trusted me he's pretty hands-off we checked in but like he let me run the show so I was looking at this guy Xavier Neil and he's got somebody this woman from Google who runs station after being the big facility he's got somebody who runs his investment fund and the guy that guy was telling the story goes you know we don't have board meetings but I was like Xavier don't you want to know what I'm doing with your fund and say hey you know tell me and he's like the he goes I told him I said hey we invest in all these companies I think we should double down on these winners and make make less small investments and and do more on the winning companies so what do you say okay he goes he goes I'm not turned I'm not doing this to make money I'm doing this to make more companies invest in more companies and because I was like what he's like he's like you could double down but don't stop investing in new and like new small small companies and then the other thing that they talked about in his thing kind of like what you're saying how do you manage this they're showing like the guy showed his email inbox all the emails from this guy and I've noticed this a lot of wealthy busy people their emails look like text messages so like this guy won't ride him a long email about like hey we're thinking about this plan here's what we could do here Plaza hey okay cool or like literally it's up to you all good it's like up but number two the letter U okay where do I see this screenshot there was a story I think was like a Forbes or Bloomberg story or something about this guy in there but I think there's a pretty common thing amongst the people who do a lot of I guess like if I buy like like I'm talking about how I'm gonna buy just a toy car like a fun car I guess I'd be like the equivalent of meat buy me like a ten thousand dollar car I'm like letting someone use it and it's like do you not care just make sure it comes back in one piece so you know the thing I guess the thing I want to clarify because when Andrews coming on on Tuesday I'm I like Andrew for the same reason I like this guy and they're totally different right Andrews not gone to jail and didn't start a sex hotline and it's not a billionaire like well we don't know that for sure this guy has about 20 years on but I guess like the thing the thing that stands out to me is I respect above all else people who do [ __ ] their own way people who have their own they are original thinkers and decide to live life on their own terms that's kind of what I got out of this guy is I think I feel like this guy Branson Elon Musk the thing I like about them and they're definitely have lots of flaws and lots of you know messed up things that they do but I just respect that they don't just follow a normal societal playbook they live life on their own terms they basically you know Marshalls beat of their own drum or whatever that's what I like about them that's what I like about Andrew he's done it completely his way which is very non-traditional do you think this guy speaks good English this French guy yeah let's uh he's alright let's [ __ ] email yeah let's do it I'm looking at them now I I mean I would if you're French I mean if you're a magnet like this I would imagine you you speak some English but is he good enough English to be on this I'm sure yes I'm sure we'll learn French dude we will make it happen if we need to yeah it'll be like yo yo el Romero and Joe Rogan we just has a translator on the podcast I'm down I would love to do this and this guy's in cahoots with this other guy who I don't want to say his name because it's too embarrassing if I pronounced if I try to sit snake it say it because he's French but I its Bernard I'll Arnold do you know who that is they don't they'll be engaged okay I'll tell you really quick he's usually goes back and forth with gates and a few these other guys as the richest guy in the world he LLVM H it stands for Louie Vuitton something but they own Chanel they only Vuitton they own it's the largest luxury group in the world they own fen phen what's the Rihanna yeah yeah they own that so the way he started it was his father was wealthy and they owned a construction business and it was big but it wasn't like billionaire big but I think they sold it for like 20 million dollars in in the 60s which is a lot of money I mean that's probably the equivalent of 20 million that's probably the equivalent of a hundred million now so it's a lot of money and so anyway he convinced his father when this guy Bernard was in his 20s and he goes dad we got a diver we got to sell our construction business and buy luxury goods cuz when I went to New York they all knew what Chanel was but that's not even a big company and so he goes [ __ ] by Chanel and so they bought Chanel for a small sum millions of dollars but not what it's worth now and then he runs it and he could start buying more and more and more so he turned a construction company into the owner of Louie Vuitton and dude they owned a lot of [ __ ] so I'm just throw off some names so they are on Belvedere they own Hennessy they are D or they aren't Effendi they own Fenty they own tag they own who bloke they on my way they own I mean this is like a like I don't know a luxury brand that's not on this list yeah they own it all like do they but then like Gucci I think Gucci's its own brand yeah it's kind of like you know like they a be in Banff where it's like you two companies own like all the other sub companies yeah well this freaking guy did it and he it started as a construction business right and this doesn't happen that much anymore but this is what I love about business before for some reason it seems like this happened this hat you this used to happen a lot more the Chinese are notorious for doing this where they diversify like crazy so I don't think this doesn't happen more I think this is just something that happens on like a 50 year horizon and so it's just hard for us who's like we're just for five years we've just been furiously looking this or 10 years to see these things that are playing out over 50 or 100 year arcs right I agree I agree with you but I've studied a handful of Chinese companies that were launched in the 90s and 2000's and they are like crate easy about doing that right where like they would start something in like two years later they own like apartment buildings it's like what the heck that's not even like and and the Japanese have done it as well they have a name for it I don't want to pronounce it because I don't wanna butcher I don't even know how to say it starts with the K okay Kazu I think okay and it's basically it's kind of like how do you know how Yamaha makes motorcycles pianos and chainsaws and it's kind of like that like they like are known for doing that and so what are you okay so I was saying what I respect the mob bank did it too right so what I was saying was what I respect the most is people who who you know create their own playbook and how they wouldn't live their life and I agree what off what what would be your cuz like I think you kind of like they're like local types you love researching what do you think is like your highest highest bit thing you respect people the same you said it best I agree with what you said people who people who look at the world and be like yeah I get it the world's this way I'm gonna bend the world to make it my way though and have you like in your own small way do you think have you done that like what's an example of where you've bent the world into working the way you want it I think that I'm from Missouri I think that some of my friends from Missouri think that I have done that I do not think that I have done that right but I think give it time and I will I think some of the things you did with the hustle were like that so for example you didn't go to the VC route in fact you did some weird [ __ ] like crowdfunding and other stuff along the way and from the beginning I think you I remember you distinctly saying cuz I was like why don't you do Facebook you know why don't you to video why don't you snapchat this it's hot and you were like no I want to do email because that's my own little pirate ship that I can own and not dependent on any other platform I want to make my own part chip and I want to get my part to be a big [ __ ] pirate ship and I just never really heard anyone talk like that or think like that where they were so specific around the like the path to victory dude I have a video like I'm normally I try not to brag on myself because I think I got a lot of flaws but the way our company is shaping now I made a video in 2015 in my outline what was gonna happen and it is 100% happening exactly like that where's that video on youtube if you google the hustle scene vests I explain I go we're gonna build you a million people we're gonna profit from advertising we're gonna use all that profit to build more stuff and we're gonna sell that stuff and then we're gonna build more media around it and it is happening exactly and do you know how you said pirate ship let me show you something hold on let me show you so but stay there mr. Sam just dropped his pants I'm looking at a giant pirate ship tattoo on his thigh when did you get that into da like right around what I was telling you about the cousin I got a pirate ship and it says bald fast fine so you basically that's how you tattooed your business plant under your thigh yes I tell everyone I go email this is our pirate ship and every email is a little bit of wind in our sails I love it that's great okay we gotta end on that that's a classic I should have taken screen shot of that one okay so we will see you guys to z' day we're gonna have Andrew on when we say Tuesday that's what we record these come out it looks like a freaking loose cannon right now with the Mohawk and tattoos and I actually like that all right man I will catch you later okay [Music] you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
in many remote Alaskan towns this is just ordinary life [Music] Zack welcome back hey how you doing Bret pretty good so you've got a story this week that sounds like it's gonna be pretty awesome you found this small town in Alaska and this is a place that was already pretty remote and cut off from civilization and now even more so tell us a little bit what you've learned here yeah so you know almost everyone the lower 48 states has had some kind of run-in with a supply chain issue at this point whether it's you know you go to the store and you can't find eggs you can't find milk in many remote Alaskan towns this is just ordinary life so I was curious to look at a place where the supply chain is so ordinarily complicated that any extra rent she throw into the equation is almost devastating and there are some people finding really intuitive workarounds to these issues this little town that we chose to look at Gustavus Alaska population 400 it's a place where there was no electricity until 1985 no cell phones until the mid 1900s last night I joined a town hall meeting by by telephone and there were five people on the call so and that was considered a monumental turnout for the town so that's a quorum so this this town usually gets its it there's one grocery store in town and typically they'll get their groceries by ferry you can't get to this town by automobile the only way you can get there is by plane or airplane or by plane or boat so for instance if you wanted to get there from San Francisco you would fly to Seattle you'd fly to Juneau Alaska and then you take a little seaplane from maybe a six seater seaplane from Juneau to Gustavus problem is that a few months ago that ferry went out of commission the state had a bunch of budget cuts the town is almost entirely dependent on tourism revenue so a lot of things just hit the fan at the same time and this grocery store owner had to find a new way to supply his town with not only groceries but rations supplies the local businesses also depended on him to bring over things like lumber and concrete so he bought his own barge $200,000 ship and started making trips six and a half hours one way between Gustavus and Juneau Alaska to the Costco there which is actually the smallest cost in the United States and bought $20,000 worth of stuff at a time and he's doing these shipments once a week and basically feeling his entire town on those trips so not every town has such an altruistic person who's willing to put the town on his back and and shoulder that sort of burden but this is just not some ordinary good citizen this is somebody who has pretty deep roots in this place and you're telling me a little bit about his is was it his grandfather can you can you describe this this little backstory I thought that was fascinating yeah so his family goes way back in this town to 1917 his great-grandfather's name was Abraham Lincoln Parker his father's name is Lee Parker and his name's Lane Parker comes from a long lineage of gustavus descendants and like many people in the town he he his family probably went up there to seek a kind of a remote lifestyle it's it's a very beautiful place it's right next to Glacier Bay National Park which is just a tremendous place but the that remoteness and isolation sometimes comes with a cost you're at the very end of the supply chain before he started his store there a gallon of milk in Gustavus was twelve dollars so you know you'd you'd buy it you'd get it and yeah the shipping company would get it in Seattle for like three bucks then they'd have to like load it onto the barge they'd have to ship it on this ridiculous journey across the ocean and all cost considered by the time it got there the mark-up would be like seven eight dollars so this guy basically found a more efficient way to minimize those logistics and reduce the cost a little bit on those Goods so abraham lincoln parker would probably proud well the other thing that interests me here is this is not just about one remote town in a remote place but it's it's really more story about the supply chain problems that many towns in rural america are going to start to face as this pandemic stretches out beyond the coverage areas there's like a lot of people and what they're what we're reading in the pages of lots of newspapers and magazines so there was somebody who talked to it was a kansas state university who sort of shed light on some of the effect that we're gonna see in rural towns can you tell us a little bit about that yeah this is like kind of an extreme example of remote or rural town this place in Alaska but there are plenty of towns small municipalities in the United States like in places like Kansas where there are one there's one grocery store in town and in a lot of these places a lot of these places are so small that it doesn't even make sense for a Walmart or a dollar store to come and crouch on the business there so the the grocery store is is on its own and a lot of time a lot of these owners are very old they've been into town for a long time there are kind of a town fixture and when they retire they have trouble having someone to fill their shoes finding someone to fill their shoes so a lot these grocery stores closed people are in a situation where they have to commute 30 or 40 minutes to the next town or the next grocery store over to get their stuff and especially with koban 19 right now when people are shelter in place that's not a possibility for a lot of people aside from that you know the population who doesn't have access to cars or who isn't mobile for any reason so it's a big issue we could see coronavirus having a pretty devastating impact on rural towns with a single grocery store like this and and even big shipping logistics companies freight companies will sometimes bypass these talents because this really makes sense to stop there so these towns are having to find ways to rely on local economies and farmers ranchers things like that to fill the void but sometimes even that's not enough so in tandem with coronavirus we're seeing this great ongoing decline of rural grocery stores that many people are trying to find a solution to it's fascinating well more on Sunday definitely open Zak's email and if you have stories of supply chain disruptions you want to share then send them to holler at the hustle and we'll definitely take a look because we're continuing to find these stories interesting and want to continue to cover those undiscovered stories for you all right thanks for joining a sack and everybody open your email and Sunday for more take care of one [Music] you

#ethical or #unethical

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
he's probably the most charismatic guy I've ever met my whole life I was like I'm curious do you think we are low ethics do you think you have a sort of a looser ethical criteria than most people for business I think that we have a looser attitude yes but by the way I think it's significantly above the line of like good like right like for example most people are like I can't priests all product that I don't have and I'm like in my head I'm like who cares just refund to people and like you haven't you something I'm not saying steal money I'm saying advertise something it doesn't exist you can get demand and proved a man and then you refund the money let's say you steal from them but yeah you are lying and so I think that's ethical right yeah I think we definitely have a looser definition than the average person I would say the average maybe the average business person even but there is you know I think the problem here is there's no standard right there's no there's no definition for what's ethical what's not it's completely subjective and judgmental and so the hard part is you know for us we think there's a line between right and wrong and we're on the right side we we think we have a safe margin of a buffer where we're in the right but for other people their line might be in a different spot yeah but that's because most people aren't aggressive but anything that I do I would I would suggest to my mom that she buy whatever I'm promoting or like it's like do I want my family to use this or or if I told them about what I'm doing what I like do I want to hide this right and I don't I'm I'm anything that I could do I'm not afraid to tell so I met this guy once this guy had reached out to me about we're building his product called blab and blab was getting popular this guy reached out hey my name is Billy I'm from you know for comers from like Santiago or the firm X or somewhere and let him and he was like I'm coming up to California coming to San Francisco I want to meet you and I want to talk to you about this company I was like okay I don't know about that like most of people who that are users of a product or not usually people I want to like do meetings with necessarily but he said a bunch of stuff in his email that made him sound amazingly legit he was like my family started the first television station in Mexico we you know I own all these different like music festivals and he said he sounded like super legit but his emails written with blue text font and like different sizes of text yeah no no not like that like it was like IKEA Cho's like no I'm good at my emails are blue and not the like copy-paste a little purple thing it was like this was just his style so I was like I don't know this guy's a joke or not anyways we go out to dinner and I have very low hopes we go to a sushi place and I walk in and I see probably the most handsome guy I've ever seen and this guy Billy was extremely well-put-together he's like in a suit and tie he looks legit he we sit down on the table he orders the omakase which is basically chef's choice like $200 each sushi dinner and he's like I got this don't worry and I'm like okay I'm starting to believe it but you know could be it could still be someone who's faking it and he starts telling me a story and this guy's completely legit he's probably the most charismatic guy I've ever met my whole life I was like you know if if I swung that way I'd be in love right now like this guy is amazing so at the end of the dinner I asked him a question I said hey you know you're a very persuasive guy like this was you clearly are good at this right you're clearly very personalizing very charming I said I used to think I'm that way till I met you basically I used to think I was in the sort of top tier of that but I always sort of had this hesitation of like you know should I use my my powers for good or evil type of thing like where do you draw the line on using this but this guy's legit he was a real completely legit and and so he really was wealthy very successful very smart very charming all that good stuff and so I asked him I said you know what do you think he goes my rule is this because if your intentions are good then it's all fair game and so he was like he was like it all the matters of the intent if you're trying to scam people if you're trying to con people if you're trying to not deliver value if you're trying to just get something that's a good situation for you and not for the other person then you shouldn't be doing it what you shouldn't be using all these powers persuasion sake but if you think you are genuinely gonna help people if you think you are genuinely in the right if you think you're gently working for a good cause if your mission is pure if your intent is good then it's all fair game you should use it to the max and I was like all right Billy thank you very much for this incredible I completely agree with him and if you study you know like persuasion and charm and I use it in the form of copywriting that's all some people are born better but it's a teachable skill and I always tell people like what I'm gonna tell you it's gonna sound like evil like I'm gonna teach you how to manipulate people but make sure you use it for good right because you can easily use this for bad [Music]

Title: Why The Lambda School Model Is A Great Business Plan! | My First Million Podcast

This is why the lambda school model is a great business plan! The lambda school model is a great business plan for many professionals around the world because it allows them to teach their students the roles and responsibilities of said position until they are completely qualified to fill it, all for no up-front cost. The only catch is that the teacher is contracted into an income-share for when their student fills the position! 

The lambda school model is a great opportunity for both executive assistants and others seeking qualifications for that position because both party's incentives are aligned and the ending result is a win-win!

someone who handles stuff yes I do sar and things like that right I'm talking more like so admin work or like an executive assistant or secretary do you have anybody like that have you ever so recently I'm at my work we're hiring an EI right so we had any a she left we had to hire a new executive assistant and so they put me on the hiring panel and I'm like ok I don't know what questions I'm supposed to ask like I don't really know what the background I should be looking for all that stuff so I started thinking about this store looking it up so it turns out that office administrators or secretaries or any or executive administrators EA's it's one of the most popular jobs in the country and it's also something where so there's about you know I'd say 600,000 I think in the US and they pay pretty well so it doesn't require tons of specialized skill that's pretty much anybody can learn to do this if you're you know somewhat competent but you can make 50 60 70 80 K doing this I thought that's a pretty good paying job and I know at our company the EI is they're critical they do such an amazing job they they're they help and all the senior leaders do what they do and so I started looking about this and I said could there be a lambda school for EA's because I think this is something that in three months you could teach people the core skills that you need around calendaring booking travel you know note taking all the different sort of core components that you need to do to do this job well you know it's not rocket science you just need to learn the tools and learn the sort of do's and don'ts and then I think companies when you know like us when we're hiring for this there's no like school or degree that you look at or you like oh because you have this degree you're gonna do a good job and so it's usually like do you already have experience doing this or not but that's a catch-22 because how do you break in if everyone wants to hire for somebody who already has experience doing it and so I'm thinking that you could create a pro that tells it offers people who says hey in three months we can train you for a job that'll pay you 50 60 or 70 K here and it's a job that has good you know work-life balance and all this other characteristics of it and so and you could use the lambda school model where you take an income share agreement you say great on training people for three months it cost me three thousand dollars to do this remote virtual school but I make back you know up to fifteen K 17 K per candidate that gets placed into a job over time what do you think of this idea love it and I'm looking it up right now org org dot Co I'm your dove or gorg no we use it let's see how big their team is that can kind of tell us something they are but okay what or org is is it's a community / community / job board it's something um I don't know how you would describe it in one word it's a organ org is a 100% volunteer run organization we have job or blogs resources we have private groups and email lists and it's all for HR and my executive assistant office manager HR departments a DIY admin assistant like you know reverence its and so my our old ei was on this and it was an email list and and they would send out blasts like hey I'm looking for the best IIT person our company small we only have a budget of $2,000 who do you recommend or like when I wanted to hire new ei I had a friend post a listing on there and I got tons of applicants what I would do with your idea is I would either buy this company man these these the lady who runs this I forget her name but she could be making millions off of this but I don't think she is I bet she's making hundreds of thousands of dollars so like I would buy that yeah I would buy that I had or become the platinum sponsor for you know fairly fair rate and use it for the sort of the user acquisition and there's this powerful thing because once you build the brand that hey yeah this is it's like a staffing agency right but it's a it's a big internet internet version of a staffing agency and once you place some people to good things the first is you get a reputation that says hey reas I've been hired by company ABCDE and if we could come may become a trustworthy source for good EA's but then also right now all the candidates in our current be a pipeline came from our existing pas people they knew from their network and so as your alumni become your hiring become your hiring partners and so the more alumni you place the more opportunities you have for your own graduates and so I think that's like the real power of the lambda school model and unlike okay so the ladies go model you gotta break that down labor school model you're saying and you train them for free and then you get a percentage of their salary yes you love that model for everything not for everything necessarily but I think when you have a low cost of training it's a great model because it reduces the friction to join because you say well it's free and so I only I only have to pay them if I get a high paying job out of this so your incentives are aligned right because we want you to get a high paying job and you came to us to get a high paying job we only get paid if you get a paying job and if you get a high paying job this is a reasonable payback for for us providing that service to you and so I think anyway any place where you have a low cost of training this is a very good mechanism it's not just a dent mechanism it gets a lot of hype but really it's just a debt vehicle and but I think it's a good debt vehicle for this [Music]

yes all right so Xavier Neil I'm sorry I feel like I've been talking most okay it's really interesting so Xavier Neil is my new favorite billionaire so this is my second section this is my segment of the show called my new favorite rich guy so this guy is essentially like a Elon Musk type of dude in France but instead of trying to send rockets to Mars this guy just operates in his own style but he's got the same kind of alcohol like no give him attitude like a Branson or an Elon Musk and I never heard of this guy so I'll tell you how I discovered him so I discovered him because he created this thing called 42 have you ever heard of the school called 42 no so it waits to me in France he's in France he so I'll tell you his kind of like life story so age 19 he creates this business called minitel minitel is essentially a sex hotline a phone service you call it so calling someone a sex line and at 19 he creates this thing and it goes gangbusters and so he's doing really well makes a few million bucks off this then he either creates or investing bye-bye as a stake in something called world net sold a few years later for 50 million bucks right before the dot-com crash and then his big thing that he did was he created this thing called free and free was like a t-mobile it's like a mobile carrier and at the time in France all like SMS phone plans are all very expensive so he created that he undercut everybody he created the like lowest cost way to have you know a cellular cellular service and so 3d became this huge company and so his net worth ballooned to like six point six billion dollars I'm looking him up now this guy's my favorite person ever yeah he's he's very legit and so he was like alright look what I want to do now I want to do more baller and so he was like okay I'm gonna create this thing called 42 so he was like I'm gonna create a computer science school with no teachers and no staff so all he did was create those dopes facility with a bunch of computers and if you get into 42 you just come and the computer is your lesson plan so it's like a video game there's like a challenge it's like hey you need to make a that could be x y&z you're like okay and it's like you have the internet and you have some people next to you and like you guys need to figure out how to get past this level and so you start doing the program and so it's self-serve you do it you do a bunch of like projects to level up plus you create your own you know like projects or ideas so somebody created I don't know like somebody could create like a coronavirus tracker right now because that's a timely little website you can yeah I'm looking it up now they have 2,500 students yeah and it's actually closed right now because the physical facility it closed here but it was a wild idea I don't even know how successful it's been I don't think it's been a wild success but I love his bet so he was like yeah I'm gonna put a hundred fifty million dollars into this so he built one in France and he built one here in Fremont for a hundred million dollars in California and it was just like so what a rep with a radical idea what a way to bet your money and try to like change the world over and over and over again and then he did this thing in in France he's like okay how do I build like startup ecosystem here so he created this thing called station F and if you just think it's like the NASA facility it's like this huge huge but like I don't know how many football fields long office or hanger or co-working space and he's like alright I'm gonna make the dopest place for any investor to come when they're in Europe here here's some space to go hang out entrepreneurs you're starting companies come over here and build your company here's an office space restaurants come here at the bottom fill this place up you know gym whatever so he created his own little oasis how like Tony Hsieh did in Vegas this guy did in France this guy's amazing agent F what what I just love this guy style so first of all I've looked it up now he's not perfect 2004 he was indicted and detained for a month for misuse of company assets which occurred in several of his sex shops that he was a shareholder in and he ended up getting a two-year suspended prison sentence for misuse of company assets so he's certainly not perfect I don't know I'm just reading about this one thing though in addition to all this he owns the rights of the song my way by Frank Sinatra which I love the only one of the largest newspapers in France it was super interesting guy what I'm curious about people like this and Andrew Wilkinson is gonna be on the pot is he gonna be on unless you say yeah next the next episode basically so Andrew kind of Andrew not exactly but kind of does a soy in the same way as well until we have to ask him about this what I want to know is how do these people manage so many freaking projects right cuz like I I can't even manage what I have on my plate and like right so it's nice never live it so they you know they hire hire people to run their right so like I worked with a guy Michael birch who's kind of like this like billionaire type of dude and he created this incubator with his totally different model or everybody owns all the equity in all the projects and you know he picked me to run this around the show for him so he truck and he trusted me he's pretty hands-off we checked in but like he let me run the show so I was looking at this guy Xavier Neil and he's got somebody this woman from Google who runs station after being the big facility he's got somebody who runs his investment fund and the guy that guy was telling the story goes you know we don't have board meetings but I was like Xavier don't you want to know what I'm doing with your fund and say yeah sure tell me and he's like he goes I told him I said hey we invest in all these companies I think we should double down on these winners and make make less small investments and do more on the winning company so what do you say okay he goes he goes I'm not turned I'm not doing this to make more money I'm doing this to make more companies invest in more companies I was like what he's like he's like you could double down but don't stop investing in new and like new small small companies and then the other thing that they talked about in his thing kind of like what you're saying how do you manage this they're showing like the guy showed his email inbox all the emails from this guy and I've noticed this a lot of wealthy busy people their emails look like text messages so like this guy will write him a long email about like hey we're thinking about this plan here's what we could do here paisan hey okay cool or like literally it's up to you all good it's like up but number two the letter you okay where do I see this screenshot there was a story I think I was like a Forbes or Bloomberg story or something about this guy in there but I think this is a pretty common thing amongst the people who do a lot of I guess it's gonna be like if I buy like like I'm talking about how I'm gonna buy like a just a toy car like a fun car I guess it'd be like the equivalent of meat bucket a car and like letting someone use it and it's like dude I don't care just make sure it comes back in one piece so you know the thing I guess the thing I want to clarify because when Andrews coming on on Tuesday I'm I like Andrew for the same reason I like this guy and they're totally different right Andrews not gone to jail and didn't start a sex hotline and it's not a billionaire like well we don't know that for sure yeah this guy or this guy has about 20 years on but I guess like the thing the thing that stands out to me is I respect above all else people who do their own way people who have their own they are original thinkers and decide to live life on their own terms that's kind of what I got out of this guy is I think I feel like this guy Branson Elon Musk the thing I like about them and they're definitely have lots of flaws and lots of you know messed up things that they do but I just respect that they don't just follow a normal societal PlayBook they live life on their own terms they will be they basically you know Marshalls me do their own drum or whatever that's what I like about them that's what I like about Andrew he's done it completely his way which is very non-traditional do you think this guy speaks good English this French guy yeah let's uh he's alright [Music]

Deepfake technology is becoming so accurate that it could start to influence American politics. New video technology makes faking videos as easy as faking words or photos.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
but this is also like part of this deep fakes like this deep fakes problem and so if you don't know what a deep fake is a deep fake is basically people can now use technology to make a video look real you can make anything look so for example what they do is they'll take Obama Obama's talking yeah but I can just say any sentence I could just be like hey hey my name's Barack and I'm the worst president of all time and it'll make it look like his lips are moving to my sentence because they basically feed in a bunch of footage of Obama talking normally and it basically the algorithm learns okay here's how Obama's face moves when he says certain things and then when I I can input any audio and it'll make it look like he's doing it now right now the technology is where it looks a little off but it's not that far off like if I showed it to my god all they leave it off right but it's just getting better month over month so they just showed a like a paper just came out with a new one and it's literally just taking a still photo so they took the Mona Lisa and then they do the same thing I can go say a sentence and it will make the Mona Lisa say it like the voice can is that good so like it's pretty crazy that they can just do that off a still photo you don't even need like hours and hours of raw footage of the person in order to do this now so I downloaded an app that does that with the Mona Lisa which app is that do you remember yeah it's amazing I'll tell you what it's called it's really neat and I think that everyone should download this stuff I paid $5.00 for it it's called no I don't remember the name of it I got no worries but what do you think of this whole defacing cuz there's a big problem like your sister's a lawyer and I think she was she was like a DA before right yeah well and then she's a public defender in the Bronx and people yeah now it's like if you can't trust what you see right if audio like we have photos that could be Photoshop audio now that can be like live bird I think the name of it where basically you just you just ha you can do you you can train you can train this system to where you could just type anything and it will say it in your voice or it'll say Amen Donald Trump's voice so if you can't believe what you see what you hear or what's in video then how does that like mess up the world like fake news is gonna become a bigger problem yeah it's gonna become a problem why are we defaulting to that why are we worrying about I mean yeah it's gonna be a problem but also let's think about all the amazing things like like act like there's gonna be fake actors like my dance like your dance video like it's gonna make movies amazing like like Brad Pitt won't exist don't be it will be it'll be a Jay Pitt it will be something fake person and I think that's awesome so here's a future world you literally are just looking at your computer and instead like today if you want to make a movie or an animation you have to like be an animator or a movie editor or an artist to be able to draw you're just gonna be able to say things and it's gonna be able to create what you're what you're saying so you're gonna be able to say okay what if Donald Trump was talking to you know whatever Barack Obama and then Donald jumped in the air and he said this and then literally it's just gonna be able to animate that's how that's how far this is gonna go and that's gonna unlock the ability to create stuff to people who don't have the technical skills to do it today yeah I mean I'm I'm not too worried about how they're gonna regulate it because like if you have a political ad now it like anyone can run an ad on Facebook or on TV and it says Donald Trump I'm Donald Trump and I hate Mexicans anyone can do that now but I mean like literally the tech like you could buy ads but there are ways to say like well no that's not allowed and it has to say like I'm Donald Trump and I support this you know what I mean like there are ways to like Woody man like if you wrote a TV a political TV ad right now it has to say who pays for it sure it has to say is this like it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be a political thing right this can go for anyone someone in high school could just bully somebody else like right yeah I think things deep fakes got famous because people were putting other people's faces on porn actors and you could make it look like I could take a photo of your mom and I could put it on it put it into a porno and it would look like your mom's in the porno and people were doing this with celebrities people were doing this with their classmates and you know the reddit the subreddit for this got huge is all slob fix our slash deep fakes and so this is how we got popular because it was like this incredible bullying tool like forget about political ads it's just like slander left and right it did it did it get taken down that subreddit no I I think it's still up I haven't been in a long time but when it first blew up you know it got really popular because people were you know if oh yeah it is banned from reddit now because it was like it was becoming a problem oh yeah but that didn't stop the actual the actual problem it stopped the subreddit where people are sharing it so so I think there's going to be a massive massive problem for evidence I think it's a bit gonna become a massive problem for just like slander and you know spin like I could I could take a video of you it'd make it say that you hate Mexican people and it's not Trump and and people would believe it because they would see your face and they would say I saw him say that yeah yeah I don't know and so I'll tell you what some people are trying to do to combat this there's a whole bunch of programmers who programmers in general I have a high bar for the truth they really want things to be true logical solvable rule up reliable and so when you take away evidence evidence which used to be a source of truth it's like well you're saying this but I have video of you doing that thing so that's evidence but now it's like well this video could be anything this video could be fake so they're trying to solve the way that they think it can be solved so the theory is anything you make to sort of validate stuff the con artists will always be one step ahead and there's too big of a payoff to be able to fake this stuff well it's like a counterfeit er and so you're always a cat-and-mouse game which is not a winning solution so the solution that they believe is that the phone makers themselves the device makers themselves will need to put a cryptographic seal on the video when it's taken it's like a tamper-proof seal like we have with medicine or whatever where it's like if this seal is broken that means this videos been edited in some way and so at some point people will only trust videos or photos that have this this cryptographic seal on them that says this has not been edited because it's it's on the device itself from when it got captured it gets instantly implemented on and so it was working on that well the problem is startup can't do this right because it's actually Apple that needs to implement it it's actually Samsung that needs to implement this and so luckily apples are pretty privacy conscious company and they know that like if their tools are being used for evil they'd usually actually do stuff about it so hopefully Apple is working on this but I have a friend who was doing a start-up trying to do this and he was running into this problem which is like look the people who need to do this are all all the camera makers like you know the security camera itself needs to do this and that's the only like decent solution now some technical people will say oh there's nothing that's actually tamper proof you can still you can still you know get around it but it's better and there they are right but there are still things where it's mostly works right exactly no I think that's the world that's the way the world is going to work later where you're gonna need to see this little you know icon that says it's like you know it's the gluten-free icon it's the organic organic icon it's gonna be this is legitimate and there's gonna be a legitimacy icon on any foot that's the icon business that's a good business you know JD power [Music]

okay so the other way of doing this so so one way one of the things to say what you just said which is use these powers for good the other thing i've i've been able to do is is the opposite which is when i see somebody do something for evil but it works i try to learn from it and so for example remember the first time i saw that i'll give you a recent example first no i completely agree so trump is uh somebody who i'm not a fan of i think the guy is bad in all these different ways um but when i watch him the guy is an incredibly effective communicator and he's not polished he doesn't use fancy 15 words he um doesn't have a lot of substance behind what he's saying but the guy is like a a master of of communication the guy knows how to get his point across uh in a way that resonates with people i completely agree scott adams who's the creator of gilbert was talking about this when trump was running if you haven't seen it go read scott adams's blog um he's the creator of dilbert and he was early on when trump first announced his candidacy scott adams called it he goes this guy's going to win and people were like what he goes i've been studying persuasion for 20 years i've been studying hypnosis i've been a communicator through cartoon i know an effective communicator when i see one this guy is a master he goes and so he would come up with whenever trump would say things like um low energy jeb or whatever when he would like call jeb bush low energy um he was like these are linguistic kill shots these are and or when he would talk about the wall he'd be like it's a great big wall a huge wall and he's like he's painting a picture in people's minds which is much better than talking about policy and uh so so you can learn from people that you think are using it for now well he he and he called out that he was gonna win he called it he was gonna win months before anybody even took him seriously when 538 was like this guy's got a zero percent chance scott adams was like this guy's gonna win and uh of course if he was wrong nobody would even really pay attention to it because you know but when you're right on a country and prediction you get all the credit and the other example of this was hitler so hitler when hitler was rising to power i studied how did this guy get so popular what did this guy do because when you watch him speak he's not a very compelling guy um but they did a lot of things so one thing i remember that stood out to me this i was in seventh grade and i remember learning about this and when hitler was trying to rise to power all the political campaign posters were all like full color lots of text uh people trying to explain their position on things and hitler went the other way everything he did was black and white which would be normally it would not stand out but he was like well i will contrast everybody else who's using tons of color on their stuff i'll go black and white the second thing was he would use only like big images and like really powerful images and not a bunch of text and then he would use movies as propaganda and you know fill the cinema with people to watch a movie but it was very much a propaganda thing behind it so even though he used it for evil those techniques and principles are interesting to learn from for me as somebody who wants to you know have a strong toolkit that i can use for good i completely agree i was reading i've been going on so many wikipedia holes now that i'm home so much i was reading about uh i read look at hitler's wikipedia because i was reading about world war ii and it let me like i was reading about the mafia then world war ii and then like and it was like he's like his rise to power was because he uh like would speak at these uh i don't know what what the equivalent of is now but just like halls where he like bars like veteran halls and i'm like wait a minute he started as a speaker that's it right it was kind of crazy

[Music] welcome back to the third episode of exit strategy podcast with here with one of my favorite founders her name's Cara and she's the founder and CEO of hint water Cara thanks so much for doing this super excited job thanks for having me I feel like you and I have met plenty of times in the past but rarely we had an opportunity to do it like an in-depth one-on-one discussion so really excited to do so just a quick background in the history of hint water you guys started in 20 2005 much like what you're drinking right now you guys make a flavored water that's generally flavored with fruit the water is generally non-carbonated although you have a carbonated version there's no sugar stevia calories artificial nerves in the water dissolve that sound right am i messing out that's absolutely right we have over had 20 flavors of our water and and then a few years ago we came out with a a carbonated version and then a caffeinated version of the product too and so you started the business back in 2005 when you were making the switch from Diet Coke because you just didn't feel healthy drinking the 8 to 12 cans that you were drinking is that right yeah I just you know I I never realized this about myself but I you know was really I just I really just wasn't happy with where I was at from a health perspective and I had gained a few pounds but I had also also developed really bad adult acne which I had never even had as a kid and I really felt like my energy levels were low too and I couldn't really figure out what was going on and you know we were I was at a time when I had taken I had had three four kids now but I had three kids at the time so I was taking a little break from work I had left AOL where I was running their e-commerce platform and I just you know was interviewing for jobs we were like we my husband and I were redoing a house in San Francisco and I just took the time to kind of you know get in shape and it's funny I mean I always tell people when I'm out speaking about sort of my background story I really thought I mean I probably wouldn't have admitted it but I really thought that my pathway to get healthy was just shopping at Whole Foods like if I went into Whole Foods and I went shopping there that I was good to go like I was like you know I was going to be healthy and then I was like okay well I'm not really getting any healthier things aren't really changing for me and I had been an athlete growing up I was a gymnast and so I you know started I knew how to train and so I thought okay I'm really gonna start working out and training and and you know continuing to shop it and buy you know better for you products but then nothing was still working and so I ended up going to a few different doctors who basically said you know look you're probably having too many cupcakes and I'm you know and that's why you're getting all this weight and that's where you're having this problem with your skin our you know hormones or you've had babies too close to one another and none of it really made sense to me so your response wasn't like the cupcakes are from Whole Foods that yeah no I really you know I said no that's not really what's going on so yeah at that point I I really started to take a closer look and and you know maybe one of the doctors said hey keep a diary of everything that you're eating and everything that you're doing and I don't even think I really counted my diet soda consumption because I didn't really think of it as food I really buted as just like something else that I'm doing and and there's nothing wrong with it so why count it but then one day I was looking at the label on you know his diet coke was my favorite but the Pepsi people loved me because I always talk about you know Diet Coke and and yeah my problem with Diet Coke not my problem with diet that's a Pepsi and I realized how many ingredients have had and so many of the ingredients I just didn't really even understand and so I thought I don't know maybe I'll just put it to the side for now and just see what happens but not really thinking that would be any dramatic change and I swapped out my diet my diet sodas for plain water and at that point I really realized that you know I had things were getting better my energy levels were coming back my skin was better and I was losing weight and in two and a half weeks and it was it was a pretty dismal two and a half weeks like I felt like I had a really bad case of the flu I just didn't feel right and I now look back on it as as detox like I didn't call that Ben but I was really getting off of you know at that time it was Splenda and NutraSweet and some of the other sweeteners that were going into these diet diet drinks that I was drinking and I had lost 24 pounds in two and a half weeks my skin had cleared up my energy levels were back and that's when I was like God I've actually been marketed to and I've been told that something is better for me because it has the word diet and that for me was like this epiphany and again like I had I'd grown up in the publishing industry and the in the tech industry I never really paid attention to you know labels on food as being tricky and so at that point you know I was kind of living my life and let you know another six months pass and you know I kept losing weight I sort of went through a period wondering if I was actually really sick because I was losing weight so much faster and you know my skin continued to stay great and you know my energy levels great and and by the time six months rolled around by a I had lost 55 pounds which was kind of my you know college weight it was like my goal weight and it was dramatic like you know people would see me and they were like gosh you know wow you look like you lost a lotta weight and I'm like yeah I did and everyone's like you okay and I'm like yeah no I'm really good I feel I feel really good and you're like well what diet were you on I was like I wasn't really on a diet I actually stopped drinking diet soda and that's when I realized that I educating so many people about my experience including the guy who was stuck in shelves at Whole Foods when I decided I really want I started in order to drink water because then I realized I really wasn't a water drinker after all I thought I don't know how long I can do this because I just I'm so bored by to ignore it so it's slicing up fruit and throwing it in water and and then I went looking at my favorite Whole Foods in San Francisco for that product and everything had sweeteners in it that had fruit and then a lot of times the fruit wasn't even you know real fruit that they were using it was you know lots of other stuff so I you know really saw this like need in the market but I never really thought oh I should I should like go become a beverage entrepreneur I mean I really saw it as like you know this is this is criminal what I've experienced and so many people really do want health but I have a really hard time finding us and so you have this epiphany and you say okay you know what like water is boring it's hard to drink it just you know plain tap water or bottled water week after week and adding fruit sort of you know changes that dramatically right it's good for you and it's still water but it's got a flavor it's got flavor and it like lets you drink it consistently so you start this business how do you make it the first year like do you go to third-party manufacturers and say hey I'm interested in making hint water or are you making it at home I'm always curious like are you cutting up fruit as a third party manufacturer doing that how like how do you guys make this stuff yeah so we so initially I mean I was making it at home and and literally cutting up fruit and throwing it in water and then what I realized pretty quickly I don't know if anyone's ever sliced a fruit and thrown it into a pitcher but if you you know so even if you put that in the refrigerator what you need to do you know from a bacterial standpoint you can't leave it off but on the counter for too long but it's sort of I used to say it would get likes Meggy looking like it would have you know the water or the fruit would actually get sort of soft it would just like the Pope would be sort of funky after a while and it just wouldn't taste as good so I started to try and figure out like why was that and then what I realized is that if we actually took you know the skins and oils of the fruit and created it our own extracts and and then dropped a few of those into the water then we could actually you know still be using fruit but you know we're oftentimes we're using the rind so people like we just recently came out with a lime there are a lemon flavor and people were asking us for years like you know why don't you have a lemon flavor it's really odd and because a lot of times we're actually using the skins and most of the time we're using the skins and oils and so it would almost taste like you know that the lemon naturally has like a you know it can taste almost like a turpentine almost like a furniture polish like sort of smell to it now totally and so you know it's just again it was trying to figure out exactly how we could do that in the right way that it wasn't you know like reminding people of of that I mean same with cherry I mean cherry so so often reminds people love bad cherry medicine cost medicine that they used to take as a kid and you know that was the same thing it was like you know we just wanted to make sure and again we're not using sugars or diet or any type of you know stevia or diet sweeteners in it too so it's it's really there's not a whole lot to hide behind it's really a matter of the type of lemon the type of cherry the process and and you know so often times you know people will say to us well you know how do you get that well-rounded taste like year-round and and oftentimes we're using actually grape skins to actually round it out but again it's all you know vegan and I say that but a lot of people say like oh it's fruit of course it's vegan and I'm like well actually that's not the case I mean that was my epiphany when I was looking at a lot of these you know so-called diet diet drinks that were out there a lot of them that are claiming to be you know fruit are actually using things like bone marrow natural the turn girl in general has a pretty wide definition and so so you know cockroach wings for example are considered you know magical they're they're oftentimes used for food coloring the red color in particular so you know I always tell people that you know even bone marrow like even if you are okay with you know eating bone marrow at a French restaurant a lot of people think that you know the fact that they're actually drinking bone marrow and some of their drinks is kind of you know gross and and the fact that we're not actually they calling that out in all true drinks it's just that is creamy right yeah yeah I'm okay I'd be okay eating chocolate-covered cockroach wings once in my life but I'd want to know what I was eating if there were cockroach wings in you know a blow pop because it was bread I'd want to know that before I put it in my mouth like that type of transparency it seems like it should be table stakes these days in the food and beverage industry like an awesome bone marrow I mean you know either you know that's one where you know more and more we're seeing people you know not that they're vegetarians right or vegan and and just like they they are there's you know some mainstream drinks that are out there that they've thought they've been drinking for years that actually have that so so that was you know for me that that was you know really kind of we I probably spent you know close to a year actually trying to figure out we looked at a lot of flavor houses because I had you know run into I was trying to find a co-packer to actually bottle it we kept getting pointed to all these flavor houses and and that's the challenge that we couldn't actually I mean this was 15 years ago we couldn't really figure out what was in all of these flavors and a lot of the flavors just were not as real as you know we wanted them to be so that was when we started creating our huh and can you talk to me a little bit about that about what it looks like today at your co-packer today or but your bottling facility are they do they have like the rinds of lemons and you know pineapples and grapes and skins and oils does that happen a third party facility how does that work cuz like if there that must be a you know I'm always amazed at businesses like yours only because the because the drink is so spectacular but just like making it do you have like you know I'm reading this book by about McDonald's and they're talking about how they perfected the French fry and for a while they were like okay we got to make sure we get the oil right and the time right and then it turns out that like that's not the only thing that matters because if you throw cold potatoes in ten oil it's very different than if you throw warm potatoes and then it matters in terms of like the sugar and starch that's already in a potato so they have to go they ultimately had to go back all the way to the manufacturer of like the potato in Idaho in order to make a consistent french fry for product like yours you're talking about rinds and oils of like lemons and grapefruits and grapes is your co-packer doing that are they like getting these rinds and sort of mixing it with water what does that operational complexity look like no we actually have so we now have a we have a third party that just works for us that puts that creates tap for us so they do have that but what but we have multiple co-packers we are only distributing in the u.s. today but we send that into our co-packers so yes there any like crazy stats there are you can you say like you know we you know like I looked at something about like about Panda Express and they're like we use 30,000 pounds of chicken every X number of days or something to that effect do you got luck are you like oh my god where the Lord we're one of the largest consumers of grapefruit skins in the country yeah you know I I don't think we I mean we use such a tiny amount I mean in every bottle there's only like two to three drops of the oil and so I wouldn't actually say that you know we were like a major producer of it I mean what's really interesting about it we you know people always ask us like you know do you use organic fruit and we try to use organic whenever we can but you know the key thing for us is no pesticides and what I always tell people about organic fruit when you go in to you know these co-packers and you know our original co-packing plant that we used was and still use it every once in a while is that they also do they're on an apple orchard so they have you know lots of apples and they do other people's products or and in and I'm just amazed at how much fruit that actually gets produced if into juices that actually has mold on it and so you know I I mean it's it's a problem and so you know we don't want that's sort of another reason why we really want to produce our own our own flavors too because we're you know we have a lot more control over that and being able to see that you know we're we're getting what we're getting you know that doesn't have that doesn't have the mold on it but just in terms of you know complexity I mean we make it you know easy to to you know drink our water and and you know it's pretty it's it looks pretty simple on the outside the truth is is it's not that simple because of tempo and you know and and everything else about it but I always you know you and I have talked as as founders I mean you know there's all these founders stories that I actually my book is coming out in October that really dives into a lot of these you know nightmare stories along the way you know of creating not just hint but just sort of like other stuff for me oh well and and sort of my I was in the early days of CNN I mean just sort of a you know lifeline a little bit but and what I've learned along the way but but you know it's interesting we we produced the first non-alcoholic water company that didn't have with fruit in it that didn't have preservatives in it and so and for me I really you know just didn't trust the word preservative when I first started I couldn't exactly look back right and it's just and I thought I kept asking the question I go to these co-packers and I kept asking the question like you know why do we need preservatives and they're like because in order to have a shelf life to go beyond the shelf at Target you need to have you know extend the shelf life otherwise you know you're you're not going to be able to grow this company and so you know there was a point probably a year into being you know in Whole Foods we weren't probably a little over half the country and we almost just shut the company down because we just couldn't figure out how to do it and you know my husband Theo who's our chief operating officer I mean I really give him full credit I mean we literally like thought we had tried aseptic packaging and and you know really just we're looking at all different ways to ultimately do this and then finally I remember him getting up in the middle of the night and I heard him out in the kitchen really trying to figure this out and I said what are you doing and he was like you know I'm just trying to figure out if we can use heat and just to actually you know but it's tricky because of the sugars and you know you don't want you know to turn the fruit and I always tell people you know just in layman's terms it's like a cooked carrot versus a raw carrot or a you know rock Roth strawberry versus a Robert very different type of thing and so you have to be very careful with it and so it's not a straight shot of heat if there's actually you know ups and downs along the way in order to make sure that that doesn't you know change and so when I talk about like this is a product that is not easy I mean it's probably you know the biggest reason why companies like have had a hard time replicating it over the years because it's it's you know it takes time and it's you know it's an artisan product that is that is really you know priced as a mainstream product for you know anyone to enjoy and so and so the heat is that like a form of pasteurization that you're doing in order to provide shelf shelf life gotcha okay and so that was like one of early on you're basically like we cannot put this the shelf anywhere because the shelf life is several weeks as opposed to you know a year or two in which is what you really need to get intellect or yeah and so we assume I mean this is this is a segment my book I mean it's you know it's it's like funny now it wasn't funny then but I mean we used to go into Whole Foods and we'd stock the shelves in Whole Foods and we actually had inventory in our warehouse and in our garage but we would just tell them like oh we we this is all we have we're out of stock and so they would yell at us because they're like you guys don't have enough stock you know to maintain this relationship and the truth was was that we were really nervous that we didn't have you know the stability on the project and you know I always tell entrepreneurs this too we were you know CEO who's you know my husband and our chief operating officer I mean he was an attorney prior to helping me start hint and he had worked on the the case I don't know if you remember voilá when they had the e.coli you know a few kids died I mean it was horrible and they were not like pasteurizing the product and it was awful and so he learned like a lot about you know shelf stability but also you know the dangers of it and so every single day literally in the early days of hand I mean we were taking our product to a lab to make sure that you know it was actually I mean it was truly we believed it was safe you know and knew that you know we didn't want to mess around with people's lives at all but when I see that you know I've talked I'm sure you've talked to many entrepreneurs and and especially in the food space I mean it's just it's frightening to me sometimes when I hear like people are like oh yeah no we haven't we haven't really figured it out because our volumes aren't that big and I'm yeah an ingestible that's nuts yes how could you possibly think of that's okay there was activity over there's a start-up Deora brand that launched a couple years ago identity argot had stability issues all of their deal wrote would melt basically three months into their shelf life and you know they got called a target target ended up giving native their shelf space and it was a complete disaster and like from that perspective it's bad both from a brand perspective from a customer perspective his target doesn't really trust your brand any longer and from a you know consumer perspective because you're selling an inferior product or an ingestible product that could harm a consumer that's like unforgivable yeah I do yeah it's crazy I do want to talk a little bit more about that you know in preparation for this podcast I looked at you know I did a bunch of research on him today you guys are a massive company you know like uh uh you know there was this guy that works at native who would not drink any water he would only drink hint water I'm pretty sure he brushes his teeth whatever and anytime we'd have to travel he would have to instacart Hinch water to the hotel before we landed so we've gotta look Vegas and New Orleans and you know different like in Minneapolis and he was instacart in water it was crazy a huge fan of him and you know from from what I can tell look you know I've seen articles in 2006 2018 you guys were somewhere in the 90 to 100 million dollar run right back you know back then what were the numbers looking like in 2005 and where were you getting sales from because you know this is 15 years ago direct consumer isn't nearly what it is today where were those sales from and what is it would those sales look like so it's uh so you know we started out I mean literally delivering cases and and you know I was doing and initially I just had my fourth child and and you know I joke about this but I think the you know just really thought I was out of my mind I mean I had four kids it just sticks and I'm you know a previous vice president you know at Ebony and you know it's he's like wait I get that it got you really healthy but why do you really want to do this I mean you're you know you could go get a job somewhere else and you know go make a lot of money and and I thought you know for me it was really about you know resetting health for people and and like I didn't care whether or not I didn't set off in my business plan to actually Oh build a billion-dollar company or become the next red bull or vitamin water or whatever for me it was really about you know helping people change health and I really believe when I described this company to people I said if I can actually just get it in the hands of people especially the people that are drinking these you know flavored waters or vitamin waters or diet sodas or even you know full-fledged sugar sodas and get them to drink our product maybe they'll eventually get to water maybe they'll never get to plain water ever but like we could actually change health and you know the world and you know in our little you know area or whatever and you know that that did not only mean you know helping people too like we were here and early on that this was you know and I saw it myself helping me lose weight but it was also you know type-2 diabetes at that time was probably 2% of the population I mean it's you know upwards of forty five percent of the population just in the u.s. have you know of type 2 diabetes or prediabetes and heart disease and lots of other things so I thought you know that how do I get it in the hands of people and so when we initially went into Whole Foods I mean that was the first retailer and around the Bay Area went into some others I was actually interviewing sort of like not seriously interviewing but had had a few conversations with this guy of meat cortisone II who was at Google at the time and he worked with my husband at Netscape and and so Amin was talking to me about a job at Google and you know he's really nice and kept upping the salary that he was talking to me about and after a while I was just like you know what I mean like you know it's really nice and you're I consider you a friend in this job you know likes you a lot but for me it's really about it's not about an offer right now it's about I don't really want to commute down to you know Palo Alto and Mountain View I really want to stay up in the Bay Area but then I really you know I just want to go and do this and see if I can actually help lots of people and so that was a major turning point for him because amede you know somewhat joking but he was like oh well do you have do you have a sample of this product and I pulled it out of my bag and he was like of course you have a sample of the product and you actually selling him during a job interview in order to get hint water into Mountain View's offices yeah but I never even thought of it as yeah sure but he said to me he was like oh you know we have the sky Charlie you was our chef and you know he will talk to Charlie about it and and see and I was like okay cool yeah if you guys like want it in your offices I'd be really fun and I had no idea what I had stumbled upon and you know Charlie ends up calling saying hey I really like a meet a lot like can you send me some samples of the drain yeah we'll give it a try and see what happens we've been doing food and it's fun well but let's you know give him to try as well and and you know he called back a couple days later and he's like do you guys have more supply and I'm like yeah how do you have you know another office or he said oh we're just going through this like crazy to vary within like two weeks of that conversation we don't need Google became our number one retailer I mean I saw your number two accounts you know Whole Foods and Google's sort of like looking into every gotcha yeah they quickly overtook it I mean like I say retailer and quote right they weren't really a real killer yeah and they were they were just in you know it's interesting because Google was really trying to make sure that they had healthcare better for you you know products not just drinks but also food like they were I mean they were really aware of it and very early and so and what you're yes so that was like the beginning of 2006 and so I mean that was like and again like we were you know still trying to get our shelf life or shelf life was maybe six months and we were trying to figure out if we could you know get it higher at me today our shelf life is two years do those b2b sales still make up a again part of your revenue but you know you selling to Google I know I discovered your product and startup as well when I was working out of somebody else's office and was in the refrigerator those pdb sales make up a significant percentage of our revenue today or is it sort of like now you're in Whole Foods and Target and Walmart and sell on Amazon and so it's still nice but less significant well it's interesting I mean we're we're obviously taping this during a crazy time in history sure yes that's right and so our food service sales you know just because nobody's going into offices is actually cut with it's interesting we're actually talking to a lot of the executives that some of these companies and some of them are even sending them home cases home to their employees just as a you know gifting them just to say hey continue to stay healthy but you know food service has really been I mean that the sort of corporate food service has been massive for us started with the tech companies in Silicon Valley that just really embraced this and then they would embraced us and then they would go into their local store and say hey look you for the product yeah yeah that's great what a great look flywheel effect ya know and I always tell entrepreneurs too it's like you know it wasn't strategic that we I said God if I can just go get Google or I can go get Facebook I mean I remember you know Sheryl Sandberg's assistant when she left Google and she went to Facebook and she called me and said hey you know what you guys delivered this company Facebook and they were still in Palo Alto at the time so I was like sure you know no problem is crazy yeah and so that's it and so what is it and so when did you look you know in 2005 you get Whole Foods 2006 Google comes along Facebook comes along the Business Objects some point obviously the you know something sets in your mind we like I'm not just delivering products anymore this can be a legitimately large business at what point did you raise money like you know you uh compared to most of the startups that I speak with in San Francisco that have not been around for 15 years you know it's pretty recently like you know their their first chat one more than five or six years ago when did you guys first raise money in the lifecycle of your butt so I think it was early 2007 and you know I we sort of did this a little bit differently I mean maybe to some extent you know I I think you know you're probably you very similar where you know we really thought early on that I still wanted to have like dinner with my friends and not have them in us in me like how you know how's it going right so I I was able I mean we we had made a little bit of money and you know with Netscape and with AOL and so and we thought you know we have to be careful but let's just let's just try and see how long we can go with self-funding and you know I always tell entrepreneurs to I mean we have an amazing house in San Francisco that we had gutted and remodeled and all you know four kids were you know that we had a baby at the time but the three kids were in private preschools and private schools in San Francisco and you know I remember looking at Theo one night saying like you know this is not really that sustainable if we're gonna be sitting here like trying to pay for school like how can we actually conserve money and actually put it into you know our company and so yeah that's when we decided let's go find good public schools around the Bay Area and and you know and that's what we did and we move dr. Marin cut Marin County and you know again like marinas gorgeous and nice it wasn't where we were sacrificing so much yeah and so today can you talk about so today can you talk a little bit about how much you've raised you know over the last 15 years yeah I mean we've raised you know this this part is all public I think it's a little over 60 million but we've raised in a sort of a different way we we haven't done venture or you know no private equity we have a family office out of Brussels which was you know they've got a little more money into the company there into their their family office then than they originally did but it really stemmed off of the Stella veer family and said what you put why did you like the family office first as a VC look it's apparent to me to be clear I just want to make sure listeners understand like why is a family office different or better for you than a VC yeah I mean I sorted I didn't know back then when when we necessarily took money but these guys had actually been investors and vitaminwater and vitaminwater know had sold to coca-cola and so part of their they came to us and sort of part of their you know thinking was we really want to invest in you know healthy lifestyle and better for you products outside of Europe and so they were looking you know at the hint and you know approached us and said like why wouldn't you take money you know we add advisory we had an advisory role with vitaminwater and we were big investors and so you know that was really like our thinking back then but you know I laugh and I don't know if you ever talked to sort of Silicon Valley investors I mean look we are stopped in most of the Silicon Valley you know offices and and but and you know we definitely when we were going out and raising money I mean we would pitch some of these people and what's interesting is that so many of these people you know they love drinking here it would always start off like oh we drinking all the time we love your product everything's great but many of those people you know people always invest in what they know and and what they think they can add value to and so I think that they viewed us as a company that if we actually were doing it right then you know coca-cola would come in and they would just knock us off and the truth is I mean this sort of you know I'm skipping to the end game on this but the truth is is like you know Coca Cola's knocked us off like six times I mean and every time it's just not with their core competencies you know you know when people ask me to say yeah people will ask me the same question why do I attend P&G build their own version native and I'm like it's the same reason that when you look at a bird you don't you're not like oh now I know how to fly just because you've seen something grow who doesn't mean that it's in your DNA and the people who work at coca-cola didn't start coca-cola there are stewards of multi-billion dollar brands like sprite and you know Diet Coke and and Powerade and so like their skill set is to steward those brands and grow them as fast as possible but in a very different way than going from but the difference between going from zero to 50 million is very different than going from 1 billion to 1 billion and 500 million dollars right or even 1 million 1 million 50 million dollars like it's a very different skill set I mean sorry when the first you know when the first time that they came in and and knocked us off I mean I was talking about it was on a timeline but like that was a really bad day I'm sure you guys have this you know same day by one of these big guys I'm good what I realized is that it actually has helped us to get more space because they eventually have given up because you know there's probably internal fights especially you know when you look at kind of the mothership of these soda companies it's sugar right which is sort which is totally counter to what we're doing we're just getting people to drink water that tastes better and that's it and so it's in and so every single time they've come out with a drink that is a you know competitor it's just it's just we've noticed it's hard for them and we end up getting more space yes just going back to your VC question I mean we would talk to these VCS and you know first of all a lot of these species I mean the core consumer for diet coke is female and it's no surprise there's a lot of VCs that are not female and especially you know 12 13 years ago when I was pitching so I be in there talking about you know my diet coke addiction and they would they would look at me like well that wasn't really addiction was it and I was like oh no it was it was real and like it was right up there with like you know cigarette addiction or like I'm like the same timeline and they're like really like people actually have that and you know it and again it was just not what they knew and so they would still keep ordering cases in cases a hint to consume in fact some VCS have told me that they won't invest in in tech companies unless they have hints in the office because they really really believe that like they that they you know understand what their employees need to stay healthy I mean crazy stories like that a lot of its most but but yeah I mean they just wouldn't end up investing and so and so we ended up you know going a different route and and you know just raising from a lot of individuals so we have over 100 investors and the company and and so John Legend is on your cap table I think my brother actually transparency is also on your cap table but I want to fast forward a little bit to today you know I've heard you talk a lot about how about 40% of your business is online now versus brick and mortar which is crazy because I think it's like um you know I won't talk to you a little bit about shipping costs later on in this conversation and how you sort of manage those because you know shipping water is not an easy thing to do but let's talk a little like um you know 40 percent of it is online sixty percent is in brick-and-mortar stores can you talk a little bit about the brick-and-mortar stores that you're in right now yeah it's I you know we've we've started in sort of a specialty store market which is like the you know Whole Foods and sprouts and and some of the local ones and then went into the conventional grocery I think where we really had the toughest challenge in congressional or in conventional grocery was with you know we just didn't have the bandwidth and and the people that the big you know soda companies have and so we would you know just get knocked off the shelf and you know we wouldn't have the slotting fees and and you know lots of stuff was going on I think that's where you know we really started to realize not only from a revenue standpoint but also from a you know it just wasn't as as challenging to compete inside of these firms and then you know lots of other it wasn't just Silicon Valley but lots of offices in New York we're cropping up that were extensions of Silicon Valley or LA or whatever and so we started getting into more and more and then you know companies that wanted to be like Facebook and Google and you know recruit people like they would they would end up putting us in so you know we became you know pretty giant in those companies and then and then you know we we finally got into target a few years ago you know in a in a pretty pretty decent sized way we were you know we started out with a few feet of space I mean it again like I'm sure you and I could swap stories on this it's just you know we we had gotten to a point where we sort of understood like if we didn't have enough shelf space then you know we just wouldn't yeah yeah and so we would like look little and so I remember reading a case study on Tom's you know the Tom's I mean their toothpaste and Pennsylvania yeah lots of tots of Maine and lots of things this was you know before they were acquired but I remember hearing sort of their sales plans and they talked to Beth about like they got to a point where they would tell buyers like you know if you don't give us this kind of space you know they their sales team would just say I you're just not ready for us short like welcome back like it's all good and so we've really started saying that you know to these large retailers because we knew that we would fail it unless we actually had a certain presence and so we we ended up going into target and then you know really got smarter about the data too and and started realizing I mean it's I'll give you a crazy statistic I mean in in target we do more dollars per square foot than some of the large brands like a vitamin water for example and and so that is like when you can actually take that kind of data and you can't do that when you're first starting a company right and you're not even gonna register on this data but when you start being able to articulate that to these buyers I mean you you know you're just getting smarter about you know the data and sort of what you're doing and I think just sort of how that relates for us into the e-commerce side of the business - I mean that you know is sort of its own story I mean we started we we had gotten into Starbucks another big food service company we were in 11,000 Starbucks and you know which was a great day when we rolled out in Starbucks and we were only one flavor it was the blackberry and but we were you know rolling along and doing you know two to three times what their goals were for us and and one day we got a call from a buyer at Starbucks that said hey we're you know we're gonna bounce you out of here because because Howard Schultz said that you know we're only going to have beverage brands in here that are distributed by Pepsi because Pepsi is actually doing the distribution for us for our ready to drink Starbucks drink and and so I always you know my big lesson learned from that day was you know don't have too many eggs in one basket I mean really that was a bad day and you know I don't cry often but I went home and I cried and I thought how am I gonna tell my investors aboard about this and then I remember a couple weeks later you know I resurfaced and I'm like look I'm not gonna lie it was really bad that we got bounced out of there but at the end of the day we just need to find these consumers because we were doing well and Starbucks actually paid us for product and they exposed us to places like Chicago and you know lots of places taxes and and places where we didn't even have distribution and so a couple of weeks after that happened we got another email from from you know another big brand they weren't even that big back well they were pretty big but they didn't have a grocery business I guess it was six seven years ago at Amazon and they were grocery business and I you know took the email and I said you know tell me about this grocery business and I I mean I had dealt with Jeff Bezos in the early days when he was just a book you know retailer when I was running when I was running aol's business and I really believed that I wasn't I didn't know if I really believed I I wasn't sure whether or not this was a serious business because I thought Amazon gets into little businesses and sometimes you hear about them and sometimes you don't and yeah I wasn't sure whether or not they could be serious and in the grocery business because of weight and all kinds of issues I thought I don't know maybe they have it figured out because they're doing books and those are pretty heavy and so but I had a lot of you know blackberry hint in the warehouse that was supposed to be you know going to Starbucks and so I sold it to Amazon instead I sold it to Amazon and so that was the only flavor that we had on Amazon and then very quickly they you know told us like you guys are one of the number one products in grocery but in addition to that what we're seeing is that you know this goes back to the data side of the story they they said we're seeing that your consumer is also buying things like you know and you know better for you product and I thought wow that's really interesting and I asked Amazon for the emails of these consumers because I was like I'd really like to reach out to them and they said no way you're not getting love to ask you but yeah sorry go ahead now well I'd love to ask you a little bit more about the brick but about the data side of things which you were talking about look like you know at native we were entirely direct-to-consumer through our own website so we understood things like aov really well repeat purchase rate when customers would purchase and if they didn't in you know X number of days what we should be doing in order to retain them and once we launched into Target and Walmart and CVS and Walgreens like that data became a lot more grey to us we did you know it was hard to understand we'd be purchased right because did you buy it or did you buy on our site and then you bought at Target did you buy and Target and then you bought on our website we don't know if it's your first purchase or your second did you guys experience the same type of like fuzziness with your data once you launched like you know going from selling everything yourself in 2005 to now having a robust online store of robust Amazon score a big target business do you guys experience that data fuzziness or like is there something that you're doing to sort of help you through that morass so I so you know we obviously have sales numbers that that can go and buy store and and I say obvious like you you know again you get to a certain level in these stores and and they'll start to give you some of this yeah it is does somebody like a target we definitely have that and then we can you know match that with how we're doing on our own website and which is what we did after you know Amazon but it's uh you know it's it's still very difficult for us to see that you know Lisa Smith is purchasing on you know drinking calm and then yeah they're also going at Target yeah I think the Holy Grail that's the holy grail of attribution yeah and I think it's it's really tough I mean the only way you know I think electronics able to do it because they get you to like get a you know products like like our first but I think what online has allowed us to do is when we see for example we can go back into you know I'll pick on Target or Costco we're going in nationwide in to enter Costco and the next few weeks so it's you know it's interesting because we're able to say to them like you know here's our top ten markets or cities inside of you know are drinking calm and we can also match that to a target we don't necessarily have to say oh this is target's data but we can say oh this is a major retailer and we can show this and you know again you get in front of a buyer that really understands the data and it's just it's obvious that they're missing sure right and then also I think from a standpoint of the one other thing that I'll just say really quickly that it allows us to do is that you know I always say to entrepreneurs that if for example a major retailer that's in Florida was to just come and turn you off as a consumer you know it's just I we're gonna kick you out of here and you don't know a lot gonna be in here you know what I realized is that without having our own online site we're actually able to go in and market so you're you're really hedging your bets sure and and it allows you you know to be able to grow the business I mean what I've realized now was that retailers need to do what they need to do right and and I need to do what I need to do for hands as well and so the more you can have you know options out there and certainly during you know this whole corona incident I mean it's you know we're considered essential so they're still in stores and and you know going in I'm doing my part to help the sales team once a day to go in and check on supply and and etc but you know I think being able to you know have a direct-to-consumer business that is you know higher now than forty percent of our overall business has allowed us you know to really like grow our business when you know these restocking issues are you know sure someone else's problem and unfortunately products get hit by it yeah and then do you like you know you were talking about getting into Costco in the next few weeks which is amazing congratulations first when it comes to that do you find other pricing issues among the retailers that you have in Amazon look for a native it was hard to hold the price it's hard to hold the price everywhere consistently like you know today Walmart will sell well 1197 and target will sell at $11.99 but that's basically the same price you know one of our concerns was that we would all of a sudden have somebody drop the price to nine dollars or eight dollars and then have to deal with something like that do you guys have any of those issues or are you guys sort of like good when it comes to pricing on the product so we never try to you know we give us suggested retail price and people have different margins that they're working on but but you know look Walmart and Target have amazing algorithms that will change on a dime you know depending and you know and and so you know we have consumers who write to us and ask us we buy on your side or should we go to Target buy the product you know they they're like we just want to know where what's best for the small business yeah right and so we always say to people like wherever you want your the consumer you're in charge any place that we deal with is you know like we're excited that they're you're growing your black boots there's always going to be people that are going to come to native site or hint site and you know buy and I think there's this perception that it's like fresher if you you know get the product on our site and you know that's not true I mean as soon as we make our product and you know I mean we actually it's a longer conversation but that's sort of another thing and we really don't we we pretty much are making our product on to me and I mean as as soon as like we we spend very little money in warehousing because we're we're making it and it is going out the door and so and it's you know constantly running but we've got sort of the supply chain thing where you know I think pretty advanced about that so even it through this whole corona you know situation you know I saw early on probably a week before people were even talking about sort of these hoarding issue news and out of stock issues I said to our sales team like this whole auto-replenishment thing is not working that may not many many stores that I've been into and you know the response I got back from our team was like well they keep telling us that they're on auto-replenishment and you know I mean we also have a product where we're you know depending on how much space we have in stores if people come in and buy 10 bottles of hint which is common you know they'll they'll wipe out the shell right yeah that's close and so it should and so it's supposed to match with register data to say like oh you've got to automatically reorder it but the stores have never seen anything like this not just for hint but for like other products and so you know they just couldn't keep up with it so we went around to all of the buyers of all of our kind of all of our companies that we work with and we said look there's there's definitely an auto replenishment product and and somewhere in here but you know we're not going to try and figure this out and we don't expect you to go figure this out if you wanna you know like order from us directly we've got trucks that will truck our product right into you and you know I'd say over 50% of the people that we deal with just said you know yeah let's do that even if it's just for a couple of truckloads to catch us up that's fine but again like you know the number of shelves that I look at now and that are just empty you know I think I think we we just watch it really carefully and you know people are like how did you know that and I said I just I don't know I've been you know I I've watched it and you know it's it's what great founders and CEOs or to do you need to really understand like why is this happening and I'm sure once you know the whole everybody gets back to work goes back into an office and you know no I'm sure the number one thing that a lot of these grocery retailers are gonna do is figure out this auto-replenishment thing because it's a mess it's you know it's personally and I don't know who owns those companies and those software's but they're they're not they're not perfect sure would love to shift the conversation really quickly to marketing have a couple questions here one have you guys had a booth at Expo West in the past and I'm pretty certain you have or you've been taxed by West find those types of events do you find out types of events helpful to your business to like network with buyers like I'm sure there are a lot of people who are listening who are gonna be starting food service businesses or who in the or in the food or beverage industry who you know may not want to spend the money it takes to get in tax by West did you find that to be helpful for when you were growing hint yep for sure I mean our first one our first show was at fancy food in New York yeah and in a few weeks after we actually put the first bottle on the shelf at Whole Foods and I mean I literally got the worst space possible and in New York Birkin and I had no idea you know a bit just some tech booths but I just thought I mean it happened so last-minute I literally like brought my own table in and set it up and it was just I mean it was super bare-bones and we had every buyer from Whole Foods lining up so I always tell you know entrepreneurs to it it's like sometimes when you actually look pretty scrappy but you have a great product it like it's it's you know they're they're gonna come come by you and you know and and they'll they'll recognize that you're you know that you're authentic and real and you know I I mean I I laugh now because I had no idea what uNFI was and some of these distributors have seen Cisco trucks around but I had never really figured figured that whole world out so that was our first and then and I would say a couple years later Expo West which is an Anaheim every year that that's been I mean that's a great show and I think the one on the East Coast has has been an OK show as well but the a big one and yeah we've been doing it for 14 years and I'd like some brands I mean some brands like actually write orders they are at the shows that's never really been our purpose at our goal I mean we use these trade shows not only to you know get with buyers but also to really understand what else is going on in the marketplace from a marketing standpoint and just talk to other you know people there and and now it's gotten to a point where you know it's just a time I you know we have over 200 people in the company now and and so for us we actually try and you know staff our booth with people that you know don't get to work the tradeshow booths like we don't hire you know the booth babes or whatever colors come and yeah right we get we get our team in there you know who just like love being there or passionate about the product yeah yeah you know I've always heard things like when you're sampling it costs go for instance you can either get the Costco employee we used to hand out samples in which case you'll barely move any product but if you put your own team member there who's really excited about a product like hint water they will go through samples really quickly and go through sales much faster because they have somebody who's authentic and believes in the brand and passionate as opposed to someone who's like you know one of those people who is just handing out tiny samples like go on go on your way they actually know the brand and when a consumer asked about it they can respond to it but ton of questions I've also noticed that you like this year you guys had a Super Bowl commercial yeah it was can you talk a little bit about that like you know yeah that is insane I would love to like understand how that sort of came about you know I've seen certainly seen the commercial where you know somebody's talking about how they really enjoy blackberry and they've got blackberry on their face and somebody else licks it off their face and they're like the hint water they hit water flavor the blackberry flavoured hint water tastes more like blackberries than real blackberry can tell me about how that came about can you tell me a little bit about costs and stuff as well I think everybody's always curious about Super Bowl commercials yeah and how like whether they're extravagant or not we'd love to hear the background yes so I mean it was a pretty crazy story we had started to do some TV and just run in remnants you know ads so we shot three commercial was actually in the fall and two of them we had running and you know it's uh we were running just for about eight weeks on you know just various but like some news channels so some people had seen it and then some sort of overnight stuff we were just sort of testing it and and then we were also not only testing the brand commercial but we were also there's a tweet diversion and that is direct-to-consumer so you could actually you know you get an offer and and doing all of that and so so we have this one ad that was sitting in there and I don't know it was it's a crazy story one Sunday so I you know was that CNN for a couple of years way way way back and I had just run into a woman that worked with me at CNN and it's now you know pretty high-level at NBC and just happened to see her at a conference and earnings Laura and I was chatting with her and I don't know one Sunday I just was like I should just text her and just ask her you know I knew it was on Fox and I should just ask her who's like if she knows anybody at Fox and if there's any inventory and I had sort of heard that they were sold out but I never really trust what I hear and so she's like oh yeah you should like you should you know just Texas this guy he like runs Fox Sports and he's a good friend of mine and just tell him to Laura sent you and he laughed he said oh no we're totally sold out but he said you know it's funny that you mentioned this that there's I just spoke to somebody who was doing regional stuff and I was like what do you what do you mean I mean obviously I know what a region is but he said so in the major areas like San Francisco in New York and Chicago there's they have to leave a little bit of inventory in those markets and I said so you're saying that there's like multiple people and and this is literally two and a half weeks before Super Bowl was running Wow and so I and so he said do you have an ad and ice you know it's sort of like I wasn't sure that was it sure gonna be the advent I was like yeah we have an ad you boys do you Bluff do you know there's uh he said yeah you should talk to this guy you can drive this one guy and he can get him for all the markets I still didn't really think that it was gonna happen but I was just I don't know I was bored and amused by it and I had never really you know I had started joke like we've got it when we were making these commercials I said they have to be like something we could run on the Superbowl one day but it was kind of something that I just was energizing the team about more than actually thank you seriously about it and so the guy reached out to me and I was like okay so the Super Bowl is in less than two weeks and you have inventory in all of these markets and he said you got in every market I have inventory left and and so I I was like you know so what do we have to do and he said well your ad has to be like traffic through not only the NFL or and not only Fox but also the NFL and so you know a couple days here a couple days there and so you know the response back from my team was like this that there is no way like you I mean you're just dreaming this is gonna be like five million like I'm like we already have that it's like it'll be fine you know the founder just saying it's gonna be great you know it was still I was getting shot down by everybody in the company they were like there's just no way but this is happening and and so then 10 days before I guess 11 days before the Super Bowl I you know resurfaced it and I said you know we should really we should really go back and do this and I said to the I said to my CMO I was like go back and just say a guy like give him a lowball offer and he's like err sold out for national there's no way that they're gonna go for it and I was like no what is it was running out of time right so one week before Friday before and I said this whole thing has to be trafficked by the NFL or else they're gonna be giving the beast spots away to their own advertisers by Tuesday morning it has to so so at five o'clock Friday turn in our bid on this and let's see what happens and I mean I have to tell you I mean we ended up getting getting you know the overall plan was less than 50 percent I mean we got we we had eighty percent of the country for less than a million bucks and so eighty percent of the country in terms of this saw the ad for less than a million dollars on a Super Bowl commercial there's a 30-second spot on fifteen thirty and so and so what was crazy is that what they said to us is it will run sometime during the Super Bowl it can be anywhere I think it was like I can't remember exactly I think it was anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes before or I think it was 30 to 45 minutes before the halftime show or after we literally were right before the halftime show so everybody was coming in to see the halftime no was shelling that's been getting ready and saw the spot and it was you know it it's a I'm you know it was it did amazing and it and we were we were so excited about it but not only from a you know consumer perspective and you know definitely it was you know where you've got people licking each other's faces which you know probably we wouldn't run that out in today's climate by yeah but he got people to remember it and they were talking about it and it was you know it like some a very small percentage of the population was was you know thought it was offensive that two guys were licking each other's faces like Gen X's and Gen Z's thought it was hilarious 12 percentage of the population will think everything is offensive like if you run they'll think it's offensive if you're gonna like if you want to walk on eggshells and please everybody you're not gonna do anything yeah did you a bunch of friends texting you being like hey I just saw your you're like company on the super on a Super Bowl that I have never said this about my cell phone like my cell phone I think I had over 400 texts within like from all over the country just laying oh my god oh like and I think that that was the thing - that what I was going to say is it wasn't just consumers but it was also you know people in the industry noticing it was investors it was you know lots of people most important was employees like the excitement that they were getting all these texts saying oh my gosh like you know there's this er there's this big soda you know Pepsi is doing it and Coca Cola's doing it and everybody's doing it but then all the sister the little underdog shows up yeah yeah so that's an amazing story and and so people people were so excited but again I think it's just you know never lose your scrappiness right like no matter how big you get and and you know I think my curiosity and also just my previous life of sort of understanding like what is trafficking and AD and it just like stuff like that it just takes time right and and we knew it was gonna clear but we but we just like we were playing against the clock and the guy that we were dealing with like knew it like and I just said like is your manager just freaking out right now that you have these open at this open as me it's like kinda like can we get the advantage of the leverage that you had that's fantastic so so we've talked about like some of your incredible marketing successes it sounds like a Super Bowl ad was fantastic you've had a bunch of successes that like you know that trick shows that you've gone to in terms of getting in front of buyers can you talk about any like tough marketing failures that you've had you know at native we had a bunch of marketing failures where we tried to buy really large podcasts or we try to you know buy our way into places and it just failed spectacularly where we'd spend tens of thousands of dollars and it just didn't work out we also had that when we tried like you know I remember the first like couple months that I launched the business we've lost thousands of dollars trying to buy Google Ads that's supposed to do you know I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of people who are listening to this podcast who aren't nearly at the you know level of scale that you're at but want to realize that you're also a human being and want to realize that you know there's failures along the way were there any like failures from a marketing perspective that you had in the last 15 years you can talk about yeah I mean I would say a couple of things to that first you know I again I I was in advertising before so I sort of always had this theory that unless we you know could really get the frequency that it wasn't worth it so you know we didn't we never really it's like went out and bought one billboard because I just thought it like one billboard it's just like anything right it's just wasting money if we're if we're just doing one thing and so I think that we've always believed like you know buy it buy a chunk in an area and you know do do it right or just don't do it at all and that sort of been our theory too that you know just just not only from a marketing district marketing brand standpoint but also from a distribution standpoint we've also just believed like if we can't actually do well in a store or in a market like we shouldn't be there right and I think it's the same sort of philosophy for like don't be afraid to take your time and which is sort of like you know not what everybody would say like I mean we've had so many you know brands that have said no you got to get across the u.s. you got to get into Kroger you gotta get Publix like Costco fast fast fast and so many of those companies aren't here anymore because we just spent too fast right so if you don't have the money to go into those markets and really do it right I mean my best advice would be you know just do the markets they you can be really good at well period right and and like slow that growth but I would say you know they're you know even I'm just thinking about you know Facebook I mean Facebook is sort of the the conversation for Aldi to see you know brands right and and figuring that out I think I think it's just it's really uh you know again don't put all your eggs in one basket right and I think you have to figure out constant how do you continue to you know grow and you know go back to your list and and you know get the existing buyers to keep buying until you find the right time to ultimately you know get facebook to be at a point where you know your cost of customer acquisition isn't crazy so I think that that's you know that's the key thing a lot of people say to us like why are you on Amazon but you're also you know on your direct-to-consumer site there's a value to us of being able to have you know a name that we can go back and market to and have a subscription service and then you know all of those things so it's surveys to understand what a o V looks like and repeat purchase rate looks like that's crazy that people would ask you that there's clearly value and you sort of having your own direct channel with consumers yeah totally and and I think it's just it's again you know I never I mean I look at even I think about I talk about in my book the the whole Starbucks situation I mean it was clearly distribution I mean they were selling millions of dollars to multi millions of dollars of product every year but for us it really was a marketing play where they were getting us into all kinds of you know there's a Starbucks on every corner right and there every couple of every couple of blocks and so we were getting you know we were visible in so many places and then you know when they turned us off I really viewed that as a failure for a lot of different reasons including I blamed myself for not like having you know too much in you know to that relationship I mean they were clearly buying we weren't writing them large you know slotting fee chapters or anything like that but I still had a lot of inventory I didn't there was a lot of risk with that and you know what I've learned to do though too is you know not be so hard on yourself and create all this anxiety around the fact that you know in some ways he failed in some way she tried I think instead figure out like you know what was the good I'm a huge believer that in fact when we to Amazon at the guy who was the buyer reached out and said oh I get your product all the time at Starbucks and so if if we were not in Starbucks won't be an Amazon we wouldn't be an Amazon you're a great story yeah right and so every so sometimes it just takes a minute to actually I'm sure you know the the Google story for you and sort of feeling like oh like I mean made a mistake there or whatever if you sit back for a minute and you actually just say like what did I learn you know I got that much smarter about how I do my buys for this next one where I saved mine and again like sometimes you have to connect a bunch of different dots to actually sometimes it takes time to figure that stuff out but I I just don't really view you know life in general as failing as much as you know I'm gonna it's teaching me that I can do better on the on the next run and and maybe that also is you know telling an audience that here's what I learned along the way I mean you know and and these are the lessons maybe it's you know I'm giving back to other people to learn from you know my mistake my feel ya know whatever but but I I just I'm a huge believer that that's that's such an important piece of this as well and you know you make the best decision based on the best information that you have and you know and I think that that's that that is so key and and sometimes you know that's challenging too because I'm sure you know you you have things in your head that you maybe did wrong or we're not exactly how you wanted them to turn out and now then people come to you and start talking to you about you know Google AdWords or whatever and you're like God you know I sure and you're gun-shy and so you know exactly what you need to get over or what the prices and so it's a lesson yeah yeah and you know initially when we were talking about marketing you were talking about billboards and how you didn't want to buy one billboard and there was like a frequency that you thought was really important in order to get consumers to sort of resonates a brand or think it when you were setting your marketing campaign when you're setting your marketing budget our campaigns do you think okay we're gonna allocate this much to digital this much out-of-home this much to you know b2b or are you sort of like look this is a living organism and we'll call the play when we sort of walk up to the line so we currently divide our marketing out into branded marketing adults as well as direct to consumer and so some company is actually having especially when you're small you have one person who's maybe you know kind of yeah sure kind of being or running the ad buys or whatever they're actually two very separate you know departments in terms of in terms of budgets but what we found is the more money we put into direct-to-consumer as an example in terms of ads like there's a lot of people who will go on Facebook or you know or other other places where we may show up and they're gonna walk into a Target store or they're gonna go on the you know they're gonna go on an insta part or whatever an order and so that for us we've just found it you know there's some carryover into the branded or sort of the offline stuff that they're gonna do they may not click the button and actually order online or you know if they see TV they may you know again go into their local grocery store or you know whatever they they you know might end up doing that so I think it's it's just a matter of there's definitely spillover into that so it's it's a you know I would say that from a from the standpoint of budgets are direct-to-consumer just because of its measure ability and because of the spillover we put more money into that but you know it on the on the flip side of that too we viewed the Superbowl ad as there was no you know at the end it said direct it said Dre Kim calm but there was no 800 number or nobody's going on don't know if Superbowl to go by but you know the next time that they saw a direct-to-consumer ad did they click it because they remember of course yeah and you know and so that's that's really how we you know how we view it and if the direct consumer side is sort of larger than the branded side it's Facebook like a native Facebook was king there and I think you've told other people as well Facebook is King therefore hint as well is that right is that where you say okay this is our yeah yeah definitely I would say I would say from you know third party like companies where we're doing doing it we're also you know we do we also you know go out to other lists as well and and do you know different swaps with other companies as well to try and figure out if we can you know email people and do some sort of partnership too so we've done you know it's it's funny to just from a branded standpoint and again sort of I can't say that I was strategically like you know brilliance or you know knew exactly what was going to happen but a few years ago Verizon reached out to me and they're like hey you know we've got this ad we're asking entrepreneurs to be a part of this ad would you be interested and I've been a Verizon customer since pretty much since day one I wouldn't get in cell connection through you know ATT sorry ATT but I'm sure they've got a lot better but it was but it was just I've just always been Verizon and and that was from my well days and I was traveling around a lot and so I still have my nine one seven number even though I'm living in the Bay Area and so they asked me to be a part of this and they didn't really give me a sort of clear definition of what it would be and they told me to show up in this like studio and I really thought it was going to be print and then after they did the print they were like by the way we think we're gonna run this and they they actually didn't run the ad until recently and so it's running on CNN like a lot right now and by some miracle they were just talking to me just like you and I were talking about some miracle I had a quote that they picked up on which is part of the Verizon and it said you don't have to be together to work together and so that has become a Verizon like quote and it says cure gold and founder and CEO of hint and but the number every time that Verizon ad runs people go on to our site yeah definitely it doesn't say drinking concert it's very subtle and then the exact same thing happened with a company called NetSuite and I was speaking at you know their their conference and you know I tell the story that I truly didn't know how to call Oracle to we were like moving out of QuickBooks and you know I didn't know how to call Oracle I just thought where would I start and I'd heard about NetSuite and and you know I just thought they're like maybe eventually we'll get to Oracle but for now like let's let's start with these guys at NetSuite and so we've you know grown with them we told them all their problems that they had and and we continue to grow and the CMO said to me you know I loved watching you on stage like you're just you know telling the story and and would you do this ad for us and I was like sure and so so that ad has now been running for a year and every single time that ad runs it's like you know hint people go to have water duck yeah sure yeah and so we have not spent a dime on that advertising and you know we we have you know I would say it's I would say conservatively between Verizon and NetSuite which is now an Oracle company easily 50 million dollars and adds that they will that's crazy in our brain I certainly seen a lot more like businesses doing that like I've seen a senior at first on like that sweet it's fantastic I've seen shipstation doing ads with a beard brand I've seen like Amazon doing ads with companies like not pods it's really amazing to see these large business or its business has sort of leaning into that I feel like it all started with American Express a long time ago and I've done some for American Express to you I mean I think that I've learned I've done it for some of their direct mail pieces I haven't done a television commercial but I think like that's you know the other thing that I say to entrepreneurs it's like you know none of those were intentional partnerships but they're they're authentic and they're real and I think that you know when you're out that's why I always tell entrepreneurs like the sooner you can get out and actually tell your story to and that doesn't mean like necessarily like talking to press outlets about it I mean maybe it does but also actually speaking and whether that's you know at whatever the hustle or shorter grind or whatever you go you know it you go and speak at some of these conferences and you start telling your story about like we initially funded the company with our American Express card and thank God we had like good credit yeah and because we needed it and you know to buy the bottles and the cabinets and then you know American Express reached out like took them six months so they reached out and they're like we want to talk to you about the story and thank you for being a customer and then suddenly you know it was clear that they wanted to get you involved and so those things are you know so valuable like if you can figure out two or three partnerships that you have where you know you just really believe I mean again like you know I had another phone company reach out to me after the Verizon one and I was like you know I just I wouldn't do like I wouldn't do another food company I wouldn't do you know but I I just thought like these are these are companies that I truly believe in and and I think like if you can borrow equity from those brands because they're clearly borrowing equity from our grant right we're startup we're a female founded startup like there's lots of reasons why I don't bring you products yeah 21st century completely agree that they're do that is marketing and I'm just saying like that that is one where I think nobody's really thought like I mean we've we value those relationships and you know like that is so big and and it doesn't cost you any money yeah it's company money yeah and so that's that's amazing yeah I'd love to talk a little bit about the other categories that you've launched into uh early on we talked about hint water boat that was I'm not sure if you call it flat water or like non-carbonated carbonated still water so still water carbonated you know hint fizz we talked about caffeinated since then you've also launched a couple other categories I know you've launched hints sunscreen which smells absolutely amazing it's a spray sunscreen I think you've launched nto ruin as well are there other categories that are sort of coming up and how did you think about those cash you know for us I think you know it was this it was really again looking at how can we help the consumer get healthy right and we felt like there were a lot of consumers who were coming to us who were drinking our product and they would you know reach out and say hey you know what kind of you know makeup should I wear or what we were like wait what like we're water you know that's what we're doing and and so we've we felt like we could start to touch on you know these these categories that were in our opinion and not doing what you know we needed or what our consumer needed and so I'm allergic to coconut and so a lot of the you know natural units that are out there have coconut yeah and in them and so for me like I was totally on board with the concept of a natural deodorant but I wanted something you know free coconut oil right and so that was something that you know I just started to play around with the home and then I just thought huh this is really interesting and then you know for us to it's primarily sold online I mean we were and you know on Amazon as well as on drinking calm but you know for us it's really helped us to kind of understand this consumer a little bit more and what more they would be interested in as well I mean we we I and I think the same is true with the sunscreen I mean sunscreen was way harder than actually we embarked on it I mean you need FDA approval you're like I mean we use you know we're using the same essences that we're using in in the water for the sunscreen which you know they actually needed to do the FTA needed to do shelf-life testing when we ended up before we actually got the approval because most companies use fragrances they don't actually which is a whole other topic and you're using natural essences well yeah I mean and it was like it was crazy I mean that we were like what I saw in the beauty and personal care industry was so much further behind than what the food industry what what people were talking about and so but we were one of the first companies non mineral based sunscreens that was really calling out oxybenzone and so there's and so I really believed I had you know some pre-cancer stuff on my nose that wouldn't go away and I started you know really looking deeper at the sunscreen industry and you know I had grown up in Arizona have red hair way too much Sun early on and I had read about the stuff oxybenzone and I was like you know this stuff is really bad I mean there's the Center for Disease Control back in the late 70s that actually told the FDA that that oxybenzone may actually enhance pre cancer cell growth and they had recommended to the FDA not to approve it and somehow it got approved and so there's many places in the world where oxybenzone is not approved but in the u.s. it is approved and so you know we started calling it out and and I think for me this goes back to sort of like the big company strategy the number of people after we launched it from large companies who reached out to me and said hey you know we've always known that this oxybenzone stuff is not so great but it's hard because we have all brands that are housed in our house and for us to actually call out that means we have to reformulate everything to show you and so like that's really tough and so I was like okay well you know we'll just keep doing that right well we'll keep calling it out and so eventually you know you'll have time to go and reformulate or not and you will just have more runway to just go and build your company and so you know that's the thing that I also realized that I had done with hint water which was you know we really focused on ingredients and and you know that the ingredient was sweetener right if doc man look and then you start to look at the rest of the product and you know all the great stuff around it but I think it's no different for products to and more and more I think people are you know looking at their products it's not just about being organic or not organic it's really about people are getting smart about ingredients yeah I think you know I was speaking to on an interview earlier this morning and I was talking about you know the world today and and what is the biggest thing that I've noticed and I think that you know for the last few weeks since we've been in shelter-in-place I mean the number of conversations that I've had with people not only you know friends of mine but also business colleagues around health like people are realizing you know the health is is like such a key thing and everything yeah right it's everything right and so and and I think that you know people are trying to you know make sure that they're getting their exercise every day but then also eating right and eating well and I have not heard this conversation like you know everywhere where I go like I'm hearing it now yeah I mean people are just so focused on it which is perfect there been have there been first I I think that's absolutely true and I think you're right and I think like we'll have that conversation a lot more when the Kobe crisis sort of dies down because right now I think it's a struggle in order to make sure your fridge is stocked and in a way that you know where you can get food in a easy healthy safe way yeah once it becomes easy again it'll be a lot more important to people are there other beverage companies that have sort of crossed this Rubicon and gotten into personal care yeah look I I'm trying to think of other beverage companies that have launched personal care products do you know of any you know I feel like vitamin water or way back when did I mean chopsticks we had always had like a great lip balm or chapstick or whatever you want to call it so but I you know I don't I don't really know I know of any others that that really crossed over I mean I think like the challenge of course is that the soda you know companies like I mean look most we are today the largest independent non-alcoholic beverage in the country that doesn't have a relationship with Coke Pepsi or dr. peppers now so I think like you know a lot of companies and a lot of founders that I've talked to I mean they could not figure out to do what we've done nationwide without you know the trucks the coke trucks or the Pepsi absolutely no one beyond ten million you know it's like I mean beverages are just like sunscreens are heard beverages are harder I mean beverages are you know you have to like when you go into major markets in addition to the Cisco's and the UNF eyes and all the rest of it you have to have you know a DSD Network that is going into these stores every day that make sure that your shelves aren't wiped out and if you you know if you don't know that now if you're starting a beverage like you learn it really quickly whatever I'm sure focused on you know the 7-elevens of the world or or whatever you cannot rely on the stores no matter what category they're in whether it's club or whatever you have to have teams of people that are you know in those stores and actually helping to build out K stacks and and do you know in merchandise and make sure that your reorders or you'll fail and so that's why you know the teams are bigger it's sort of you know it's just what ends up happening and so I think when I look at these other categories too it's it's probably tougher to build the sunscreen and you know and we really haven't put a whole lot of marketing into any of this here I mean we're really sort of in the infancy stages of it but I think it's for us it's really I mean it's not take any more people to do it I mean we've got like a small group inside internally that can focus on it because it's just it's not as high touch as beverages you think it's a little bit like giving people haven't done it as much in the past because they're afraid of like you know coca doesn't want to buy a deodorant business or a chapstick business or do you think it they're afraid of dilution of brand or do you think they just haven't had the right story they haven't been focused on ingredients or do you think it's just because you know people haven't thought of it or like is there a reason that hasn't done that sir no I think there's definitely people have said you know you're starting these categories and you know the soda companies like won't like that when they're looking at you to you know to buy but I think that there's there's two things that I would say number one you know my my goal is not to figure out like how to get my company perfect so that really Pepsi will buy us right we have we have built a standalone company that is now profitable that has grown every single year for the last 15 years I mean we've built this really solid company and I think in addition to that we have a direct-to-consumer business that is I don't think there's any other you know company in our space that is doing what we're doing offline as well as online and I think soon people are these large brands are going to figure out that you know hint is a brand name that can stretch across multiple categories I mean I would love to do a home product not necessarily to go you know super broad on it but just to actually figure out because I'm all I'm all about consumer permission to and and you know and I think unless you test it you just don't really know you know and whether or not and and I think there's I see products every single day where I'm like if it just had that or like just be a little bit better and for me it's just really trying to understand you know when we talk about lifetime value I mean that's just extra bands the lifetime value of a consumer and if you can if you can do that in a way that doesn't jeopardize the rest of your sales that doesn't you know get get your team focused on stuff that they shouldn't be focused on then it makes sense and and I don't think it happens like I wouldn't go launch a company today and go into multiple categories yeah definitely say but we gotten super permission to do that yeah and the consumer and and I don't think I would have even like had the you know courage to go do it if I didn't keep hearing from the consumer help me you like help me just like you I have a coconut allergy just like you I had read about oxybenzone you know you should go you should go do this you should go do this so I not only feel like with our products we're helping consumers but I also feel like we're helping large companies really understand that this consumer like wants health right and they're no longer going to be fooled by you know these words like diet or you know natural or oxybenzone or like feeling like it's a you know plus it's like it's like these these things are engineering our health and and I think that you know that is the time we stand up to that we we stand up to it and I fundamentally believe it every single day that that's what we're doing and if and if there's products that I think we can do better you know I don't plan on having this company under my leadership be the next you know honest company the Jessica Alba's honest you know not the honesty that I just I don't think we need to do thousands and thousands of skews I think what we need to do is do a few skews well and really try and understand where the consumer you know wants us to go yeah what kara we're way over time I really appreciate you spending the time I'm gonna ask you a bunch of just really quick forward quick questions one what is the best-selling flavor of mint water it's a close tie between blackberry and watermelon okay what is your favorite flavor of mint water uh we just launched Clementine Clementine that's certain favor right now amazing yeah okay cherry cherry fizz is also I'm okay when you aren't drinking hint water what do you drink it coffee so I'm a coffee snob I love you waiter coffee another San Francisco great female founded brand so I'm very uh yeah I would say you know coffee and finally if somebody is um wants to start a beverage brand today what do you recommend and the first thing they do to get into a brick-and-mortar store is is it just trying to go into bodegas in New York is it to try and get a you know a meeting with your local Whole Foods buyer is it to try and get a booth at Expo West what is the first step that they should think of when they're like I've got a beverage brand or a food brand I want or beverage brand let's focus on beverage brands I have a beverage friend I want to get this into brick-and-mortar stores what's the first step there I think it's finding who you're on dances because I I think that if you don't you know if you're launching an energy drink and a whatever 22 ounce can that you know that's probably not the market for Whole Foods I mean maybe maybe not it depends on the ingredients but I think you just need to find out who your market is and then and then you know go and try and get in there I mean when I got into hold 15 years ago they had a program where you could actually go in to the local store and try and sell it in and they would test it out I'm not sure since am acquire them whether or not they're doing that or not but you know don't focus on the targets or the Costco's I mean start small and just keep doing well and just keep building and building a building and then I would say also you know social having social channels has just become you know absolutely critical and if you can you know do that right I think that that's the most important thing and whether that's you know figuring out who influencers are you know there's there's highs and lows and pluses and minuses to that but I think also just you know are you doing something from a messaging standpoint that you think an audience would really relate to yeah that that you know they would tap into and I think you know don't be afraid I know many days you actually you know delivered cases and you were you know at the trade shows and and showing up I think it's it's a you know I still see handi you know not necessarily delivering javonni you know everywhere but every once in a while you know showing up and and definitely at the trade shows and Daniel from kind bar as well and and I think it's like never be afraid to you know take care of your product and and make sure that it's being cared for and yeah that's the biggest thing fantastic thanks so much Gareth people want to hear more from you where should they like where should they here where should they follow you should it be is it on Instagram it's it on Twitter can you provide you yeah I mean I'm on all social channels at carat golden kar a gol di n I'm probably most active on Twitter and have a pretty robust audience there that's lots of fun and and so yeah that that would probably be the biggest place and then if you are interested in buying hinted at stores but also on our site at drinking calm as well as Amazon fantastic thanks so much for your time John really appreciate it this is fantastic awesome [Music]

what's up everybody Sean here with Sam and special guests for this episode Brent Brent how do you say your last name be sure be sure alright cool I've been trying to get you on for months I think our email thread goes back months the reason why is because I'm interested in the business of buying businesses I've been looking to do this myself so after I sold my company I said great I got some cash I can either put this in the stock market I could do sure you know I can go gamble this on a riverboat or I can potentially buy a cash flow and business that's a good solid stable business and so I started learning about that world stumbled around and saw permanent equity and yeah I've been interesting having you on on the podcast since then so why don't you tell us give us like you know the minute version of who are you and then also what is permanent equity yeah so permed equity is we like schedules of family of companies advise family-owned companies so technically we're private equity firm now we were just a small collection of my own capital and beginning I was an entrepreneur and I've been accidentally bought a business about ten years ago and that's what leaded to kind of what we do today but raised a business yeah so I had a mutual acquaintance saying hey you should meet this guy he's in your industry and he just got left at the altar for the second time and I took that to mean I should try to buy his business because why else would you tell me that he had no idea and he was just trying to connect to people that were you know in the same in the same field or similar fields and so I don't know I look about 2425 now I looked about 13 or 14 then and sat across from this guy and told him I went to buy his business and he laughed at me and said to two grown men try to buy my business how in the heck do you think you're gonna do it I said I'll figure it out we negotiated and he told me no thank you and in seven months later called me back up and said all right let's move forward and get it done so what was your company before so I started a kind of collection of regional marketing companies we started in 2007 kind of really got going in 2008 nine which were as you all know interesting times but it actually allowed us to grow and we adopted some video technology and becoming standard we think we were probably the first people in the in the world to use it for commercial purposes but what does this mean what's regional marketing you know we were doing look we were doing like ad agency type of work we're doing media buying we're doing digital work you know trying to scrap and claw and and sort of make a go of it yeah you for DISA Nate you're you're an agency just figuring it out yeah we Meijin see we had some unusual talents kind of under that agency because being in mid-missouri we didn't have access to a lot of specialty groups so we start building out our own specialty groups so we built that research we did some mobile and app development as well and and then some film work so those were kind of the three unusual buckets that you typically don't get animation see and how big give us a sense of the like level of success I think a lot of people one of the things we hear a lot is from the audience is like they hate when we fast forward and someone's like yeah I did this thing and then all of a sudden these amazing opportunities opened up and they sort of her like wait where were they before and so give us the before picture how are you doing how was that business doing financial today was it a big business small business yeah yeah so we saw Lucy or so I'm trying to spend a bit a while since I've thought about the numbers so we grew to 26 employees I think at the peak of that kind of before we were so we were doing fine I can make a living doing it I'm making good living doing it it wasn't the agency business is hard it's really really hard and I think that's probably what I've learned in my career is I've made all the mistakes I've tried and tested a lot of business models and sort of taste and try something you're like up didn't realize how hard that was gonna be and sort of you know move around and so you know I would say you know moderately successful regional marketing firm nothing special I mean I would say you know when yeah when we bought the the firm that we did called meaty cross you know we were kind of co-equals is how I described you kind of in the marketplace they were much more focused on government contracts that we were we didn't any government contracts that was we really attracted about the acquisition and the able to combine those organizations gave us a lot more cash flow than having them set for just based on cross selling different products that we had and being able to fulfill a lot more of the a lot more of the gross profit through sort of a larger organization that they had been farming out some stuff so that was uh it was kind of a nice combination so did you buy that first company under the umbrella of your of your marketing business yeah yeah correct got it and so it wasn't its own entity no well I mean it wasn't me technically it was his own density but it was a hundred percent owned by me and a hundred percent the other firms owned by me so I mean it's sure responsible so you didn't have a girl found her or any outside investors or anything yeah so I bought it with an SBA loan thank God for the SBA and so no it was it was just a who's SBA loan and rolled the dice and so just to give people a sense of where you're at now I think permanent equity you guys raised a second fund 248 million it's a 27-year fund which i think is interesting and you can talk about that and you have a ten year investment period and so so the first fund 50 million second fund 250 million roughly so what are you guys up to explain what the model is here and why that should be interesting for people yeah well so if you think kind of from first principles families got wealthy by getting involved in a business and holding it for a very long time and then over time using those cash flows to either fund new investments or opportunities and so we just have very much this Amalur mindset you know private equity is kind of the main methodology of how people have bought and sold companies that passed and it's a very short time clock if you think about it that way you're really from the time you buy it on time you sell it really needs to be probably no more than four years or five years at most and that's if you catch it kind of early on in the lifecycle most private equity funds are seven years with three one-year extensions so up to ten years maximum I mean technically you can't sell the asset you can go longer than that and everyone gets irritated at you but you're expecting to sort of have the capital return and so what that forces is is you know you just can't think longer than your time horizon for holding the business and when you combine that with a you know most private equity firms are trying to put in as little equity as they possibly can and maximize the debt and so what you end up doing is you take these great family businesses have been around for a long time you're sort of hitting them with the needle and that trying to supercharge them to grow them and get a higher multiple when you sell and you're making just very short-term decisions by necessity and you're opening yourself up which is pertinent now it wasn't as pertinent three or four weeks ago but now you're opening yourself up to a lot of downside risk you just can't withstand nearly as much shock as as you could if you didn't have any debt so we've just really taken the opposite approach and said we want to own businesses like a family would so we buy with no intention of selling the business and we're typically using no debt as part of their transactions which in the private equity world means that we're the weirdest duck in the world so how much what should total what's the total revenue of the collection of companies then we'll see so total revenue gosh I mean and then I imagine you guys try to run this like super profitably so then if you have a hundred and eighty million in revenue I bet you have a forty million in cash flow oh let's see here so hold on I you literally put me on the spot here I have not done our calculations recently yeah I mean we're highly profitable I mean the organization does real well I don't know if we're at forty million because we have some lower margin businesses were lower than that but yeah we do real well and and look I don't know all that anymore right so just from a like I don't want this to come across differently than this we've got investors the first fund owns five of those investments and then I own four outside the first fund that were the the group that we put together raised that first funded then the second one we haven't deployed any of that capital and yeah so we've got a bunch of dry powder I mean obviously it's been extremely fortuitous for us to raise the time that we raised and I've been having lots of conversations with our investors and there should be should be lots of opportunity lots of pain out there which is unfortunate we've got to try to tow that line we can talk about it between being a white knight and a loan shark and that's not an easy one to tow right and so so let's just if we just take a look at the the portfolio as is what types of companies are you trying to buy so you're trying to buy is it a certain price point is it a certain business model is it a certain type of owner what are you trying to buy yeah so we first want to buy something that we thinks gonna be durable and around for a really long time so you know if you look at our current portfolio we are in the swimming pool business like digging holes in the ground shootin concrete we also manufacturing in that space as well another company that's unrelated in the backyard product space it's a bunch of confused and sell through mass retail we are we military recruitment firm that was the first firm that I acquired me t cross we've got a military recruitment firm so it's not like Legion for military yeah so we actually work I mean we have number of different clients but one of our main clients is a civilian branch of the Navy that resupplies the ships that never came into port so it's called Military Sealift Command and we're responsible for finding and onboarding all of their staff on a yearly basis so it's like a staffing firm for a ship yeah well for a whole branch of military so it's there's their staffing there's a lot fourteen fifteen seventeen hundred civilian Mariners a year into that division so it's a it's a pretty large operation digital digital yeah yeah we have you know online application products but not mostly I think there's a lot of physical activities as well we have physic Reuters it's not sexy where the rubber meets the road real-deal business so we were talking about some of the differences you guys owned so me across which is a military recruitment firm swimming pool business back here at the base so you have a couple of there so you were saying you're looking for durable businesses that's like we say attribute one what are the other sort of key attributes are you looking at yeah I mean so we want to find a leadership team that we can partner with there's so many you know it's so hard to grow a business right and so a lot of the businesses were looking at we we either called has been right before the line of professionalization or maybe has just crossed it and there's this this real interesting you know sort of in-between gap or a lot of these firms they're they're too big to be small and too small to be big and the leadership teams kind of capped out they're just brute forcing and as much as they possibly can but they don't have the the system's the talent on staff to be able to grow larger and so a lot of the times we're trying to figure out from them you know do they want to get bigger there's some there's some firms we talked to and and they say well even though say I want to get bigger but the you know the CEOs answering 60 calls a day on a cell phone and I mean there's just no way right and so we're looking for a leadership team that I think has the base skills it's really really excellent at what they do and we're looking for the company to have a position in the marketplace that is protected somehow right so I mean we're not looking to get into just commodity type businesses we want them to have something unusual about them that we can really build on and help them grow and then you know this is gonna sound like a like a maybe a no-brainer obvious one but we gotta get to a price in terms that that that are acceptable to both parties right and there's roughly 400 decisions that have to be made to sort of dream that acquisition process I mean that's 400 opportunities to not agree and and it's very difficult and time-consuming and so a lot of is just trying to make sure that we think that a deal could be done as well and and so when you say the leadership team can you know what you want them you want them to scale so why are they selling if if you want them to stay in place so they're not looking to kind of like go do something else or retire or whatever you you want them to continue to operate and are they just looking for liquidity what is the kind of core motivation to sell and then do you have a problem where once they've sold or have you structure the deal so that they're still incentivized to just to stay on it do a good job yeah it's a good question so part of it so the leadership team in the the ownership is not always the same thing so some of the organizations that we get involved in the owner is is very much part-time and it hasn't been directly involved in the business for a long time and so for us it's actually that's a that's a decently good situation because we'd love to just you know continuity of it keep the leadership team well and and try to augment the talents kind as we go along some of the owners that we got involved in have stayed on and and it's worked out great second body the Apple they get down the road be much larger than even their first payment despite them selling a majority of the company so it really is a situation that's you know specific I mean I would say yeah for the most part some were wanting to take chips off the table some you know realize that they need help in scaling and growing so it's you know it's a variety of different reasons I would say that all of them have an exit somehow in their minds I mean if you're in your call it 30s or 40s and you want to work for the next you know 30 40 years you know I don't think many people like that are selling their business at least in the size range in the style of businesses that we buy Hey earlier you said that one of the best ways that families have created wealth was by having a business and owning it for a very long time so something tells me that you study like the wealth creation process I'm not talking about like just building a business that makes money but like like creating like a true wealth and so I guess what I'm wondering is with these people who are building these companies like I'm looking at I'm looking at like things that maybe won't ever be like massive massive but can create great wealth so I'm looking at game group I'm looking at selective search which is an executive search nice personal matchmaking that actually probably could be big anyway when you're doing this like what what are some of the paths I mean like because in Silicon Valley where Sean and I live the path for most people or the SOL Silicon Valley stuff which is sometimes sometimes not is creating something and raising loads of money and only a very small percentage and not truly getting wealthy until after you sell it or not getting liquidity at least and their salaries will be a hundred two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year so you can't like and you're living in San Francisco so you're not building it there but I have a feeling that you guys look at this differently is that true yeah well I mean certainly the types of businesses I mean you know we we have a rule we don't buy from somebody who's not already wealthy because if they didn't get wealthy doing it we're not going to so they're already they're already doing well I mean these people are the chairman of the Country Club they're there in the geographies they're in they're probably the people that you know the Chamber of Commerce would point to and say they're a really vibrant good local business or they're a bigger business national business that's based in that geography and so yeah I mean the the they're getting wealthy from cash flow yeah yeah these things make money I mean you know the you know we're typically I mean if we're getting involved now the company is making more than 3 million dollars a year of real you know real owner earnings what it sticks to the owner so look anybody and these are closely held so typically the owner will be one two maybe three or four people at most and so you know usually the one to three people that are that are owning the company are doing very well they've taken a lot of risk which maybe sometimes it's hard for people to see and they built it over a long time but I mean yeah they've done well for themselves and they're successful in you know separately an outside of the transaction itself and so the the owner let's walk through a typical one so i'm you know hypothetical owner of a business that manufactures wheelchairs we're based in Oklahoma and I'm the owner I'm the sole owner and I pull in let's call it three million dollars a year owner earnings yeah and owner earnings would be different than sort of EBIT at in this case rights here yeah I would say even - uh operating interest any sort of necessary capital expenditures to keep the business on current trajectory and a normalized compensation structure for the owner if they're in leadership of the company so it's like kind of if you hired somebody to run the company for you and you made all the necessary investments how much would be left over at your discretion where you can either try to inject it back into the company and grow it further or buy a boat so fill in the blanks for me so if I'm making 3 million a year what's a typical a better than for that company if the owners pulling in 3 million did you look at yeah I mean probably even odd would be three and a half to four something like that they like say it again so that was on three million in owner earnings would be four million in Nevada roughly yeah roughly I mean three three and a half to four I mean depends on the type of company we looked at an aerospace company couple years ago and they were doing 70 but done owner earnings was like three and a half or four Y depends on because it's because he doesn't so just they had they just they needed a large cash buffer no no they're having to reinvest in equipment to just keep their market share and sort of stay in place it just you know all that cash flow would be rolled back into buying new equipment buying more inventory you know all the all the type of things that the cash sucked into and how are they getting the money out of the business I mean are they is it are they typically LLC's yeah typically I mean it's a mixture I mean I would say probably ninety ten maybe eighty five fifteen is LLC's but either way I mean if there are C Corp kills typically C owners you know paying themselves a lot to avoid that double taxation so they're just paying themselves big ol salaries and just having to pay 50 percent tax yeah I mean if you look in California if you live in California so let's keep going for a second so let's say you're at three three and a half to four million eita and when you guys go to buy these businesses what type of multiple of course it depends on industry and it's very dependent but what's of range is it 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X is that lit is that the sweet spot of kind of the bulk of your deals yeah I would say kind of three and a half to five and a half would kind of be the be a normal range I mean we maybe would go higher for a really high-quality asset but I would say that's a pretty normal range in our segment which is you know kind of our strike zone is three to eight million dollars of owner earnings so in that range I mean on the upper end you can get into more traditional private equity territory and and you can see some so well you used to see as a three weeks ago this is again I got to read orientate myself to the new reality but yeah I would say three and a half to five and a half times and then there's usually a component of that that's held back earned out or downside protected in some way so we're typically paying to to kind of two to three and a half times cash and close and then the rest kind of on on the upside depending on what happens gotcha so you might have a let's say ten million dollar price tag for the cash at close and then plus maybe four million three million bucks that's that's earned out so now you go to SBA and what you were saying is that you guys don't do debt you got years or no debt or you use less debt than a part a typical private equity firm yes so so the SBA was on the first transaction I did not you don't do sp my own money that we have no we have no involvement with banks or the SBA or anything like that now I'm guys just do cash deals you say here's ten million bucks we're done now why don't you use debt yeah well so that's one way to take a good company make it a fragile company you know the more debt you're layering on and the sort of the wider the variation of outcomes that you expect to happen and obviously pandemic risk is something that was not a lot of people's radars us included until recently but it's a you know it's a good example of why we think that not levering these companies especially in the beginning when you're starting to get to know them I mean until you own these companies you just don't know what you're getting really until you get you know underneath the hood and there's always more risk there than you think there will be right so you know our our mentality has been going with with all equity no debt try to keep them very very robust on the balance sheet and make sure and we're buying these with full balance sheets attached to them right so working capital is all included so the net worth of the company will be you know fairly robust going into the transaction and then force as we overtime as we build cash into these companies then we can decide what to do with it but working capital bucket is kind of like them you got to fill up the bucket first right the owners can get anything out right you got to keep the machinery lubricated and when you buy a company what is the first three months six months are you hands-on with that is it do you have an operating partner who does that how do you guys make sure that you and you buy an asset you know a destabilize it and be you actually start to grow it which is I assume why you bought it in the first place yeah so so our philosophy there's a lot of private equity firms out there that have these like you know 30-day 90 day 120 day plans right we don't do that what we try to do is is take a humble attitude towards it and say look we we know some things we have some talents but what we want to learn and and and come alongside them they're the experts they've been doing it for a long time so there's a team of 16 of us so so it's not certainly if I don't get the impression this is just me there's people far talented more talented than I am on staff and there we have a dual hook in structure post close so our financial team hooks into their fine Angell team and creates feedback loops and then we have a we calls portfolio partner there kind of a Board of Directors in a box that is overseeing kind of the executive leadership helping make very high-level decisions I mean these are autonomous operating units I mean so there's these are these are not we're not injecting these people into the companies to run them but they're in touch with the leadership teams all the time doing you know a variety different types of calls and meetings throughout the year and how many companies are there there's nine that you guys own yeah got it that seems manageable yeah I mean it's so for every kind of three to five companies we we acquire we got a higher one high-level financial person in one portfolio partner and that's kind of their their grouping of companies that they're kind of running so we're almost creating like a fractal if you want to think about it that way down into the organization so that it scales as certain linearly in that way so Andrew from tiny Charlie might have friends with him and we I just shoot the with him every once in a while and he emailed me he's like tweeted this thing and he sent me the tweet of how he met a guy who had a cool furniture store and he goes oh this is neat you need to put that on Shopify and okay I'll partner with you let's do it now I own part of it and he also did the same thing with like a local news outlet in Victoria where he just like seems like he's spinning up stuff so fast I'm like Andrew I don't know how you track all this this is crazy they're not tracking 9 is easier then tracking the 9 is hard but it's a little simpler because it appears from the outside as though he has got 40 different things how does how does that compare do you think with what's up in like tiny and this this is keeping it on top of all this I mean and that seems really hard to focus on where to put your focus yeah I mean I I know Andrew a little bit I don't know him super well I mean it seems like he's been successful I think they're getting involved in in for the most part more internet based software based type companies so it's just a very different model so I would say I have no idea how they're organized internally I can tell you four on our end is it a lot of work is it difficult of course it is write anything worthwhile is gonna be hard you know internally how we've created that structure though it's it creates a very manageable focus group right so you can you can allow a small group of people be highly focused on on certain outcomes as opposed to being all over the place I mean I if it was just me and a partner of mine like that we were trying to ham and egg this thing like I'd go nuts there's no way especially right now I mean with all the turmoil that's happening there's just no way you can keep everything separate and you know watch legislation that's coming out and watch legal and accounting and meet deadlines for audits and I mean it's it takes a full team and so yeah I mean we're obviously blessed to have that earlier you talked about the one of the things you buy a company I said that there's the your sweet spot is in between like it working out like it working and it being professionalized right yeah and I think that when I so I start the company that I have I started when I was 24 it's a good business now but what I learned the hard way was that actually to make something more valuable you need to take yourself out of the equation as opposed to like you know this Mark Zuckerberg thing were you just gonna super Superman this thing into like existence it's actually far more valuable even if that means you have a lower revenue number to have it where it's like a machine where people can be where you put people in place and it's not just on the shoulders of one person sure can you and and I learned this from David Houser shawnee no David Houser I don't okay this guy named David Houser he's one of our little we waste a little bit of money he's one of our investors he started grasshopper which it was like yeah you know grasshopper okay okay so it helps entrepreneurs it gives small businesses a phone so it's like Google Voice on steroids and he sold it per I think 300 million dollar really successful and he wasn't even the CEO he started it and owned the company and hired a CEO to run it and he taught me how to do that and I think that's fascinating can you talk abut but that's different than one of our a lot of our listeners probably think about they think about if they're gonna start it they gotta be like running the show can you talk about where you've learned this process and and why and I guess the companies who you've bought how big successfully navigated that to where the owner is no longer like the person yeah yeah so I mean for for us I'm equal one I I knew my own limitations I knew that there was no way that I could just brute force this thing on my own and I mean I think always subscribe to the bring bring people that are far smarter and more driven around you so that's how we build the organization I I hope in three to five years I'm completely useless and they just give me my ball of yarn and let me play with it so but in the organizations that we look at we call this found remote so this is probably the biggest danger of acquisitions as you buy a company that is that largely all of the goodwill is tied up in the relationships expertise drive of the founder and there's no really way to transition those separate from maybe coming alongside them and over a very long period of time making that transition happen so I for us we try to select against that we want to see repeatable processes we see a healthy layer of non-owner management we want to be able to see that we always call it you know hit by a bus risk so if anybody in the organization can get my bus and destroy the value of the business that's just a no-go for us but tell me what you've learned on these people so how do I want to make my company like that how have you what one of how they've done it best yeah so I mean I think that the methodology that we've seen work the best is take the things that either you aren't good at or you don't want to do and start giving them to other people and then over time as you sort of continue to offload and offload and offload you just kind of move up until eventually there's nothing much for you to really be working on I mean if you have a lot of free time and you have a lot of flexibility we always talk about if you have the option ality to get involved or not to get involved a lot of these owners you being good example that could probably add a lot of value if you chose to get involved but you also know that the things gonna work out fine if you don't get involved and so that's always ultimately the test now we also have a lot of owners that we talk to and they say oh I'm not needed in the office at all I you know this thing runs itself and we say to them oh that's great when was the last time you to get vacation they're like oh I think three years ago I went on a weekend getaway with my wife and yeah you know you're like really so there's that balancing act of self-awareness as well is there any resources that you turn - or have turned - to learn this or that you can tell me and our audience to turn to in order to learn how to do this successfully gosh I don't it's more just you know getting hit in the face over and over again hard knocks Brett where you finding these companies so are you is it broker network are you are there websites you use is it inbound because you do a lot of content or you know what is the explain how you find the companies that you end up looking into and potentially buying yeah yeah so we're fortunate now we do a lot of content out there actually podcast is one of the things that it's been helpful for us so thank you guys for having me on but we it's all inbound at this point so we're not going outbound to anybody other way website oh there you go I got your book if you're listening to the audio version which you almost certainly are I'm holding up the messy marketplace which is Brinks book I bought this like six months ago I bought it right after we sold our business so it wasn't really applicable I was kind of like Oh what did I do wrong - everything fine I think it turns out just timing was good you know getting in before the whole world descended into chaos was it was a good idea a good time to sell but I didn't know that you put out this book and it seems like you do more content than and I would say the typical kind a buyer or private equity firm yeah I mean I so so you know I own most of my career to just ripping off venture capital is in reality so you just look at how did all the you know Fred Wilson's Brad Feld Schuster's and Greece and all those guys how did they break into the world and it was basically by pulling back the curtain and helping educate people and so I mean that's what we've we've taken that to heart and we started very early on so we've been producing boy cruising content talking to people for probably have seven or eight years now it's going back a long time and so yeah over time that compounds right in the beginning you're just shouting into the darkness and no one cares and then over time you know you sort of get people's attention our goal is just to be the first stop for anybody who wants to sell their business and we also try to be helpful on the backend so all of its inbound we have a scout network which is common in Silicon Valley but very uncommon in in private equity so we've about 700 people now that that Scout opportunities for us which is fantastic and we obviously pay them when we are able to consummate the transaction any of a capital camp right yeah yeah so Patrick and I yeah so we we were complaining one night about how all the events and finance were terrible and how it'd be fun to get like a cross-section of people together specifically the you know BC events private equity events very few events to get sort of a broad cross-section of people doing interesting things together and so we complained about it enough III said the battery said well we just do something about it and so he and I partnered up and we hosted the first one last year is fantastic about 250 people from 11 countries five continents came in and that was great we have we did wonderful time hosted in Columbia Missouri in my backyard but it was you know I think there was one other guy from Missouri there so it was very not not a regional crowd if you if you know what I'm saying and unfortunately this year we had to postpone it due to the virus so we're pushing into September hopefully that we were able to flatten enough by then that we can we can have it hosting them give us some predictions about the virus in the the way the sort of what's happening to businesses right now you know on one hand you said your timing was was good in the sense that you've raised your big fund before all this and now a bunch of businesses are gonna need liquidity they're gonna need you know somebody who's a stable capital partner to come in and buy them what do you guys think what's your prediction on how this gonna play out well for you and for the economy I would say yeah well so so for let me believe broader I think what what we're predicting and of course no one has an idea right we're I'm trying to do this we can't triangulate information we think it's gonna be a pretty long if you want to think about it a good analogy I heard was a blizzard a winter or an ice age right it's kind of about the three stages probably you know I think the blizzards gonna last for another at least six to eight weeks probably longer than that and then I think we're going through a period of its to be hard to restart a lot of these businesses so there's in in theory it sounds oh there's economic problems as nobody'll you just kind of go into hibernation and come back out everything's fine right in practice there's a lot of start/stop problems I mean you guys have run businesses you know if you had to mothball everything and try to restart it I mean you're not be able to do it it looks to be very difficult to do it and so my guess is there's me a lot of pain and suffering so in our portfolio you know because we don't use debt we have good balance sheets and obviously we have a financial firm to back it up you know Ward me fine I mean a lot of the businesses were involved in have been doing better than we expected probably two weeks ago with that said you have no idea where demands gonna go and I mean we're racing and we have plans for you know depend on what level of pain and suffering you know happens well you know what the plan is and you know we're gonna try to get the things back up and running as fast as we possibly can you know the government intervention that just came out is interesting and how its structured so the Care Act just got past 20-30 minutes ago and you know it is it's better than nothing it's going through the SBA and the SBA is to be generous like the DMV of the finance world and so it's not gonna be an easy thing to get all that money deployed also the the SBA lenders that we're talking to that are at these banks and we're not using the SBA but obviously if it's forgivable loans then be insane for us not to participate in that and they don't even know what the rules are right and so they're trying to get triangulated on what things are so I think there's gonna get a lot of confusion I think it's gonna take a lot of time to get the the money into people's hands I'm not sure it's gonna actually stem the tide as much as they think it will on unemployment and so I fear that unemployment could go to 2025 maybe even 30 percent which is you think that's realistic yeah yeah fuckin'-a man that's crazy yeah the perspective but to put that in perspective the great the the Great Depression was what eight eighteen or twenty I think it touched high 20s so so I mean it's a peak and like I said I mean I look I hope I'm wrong right let's just say what it is I mean I hope that that's on but this is not a good environment for us actually I mean this isn't interesting we could talk about as being a you know a firm that has a lot of cash right now I don't think this is a good environment for us at all I would much prefer a 2008 which is much more shallow downturn recession this the violence of this is basically rendering all information available like a non-issue you just can't there's nothing predictive about what's happened in the past and what how it goes in the future and demand curves I mean we don't know no snow knows what the demand curve looks what are you betting for a 20% or 30% unemployment rate well I'm not betting on it that's why I think's gonna happen but I think they do you think that's gonna happen I think I think we'll probably touch 20% I think we could touch 30% yeah and I think we'll see it in the next six weeks will be will be when it really comes down my guess and I call jobs the jobs number the unemployment number that came out I had said previously I thought it was gonna be about 3.5 and it being about 3.3 which was wildly higher than what the sort of consensus was a million and it's look if you're involved in small businesses and you said there was million people that finally found employment like I said that's a good joke of course it was mean way higher than that there's no it couldn't be way higher than that I mean what we're seeing is I mean I had a buddy this week who laid off 4,000 5,000 employees this week had another friend who laid off 585 of 600 I mean and this just that's just me I mean what I know they in the hotel industry or what was it just worried that yeah food services one and construction was the other so it's just it's it's it's a tough I mean why do you say this is this is not a good time versus 2008 what what is the core difference there yeah so the core difference is the violence at which this had has has downturned is basically you could see in 2008 a nice trend right line like you could see it's kind of like a soft you know hidden private businesses right I'm not gonna talk about the stock market stock market in private business which are totally different right but in in the stock market it was you know sure he had a violence to it and then you know kind of petered out and another violence to it I mean this happened it in eight days right right I mean obviously Lehman and all that stuff compression know I'm talking about right now oh yeah right now that's why I'm saying is right now in in private businesses it is worse in private businesses than its reflected in the stock market right now it's hard to know what's priced in and and what do you do with monetary policy when you're basically an unlimited bid I I don't know right but I mean when you look at it from the businesses that we interact with it's carnage everywhere I mean you maybe have I was saying 90% of businesses have been adversely affected 5% are probably you know sort of unaffected and then maybe 5% have some sort of tailwind that's weird because of this but 90% are just it is suffering I mean I is unbelievable what's happening right now and I mean Sean like for week only two weeks it whenever you sent me that link Sean there you go the NBA's canceled yeah like a few hours before that I booked a flight to Germany and because I was go to a conference so they paid for it but I like gave him my information I was like yeah the conference is on and then Sean sent me this link on at seven or maybe five o'clock at night and he goes the NBA is cancelled I was like oh you mean like they're just pausing it for like five days it's like no no no like it's done for the year well whole content and then the next the next day it was like oh my flights cancelled everyone's flights like it was like like that was only two weeks ago Sean yeah that's insane I remember people thought I was crazy I started working from home the week before everybody did cuz I was like hey I think there's like there's once on 100-year virus out there I'm just gonna start working home we did one podcast together and I was like yeah I'm not doing any more in-person stuff I'm not coming into the city I'm not doing any of this and then it just felt like day after day it's like escalation escalation and now I think the the sort of the data is outpacing the fear even at this point I think that I think that the situation is worse that people realize even now because it's growing exponentially and so so I totally hear you Britney - my my sister own schools my brother-in-law owns gyms my brother owned a Christian films my brother owns a concert promotion business nobody prepares for zero revenue overnight for two months you can't plan for that yeah we were talking on our revenue I mean I you know again calculating my head may bring me a 160 this year let's say under normal I think we may be 110 or 120 I mean we have no idea I mean it depends on how things go off the cliff right I mean it's it's literally no one has any idea what's gonna happen what we know is that it's not good if you look across our business I mean our military business is very robust and obviously we want to keep people you know employed in that but if you look in construction there's a longer lead time the the sales cycle is longer right so you'll have a longer tail to it but that's still if you're shut down on its construction site we were working one of our companies was working on the Wynn casino they just shut everything down I mean there's like nothing new and so you have all the materials you bought you have all the labor that's right there you everything you're coordinating it and what do you do I mean it's like I said it was like prohibition except for everything so where's the opportunity here well I mean the opportunity is there's gonna be a lot of these family businesses that are very durable you know business under any sort of normal ish circumstances we don't have easily gotten through 2008 which everyone would consider to be you know a detonation prior to this that are gonna need help and they're gonna need capital to get through this they're going to need capital to restart the businesses if that's what it takes and as well as just taking some chips off the table I mean you know if you're there's a lot of people we've talked to that or they're holding on for sort of last couple good years and then they want to sell and you know we had these conversations two or three months ago with an owner who he's like look I'm in my 70s I certainly can't go through another 2008 but man business is really good right now like I'm just gonna hold on for another couple years I changed you know it's tough and by the way I'm not saying it was the right thing for him to sell then even right I'm just saying is like it's always a bet and you know one of the things that is maybe nice it's not you know if there's any silver lining in this is I think people had gotten certainly not immune but had had gotten a pretty good resistance built up to risk in general and I don't think most people were seeing it I mean I you know most of people were talking to is a there's nothing on the horizon there's no contagion that could cause things to go down I mean I would hear people say is all the time I mean what could it be could it be student loan debt maybe that's gonna be contained could it be you know the bubble and private equity oh that's gonna be contained you know gosh we had no idea what was getting ready to come down right I think that's what Marc Andreessen or maybe as Peter teal was talking about once which is that when everybody keeps asking you think X is a bubble that's not the bubble right now when we're all aware of it we're all talking about it that's usually not the actual bubble it's something that a very few you know a small set of people are sort of saying wait a minute we've removed too many of the Jenga blocks here this thing is about to tip and this wasn't a bubble driven thing I mean I you know as a war it literally is a work like that I mean I think that's the best analogy for I think where I think this is closer to Pearl Harbor than it is to 2008 yeah oh I would I mean I would absolutely agree and the issue is that you know for Pearl Harbor obviously a lot of people went over and fought but it never come on to you know home soil I think this is the thing is everyone's fighting a war in their back door and I don't think that's ever I mean look you don't know you don't know what the death rates are actually gonna turn out to be you don't know what the infection rates gonna be you know I certainly don't want to be comparing it to things that are horrible traumatic events that affect generations and generations maybe and god help us if it turns into that but at the very least I mean the economic side of it is just absolutely unprecedented in every way right now and anybody who thinks this is gonna be a short like V recovery where it's gonna just pop right back out of this thing it has never been in a business and those are most the people that I hear that are investors saying stuff like that they've never operated a business I mean you guys well if this makes you feel any better Brett I I feel horrible right now I called the hospital to get I call I try to get a test and they're like like don't waste it on yourself but it sounds like you have it and and so they think I have it but it's not confirmed it sucks it doesn't suck that bad but for a 30-year old it stinks but it doesn't stick I I describe it it just yesterday cross the threshold the where I would stay home from work and not exercise really so you think you have it yeah well me and the doctors but it's not pretty pretty sure he has it I mean like like breathing sucks but it's more annoying than it is scary and yeah I am so sorry man I had no idea why no it's not look no my point is not to get sympathy my point is to let you know for most people it's not the worst yeah yeah that's that's great I mean look I I hope that's the case I hope we can get back to some semblance of normal life I think that the unfortunately the economic damage even if you wave the magic wand and brought everyone back to these businesses right away I I think there's a lot of damage that's been done depending on how long your lead cycles are and all that stuff but I mean it's just it's tough I mean it's tough as demand dries up and you gotta think about the supply chain all the way back I mean people aren't ordering stuff from factories right because their demands dropping off on the other side it's the fact if the store said no no we want you know all of your inventory now they say we don't need to sell you right right because everyone's preparing for winter and so yeah the stop start problems are just gonna be tremendous wait Sean and Brent you guys are both I mean we are I have no idea where people are but we all are people who probably aren't poor have you guys cut your spending oh yeah for sure I I did the first thing I did was I cut the I cut my exposure to the stock market which I think is gonna drop like a rock now and so that was the first that was the first thing I did because that's more than spending is wealth destruction and so I wanted to avoid wealth destruction first but it's like good your monthly subscriptions I didn't I didn't go through that yet but we have sort of like me and my wife now before we do something we're like yeah do we really need to and so we're you know it's starting to creep in but we haven't gone and audited and said hey necessary unnecessary necessary unnecessary but yeah you know probably should and probably will even though like I have plenty of money to last from a long very long time I'm like I don't I'm gonna buy the generic brand of this food we're still spinning on food but we I mean if you look at our bills in the past it's been a lot of round travel and yeah we're not doing that I mean we did we did spring by the way the best investment I've ever made I've got three girls under six and we just bought a bounce house and have in the backyard and by the way that's the best it's the best $300 I've ever spent my life there's a business you should buy that sounds not sexy but interesting enough exactly bounce houses for yeah okay my last question for Brent is this your your 25 30 35 and currently like let's just imagine you are I've no idea how old you but let's say you're young enough to like sorry okay well let's say you're you're starting your career you're in the middle early part of your career now knowing what you know about what makes valuable companies and what builds wealth what are some businesses that you'd want to start right now and what would you optimize for and what metrics would you try to optimize for and how yeah I mean I think it depends on what you're what you're trying to optimize for if you're just trying to I'm asking you well I'm asking you for me personally I mean I I really find value in balancing home life and work right so family is super important to me so my answers probably a little bit different for me and I want to live not a big city and so that's great I want to hear what you would do yeah yeah so if I was starting over today I would probably start something in the construction space or home services space office services I want to get in something that's it's I like competing in areas where there's not a natural selection of people into that right so you don't wanna be in the winery business because everyone in Silicon Valley who exits a business goes and buys a winery right and pumps a bunch of money into it like I don't I don't want to be in the the film business because everybody who you know every son of a billionaire you know makes movies you know owning restaurants is really difficult I mean separate from all the stuff we're going through now because everyone you know that makes me money thinks is be easy and once they own their own restaurant so I like two things that sort of have a natural selection biased against them like nobody drives by somebody building a swimming pool in Arizona in the summer and says you know what I really want to quit my job in the air conditioning and go dig a hole in the ground right so we want to get involved in things like that I would try to take something probably that that is small and partner with them that they already have the infrastructure in place the sort of the the technical side and the systems there and then I would really try to spend some time you know how can we use you latest technology to make us more efficient try to build something that's scalable sort of beyond a geography and get a model down a billing model a sales model down that we thought was replicatable and that really had some sort of moat around it and then I would try to scale it over time and I yeah anything specifically I think it would depend on largely on what I could find in the geography I mean here in Columbia I mean there's there's a fantastic HVAC service company that's still fairly small but they've got great systems they actually develop their own software be something like that that I'd want to partner with and say okay look look you know I wanna get my hands dirty and get involved in I mean I'm uh I'm not an investor by heart like my I mean I'm an entrepreneur that's what I love to do and that's how we think about our business is being operators and entrepreneurs and so I I wouldn't necessarily get involved in finance I mean finance to me is a mechanism that allows and enables entrepreneurship and and you know running real companies it's not trading paper back and forth so I would probably get far more involved in in sort of non tech entrepreneurship which I know you guys are in Silicon Valley and this can fall on deaf ears no III like I like what you're saying but you so you said HVAC you said each bag was yeah pools lawn service I think I service yeah like lot like lawn and garden care type stuff I mean have you ever tried to get somebody call you back it's yeah you want to hear something cool we had a so Brian you know who Brian's Scudamore is just got a more 1-800 GOT JUNK oh yeah yeah okay so the guy own is the guy who owns a his name's Brian he's Canadian he's friends with me and Sean I shoot the with him every once in a while it's like a what is that Sean like a 500 million dollar a year company he owns all of it and he we either me or show someone of us asked him where opportunity is it he goes man if I do the same thing I would do money hunter got junk but I would do it from lawn care or for irrigation yeah yeah that's type stuff I'm talking about yeah I mean there's there's all these like strange I mean niches that you can get into what I would do is probably take my time and go and talk to a lot of people who are already in business and say what is your biggest problem like who's the supplier that you're most annoyed with you know what's the customer that you have that's just kill that type of thing and I'd probably go try to snake my way into one of those one of those businesses and then just it's really just about getting a foothold right and that's what you need is you need a foothold and then you can start building on it from there but yeah I mean that the problem is if you've got a if you've got a boat that you're trying to row that's rickety and and it may look pretty on the outside but it's just not gonna go anywhere it doesn't matter how hard you row it and I think that's a you know early my career when I was involved in you know more the agency business that's how I felt felt like I mean I could just row that thing as hard as I could I maybe get an inch further and that's why I just want to get out of businesses there like that right all right well we should wrap it up right thanks for coming man if you're listening to this you want to get a hold of you what's the best way for people to follow you you know yeah keep tabs become a scout whatever you want yeah yeah so permanent equity calm is that is the website and i'm on twitter apperent be sure on LinkedIn I mean just hit me wherever trying to be very available and if I can be helpful let us know yeah it's been wonderful to have you guys on man and I hope you get hope you feel better that doesn't sound like any fun I mean I know you're terrifying me so well no look I my point was the opposite was to not terrified look do I seem secure I mean I I am well I'm sleeping in so I got it in get up bed I didn't wake up until about 9:30 or 10:00 a.m. this morning because I I was like I'm just gonna sleep as much as possible I'm drinking a lot of water I I would not exercise today that's how bad I feel I would not go to work today but I definitely would not even consider going to a hospital I normally I wouldn't even gone to a doctor oh all right well though this is how I'm trying to paint this as in a positive way as as best as I can well Shawn don't don't you get sick all right you can't get it through zoom so we're good all right guys hey take it easy really appreciate it take care [Music]

when you buy a company what is the first three months six months are you hands-on with that is it do you have an operating partner who does that how do you guys make sure that you and you buy an asset you don't a destabilize it and be you actually start to grow it which is I assume why you bought it in the first place yeah so so our philosophy there's a lot of private equity firms out there that have these like you know 30-day 90 day 120 day plans right we don't do that what we try to do is is take a humble attitude towards it and say look we we we know some things we have some talents but what we want to learn and and and come alongside them they're the experts they've been doing it for a long time so there's a team of 16 of us so so it's not certainly I don't get the impression this is just me there's people far talented more talented than I am on staff and there we have a dual hook in structured post close so our financial team hooks into their financial team and creates feedback loops and then we have a we calls portfolio partner they're kind of a Board of Directors in a box that is overseeing kind of the executive leadership helping make very high-level decisions I mean these are autonomous operating units I mean so there's these are these are not we're not injecting these people into the companies to run them but they're in touch with the leadership teams all the time doing you know a variety different types of calls and meetings throughout the year how many companies are there there's nine that you guys own that got it so that seems manageable yeah I mean it's so for every kind of three to five companies we we acquire we got a higher one high-level financial person in one portfolio partner and that's kind of their their grouping of companies that they're kind of running so we're almost creating like a fractal if you want to think about it that way down into the organization so that it scales as certain linearly in that way [Music]

what types of companies are you trying to buy so you're trying to buy is it a certain price point is it a certain business model is it a certain type of owner what are you trying to buy yeah so we first want to buy something that we thinks gonna be durable and around for a really long time so you know if you look at our clone portfolio we are in the swimming pool business like digging holes in the ground shootin concrete we're also manufacturing in that space as well another company that's unrelated in the backyard product space it's a bunch of confused and sell through mass retail we are with military recruitment firm that was the first firm that I acquired me t cross we've got a military recruitment firm so it's not like Legion for military yeah so we actually work I mean we have number of different clients but one of our main clients is a civilian branch of the Navy that resupplies the ships that never came into port so it's called Military Sealift Command and we're responsible for finding and onboarding all of their staff on a yearly basis so it's like a staffing firm for a ship yeah well for a whole branch of military so it's there's their staffing and there's a lot fourteen fifteen seventeen hundred civilian Mariners a year into that division so it's a it's a pretty large operation digital digital yeah yeah we have you know online application products but not mostly I think there's a lot of physical activities as well we have a it's not sexy where the rubber meets the road real-deal business so we were talking about some of the differences you guys owned so me across which is a military recruitment firm swimming pool business back here at the base so you have a couple of there so you were saying you're looking for durable businesses that's likely attribute one what are the other sort of key attributes you're looking at yeah I mean so we want to find a leadership team that we can partner with there's so many you know it's so hard to grow a business right and so a lot of the businesses were looking at we either called has been right before the line of professionalization or maybe has just crossed and there's this this real interesting you know sort of in-between gap where a lot of these firms they're they're too big to be small and too small to be big and the leadership teams kind of capped out they're just brute forcing as much as they possibly can but they don't have the the system's the talent on staff to be able to grow larger and so a lot of the times we're trying to figure out from them you know do they want to get bigger there's some there's some firms we talked to and and they say well even though so yeah I want to get bigger but the you know the CEO is answering 60 calls a day on a cell phone and I mean there's just no way right and so we're looking for a leadership team that I think has the base skills is really really excellent at what they do and we're looking for the company to have a position in the marketplace that is protected somehow right so I mean we're not looking to get into just commodity type businesses we want them to have something unusual about them that we can really build on and help them grow and then you know this doesn't sound like a like a maybe a no-brainer obvious one but we gotta get to a price in terms that that that are acceptable to both parties right and there's roughly 400 decisions that have to be made sort of dream that acquisition process I mean that's 400 opportunities to not agree and and it's very difficult and time-consuming and so a lot of us just trying to make sure that we think that a deal could be done as well [Music]

some predictions about the virus and the the way the sort of what's happening to businesses right now you know on one hand you said your timing was was good in the sense that you've raised your big fund before all this and now a bunch of businesses are gonna need liquidity they're gonna need you know somebody who's a stable capital partner to come in and buy them what do you guys think what's your prediction on how this gonna play out well for you and for the economy I would say yeah well so so for let me believe broader I think what what we're predicting and of course no one has any idea right we're I'm trying to be best we can triangulate information we think it's gonna be pretty long if you want to think about it a good analogy I heard was a blizzard a winter or an ice age right it's kind of about the three stages probably you know I think the blizzards gonna last for another at least six to eight weeks probably longer than that and then I think we're going through a period of it's be hard to restart a lot of these businesses so there's in in theory it sounds oh there's economic problems it's no big deal you just kind of go into hibernation and come back out of it and everything's fine right in practice there's a lot of start/stop problems I mean you guys have run businesses you know if you had to mothball everything and try to restart it I mean you're not be able to do it at least be very difficult to do it and so my guess is there's me a lot of pain and suffering so in our portfolio you know because we don't use debt and we have good balance sheets and obviously we have a financial firm to back it up you know Ward me fine I mean a lot of the businesses were involved in have been doing better than we expected probably two weeks ago with that said you have no idea where demands gonna go and I mean we're racing and we have plans for you know depending on what level of pain and suffering you know happens well you know what the plan is and you know we're gonna try to get the things back up and running as fast as we possibly can you know the government intervention that just came out is interesting and how its structured so the Care Act just got passed around 20-30 minutes ago and you know it is it's better than nothing it's going through the SBA and the SBA is to be generous like the DMV of the finance world and so it's not going to be an easy thing to get all that money deployed also the the SBA lenders that we're talking to that are at these banks and we're not using the SBA but obviously if it's forgivable loans then be insane for us not to participate in that and they don't even know what the rules are right and so they're trying to get triangulated on what things are so I think there's can get a lot of confusion I think it's gonna take a lot of time to get the the money into people's hands I'm not sure it's gonna actually stem the tide as much as they think it will on unemployment and so I fear that unemployment could go to 2025 maybe even 30 percent which is do you think that's realistic yeah yeah fuckin'-a man that's crazy yeah the put perspective but to put that in perspective the great the the Great Depression was what eight eighteen or twenty I think it touched high 20s so so I mean it's a peak and like I said I mean I look I hope I'm wrong right let's just say what it is I mean I hope that that's on but this is not a good environment for us actually I mean this isn't interesting we could talk about as being a you know a firm that has a lot of cash right now I don't think this is a good environment for us at all I would much prefer a 2008 which is much more shallow downturn recession this the violence of this is basically rendering all information available like a non-issue you just can't there's nothing predictive about what's happened in the past and what how it goes in the future and demand curves I mean we don't know no snow knows what the demand curve looks what are you betting for a 20% or 30% unemployment rate well I'm not betting on it that's why I think's gonna happen but I think they do you think that's gonna happen I think I think we'll probably touch 20% I think we could touch 30% yeah and I think we'll see it in the next six weeks will be will be when it really comes down my guess and I call jobs the the jobs number the unemployment number that came out I had said previously I thought it was gonna be about three point five and it being about three point three which was wildly higher than what the sort of consensus was a million and it look if you're involved in small businesses and you said there was million people that finally found employment so that's a good joke of course it was me way higher than that there's no it couldn't be way higher than that I mean what we're seeing is I mean I had a buddy this week who laid off four thousand five thousand employees this week had another friend who laid off five hundred and eighty five of six hundred I mean and this is that's just me I mean what I know they in the hotel industry or was it just that yeah food services one and construction was the other so it's just it's it's it's a tough I mean they're why do you say this is this is not a good time versus 2008 what what is the core difference there yeah so the the core difference is the violence at which this had has has down termed is is basically you could see in 2008 a nice trend right line like you can see it's kind of like a soft hitting private businesses right I'm not gonna talk about stock market stock market and private businesses you're totally different right but in in the stock market it was sure I had a violence to it and then you know kind of petered out and another violence to it this happened it in eight days right right I mean loves you Lehman and all that stuff compression oh I'm talking about right now oh we have right now that's what I'm saying is right now in in private businesses it is worse in private businesses than its reflected in the stock market right now right it's hard to know what's priced in and and what do you do with monetary policy when you're basically an unlimited bid i I don't know right but I mean when you look at it from the businesses that we interact with it's carnage everywhere I mean you maybe have I was saying 90% of businesses have been adversely affected five percent are probably you know sort of unaffected and then maybe five percent have some sort of tailwind that's weird because of this but ninety percent are just it is suffering I mean I is unbelievable what's happening [Music] you

[Music] everyone welcome to another edition of behind the hustle I'm back with Zack Crockett our Sunday editor Zack good to see you hey man good to be back for another episode of slurs in their closets during honking is that where you are you're literally stuck in your closet it's the only quiet place I'm fine so let's go making doing these times I had this image of you I always thought you lived out in the woods like so you go for these runs on these trails or on your house and I just had this picture of you secluded off somewhere quiet but it's not that I guess huh yeah it's uh every place has its ups and downs right now sir all right well at least you found somewhere quiet I doubt my place is gonna be quiet so forgive any interruptions that happen here this week you're doing a piece that's near and dear to my heart I love to bake bread I've done it for many years my kids eat like a loaf of bread a day my wife thankfully has taken up the habit of making a loaf of bread every day for us she won't make more than one because it's like about what one is just enough but it it's almost impossible to find flour now people are crazy and mad and excited to do this and it's almost like we've returned to this agrarian culture what what's your story gonna be about what are you sort of how are you approaching this yeah this week we're doing a story on the meteoric rise of at home bread baking so as you said it's pretty much impossible to find flour yeast bread starter even bread machines bread pans the entire bread economy has been shaken to its core by this influx of quarantined people looking for a new hobby so we're diving into this some of the numbers behind that using tools like Jungle Scout look at increases in Amazon searches and sales volume of things like yeast you know just utilizing basic tools like Google Trends we talked to red star yeast and King Arthur Flour which are some of the oldest brands in the country which are both facing immense shortages right now and supply chain issues and we also ran a survey and heard from almost a thousand hustle readers war stories in the kitchen a lot of gummy sourdough lows and also a lot of bread experts who have a lot of experience baking very cool so one of the things we found was about the sort of reimagine some some of these bread making machines that had not been selling very well and what what did you what was interesting about that so the the bread making machine was this thing that was rolled out in 1983 1984 it was marketed to be the next toaster and for a while it did really well about three or four or five million American households bought this bread making machine and then it kind of just died out it disappeared and it's hasn't really sold well in the last few decades right now during coronavirus Cuisinart bread makers are just exploding in sales if you if you go on Amazon it's like one of the top selling products in the bread category and so you know one thing we've been looking into is how this pandemic has affected industries you might not normally think about I think at this point it's pretty obvious to everyone that there's this huge explosion in bread interests the things you don't really think about are like these you know the resurgence of these old weird machines like bread machines it's it's been kind of interesting to watch that happen so you also talked to this little bakery called mr. Holmes bake house and interestingly I've when I was out in San Francisco I'm based in the DC area I flew out to San Francisco probably 15 times last year and worked out of the office there where our headquarters is and every time I leave San Francisco I walk across the financial district down to the Ferry Building and I buy like a bunch of loaves of sourdough for my kids because they're crazy about it I didn't even know about mr. Holmes but mr. Holmes has had an interesting pivot in this time with obviously not being able to have a storefront yeah has gotten really creative and bakeries all over the place are closed and his solution gives he had no ecommerce experience really is an entrepreneur at heart a true hustler kind of guy he decided to start selling bread starter kits online so he leveraged his expertise and in baking took his team which is full of skilled bakers and all kinds of culinary artisans and basically used his warehouse transformers warehouse into kind of an ad hoc ecommerce operation where he's shipping out hundreds of these breasts armor kits you can buy them for like 25 bucks they come with everything you need and the average you know bread novice like me can cook a loaf in a few tit bake a loaf in a few days so it's really kind of a genius idea and we're starting to see this adopted by a number of other small bakeries around the country number of people in our survey said they were doing similar things bakeries are selling loaves through Instagram and they're finding all kinds of creative ways to keep themselves afloat during this during these shoppings here so do they sell a sourdough starter or is it just a starter kit all right so the one I bought is just like a white bread starter there is a way to convert it into a sourdough starter kit I think but he's also rolling out he isn't a cookie baking kit that he's selling now he's kind of expanding into some is but it's it's like an immensely popular bakery their stuff is incredible if you've ever been in San Francisco and hopefully in the future if you have a chance to try them out they're really great so they already had this like cult following both at the retail location and on Instagram online so they were able to tap into that bit very cool so you as a novice Baker you said the word novice have you actually tried to bake some bread this week yourself I'm a terrible baker but uh we we bought a kit for mr. Holmes last week and it's on day two of feeding right now so you have to feed it for a few days he feed it flour and water or let it incubate right now he's sitting in the refrigerator and gonna try baking him tonight his name is pure pot my name did appear fine so we'll see how it turns out well that's good I I'm looking forward to reading your story Zach and I think it'll be a lot of fun to see sort of a your take on the economics of the bread baking phenomenon that we're going through right now so thanks for joining us again this week Zach [Music]

where are you at this point in your life between money legacy the process if I said if I said 30 year old you right now between generally in your stomach in your heart in your gut about how much you're driven by and how much you like the net win is around dollars is around being able to do your process and around legacy how are you currently broken down between a hundred percent as well I don't have children yet so maybe things will change but I have enough that I don't have to worry for maybe a forever I find my I thought I was really money motivated but when you get all these like opportunities when you get to a little bit of a level like we'll pay you ten grand to come here do this or whatever and I just denied and I found myself not wanting to do that because I don't like that sounds so boring to me I don't want to do that so I guess it's a question of where I am a little bit I would I mean like one time we had um a client do something that we thought was an [ __ ] thing and we fired them and we lost a quarter of a million dollars and I slept like a baby so I don't think I'm as money moded money motivated as I thought do you think that because you checked some sort of box for yourself along the way versus no I really I think I had [ __ ] you money when I tinker in yeah I get that I understand yeah I do know that like and then what I was like wait a minute I still don't think I've ever been more rich than when I was doing baseball card shows at 13 because 3000 $4000 when you're 13 and you came from nothing set I thought I had like a trillion I remember one day I sold hotdogs and I had a grip of cash it was like a great grip yeah it was just a grip we call it I call it a grip let me get that grip it was it was because I have to go John are here tonight and I had like a grand in five dollar bills and I was like this is for me money this is it I was I was like like we called it hood rich and where did you grow up again in st. Louis Missouri but then I lived in Nashville Tennessee but I grew up with a lot of like poor people and you know that's why I talk like this but I felt like it did you think about I was happy so in Nashville I lived across the street from the projects and we would hang out all the time I was how old were you then 19 to 21 a 21 and I would just hang out there with my buddy right out and we would just chill and just sit on it was the most it was I was my happiest when I had nothing which is weird right no I think I think it's not weird at all but uh what you guys talk about just shoot like guy talk girls sports just random [ __ ] or would you talk about dreams business yeah I mean he this dude had served 25 years in prison and he would talk about that but just stupid stuff but it was just it's really fun I think that when you come from not a lot which you know I had a good family and everything but when you start from when you trying to start on your own from scratch you have siblings yeah yeah I've said when older brother and older sister you were two youngest mm-hmm yeah I think when you start from not a lot okay it's actually a huge advantage and you could be a lot happier that way I think I think if you're born to a wealthy family the likelihood of like depression might actually be higher I think so you know what I mean based on our societal norms right now so much of my passion about like what I talk about and the content I put out is to create empathy for it's very hard I you know I get it I grew up in it it's very hard for somebody that doesn't have much to have empathy for somebody who's driving a BMW and has a Rolex but you know based on all my readings all my DM so I get at this point of my life I have some hundreds of thousands of interactions per month year whatever it is it's just a lot of interactions I see far more sadness and people that had too much then people had too little I see Envy in people that don't have as much I see drive and people that don't have as much I see resentment and people that don't have as much I see deep lostness and people that had too much you know like there's just when people didn't have as much they there is an inherent I'm gonna pull myself out of this whether it's illegal legal there's a drive it's really hard to be hungry when you started fed it just is no and I agree and I have I have wealthy kids and I think about it constantly [Music]
