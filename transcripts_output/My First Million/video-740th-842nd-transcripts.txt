all right so we have Austin here Austin Reef founder of uh morning Brew uh I I I I know how big you guys are I don't know what the public numbers are so I'll let you kind of say like how how big is the company now yeah 70 75 million of Revenue this year uh double digit profit uh margin 250 people or [Music] so and it's kind of a kind of a crazy story you guys started this you guys were at college right you're you're at uh is it Michigan where where you guys went to school yeah so so we're at the University of Michigan uh I applied to Duke didn't get in though unfortunately and so I went to Michigan yeah I went to a small private schol so no Michigan worked out well was a little cold a little bit colder than Duke but I I mean my goal was to go to the biggest school I could get into uh other than you know an ivy or Duke so I got to Michigan had no idea what I wanted to do uh and everyone went to Finance at Michigan so I was like oh I got to I got to follow the herd I was a sheep following the herd straight into the world of corporate finance or Investment Banking uh and then stumbled upon this guy Alex liberman who was like I wouldn't even call it a newsletter it was a PDF attached to an email like he actually took a he made a Word document he would PDF it and put it to an email and that was the first newsletter so he was he was already doing it was it called morning Brew no it was called market corner it was way more markets based way more Finance oriented was he in college as well or was he had he graduated yeah so he was two years older than I was and that's a big part of our success to be honest uh if I was his age we probably would have went out and raised Venture Capital so you know 20 2015 you have BuzzFeed raising money Vice raising money and the only reason we didn't follow that path was because I was in college and no one was going to fund a sophomore in college and so Alex went to work at Morgan Stanley for 14 months I spent the summer Investment Banking and was like holy [ __ ] this is miserable get me out of here and so I was like all right well I got this morning Brew thing I might as well do it for a couple years and what's the worst thing that happens I come back here and that was the that was a start of going fulltime what did your nice Jewish parents think about you not becoming a banker instead working on a a newsletter so my parents were actually okay with it except I told them after my junior year I said I have one more year of college what if I I just don't go back what if I don't finish and the idea of them spending $150,000 on three years of college and not finishing my senior year drove them nuts so the deal we made is if I if I graduated they were cool with me doing morning Brew for a year or two after and then fast forward you guys so it was funny uh right when we were s in the process of selling you announced that you had sold like months or two months uh in it before us and so you guys sold a portion of the business I think the majority of the business for at something like a $70 million valuation in that ballpark right yeah right around there I think we were actually we were doing m&a at the same time we were even talking to some similar Partners I I think we were and the reason why like Sean and I wanted to have you on because we want to talk about newsletters which every all three of us have a newsletter business but you and I have an interesting background we like on paper we kind of hated each other like the whole time not kind of I hated you dude I hated you so I didn't entirely hate you I just it was it was like I uh it was like Just Sports opposing sports teams where I was like I have a lot of respect for this person I don't know anything about their character but I'm going to make up the story in my head to like motivate me and the reason why I wanted to do that was because we so I launched we technically launched the hustle on April April 2016 were you before us or after us we were 2015 when we launched the first newsletter but it wasn't it was a very small thing then so we were going like back and forth it was like the skim was like the thing and then it was you and I morning brew and the hustle and you guys were this like New York kind of buttoned up crew I was like a little bit of a crazier person it was Tech San Francisco but it was like everyone kept comparing us and I remember like wanting to like Crush you guys and then after we both sold Alex called me and uh you and I became buddies and I was like oh no I actually love these guys and now at this point you and I are great friends and I have a ton of respect but uh yeah like I wanted to crush you I didn't I didn't really hate you what what did you feel yeah I look I I I think it's always good for a business to have an enemy and I think in the early days our enemy was the skim very quickly though we were like you know what they're not our enemy we realized I think we both realize pretty quickly that you can't raise $25 million for a newsletter and and have a good exit and so I think it was you and us and so I turned you into that enemy and I was so immature at the time right I it was my first thing out of college I knew nothing so I was like here's this guy he's so abrasive he's so aggressive like what the [ __ ] and like I was so I I wasn't principled I didn't have real values at at the time and so I just saw you who are super valued right you you have strong principles very strong principles which some people love tons of people I'm sure don't like uh and I was like this guy is just so abrasive and I've learned to love that about you but at the time it just it rubbed me the wrong way and I was like we're going to make this guy your enemy and we're going to crush this guy dude I used to get mad because everything that I was bad at you were good at and everything that I was good at I thought you guys were bad at and I'm like [ __ ] they're just stealing all my ideas from my ads that I'm running stealing all my content ideas and then I would see how you guys operate and I'd be like no we got to have all these sales people just like them like I remember I I was at your office and uh I and you were talking about morning brew and you were like I thought you would just hate them and be like they suck because uh I feel like that's how we used to just talk about most people in most starts was just like oh my God they suck and especially one that's doing what you're doing then it's like oh I already want you to suck so I'm going to say that and instead you were like God why is this this email look better than ours and you would just like show it to the whole team and you're like look at this why does this look so much better than our email look at what they do at the top like God there're so like you're like they're so much better at that you know like the the formatting or the cleanliness or like the the brand that they are doing at the I remember at the top of the email and I was like wow he just respects the the actual like craft so much that he can't even hate him fully he's like ah they're doing good at these three things Sam I'll give you a story I've ever told you which is you know there was a time where I thought our copy was much better than yours our editorial and then there was a time where I thought you guys passed us right and Alex in particular was maniacal about this he would print out morning Brew in the hustle every single morning we just go line by line we'd sit down line by line and we'd be like that Line's better no our Line's better no that and we go line by line and some some of the early morning Brew employees they really hated you cuz when you wrote a story that we wrote and when yours was better and Alex thought yours was better people I mean people were pissed there was like a Revolt in the morning room office one morning cuz people were like no ours is better and I think ultimately it wasn't better or worse right it was just hater towards different people but I mean we we we printed out your newsletter every day and read through it through it for I don't know 6 months nine months like we were just so focused like I've never been as hyperfocused as I was in 2018 on us writing the best newsletter growing the best newsletter and selling it like I woke up every day write grow sell right gret like we wrote it in the wall and at 11:00 a.m. every single day we had the Great Wall of opens and we track our open rate and write it down the wall and we had that for probably two years running every day what was our open rate and your strategy was to our our strategies were they diverged and they were different so we were going to launch we are going to stay in this space and verticalized and launch subscriptions services and all this other stuff you guys launched multiple different newsletters which meant from my eyes you grew your Revenue quicker I personally hate that business because I don't like advertising that much but you grew your Revenue way faster than us um well I think you did like we if we were one year behind you I think we were tracking one year be so the year we sold I think we could have done 18 or 20 million in Revenue which is around you were I think the same year so we are like tracking perfectly which is really interesting but you went this horizontal route where you launched multiple multiple newsletters which route do you like looking back look I mean it's tough to say we took the round the wrong route uh but I also think it's what we had to do right we didn't have the choice you had because our content was more General business right you wrote with an edge with a tone you were targeting uh entrepreneurs or maybe like account Executives who want to become entrepreneurs and so you had way more opportunity to launch a Trends or to launch a hustle conon uh for us we thought you know a general morning Brew subscription wasn't going to work a general morning Brew event wasn't going to work the the tone wasn't specific enough the the Target customer wasn't specific enough but we fell in love with this B2B business which I know both of you got in a little bit of Twitter [ __ ] when you when you spoke about the B2B world and you know industry dive but we I fell in love with that business I'm like wow if you can get in front of retail professionals and HR professionals and we have them in our newsletter and it was the craziest business where we'd launch a newsletter and it be break even before we even hired the writers because we pre-sell uh you know an Advertiser let's call it like a B2B SAS company into one of these newsletters and so I don't think there's better worse I think your our opportunity was easier to get to 100 million of Revenue yours was easier to get to let's call like a a billion dollar uh company right because you could have subscription multi- Revenue stream much easier it just was going to take another you know 8 to 10 years that's great I'm happy I'm learning that now after I sold it I'm happy I got to see it because I just got to copy both of your playbooks and do that do it for the milk Road like all three of us were able to win with the same Playbook mine was the easiest path of all cuz I could just text you guys and be like hey U think about doing uh your thing but for crypto uh what do you think and it was like yeah I think it's going to work let's do it and did did the Playbook work perfectly Sean you think I mean it has so far right we basically in less than a year we built the number one like the biggest daily crypto email it's profitable it's you know seven Figures it's I don't know like it worked as well as one could expect bootstrapped it you know in our spare time like that's like as good as I could have expected that to go dude that's why these businesses are awesome is people don't realize that's why I always hate when people say if you're going to start it over again what would you do I'm like do the same thing like it works it consistently works I know uh Austin you're way more like pessimistic you got you're like I'm pretty paranoid you're way more paranoid and I know you say like oh it can't work again and I'm like no man I think it I think it can you have like a framework around you have like a lot of opinions around email newsletters give us that and put put in the context of milk Road like when I told you I was going to do that or you saw I was going to do that that what' you think and did that fit your framework for what you thought might work or was that maybe an outlier what what was it yeah so it perfectly fits the framework so I'm pessimistic on relaunching the next morning brew a general business 4 million person email uh but basically I split up newsletters into three categories one are the editorial newsletters right you have you your sub stackers your your packing mccormix full newsletter maybe 2,000 words maybe 10,000 if you're some of these writers uh that's like category one right category is what we did aggregation right and Sam and I kind of went more General General business went for scale and then uh after that you kind of have like the let's call it morning brofer X right where you you still have that aggregation of summaries but you're more nich right and maybe the Tam is smaller but you think because of your tone and because of the way you cover it you can have a larger percent of that Tam reading your product which Sean I think is what you're doing and the third is more of like your classic hey I'm going to give you five LAN your five bullet Friday or things like that I think the biggest opportunity is Sean what you did which is morning breu for X you find a growing industry you just ride that tail wve and you just own that and build a brand something really distinct in one of these you know niches and if if x is finance or X's something that's B more B2B or like you know a professional C uh you know something that's a job title uh then X works better than if x is you know fly fishing or or or you know basketball or something like that yeah so I think if you're going to go consumer route right target consumers it's got to be high dollar it's got to be you know the newsletter for Ferrari owners or the the newsletter for Rolex owners right something where people spend you know hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on this B2B is great as well that's the other place I would go and so you were kind of like I call it maybe prery right it was the best of both worlds you could hit on both worlds you got the consumer oriented uh readers and then also the people who work in the crypto industry did you agree with our I know that I and we actually did or I'll say it myself I did sound like a douchebag when I was talking about Industry Drive I didn't mean to like phrase it that the way that I did but when we were talking about Industry Drive you know they're a $600 million uh company that mostly is a newsletter business and our criticism towards the B2B industry was like the content's pretty whack do you agree with that uh that assessment like do you still think there's a lot of opportunity to build really big B2B media companies yeah I just think you have to do it the way sea did it right which is go the complete opposite route right so they're they're pretty dry they have a standardized process they go in every single vertical look I think their business model is simple but it's not easy I don't think what they did was easy at all but I think it's very simple The Playbook is very well defined there's no crazy Tech they're not you know building some AI machine learning thing it's they create great content they resonate they sell ads into it uh but the way to compete I think is to treat B2B like consumer right to treat them like people like you know the milro does why is it not you're saying it's simple but not easy why is it not what do you mean it's not easy I mean I I think to scale across all those verticals right to your point added businesses are pretty tough right and so you take on a lot of costs and you can't you can't mess up right because if you you go wrong in verticals you have a bunch of writers and salespeople and and the thing about media businesses even when they're profitable the difference between 20% uh profit margins and losing 20% is way is is way like it's easier to to flip that uh because of all your fixed cost cost it's not SAS you don't have locked in you know you're a B2B SAS company you have locked in 100 or 110% of your Revenue the next year because of renewals every day with ads it's another grind you got to go sell more ads and so it's not easy you know the ad business is an absolute grind we found this guy um I'm gonna give him a shout out here his name's I don't know I think his name you pronounce it wter and he's from the Netherlands and he uh I think he's at school right now I don't know what happened but I I did a video I thought okay maybe maybe we'll start doing YouTube content I did this video when Luna collapsed and I did this video like oh I lost a bunch of money on Luna and I did this video I thought it was going to be like funny I was like H mic viral whatever we came out late we came out like 3 weeks after the news so that was kind of stupid so it didn't didn't go super viral but one good thing came of it which was this this kid on Twitter was like hey your thumbnail sucks for for your YouTube thing like it should be like this or like this or like this he did this thread and I was like yo you're great um I don't know if I'm going to do any more YouTube videos but like you want to just come in our slack cuz I just I like what you just did that was like helpful and it was quick and like you know he's like sure yeah that'd be amazing I love the milk gr and so he joins our slack first we're like What are we do with this guy like who the [ __ ] is this guy like imagine like a twers meeting and I just invite this third guy from the Netherlands to a meeting you'd be like uh like is this guy going to talk what's why is he here and for 2 months no one knew why he was there but then something amazing happened we were like ah we need to sell ads like for the next month or whatever and it was like nobody wanted to do it it was just like uh do we have to like it's just going to be a pain in the ass it sucks it just sucks to sell ads like oh we should hire a sales guy it's like ah even hiring a sales gu is kind of a shitty task okay let's procrastinate a little bit and uh along the way this guy had been wanting all this guy had been always just messaging us ideas like CU he's like I don't know he's like in the slack so he's like trying to be productive so he would just non-stop message ideas of things we could do and uh it got to the point where Ben was just sort of like dude this guy is like you know incessant like he won't stop messaging and it's like you know it's at first it's a good but like nobody can handle this volume of ideas like this is crazy and then he's like I he's like you got to do something about this and I was like okay I I'll I don't know I'll talk to him or I'll kick him out of the slack and I was like Hey what if we just point the machine gun like outwards instead of like right now the machine gun's shooting us with ideas what if we just made him like sell the ads and he just bothered the hell out of everybody else and so that's what we did and this guy is the single-handedly crushing milk Road at sales through the crypto bear market like we are fully sold out for months on end just one guy with this one kid who's not even 20 years old just absolutely pillaging the market and the advertisers will privately DM me and be like yo I shared this guy's name with our sales team cuz I was like this is how you sell like this guy is Relentless and I was like wow that was a that was just like an incredible I don't know like incredible thing he is so impressive dude let's talk about that real quick ad sales ad sales suck Austin they suck and what I learned getting into the hustle I did you sell I sold our first ads I think I got us I sold like the first maybe $100,000 worth of ads and then in order to scale we had to hire a sales team and they would show me like the conversations that they are going to have I'm like there's this conversation will never work like you're using all this jargon and you're wearing like these like buttoned up plaid shirts and like these brown leather shoes like you guys look like dweebs like this is never going to work and it worked perfectly nobody wants to go skateboarding with you right now yeah you are not ready if they want to skateboard dude I was like dude you look like a you look like your name's Todd or Kyle like this is not going to work and uh he like my name is it [ __ ] works yeah yeah it it works you're not cut out your personal is not cut out for the the the media buying world did you do it you're uh well no so yeah in the early days we bought right but we we we sold all direct response ads right it was Casper mattress it was a away luggage it was you know hey buy buy your placement here you're going to get 300 clicks and 3% of them convert and you're going to make $1,000 and we'll charge you $800 as we've grown though I think there's another difference between us we were in New York City and it opened up this whole world that I had no idea about which was the world of of media buying and these big ad agencies and they have huge budgets right we're not talking about a 100 Grand from Casper we're talking about $5 million from the biggest brands in the entire world and it really is a black box that people who aren't in it and I think it's one of those things where it's a black box intentionally so people can't get in right Finance is the same thing every year there's a new term within the ad industry or Finance just to keep people on on the out it's crazy it's crazy and it's like not based in logic or fact it's based on relationships and like it's so weird it's like oh wait I have to realize that this person this lady I'm trying to get to buy ads she just has to spend this $20 million this quarter and she just wants to find somewhere to place it where she won't get fired that was such a weird feeling yeah I mean that the idea of like media budgets right hey they if they if they don't use it they lose it and so you're incentivized to spend money it's it's it's interesting and it's uh something that we learned Again by hiring people in New York which I think was a big difference between us and you you had a a lower cost more like inside sales team a really efficient one right you took that route we didn't take that route we went for these Big Brand dollars and and I think both routes work it depends what you're what you're looking to sell um we just took the route of say hey we're going to we're going to Dive Right In this black box and we're going to learn all about it we're going to get a million dollar I mean one of our first advertisers discover gave us a million bucks I was in college I'm a senior in college living in my frat house right like beer cans everywhere I get an email from the CMO of discover like here's an RFP I'm like what in the [ __ ] is an RFP like what are you talking about no clue I open it up and it's like hey give us media plans for like half a million a million bucks right for a million dollars she could have owned the company seven times over the company was not worth a hundred grand and here's this woman asking for a million dollar RFP and we just we learned it but it it really is a relationship driven game how did you how did you justify that like how do you like if if if if AMX says we're going to spend $5 million this year be real do you actually think that's going to help them like sell more [ __ ] yes so I do right we do a lot of brand lift studies and things like that right it's different right it's not we're not no one's trying to uh you know like Lexus for example or car company Lex does how many brand Li studies did you do we used to do them and I'd be like what the [ __ ] is a brand lift study like like are you kidding me Todd what is a brand Li study I don't know what the hell this is or we would do all this other stuff like an RFP like we had been doing it for like 6 months and I was like Hey guys like at this point I'm a little bit too afraid to ask but what the hell is an RFP I don't know what this stuff means I didn't know what any of this stuff it's so challenging if you don't work in the industry and then they like they talk about agencies and I'm like wait what the hell it is an agency why don't we just go straight to the brand like this stuff from an from a small business owner's perspective all of this stuff is crazy inefficient and stupid now that been at a big company HubSpot I understand I'm like okay I I get like these guys are having to like give out a billion dollars of marketing like now I I understand a lot more but when you're just a 10 person company you're like do you guys realize this Market study [ __ ] doesn't work like this brand study that's [ __ ] right L like you're going to give me $20,000 to write this article it took me like 20 minutes to do it uh like so it doesn't make sense when you're small yeah but you know people are people are buying the audience they're buying the the relationship with with you they're not buying you know purchases or things like that and so you know I think at scale when you get to 4 million subscribers if you can change the perception of half a million or a million people and have make them because of a marketing campaign have a you know 10% of people have a higher perception of of credit card X's programs like that is really valuable when your Visa or your MasterCard your American Express and you spend a billion dollars like that's so much money how do you deploy a billion dollars of marketing spend you go through agencies and that's how it all happens Sean and are really good I think at starting stuff we we've got pretty good Vision where we can spin things up and get them to like a million in Revenue pretty quickly the thing that I was always envious of you because it's my it's a it's a fairly big shortcoming I think I have is you are just so good at I don't know exactly how to explain it you've got this like almost private Equity like ability to like look at numbers and be like oh the margin here is shitty and I'm like I've never used that word margin in my life but you'll like talk about like the margin here and like well if you just change that by like 10% probably by doing this your outcome is going to be like this this and this like you just have this really good operational ability you're also really good at saying like well if you just improve this this and this and only focus on that then in 6 months I think your outcome will be this you're really good at that and you were really good at that at a very young age how did you figure out how to do that how did you learn how to do that and and have that insight and have that ability and also have that faith in like well if you just do this this and this the outcome might be this this and this in eight months yeah I mean so I got an undergraduate business degree and I always used to [ __ ] on undergraduate business degrees I'm like what a complete waste of time like those four years were so dumb but as I look back it really did give me uh a pretty good overview of what it takes to to run a business now not actually the day-to-day of running a business but like what is accounting I took like seven accounting classes or I don't know maybe five those were actually really valuable to be able to really dive deep into a p&l to re and and my summer spent in Investment Banking to to understand what's a financial model what drives them model those things that within the context of Finance like yeah you know they're okay with in the context of running a business was super helpful to understand what levers you need to pull uh but the other the flip side is I looked at you three years ago and I before we knew each other maybe even two years ago and I was like both of you I was like I hate these guys because they're so good at going zero to one they're so good at coming up with ideas like I'm the opposite right I I'm not an ideas guy I can't come up with ideas but I do think IDE there cooler and sexier to do what we do you know there's no doubt about that it is definitely yeah but like dude what what would you I mean you know we all we need to like partner because zero to one is cool but then like one to 100 million years is is pretty [ __ ] cool too yeah how about you guys take things you get them off the ground you take them to three employees and a million dollars of Revenue and I'll take him from one to 100 and we can just pair up in just every couple years I about his margin and he he thought I said margin he brought me some butter dude like we like I didn't understand for all we know for all we know the the hustle was either a billion dollar company or worthless um Sam just has no idea yeah well I like I remember um when we were negotiating to sell and like there was just all these things that people were giving me advice on and I'm like man I just didn't even think about that like it's just and I actually know a lot of people that are really successful like we're talking billion dollar successful and they know so little about operations and there's a lot of people like that like who are just they're good at hiring Like Richard Branson I think he famously said he's like dude I didn't know what a p&l was until we hit like hundreds of millions in Revenue like I didn't know how to read it um the same thing which is super cool uh so Austin you what I like uh that you said on the operation side like a Sam's saying is um like you when you were talking earlier you were like you know write grow cell you know we wrote that on the wall we woke up every day and said WR grow cell we had the Great Wall so good at that those are the things that like uh we I used to do this such like similar like literally we had the wall but not with milk Road actually this is like kind of my earlier startups and at Monkey Inferno I remember Sam you probably remember this when people used to come in like we would always have like all this [ __ ] on the walls and like these sayings and these posters and indoctrination things the indoctrination and and I I always felt like whenever I would meet Founders one of the highest predictors of success was do they even know what the main thing is and it sounds like a stupid question but for a lot of Founders they didn't really understand what the main thing was for their business they didn't know their business's version of WR Grell okay and even if they understood like that that's kind of generic okay what are you going to do with that they didn't understand to translate that into the Great Wall of opens is the number we're going to write down every day we're going to look at it and if it's bad we're going to do something about it and if it's good we're going to like double down on that and that's what daily work is is around this one number and so it was like uh I remember we had these Founders in in in the office and they would be like I'd be like all right what's the you know how many new customers you guys get today like what's the revenue and they'd have to like oh yeah let me check and they would like at first they didn't have a dashboard they're like going into the database I'm like bro you haven't built an easy way to know this number and then they then finally they built that and they always had to check and I was like how do you not know why am I asking this question like it's 3 p.m. one of y'all two should have asked this question by 300 p.m. like every day this is crazy and they just didn't do it and I was like these guys are going to fail cuz they don't know how to keep the main thing the main thing is that something that you see or like did consciously like where where did you get that cuz that wasn't uh obvious to me right out of college but sounds like you got it right right away I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsh sheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better yeah that I I mean for us I I mean it's almost an insult right we were we people are like why didn't you do this why didn't you do that why didn't you go into video we were too dumb to do that like we had no we like video how the hell do you make a video we can barely get our newsletter out I mean there were days where we'd we'd finish the newsletter like 2 a.m. we'd be coding the thing ourselves and so I think it was partially you know a little bit of foresight but also partially a forcing function uh you know we just looked at we're like if we do these things we will get here and we looked at the math and we're like everyone's telling us we're crazy but if we grow Subs $50,000 every or 50,000 subscribers every single month and our costs don't change we're g to go from 50,000 monthly Revenue to 75 to 100 to 125 and by end of this year we're going to be at a million Subs doing a million dollars of Revenue a month and I tell that to investors and people they'd be like that doesn't make any sense I'm like I don't know what to tell you like I'm just looking at the Excel and people couldn't I mean we spoke to investors and they were like what do you mean your business only has $100,000 of costs I'm like like it's people it's growth marketing and it's an ESP that's it that's all we spend money on what was that last line I don't even know what that last line is email that's like provider email service provider will you sail through oh ESP okay I think said I was like SP I was like what the hell is sp okay yeah but but it's it's one of those things where like it was just when you boil it down to numbers and run it in an Excel model it's like so simple and people these investors were like well like you're not accounting for this and that I'm like it's all [ __ ] like none of that means anything I'm just trying to make money like I'm just trying to make money also did some Scrappy stuff I remember like uh didn't you get your first out a few thousand emails just by like standing in a classroom we I think we may have we may have broken a couple laws to get our first couple thousand walk out and you'd have a piece of paper and be like hey just write your email down no we we we wouldn't let him walk out so we go in the beginning of a lecture these econ 101 lectures like a thousand people and I hated public I still do but I hated public speaking and I was like look if I'm going to this lecture hall and I'm going to talk in front of a thousand people I bet get every damn email and so what I would do is I'd speak in front of these people and I'd walk around the teacher would let you speak or you would just stand up yeah speak no no the teacher would let us speak because there there's a thing called Michigan times you actually had 10 minutes in between each class so if the class started 10: I actually started at 10:10 and so at 10:05 I get up there I pitch on Pitch them on morning brew and then i' basically print out an Excel document and I'd walk around I would just stand in front of people and just stare them in the eyes until they gave me their email and I'd sit in the back of the class and type every email in and I'd be like [ __ ] Alex is that an A or a c or an e he'd be like who cares put them all in and we had like every like six permutations of every single email and that's how we got to like 10 or 15,000 in Michigan and then we're like do you have a friend at Penn State I have a friend at Penn State let's do this at Penn State let's do it at Miami let's do it at NYU and next thing you know we have like 50,000 people across the the country college students reading morning Brew are your parents wealthy did you grow up wealthy uh I'd say middle class upper middle class but what's interesting is so I grew up in the suburbs of Baltimore and like I didn't know I thought I knew wealth and then I moved to I went to Michigan and I met people from La in New York and I moved to New York and I saw people from New York and I never saw that kind of wealth and to me that was inspiring that was exciting uh because I came from again there like a very well off I had everything I needed but you know I know people I met people at school who were flying private planes I know what a private plane was you got rich pretty young right like when did you guys sell you're you're pretty young right now I think you guys sold at what 26 or something yeah any 25 well the reason but hold on real quick the reason I asked was because like you've got this like this immigrant hustle and before I knew you I stereotyped you as this like H everything's been given to this rich kid like and and and hearing this story I'm like oh no these guys were like just as gritty as I was for sure sometimes more um yeah I mean Alex has his own story about you know family and and his dad passed away and so he was I mean I learned so much from Alex about Hunger like Alex again he broke things down the same way I did Alex would be like hey you know I'd be like Alex we need a hundred advertisers this year I'd be like I don't know how we're going to do it we have zero he goes I know exactly how we'll do it I'm gonna go in LinkedIn and I'm not going to sleep until I message a thousand companies and we'll get a 10% reply rate I'll be like you're going to message a thousand companies he's like well isn't that what you need to do to get to 100 sub 100 advertisers and like yeah but that sounds crazy he goes well let's start working and we just like you know sit there drink beer and we work and just you know crank out cold DMS the head of I mean I must know the head of growth at every New York City direct consumer company because Alex incessantly emailed them and we would like we would laugh at the response like we would get excited when someone respond to be like hey Alex this is your ninth email like you got to stop following up like number eight was good but nine you you passed it so yeah I think we both had that hustle what did it feel like to back back to what Sean saying you're 25 and you I don't know how much you made but let's just say eight figures what's that feel like when you're 25 um [ __ ] dope yeah I mean so first off it was it was very cool it's great so so it's so it's interesting right um I I got the wire what the the sum of money I was it was during covid so I get this like listen to this J position on one hand I just made a boat load of money more money than you know I thought I'd ever make right on the other hand I'm living in my childhood bedroom sitting next to my parents as the wire hits my account and every's like what are you gonna do now I was like I don't know my mom's cooking like meatloaf tell your mom mom make me breakfast yeah it was the most anti-climactic thing ever it was unbelievably anticlimactic you should have just moved into the master bedroom yeah like move over Mom and Dad this shit's mine no but I I I think look I I I think uh getting a quick win early in or a win early in life is so important right just having that Swagger that confidence that brand allows me to do so much that I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise but get into any room I can get in touch with anyone right what other opportunities do you think you get I mean again like get into any room right SO meetings uh investing what are some what are some cool rooms you got into I mean again like it's the same things that I think you guys are you guys also have wits right I don't think anything is is that well I don't like to leave my house and then Sam's only interested in like people that are like this guy's the best Axe thrower in you know the country and he's like super pumped about it I'm like I don't think you needed to like you know pull your your you know rich guy card to get in touch with him but I feel like you I don't know like have you met Leo Caprio I feel like he might have just bumped into Leo DiCaprio somewhere that I feel like that's more your five in New York well so so I I bumped into Justin Bieber in the Bahamas um which was pretty cool um but no I mean like the weekend we had with with uh uh what's his name Mr Beast and and uh hust was cool I spent a weekend with Kid Rock on his Ranch yeah tell me about that was pretty sick what was that like I mean he's a a unique unique character again this is all according to him so I Haven I haven't fact checked this but I'll assume he's tell telling the truth he told me he's the only person to play at both President Obama and president Trump's inaugurations he played at both and he knows both super well he's close to both and he has this this he lives in this huge Ranch outside of Nashville right I went there it was uh my friend his name is Shane uh he works in Tech he's good friends with Kid Rock Kid Rock obviously music guy and Shane put together 10 people in Tech Kid Rock 10 people in music we go to his Ranch and I mean you get there and it's like out of a movie right you walk in and Kid Rock's back is to me he's got a cigar sticking out of his mouth he's got a shotgun and he's just shooting clay pigeons and the whole weekend was out of a movie right his Studio unbelievable we pulled on lighter together just telling stories about Eminem uh I mean he's a is really really cool he's uh a lot of people don't realize this but Kid Rock got famous right before CDs went down and he's one of the bestselling artists of all time and I I it wouldn't surprise me if he's probably worth2 or $300 million because he was famous when CDs were $18 and $21 and so like it's wild yes so so now though I think he's a new source of wealth so he owns uh again this is what I I've been told he owns the most popular bar in all of Nashville and whereas most of the other ones like Luke Bryant has one and a bunch of other country singers they just licens their name to the bar right and they make a couple percent I think Kid Rock's like a 5050 owner probably makes two million bucks a month no I've heard more I heard like it's a project I've heard again I don't know if it's true I've heard it's big big money you know high high uh tens of millions you know which is crazy dude the one of the best things uh about our companies and um like the culture that us three have kind of built with our friends because we kind of like got into this media game a little bit early and I don't know about you Austin but when the hustle was starting there wasn't that many people who we could look at and be like well let's just do what they do but different there like I remember I told this one media guy who I'll tell you afterwards he's the founder of a multi-billion dollar Media company now I was like here's what I'm doing he goes bro this will never make more than $2 million a year in revenue and this other person who I who I'm now good friends with was like dude what are you talking about this I'm like it didn't matter it's just a small screen who cares like if you're an email or on a website it doesn't matter the math shows X Y and Z and so we had a higher like 20 four-year-olds who like were promising but like and then we had to learn about it as we grew and be but because of that both morning Brew the hustle and the and the crew that now Sean I mean Sean's great at this as well we've we've done a really cool job of like finding smart inexperienced people who now have gone on to do a lot of really cool stuff and that makes me really really proud to like see like this crew that we've all built and so there's like the hustle crew the morning Brew Crew and then uh Sean was like the hustle thing now he's got his own thing have you noticed that like we all have this little like Army of people who have like been through like this like self created like training camp it's kind of neat right yeah 100% I mean it's it's we in the early days we could not get people to work with us who didn't want to be entrepreneurs and the pitch was simply like Hey we're starting a business you'll be in on the ground floor right you'll see what it's like and that's that's all you get like you know we didn't have for the first year and a half of I was so cheap for the first year and a half of morning Brew you didn't get a company computer you had to bring your own computer to work dude I was famous cuz on Facebook I would put hey I'm buying I'm buying laptops does anyone have a Mac for sale for $500 no D we were not dropping any money on Company Computer we didn't have health care in the early days you got nothing you got I mean and we we just we we we couldn't afford it because I was so against taking venture capital I was like we're going to make every penny count One More Story Fridays at 3:00 we'd all go pencils down work with stop because we had a referral program we'd send out stickers and t-shirts and that whole thing that you know I'm sure we've all seen but you had a packet we had no we had no packing and so we'd sit down we'd like wheel in that wew keg into our office and we'd convey our you know we we do like an assembly line the first person would would like open the envelope the next person would stick the sticker in there the next person would lick them the next person would put the the the label on and for like 3 or 4 hours from like 300 p.m. till 7:00 p.m. on Fridays that's all we did was just pack envelopes of [ __ ] well your one of your early Guys Tyler dank has gone on to start beehive which is a really cool company he he seemed like a really good entrepreneur he's pivoting or um iterating really quickly and then I've got a couple people have done that and then um like it's it's just cool to see like these people who were young and not dumb but like just young and like inexperienced go on to like build cool [ __ ] and then like your ex people are now at other newsletter companies and then sea has hired a couple of my exe or and probably it seems like a couple of your exe and it's like this incestuous thing which at first I would be jealous I'm like who what the hell why are they working with this person but now I'm like oh this is awesome man like we've created this like tiny little industry of of newsletter nerds and it's actually quite cool yeah I love it yeah I think it's really cool I think there's be so much more value created I think what Tyler's doing at beehive is amazing I think what I've been so impressed with him is like the the maturation from the morning brw days of you know it's like six of us and he's doing a little bit of everything to the way he's been able to scale himself and scale that team is amazing and so it's really and I mean Trung's the same way like what Trung's done is incredible and there I mean there's a ton of examples and it's really cool to see you regret selling no that's that's you answered that quickly even though like not even a little bit so you sold part of the business what do you think the the entire business is going to sell for in the future hundreds of millions I think many multiples of what we sold the first uh half for but we structured the deal in a way that I thought was great right I mean the ability to have life-changing money if anyone has the option like I always think it's good to take half your chips off the table right and maybe I'm biased because I did that and and it's worked but I thought it was really important but I still have enough upside where I'm excited right it's it's not like a tiny earnout that people sign where it's like 10% of the deal it can you know it can be really really meaningful and that drives me that keeps me excited it keeps me on the hunt I love the company I love the people we work with I love the executive team but I would I I I mean during covid or during I I wouldn't have slept at night I just I sleep very well at night knowing that like I have my my nest egg and so what did you do with money do you do think cool with it or did you uh did you touch it right away what that money hits the bank you're at your parents house what what happened to that money over the next I don't know how long it's been like a year or two yeah so I haven't I tell in terms of everyone's like oh you gotta do like make a Splurge purchase there was nothing out there that I was that excited about buying so I ended up buying a car um which expensive I didn't buy like a a Mercedes I bought an Acura right nothing crazy I doubled my or or I I yeah a pre-owned a my dad used wasn't it wasn't pre-owned brand new 2022 sports mode sports edition a tech at Tech air conditioning that's air conditioning what why dude you really do have that immigrant mentality man I think we need to get you like a 23 and me test I I feel like uh there's something going on here you got too much immigrant energy I love it no but I mean I I I I increase my rent four to five times right I live in a great apartment um I went on a amazing vacation last summer um you know I I actually love I know you guys know remit sty or sey I'm not sure how pronounce the last name but like that idea of like your rich life and spending on cuz I mean uh lifestyle creep is real totally that is real and so like look I spend money on the things that I find interesting and that I like and I love traveling and staying at really nice hotels and spending a ton of money on business class flights and things like that I like living in a nice apartment but like I live in New York City what am I going to do drop another 50k on a car that sits in a parking lot 361 days a year it's a complete waste of money it's just stupid and you know Morgan Howell actually tweeted this um and I read this too in Will Smith's book he has a great quote he was talking about Fame and becoming famous and the quote was something like becoming famous is awesome being famous is cool and losing any Fame is horrible and I feel the same exact way about money right I feel the same way and so I have no desire to like spend money on things I don't actually care about I don't want to I don't want to lose my money because I can you know change the a to a a you know an M or whatever on a Mercedes so I spend money that I on things I actually care about so I can make sure I maintain my wealth what do you invest in or do you just uh are you conservative are you aggressive like what's the pie chart of like of the 100% where did where did the money go yeah so I probably took like 8 85 90% of it and put it into very very boring stuff right S&P 500 or or or Vanguard like Target date funds like uh 2065 or something like that right you did this yourself or you hired like a wealth person no I hired a team and it's a good thing I did because if not I would have went off the rails right um and then I put you know five maybe s% in crypto right and I put another 5% in Venture investing right but the vast vast majority is in really boring real estate S&P 500 uh and uh like bonds right but like really boring [ __ ] nice let's talk about some non- newsletter stuff so you got a bunch of ideas uh when we were hanging out at at Camp MFM uh you were telling me about like this thing you're doing and this thing you're doing I was like oh this guy's like way more Dynamic uh and interested in a whole bunch of different things what are some ideas that you think would be cool to share yeah um so I'll throw out a bunch of ideas I have but one General framework I think people should think about is when you're in shitty Economic Times like we're going into now I think the the framework you should use is you should look to save companies money or earn individuals side income right before companies money didn't matter right Capital was abundant and so companies they were all about just grow grow grow right how can you help me grow it's a 180 now you know people were trading their money for others people other people's time right now they're trading time for money and so all you know if you can help companies preserve money you can I think build really really great side hustles so a few ideas right I think it's like what's old is new and there's a bunch of agencies I think could' be really interesting to start right now one is outsourced talent I knew nothing about the outsourced Talent game I recently became a co-owner in a business uh it's a really interesting business called oceans they found talent in Sri Lanka right really talent in Sri Lanka where they've us graduates uh come to Tech startups work there uh really interesting and I think there are ways right they have a unique Advantage going to Sri Lanka which we don't really have to talk about but I think there are companies who were hiring a full-time copywriter let's call it or a full-time uh you know marketer and they probably only need them for 25 30 hours a week 2021 screw it right we'll need them at some point I think now companies are really questioning FTE right do you need a full-time h and so you can create these Niche marketplaces I'm getting investment opportunities for them all the time and they're just not Venture scaled but you bootstrap a Marketplace let's call it like a Content marketing uh agency or content marketing Marketplace for B2B companies right these stocks are down 90 95% they're trying to drop FTE but they still want content right we all know how valuable owning audience and content is and building that Marketplace helping them find people I think simple services like that are going to come back into Vogue and be very very profitable what's that company um where the founder got in trouble for not converting the the stock uh converting the convertible notes but it was a Marketplace for uh developers and it like bootstrapped its way practically it with toptw so toptw um they got in trouble because they only raised like $800,000 or a million dollars but they didn't convert the the F the the the the note or whatever so it was controversial but they basically have bootstrapped it to this point to like north of a 100 million in net revenue um and so these marketplaces are like can be they can be pretty freaking powerful it seem they seem hard to get off the ground but they don't seem that hard if you already working in the in in the industry and it's a super Niche a niche topic because people ask me all the time they go hey I want to hire writers who should I hire and I'm like I don't know man it's hard I don't know who you should hire yeah yeah I mean the one I the one I'm now coer and has gone from zero to seven figures of AR in like eight months right you pick a very specific Target customer Talent gross or is that margins are no no well now both right both are seven figures of AR that's crazy yeah and then what's his name Marshall from uh Marshall hos he did Shephard what's the URL it's a sheer same thing right same same business and I I it seems like he's scaled that to high seven figures in like less than a year it seems from the outside yeah yeah I think they're a bit different right ours is I think theirs is more like strictly EAS the one we have is more you you know you have people in finance people in operations what's interesting about Sri Lanka is they have big four accounting firms right so you can poach people not just from local businesses but from people have been trained by ernston Young and and deoe and so it's an interesting an interesting demographic to go into yeah I love that one uh I think that's a great one what are uh what are some other like you know help businesses save money help the other one you said is help individuals earn side money what's a what's an example of that yeah so here here's one I think's interesting right so you built morning Brew for crypto right I know a lot of people spoken about this but I don't think anyone's really built the brand yet I think morning Brew or the hustle for AI is gonna be huge dude how's that feel by the way a thing you're just like calling Sean the morning Brew of blank it's okay it's okay we did kick your ass in Krypto I mean it's okay it's okay that that happened we could just let it go though we could tell we could take a collective deep breath and just let it go if you if that would help no no again you guys did a really great job I I thought that was awesome um and I think someone's going to do the same thing in AI right and so the bootstrap version of this is to do what you did right the AI newsletter right down the Fairway have a unique tone integrate yourself into the audience the way I think to take it to the next level is the last three months thousands of entrepreneurs have all started tinkering on little AI side projects right and they all have 50 100K of ARR and I've been reaching out to all these Founders like you know uh different little tools right these are not real big businesses they're all side hustles right I went home for Thanksgiving I asked all my friends from home my family hey like have you guys been playing around with the chat GPT have you been playing around they're like what in the hell are you talking about right and so clearly it's the same customer for all of these different things right and so I think this's this opportunity for the AI for morning Brew to start a little tiny capital or a little holding company where you can start to invest and buy these businesses right give a an off ramps these Founders who've built these 50 or 100 or 150k ar businesses and start cross-promoting them bundling marketing them you write reviews for your little AI tool and then you promote it and instead of having ad advertising which Again Sam has spoken about how it's difficult you're just promoting all your products you have this portfolio of 10 20 30 little AI tools and maybe each one is half a million or a million of ARR but altogether you you can get you can get pretty big pretty quickly that one seems harder to me um I I feel like like I like the idea but I'm like okay realistically if I did that I feel like I would uh I like ideas where the idea is so good my execution can be like a seven out of 10 and I still win um because yeah but this is his thing man this is his thing he he executes some of these things really well I don't think it'd be that hard I'm telling you I I've been talking to a bunch of these like these Founders these little aisi projects and I've been I'm like what are you doing with it like I have no idea the reason I think it's hard is not because you can't roll them up you can't buy them I think it's hard because uh all it's like the Lindy effect right so when something's been around for 3 months and it's at 50k Mr and it seems great like you don't know if that thing is going to be around three months from now because the next model will come out or the next chat like for example uh you know you stable diffusion comes out then and then uh you know chat GPT comes out well people were you I've invested in a couple of these that you know the AI writing tools they're getting better and they're pouring Millions into marketing to get to get customers for their you know ai ai writing tool but everybody's building on the same foundations the same models and then they're trying to say how they're going to be differentiated and the reality is they're going differentiated on I don't know customer acquisition and so I think that like it is you know I I think about when I buy something like you know the tiny Capital bottle works because he buys stuff that's like kind of been like around and forgotten and ignored for like a long period of time like he buys like a dribble um you know it's like oh it's been around for years and I could buy it and I can it's going to be around for years and I can improve it over that time uh versus buying the things that are really new and quick I think you have a challenge with the durability um of those businesses because what happens as you know the AI just keeps improving you know either the Things become obsolete or it starts to consolidate into like one app that can do four of these things and so you don't need one for posting on social media and one for writing emails it's like ah it's the same Chrome extension that's just going to do both and so I think there's a good chance you can kind of get like you know um you know just sort of Blown Away by by by the rate of change that's going on in the industry so that's the thing I would be worried about with that similar to I remember telling Andrew Wilkinson about thrasio and I was like oh this is super smart like these FBA stores are super cheap and there you know like each one of them is small but you could go and just like scoop up all these and look at this they're buying them on this like crazy low multiple and he goes yeah it's like picking pennies up in front of a steamroller and um it his first reaction and I was like yeah I can see what you mean what like if the platform changes he goes if anything happens he's like you know these aren't real durable Brands I haven't been around for a while maybe it's that Amazon changes the algorithm maybe it's that there's you know more competition maybe it's that the multiples go up there's there's four or five different ways where you just get steamrolled and that's actually what how it played out pretty much in the in the Amazon aggregator space was for a while the get was good and then those companies went all in on it and then they kind of got steamrolled you know they're getting steamrolled as we speak yeah I think you bring up a great point about AI right and that's why well I think the technology is great I've been very skeptical of investing in these companies that just really build on top of uh you know open AI because it's it's like you have a nice rapper right it's nice marketing it's great but what do you have long term what are you actually all do that who doesn't do that nobody's doing their own AI everybody's everybody's building off open AI or stable diffusion and that's why I'm skeptical of investing in that right I I think there's so many popping up right it's the next crypto wave right there's going to be a huge huge bubble and you know and they're raising not at crypto prices but I'm seeing hey two guys left some you know Andre re and back company we're raising five on 25 like what do you have they're like oh we have a deck but since we created the deck we've already changed our mind it was this and now it's this and it's like guys come on you can't you can't be serious we've seen this playoff while you say that they're like we just got another offer for 35 the price has got up you uh you know like I always I I always felt this way about you and as I've got to know you I feel this way even more the way that you know someone's an interesting founder is when you talk to them and you're like a little fearful of them where you're like I don't want to have to against this person because they're going to be very very challenging to kill and you totally have that Vibe you've got this like weird mixture of neuroticism where you're like no I have to go like I have to win we're going to lose like everything's over if I don't win this thing but then you also have this like really good work ethic I remember I asked you the other day I'm like hey at what point at morning Brew did you quit grinding and you're like what never I'm still grinding and uh I think that's just a really that's really fascinating um are you weirdly good at like some random thing did you like channel that Obsession towards some other thing like growing up game we like we tennis or some [ __ ] yeah I mean I I was obsessed with video games right Sports video games uh but nothing nothing specific right I wasn't like Travis kenck like number two Wei tennis in the world um no it was that and now I'm like it's that for cooking right I'm I I've thought about like what I go to culinary school and take night classes cuz now I'm obsessed with cooking I love to cook wow did not see that coming you got to come over for a meal you got to come to I know you don't leave San Francisco but when you do you have to come to New yor sh so what what do you uh what's you said something about REM and like your rich life what do you think your rich life how old are you now 28 what what's your rich life going to be at 35 and 40 like what are you working towards yeah I I think for me uh it's all about time right like to me wealth is all about having time and spending that time how you want to right right now I want to spend that time building this company because I constantly see more growth and more opportunity and not just like 2x but 10x but ultimately what I wouldn't be able do at 35 to spend my time how I want to spend it on any given day right and and that means a lot of travel I love traveling like I I wouldn't go at some point uh in the not too distant future hopefully go on a six-month trip three months to Europe three months to Southeast Asia I never got to do that a lot of my friends and college when they graduated they went to Thailand and and wherever else I drove from Michigan to New York and started work working the next day and so for me it's a lot of traveling you know nothing crazy spending time with family doing fun stuff right like being able just to say hey like today I'm going to you know drop 500 bucks and go you know do something you know $1,000 and go do some fun activity right adventurous activities but they all comes back just waking up and say hey here's how I want to spend my day and then doing that thing are you able to do that now I can right but I I choose to spend that time on morning Brew like I am maniacally focused on growing morning Brew I think there's a ton of opportunity but as soon as I don't think that like I'll change I'll say Hey you know today I want to do something else do you like having 200 plus employees it sounds like [ __ ] hell particularly New York Manhattan like woke employees that like in the New York media scene like everyone's talking about unionizing like when I think about that I'm like this sounds miserable blink if blink if it's miserable because I know you can't say anything what are you gonna say um no no I I mean look I there's a couple things one uh we have a lot of remote employees so we do have a really good distribution of employees across the country which I think does help right I think having employees everywhere gives different perspectives right our engineering team lives you know in the Midwest and and we have people all across the country which I think is cool uh but to be honest as a CEO of a 250 person company I'm not interacting with that many people on a daily basis but what I love is like the one of the reasons I Stay is cuz we built this team of people who are ping to me who are just A+ Allstars like absolute rock stars and that's what makes me so happy is when I can just come to work and say Hey you know Chief content officer hey you know person X like what are you doing like tell me more about it how can I help you but also I'm like a vacuum right I'll hire someone new a chief content officer or a COO I'll be like I'm going to learn as much as humanly possible and my goal is to catch up to you and knowledge as fastest possible so if you're 38 you're 40 you know you're you're 10 years older than me I want to just vacuum up those 10 years of knowledge you gained working these four or five places in the next like two months and I'm just going to pester you and sit with you and just learn as much as humanly possible so I can you know be better than you and know more than you and it's like this competitive nature that's exactly what I'm saying about being like someone that you're you're be you'd be really hard to compete with you were hard to compete with uh that's a really fascinating mindset it's very intriguing I I saw Sean smirk that's always a good sign you're like I wouldn't want to compete with you it's like oh you did for like five years I did yeah and like uh I mean it was fun I I think that I think maybe I'm the same way where someone's like I don't know if I want to compete against you but but like you know I think it's um it's it's it's you're you're intriguing you're interesting I think you have got a really good mindset I think you got that good inner game yeah and I think I think I can't remember I said this before but I think the thing that really I I've changed my thinking about you so much is I used to think you were like rude and now yeah we've been working together on like a few side projects and what I've learned is that your style is not for everyone but you are what I would call like admirably abrasive right and we r a call I don't know if I'm supposed to tell the story but we're on a call I won't say names we're on a call and this guy gives us like a three minute pitch and I just see the look on Sam's face I go oh no this guy's feel is not good and the guy goes Sam what do you think and Sam knows smile straight face goes I don't know why I'm even on this call what are you talking about I just start dying but but I'm not trying to be rude I'm not trying to be rude exactly exactly and it's not for everyone right that style is not for everyone but I can see how you so quickly grow things with the right people because that type of radical cander that like hey I'm just going to tell you what I think and we're not going to have an ego and we're just going to work together solve problems is so much better than sitting in the corporate media and being like Oh yeah no that was that was great and then sending an email later you should look this guy straight in the eyes and you're like I don't know why I'm here yeah I mean and the person who we were speaking with I think they're great and I was just like you're you're great this is stupid though you you know be different and uh be better than you are right now and and achieve your potential I think you're I think you're great that's typically the way that I work with people and I don't like hearing when people say that I'm rude that kind of hurts my feelings because I'm like oh [ __ ] I don't want to be like I don't want to be known as a jerk I I'm a pretty kind guy I thought so I hate hearing that but it is the truth all right Sean you work with Sam what's what's you deal with that on your own yeah I think Sam's intimidating to work with uh you know I think that I've seen a bunch of people around the podcast that are intimidating but it's a good thing it's a standard like the people who have really high standards for how they want things to go they're intimidating work with like for me we come on here something's messed up the camera the audio whatever I'm hey don't worry it's going to be a great show I'm trying to put that person at ease CU I'm like they probably feel like [ __ ] I know they didn't want this to happen uh you know like and a lot of these things are I know like that's not you intentionally messing something up that's like something is going wrong somebody's late some something out of your control is happening whereas Sam gets frustrated I can see that person start to sweat and I don't think that's rude I just think that's like I think you're focused and I think you uh you know you're just like you're like a blunt object it's like what are you going to say like this Hammer is not very soft no it's a [ __ ] Hammer we that that's why we like it that's why it has that's why it gets the best spot in the tool set cuz it's this like really like heavy blunt object and that's what you need and like for the podcast the podcast would not be successful without Sam like that's just he brings that to the Pod and so I love that now with that comes well I you know sometimes it's not going to be you not everyone's going to get treated with soft gloves and that's okay like you know if you know the guy's intent is good then you you don't really worry about it so I don't know that's that's my uh I don't know my my feedback that's good yeah no that that that's one brand and then Sean let me I I know I'm here for you guys to to ask me questions but I want to ask you a question uh which is you know like you obviously are a great Storyteller you're very good on camera how much of that do you think is is natural like you just born with it how much of it do you keep going keep going keep going let me let me answer it first part keep going the hammer enter I was gonna say I was how much you think you're born with and how much are you have you studied like are you and what are you doing to get better at it because I've listened to podcast for three years and you've just increasingly upped your game and gotten better and I mean it's pretty it's pretty incredible let me give my perspective and then he should answer but so from the time I knew Shawn he was always pretty good he would we would we would do these like the the podcast stemmed because me him and sea and a few other guys would meet weekly or monthly and like do kind of what we're doing now and Sean was always good at at like I I would explain something and he' be like well so what you're really saying is this so here's how you should look at it and he would like story tell in such a way where I'm like oh wow you've got this like inspirational like thing about you that's really good and then so we always had that I think that was was like a I think he was born with that and then we started the Pod and he was a little rough where I actually think early on I was better than him at like capturing attention and then he started learning about copyrighting I think I was like you should have learn about this copyrighting thing and then he got really good at copyrighting and then he got really good at storytelling like on a more refined basis and basically what happened was because he was born with this I think this innate ability as well as he wanted to learn about it and then he actually studied it his TR and his growth was quicker than mine and I think he actually surpassed it in terms of like storytelling and ability to capture attention and if you listen to like the first couple of episodes you could clearly see like because of his tone of voice and everything like all right this person's intriguing but then it was like he studied it over a year and you could see that there was a huge change and I think it was in part of him studying copyrighting and I do think he like actually went and studied like Hass Hass and like all these other comedians he like figured out we both like comedians but I think he studies it and we'll like tweet or message each other like hey look how they like told this joke it was really interesting and so he actually studied that and truly learned it and so I think it was a combination of being born and studying over like two years is that is that accurate uh I think some things you said they were accurate for sure um my and nobody knows right like it's impossible question to answer but like I'll give it my best sh my here's my honest opinion my honest opinion is I I don't actually think I'm that good at it in absolute terms I just think is relative to Tech business and like podcast I've seen you with like professionals and they like Comedians and I saw that they were like coming to you for advice I've seen it yeah that okay that happens but I think the I don't know I I grew up in Houston and Houston's just got like a very high swag factor and like there like I you play basketball in the locker room there were dudes that like should have been on stage at the Apollo or something like that like just the natural Charisma of people who were just you know that I grew up with were was just really really high so I think that actually has a lot to do with it would you hang out with people who naturally have a lot of Swag and Charisma and tell funny jokes or stories or able to to just quickly jump in and have quick wit that's just becomes your normal so I think part of it was that some environment stuff my sister for example is way funnier way better Storyteller than me and growing up it was always Sean's the smart nice one he's quiet shy she's the funny one charismatic if something happened to me they'd be like Nisha tell the story about like Sean like let Nisha tell the story everyone will love it so at every family party it was her doing and and you know so imagine that like the person you admire your your older sibling is really great at this thing and you just constantly see your family and friends and like everybody loves that about them so to me it became like an important thing in my life I was like not in a negative way not like a a jealousy but I was just like it was a thing I valued I was like oh that's a really cool skill I value that I had no idea how to do it and when I was younger I was just super super quiet so I didn't talk that much in my friends group I was just the I was the laugh track I wasn't the the guy making the jokes I was the crowd noise and um but I started to I got a couple lucky breaks my cousin was in town and was like Hey you know there's a movie audition going on like you want to come with me and I just like I guess so I don't know and so I went with him and I ended up getting cast in the movie um and that like showed me that exposed me to a different thing and the the guy in the movie who was my brother was Cal pen who who was the guy from Harold and Kamar and stuff like that so I got to hang out with him for like weeks at a time so now I'm around somebody else who's very charismatic very good Storyteller he's like a professional actor right so he was somebody I admired that I was hanging out with for weeks he's the only guy I talked to on set because I was intimidated by everybody else and he was super nice to me and so we just hung out every day for like you know six weeks so that's a kind of a boot camp in like just being around somebody who's got that Charisma okay then fast forward uh I moved to San Francisco and I'm like okay um I want to be like you know I don't know in my mind I was like a CEO should be the leader the leader should be inspiring charismatic clear I'm none of those things so how am I going to do all that and so I like tried to do things I took you know I went to the SF improv I took classes there all the time right cu I was like I don't know it's fun I might meet some people but also I think this I think improv is like a crazy skill set to have like to be able to on your feet be able to think of something and you know make a crowd laugh that that to me is a actual superpower and it's the superpower I wanted to have same thing with comedians like I like that content but I don't just watch it and let just let drool come out of my mouth that oh wow these people are funny I'm like I want to be funny I love how funny they are and like what do they do when they tell stories um to you know that makes it work and I'll go rewatch it and I'll sort of break it down sometimes I'll I'll try it myself uh like for example when I did that Luna video I did it in the style of like those John Oliver or hust and Minaj like skits and mine is like you know 10 times worse and I texted to hust he was like cool change these 95 things and I was like ah dude that's a lot to change I'm just going to ship it like you know I I don't have time to do all that but like now that you've told me this I now know what I should have done but it's just those reps like it's Talent helps but then there's reps and people don't really see the Reps and I would say like that combination of the three things I mentioned like being around people who are who are better at it than you and you admire them that plants a little seed inside you right like Austin you were talking about that with money like when you met people with more money it was inspiring and you're like oh wow my World opened up I now have like people I can sort of like you know I can try to embody a blueprint that that maybe they have uh to to something I want that's how it was with storytelling and the sort of like I don't know Charisma or something like that for me and so that you know being around people who you admire putting yourself in unusual situations that are like kind of intensives like improv or acting in movies stuff like that most people in business don't have that experience so they shouldn't be as good at it right like if you've never gone through these intense experiences and then you know how would you have developed those skills why are you asking that Austin are you trying to like get better at talking or what yeah a better public speaking so 2023 goal I guess I'm going to New York improv dude I I I New York improv I think some people are born better but I think everyone can get at least good but I do think Shawn has this like something that will make him great and uh it it it is it's very uh well let me just put it this way Austin have you ever watched back a video of you speaking publicly in order to take notes on yourself of how you did yeah super uncomfortable feeling but an obvious thing to do if you wanted to get better right like I just had that moment where I was like oh I'm saying I want to get better at this I've never done any of the obvious things you would do right I've never like went and watched myself and said what the hell am I doing with my hands and why am I fidgeting so much and man I keep saying um at the start of these sentences I should just say the sentence but like I had to go review the game film okay then the second thing was like I had to take it seriously like did I just walk up there unprepared and not warm or do I warm up or do I prepare okay that that that added to the game and then the third one is like who's the best at this and I went to a Tony Robbins event and I was like this guy's like the best public speaker I've ever seen and even if I don't listen to any of his content if I just literally listen to the rhythm of his words and the gestures and then the the hooks and how he's getting everyone's attention that's a master class right there like okay I'll take that and so that's how I started stacking up some of these things and I don't consider myself a good public speaker cuz I don't do a lot of speeches or anything like that anymore but um it's definitely something at a time I try to build up and it accommodated in an epic wedding speech I got to say the best speech I ever gave was at my wedding unrehearsed off the Dome and just like it was I don't know the perfect the perfect speech I just retired from the game right there at your own wedding at my own wedding yeah is there uh is there anything else you want to talk about Austin it's pretty cool you should come on More by the way and we should talk about newsletter [ __ ] cuz you're like the only person or us three are some of the very few people that like I actually want to ask newsletter advice from um and like yeah I'm trying to get out of the the the newsletter guy branding but just keep on bringing me on to be the newsletter guy dude but it's it is so fun it's it's a LoveHate relationship it's really they're really fun to do but also they're painful and whatever yeah no I I think that's it I think we we cover most of it what do you think you're going to be doing like 10 years from now you're GNA you think you be running businesses or you're going to be just investing or ORS small or what so to me it's it's barbell right I either want to you know have some passive income and you know work 20 25 hours a week more casual or I want to go Allin but if I go Allin it's got to be huge right the potential has to be multiple billions I don't think I'm going to want to run a business where it's like it's nice and it's like a double right if I win it's a double I I don't want doubles right I either want to home run or I want to you know sit in the Dugout and just you know be be part of the the peanut gallery I don't want to play in that middle game I'm gonna look in the future and I'm gonna tell you it's probably not going to be you sitting in the Dugout that is not going to be this is I think maybe you will for a couple years but I I if I have to make a bet and I would put my money where my mouth is it's not going to be that one that's not what you're going to do we'll see well thanks for coming on dude this is awesome yeah thanks for having me we'll see it again soon [Music]

when we were getting to know you guys to decide like do we want to do this do we want to actually partner with you guys and and do a deal together um we would ask you a bunch of questions like at dinners or at the bar or whatever and your guys's stories and answers were so entertaining that I was like dude these guys need to come on the podcast if they I was like if I had just recorded this dinner this would have been like one of the best podcast episodes we've ever done probably the best laughs what's up y'all Sean here uh this is a special episode my company the milk Road just got acquired so the news is out and um I can finally talk about it I've been kind of hinting at it on the podcast for those who are listening and um yeah if the news is out and this episode is me and the dudes who bought it so you're gonna meet these guys and you're gonna see who why would I sell right like we started this thing it grew like crazy it was profitable like the thing was working so why so and I talked a little bit about that but the biggest reason honestly was these guys uh these are people that I wanted to be able to work with and get to know better and they're people that I thought if I give them you know this company and I own I still own a minority stake in it that Minority stake in five years is going to be worth a lot because I believe in these guys and what they've done they've done it before they've built and sold companies worth you know over a hundreds million hundreds of millions of dollars and I think they're going to do it again here um this the episode is a little funny it starts off a little slow uh but then around 15 minutes in we're done talking about the acquisition and I'm frankly I'm done talking a little bit and I let these guys shine and they tell stories about you know how their early projects like how they you know all the different projects they worked on some that failed spectacularly and some that succeeded um you know their philosophy around business and negotiations and stuff like that it gets really good after that so definitely stick through if you like this podcast like if you like my first million you will like these guys uh I'm gonna just I'll build the characters you got Mike who is this like Workhorse so anybody who likes you know a grinder somebody who's Scrappy somebody who can bounce back from defeat he tells a ton of stories about like basically getting his ass kicked almost failing and then somehow pulling it off um so Mike is this Workhorse of a guy I've gotten to see him in action with the milk Road this guy is like lives in the details and in the weeds it's amazing uh and then Kendall is the opposite he's like how can I work smarter not harder he's the Mr shortcut he is the guy who finds a way um to make something happen right like you know he yeah he's the guy who hacked the Tesla referral program and ended up getting multiple Tesla roadsters and he's the guy who did the same thing with Uber and Lyft and as like you know Uber credits for life and Lyft credits for like he's just a guy who's gonna solve the puzzle and uh and get the shortcut solution he will find the clever the clever way to get it done so these two guys are awesome and um I think you guys you guys really like him so enjoy this episode um all right so we should we should do this so welcome to the show I've been telling you guys you got to come on uh for a couple months now and I'm glad we're doing this so we will I think we should frame this in a couple ways we got together because you guys just bought my company you bought the milk Road and so we're gonna talk about that we're gonna talk about how that happened how that went down why you guys decided to do it good stuff like that then we're going to talk a little bit about you know what's the plan but really the thing I thought would be the best out of this conversation my sort of secret plan was when we were getting to know you guys to decide like do we want to do this do we want to actually partner with you guys and and do a deal together um we would ask you a bunch of questions like at dinners or at the bar or whatever and your guys's stories and answers were so entertaining that I was like dude these guys need to come on the podcast if they I was like if I had just recorded this dinner this would have been like one of the best podcast episodes we've ever done probably probably the best and so then I was like all right my job here is to somehow recreate that dinner because actually there's a lot of pressure I know how good this episode could be if I do my job and uh usually with a guest you know hey you just show up they do whatever they're gonna do but in this case I've heard the stories myself so I gotta find a way to to recreate that so that's my challenge you guys it should be easy it's you know um just you're gonna tell your stories and I think at the end of this people will know a little bit about what happened with the milk road but also a lot about you guys because I became a fan of you during the process of doing the deal and I think a lot of other people are going to become fancy you guys too during this because you guys are pretty low-keyed why is that why are you guys like so under the radar and I asked this as a guy who's like I'm constantly on the stage being like look at me you know I'm great and then I meet people who are really really great and they're not trying to do that so what's the is it don't have time is it Shy what's the reason that you don't do that let's start with you I think it's probably shy and it's just something that I never thought I needed to do and then when I met you I'm like I'm doing everything all wrong but we had a hilarious day where I don't know how this happened in San Francisco where I usually don't put the joke on the pot is I don't leave my house but when I do leave my house uh once in a while get bumped into and be like oh hey love the Pod for some reason that day something was going my way and like I don't know like six or seven people stopped us in a row and you guys must have been like what the hell's going almost your reaction to that I was like did you plan this I could not believe how many people were coming up to you and you know I'm a big fan of the Pod I'm doing this project I did a MFM search engine like it was insane yeah that was pretty crazy yeah the guy from the hospital he's like I just came from the hospital looking for Sean that was a little I don't know what that means I was like do you have security cameras because he said he goes I just came from the hospital and then we're like oh okay yeah and then later somebody was like why did he come from the hospital like did anybody catch that and we had no explanation uh because he had like a you know like the patient has escaped you know sticker on it on his shirt basically yeah um but I'm glad you guys are doing it uh so let's start with the milk run people want to know uh you know the news just came out today this pod will come out right after that um we sold it and people want to know how that went down I could tell it from my perspective but maybe I don't know let's do it from your perspective how did how did this all happen yeah for sure so Carter who is our finance was a big fan and he shared it with us Mike and I and we subscribed to it and every time we'd open it we're like uh they're doing it so well they're just a while back or this is six months ago okay and you know every time we read it we we talked about it we talked about the memes how funny it was but also how informative it was and that's kind of what we were trying to do with bitfo is just like make the best content and actually have people read it I feel like you know you could have the 10 000 words but that doesn't mean much to people it's like how do we get that 750 uh words that really punches and I feel like that's what you guys have done and uh you know it came to a point where I'm like we should talk to these guys but at that point we hadn't yeah and I think we reached out to you guys I remember having a conversation with Ben about growth and it was like Ben you know those like sites that are just like I don't know what's the price of Bitcoin what's the price of ethereum I was like what if we just go on there and like I don't know go I don't know I was like I wrote I was like it's probably just like some 19 year old kid like just offer them like a dollar for every email subscriber let's just see if they'll put it up put our ad up and I think that's how we reached out alrighty got in touch with one of you guys about that Ben reached out to I don't even know who somebody got back to us and you know it wasn't something we were going to do we were it was like offering a dollar per sub or whatever it turns out you weren't a kid yeah you're actually 32 we weren't 17. um but we just wanted to meet you guys so we're like let's take the meeting and uh yeah about 10 minutes into that we were messaging on the side it's like we got to buy this thing we've got to figure out a way the funny thing is I don't know if I told you this but that same day uh like we had just been full force working on milk Road this is the best it's gonna be awesome dude we're just every day and like I'm a big like pat on the back self pad on the back kind of guy every day I'd basically tell Ben this is amazing we've launched this thing and only in this many months we've already grown this fast it's gonna be so good this many years in but you know it's gonna be great and then one day I just hit Ben with a curveball in slack and this is the same day I go I go how much would you sell this for right now and uh he's like what like I don't know do you want to sell it I was like that's not what I said I said how much would you sell it for right now he's like oh maybe this number and I was like yeah I think my number's like you know that plus one and he was like I know he was like okay um what do you do with that I was like let's see if we could sell it and I was like I'm very impulsive like that like I was wake up one day that's how I got my dog I just woke up one day and I just hey get in the car we're gonna go let's go find a dog and we were like craigslisting in the car to find dogs and we've got a dog that day and that's kind of what happened with this and so literally he calls me like later that afternoon he's like dude so weird I just talked to these guys and they mentioned on the call if you'd ever be interested blah blah and I was like ah well who are they I you know I've never heard of these guys and he's like no they're legit and I was like what he's like yeah I Googled him and whatever and like he's like one of them built like the largest I don't know how you describe it like the largest gold website yeah gold e-commerce precious metals e-commerce precious metal e-commerce site so basically JM Bullion is the name of it if you want to go buy sell gold silver whatever you can go do it there and I knew that name because my brother-in-law buys from Champions right so he's so he had been telling me you know as he's like stashing away little like coins in his safe and I'm like all right good for you man um screw up his orders yeah yeah he gets it every time and he's like you know whatever he's hoarding gold so you guys you built that that was a couple hundred million dollar company and then you had done the same thing in the sports betting side same thing like roughly 100 million dollars worth of exits and I was like oh these guys are actually super legit okay uh scratch the whole 19 year old kid offer him a dollar let's see what we can get these guys to offer us and then that's sort of how the deal uh evolve from there and so so that's like how we met then actually making a deal uh somebody said this the other day they go the rule of they call it the rule of five they go and any deal it's gonna follow what fall apart five times if it's gonna get if it's gonna get done it's gonna fall apart five times and I think we kind of did that though we did every three or four times at least um along the way I do have a question about it which is not just how it all happened but of course I've been wanted to ask and I get to put you guys on the spot here how could we have negotiated better so I asked Ben I go what can we ask these guys on the Pod he goes because you ask him about the deal negotiation I go yeah I should ask him could we have gotten more because that was the my first acquisition that was the question I asked uh the CEO and he was like you couldn't have got a dollar more and I was like that feels good but it feels like a lie it's never actually the case so from your guy's perspective how did we negotiate give us a grade and uh tell us how we did I would say it was uh A minus I was gonna say a b okay yeah I mean I mean I would give everyone almost a b around you know the table I feel like each one of us at one point kind of were like ah this isn't gonna work and it wasn't as kind of straightforward as you'd like a deal but as you said both my deals every time I was like it's not gonna work you know for one reason or another you get to the point of they're over here I'm over here and we're not getting anywhere close right and then you know you figure it out or you walk away and you know we had those walkaways uh with you I think twice yeah I think you guys did it one time and we did it another time yeah yeah I said a minus because at the end like when we made that final you know the last little chunk yeah we were that was it for us we just said we're walking if this doesn't work um we talked about this last night I think one thing that would have helped a lot so he has a non-compete on gambling as we talked about and you know one of the times it fell apart was we Scott's into the diligence after we'd already agreed on a number and there was found out I was a degenerator there's a little more gambling a gambling sponsor Revenue there than we thought and I think that if that had come out a lot earlier you guys probably could have guided us better to like hey well for next month we're going to Target this stuff yeah yeah we didn't know that was a problem because it's not in front we don't have a non-compete so yeah this is great um yeah that's all right that's that's good we did talk about it at dinner you did yeah we would have met you yeah yeah oh yeah yeah at that dinner yeah um all right so let's talk about you know how this deal kind of evolves why do you buy a business like this what's the what's the thinking what's the rationale and you guys have been on the seller side you've sold your businesses what's the difference in in the mentality there Mike you want to take this one yeah so you know reason we bought you guys we felt like everything we were doing was just gonna work a lot better on their brand and so like the SEO play which is our thing you know we're building these content driven sites that we want to rank in Google for you know money terms and crypto like buy Bitcoin blend Bitcoin all those sorts of things yeah we should explain your guys's magic your superpower your superpower is somebody goes to Google and they say Buy Gold Online the best place to buy gold best place to um you know bet you know on whatever and your guys's whole career basically is ranked number one for that and you did it with the sports betting and the gold but before that you did it with poker before that you did it with other stuff and like we'll go into some of those funny funny stories in a second um but that's your guys's secret sauce to which I was like why do they need a newsletter the newsletter doesn't do that that doesn't that's not the answer but there is some I don't know Synergy there for you yeah so it's you know just this brand component of like Google has really moved towards rewarding brands that users are actually going to be going searching for like milk road is being searched hundreds of times a day and that's such an indicator to Google of like humans are interested in this brand same with JM James getting thousands of searches a day for JM Bullion so like when we were building our sites like defy rate.com was the one that we merged into milk Road no one's out there really looking for this site you know we're just trying to figure out how to get it up in Google So eventually it will become a brand so for us it was like hey we get to jump forward you know a year in this journey if we buy this newsletter by the website roll it in and then you know reap these benefits forevermore you're going to continue to get really amazing backlinks because you do all these awesome interviews um it was you know that was my my piece and I think too it was really complimentary you know like the newsletter content could go on the website you know we'd be able to be in the inbox of of our users along with hey you know there's a different segment of our users that are going to go to our website and so you know those type of uh ways to you know Reach people are like really exciting for us and so that was kind of like all right they have the brand they have a voice and you know they have uh you know a really complementary uh you know and it was working during the bear Market yeah that's the biggest our business was still growing and generating revenue and profit during the crypto winter which is hard for because if you're not like you know what bitcoin's price goes down there's a lot less people searching how do I buy Bitcoin right now you know and so uh or like you know D5 implodes or whatever well then people aren't looking to borrow or land at the same rates uh so I think that also helps because there's like oh this is a business that will work even in the winters yeah and you had Diversified advertisers they're not all crypto companies so yeah we're like yeah this can work even if crypto's dead for a while and so the question on our side was do we want to sell right why sell do we want to sell and I think you know there's probably a three-pronged answer to that the answer is first uh a lot of decisions just get made through like who your nature your personality and I've gotten to know my nature a little bit over the last few years and it is very much a I'm good at starting things I'm good at finding the the something from nothing but taking the something and just fine-tuning it day after day making it better which is where most of the values created in business is uh not something that I just get super excited about and so that was always hard for me because I could create something get it off the ground get it to work and then as it worked my interest would fade and you know so that was like a personal thing I was I sort of knew that so I said if if I'm getting a good deal now but I know it'd be better if I held it for four years great but am I Really Gonna have this same energy I have today four years from now I can't know that that's true for me as a operator whereas about you guys and I'll go into why I thought you guys would be much better owners of the business was you're like that Mike is a absolute animal Workhorse I actually uh like we've been working together a little bit now and I see your level of detail attention to detail is crazy like you are looking at this email you know like in the morning in the afternoon in the evening then the feedback and then do it again the next day I love it I was like wow this guy is this guy's an animal um and I thought okay maybe he's just doing at the beginning no that's just kind of who you are yeah I mean that was you know with JM same thing like myself and the the other partner who I ran that with we were probably like the biggest readers of the gold and silver stuff Reddit like on the planet because we just wanted to ingest all this what are the people thinking you know and that's really we got so many wins just observing that implementing those things so I asked you guys some questions before the Pod to get to like uh I made a Google doc and I was like what do you do like I don't know for fun or something like that like are you like and you're one of your things was uphill skiing or something yeah I've got a buddy that's gotten into back country skiing so that's like instead of you know going to the resort riding the lift up you're just sort of in nature and you're fun nice thing everybody likes yeah yeah you have to you know manually get yourself up this hill so um a few years ago he convinced me to go do one of these things and it was in um I think we're in Yellowstone Park we didn't see another human the entire day you're truly in the middle are you hiking basically up a mountain for this this was fairly tame so basically it's a it's called a split board what I use so it's a it looks like a snowboard but it breaks down the middle and the bindings rotate so it basically turns into skis and then you put these things on the bottom called skins which originally I think used to be Seal's skin is is where it came from now it's just like some fancy Fabric and it'll only slide one way so you can kind of like slide up the hill with patches you're like cross country skiing up the hill and then it won't slide backwards right so yeah you like fight your way up the hill it takes several hours to do this it's like a five minute ride down so there's not a huge payoff there just like little children coming down as you're like brutally climbing yes and then the cool thing you can do it at Resorts too so our trip this year we were at um Whitefish Montana and I was doing this in the resort and you do get a lot of respect from people coming down the hill when you're like trudging up the hill so it's a good feeling yeah yeah no respect for me yeah you are doing the wrong thing someone's riding the lift up and down I don't even get off this is but that was like to me when I heard you say that I was like checks out completely the way you exercise or though like the way you vacation basically is the way you work which is just like Malik or grind and I love that because that's if I mean if you do that in any business you're gonna increase the outcomes and so because we still own like a good sized chunk of the business and so you know I wanted to know that that was going to be worth something someday and so that would be the only way that I could make this deal worth it was okay there's The Upfront cash and all that good stuff that's great but um your boy's gonna spend that I'm gonna blow through that through you know something so I need to know that like the what if what could have been will actually get played out and like that way all just my curiosity I'll know what would have happened if we had kept at it and focused on it well let me just hand it to these guys who are super focused and let's now we get to know uh and then also there's you know uh you get the reward of it too if it ends up working out yep so that was one on your side that's like that's my super problem like this guy is literally willing to climb up the hill like with this like you know like he doesn't understand how skiing works and enjoyment Works which is great yeah and then it's like all right so let's put this guy Kindle he's the same way he's also just like this absolutely not super grinder no Kendall's Mr shortcut and I love this so we were talking and I was like all right um what you guys do before this before this I kept digging tell the story of I don't know let's pick one of them let's do the uh the Tesla one the Tesla hack because when she told me this story I was like oh this guy's super clever he's gonna find a way like he's just gonna find the shortcuts that we would need to like you know make this thing super successful so tell that story yeah so I had a Tesla and at the time they had the Tesla referral program so basically they gave every owner a unique code and to get you know 5 000 supercharger miles you actually had to use it so people were searching for it and I was like perfect I you know that's what I do for a living I rank in Google so when you search Tesla referral code my site was number one I said what was it called like trustworld.com no it was actually Fair estimate.com okay I basically made like for just a fun side project uh a lift versus Uber comparison so you just put like I'm going here you know what's the difference between the two right and so I just made a slash Tesla on that and by the way that itself that was another one of your little shortcuts you didn't want to ever pay for Uber again right like or Lyft because you would just get referral credits from that too right exactly so basically on that site the way I monetized it was here's my referral code when you sign up for one or the other and uh literally had unlimited Uber and Lyft for years literal years and I shared it with some friends they'd be like hey you know I want some can you put my code for a little bit Yeah so I'd you know do it for a month for them and they'd be like I don't need it I am done and then it would just be like the next round the next friend that's hilarious but then you know what happens is like these programs are like okay this is kind of weird you know there's certain codes yeah exactly so they kind of cut you off after a while but until then you kind of can reap the benefits so you had to Uber lift shortcut which was getting you free Ubers and lifts then you were like oh Tesla so you made a slash Road or slash Tesla like extension basically and you you were ranking for when people were looking for Tesla exactly so I sent like hundreds of people to buy cars and you needed to send like I think 56 to get a Tesla Roadster uh was that like the peak prize that is the full program exactly but you know I'm still waiting Roadster is like what like 100 Grand or something it was 250. yeah oh yeah 200 or 250 depending on like the money they never gave it they never gave it to you well they haven't released it what do you think oh the New Roads new the newest yeah so they were like hey when we do it you know in 2019 you know we're gonna give everyone so how many everyone win I mean how much you earn so I earned like 1.75 I had sent more referrals but I think Tesla was like all right you know we're gonna give you 1.75 and then um what do you do with the 0.75 I understand I think you have to pay the you know the difference between them when they do um I'll take the convertible thank you and then um you know I did that and I was like all right well hey Dad you have a Tesla do you want a roadster sure son I want that and so I put his code and then did it with my brother-in-law so you know we have a lot of roadsters that might be coming we'll see it's like the Oprah thing yeah yeah that's amazing so you did so you did that you also did other ones too let's do some of the other ones you did uh I was asking you how did you even learned that there's like this like SEO affiliate game right so SEO is just people are searching for stuff on Google if you can get to the top you're gonna get a lot of free customer traffic um and then affiliate is well what do you do with that free customer traffic they want something you can pass that kind of qualified lead that that high intent customer to the website and they have affiliate programs so you'll get the kickback that's how you got the Roadster that's how you got the Uber credits and all that so how did you even figure out this was a thing uh I want to hear that for both you guys because this is this is y'all's game and it's a game I didn't know about until much later in life but you guys discovered it kind of early I want to hear the origin story how did you guys even get into that yeah so this was like during like the money maker you know World Series of Poker was a big thing and you know all of my friends and I were playing poker just around the house and then online you know there was a bunch of poker sites and I saw one of the poker sites had like a poker chip set and they would give it to you for free I was like well how does that work nothing in life is free and I figured oh they're giving it for free because they're getting like 250 dollars per person they end up sending so at that point I was like perfect I've got a lot of friends and I'm just going to kind of make the difference I'll give them 50 bucks to deposit and I'll make you know the 200 that I get paid from the uh you know casinos and sports books and poker at that point and so you do that with like six friends and ran out of them right you know it was like it was it was great and then it was like okay well now I need to actually figure out how to do this um and that's kind of how I got into like oh I need to figure out how to create websites I I can do this with just like random people and you're you're a teenager at this time I'm in college yeah you're a college okay yeah so I was in college Mike was actually a teenager at that time and uh you know just how to figure it out and I mean like my first big break was actually misspelling Paradise poker what do you mean so how did that go down yeah well so at the time when you searched in Google they didn't have autocorrect so basically you misspelled Paradise poker and you'd get misspelled websites with that and so I was like perfect I'm not a very good speller so I can come up with a lot of variations I couldn't tell you to spell paradise poker right now actually and so I came up with a lot of variations and you know got them to rank and Google for like every misspelling right and it was crazy because like all of a sudden I just started seeing traffic I started sending them obviously to the real Paradise poker I made a cut of them and literally my last year of college it was like paid for I was basically like parents like I've got this you know I've got room board you know education because I'm making free money basically online were they like well what do you mean did they know about this the whole time or not really I had to kind of like tell them they were like I was a little worried because I was like poker gambling you know they're gonna be like oh what's my son into is he doing this right but my dad was actually like he looked at me and he was like pretty proud because he was like oh you're kind of like you know the picks and shovels right of it right you're not actually doing it you're enabling people to do it and the people that choose to do it yeah and you you said you said something real quick like we got to the top of Google did you have to do anything interesting to get your misspelled Paradise poker to be the number one or was it just like that was your domain name so it automatically was going to be number one at that time well the beauty of it was there was just no competition no one else was actually trying to misspell Paradise poker on purpose maybe they would misspell it once but I would have it like eight times so I was the best misspeller of paradise poker and literally was number one for most of the kids and essentially the thing that's going on right now with the Kia car where the Kia rebranded their logo it looks like k n instead of Kia and Google search for KN car is like suddenly spiking because people see it on the road they're like oh that's cool what is that what is the KN car and I was like this feels like a Kindle thing and I was like Kendall what would you do with this what was your answer so I you know I had a buddy in Fleet Sales and like that's where they you know sell a ton of cars via online and I would make a deal with someone like that at the dealership I would say look I can get you a lot of traffic and so I would create websites that would literally you know go for all the newest cars right you know the 20 23 you know Kia whatever it was but obviously spell it with the KN right and then you know make a deal with them like I'm going to send you this you know I want 20 of all those leads and what is your what would your website look like at that time would it be like hey this is the KN car go ahead go buy her would you be like you know would you just make it look like the Kia website what would you actually do I think I would just you know explain it like hey you know it looks it says KN but it's actually Kia and you know here's the reasons why this car is really cool and here's a form to actually buy this car and I can get you a great deal on it right and then you know obviously send that lead over and you know everyone's happy at that point they actually find the car that they wanted you know it wasn't Kia but you know it was the KN car that they had found how much you think somebody could make if they they did this what's your range what's your estimate of how that would play out if you did a good job of executing that I think if you did a good job I mean the problem now is Google autocorrect so Google Now I even did the searches myself right it goes to the actual Kia like hey I know what you're trying to do right so you'd have to kind of find that like where does doesn't it do that is it the app store or is it some like other you know place to do that right and I think you could I mean when you get like a really good misspelling of really high priced items with a decent margin you know you could make hundreds of thousands of dollars that's awesome man you kind of had a similar origin story playing poker and then discovered the poker affiliate game yeah yeah so I was basically a degenerate Gambler when I was 15 or 16. um my friends and I would play you know poker in home games just five ten bucks whatever this is when poker was on TV all the time right like 2005 and I just kept losing all my money so I would have to go to you know the local grocery store to the Western Union or whatever give them the 100 bucks cash they would send it to you know Cambodia or wherever it was going um and then I would just lose that so I was like I need to find some other way to reload my my poker account because I'm busted not I need to stop no exactly where am I getting reloaded faster yeah so then I saw it that they had like the refer a friend thing on the website and they would pay you like 75 bucks or whatever to get your buddies to sign up so I had all my friends sign up same as you and when I ran out of friends I was like same as I am like I got to figure out a way to get strangers to do this for me and ended up coming across this uh Forum called I think it was called poker affiliate world back then it was basically a lot of people who were doing this that would share you know what was working what wasn't it was a very friendly community that I was kind of surprised like I don't know why people are telling me this but they're kind of competing right yeah we were all like we were competitors yeah and just ended up becoming friends as well um so just learned through doing that start a website uh my I convinced my parents to lend me like a couple hundred bucks to buy a domain and set up you know web hosting and everything and I I told you this or I put in that document that like when I've sold my first site which was probably nine or 12 months after that it was for thirty two hundred dollars which was like a billion dollars and I got all it was like a check I cashed it I took all the cash home and you know spread it out it's pretty good out of and then took the you know repaid my parents and that was like a a very sentimental moment for me that's amazing did you have something for your neighbor did something for you your neighbor like lent you some money or something like that um was it like a lemonade stand story or something like that well I like the first thing I did for work my one of my neighbors needed some like Landscaping work done and I will give you you know 20 bucks or whatever to come over and do it and it was on a Saturday and the night before I was you know out with the boys that I had a few sodas and uh I was a little hungover that morning and I made it to like 10 a.m before I had to tap out like I just can't do this right now that was that was the first and probably only job you had yeah I just had you know random stuff like that um did that I had it I lasted one day on a another neighbor had a a bread company so they would have to deliver the bread every morning to restaurants right and my dad was friends with him so he's like you know I'm sure trying to get me to do something yeah you need to go work with uh Mr anzavine for the day it was like a 4am wake up call to do that so it lasted one day at that as well it's like there's no way shoveled snow for one day neither of you really had any real jobs it sounded like you never had a real job so you never had like a corporate go and like you know here's your first day at the new company you didn't have that I did not I basically had like a summer job it was like a temp job agency that kind of places you different places and one of them was like Dell warranties and then I I realized then I was like I can't work for someone else like this is just not me uh you know I want to work for myself I want to set my own hours and I want to make a lot of money yeah like my mom always said like when you were younger all you said is like I want to be a millionaire I want to make a bunch of money and she was like all right sure you know let's see what happens but um you know that was just kind of my general sense of it and I was like I need to figure out a way to make it like to make it also says something like I don't like the idea of working working really hard and someone else making money off that exactly I'm gonna make the money off that I mean that's what you know like being an employee right like you're making the owner's money and I just like I couldn't get like around that I was like I need to be the owner of the business dude I find it hard sometimes to recruit people because I'm like I fundamentally don't want to do this trade of like I get some security and certainty and experience but you get the upside you know like you know I get my salary but you get the the upside of my my work I I almost find it sometimes hard to even recruit people to work at this point because I'm just like I don't know man I philosophically don't love this path but then I also need to hire employees all the time so I'm like you know it's not because it's not very productive you ever have that oh totally and I feel like actually it's been actually one of the most rewarding things of my company is like watching the people grow you know we would hire them and I'd say like all right I just need you to kind of you know write a couple pages of content and then they do a really good job it's like oh do you want to be an editor of this website right and then oh do you want to manage other people and so like you know the businesses I sold I made sure the people that I was working with got really great jobs because I feel like you know sure I made a lot of the money but I want to make sure that like your career is set and you are in the best position possible to really you know crush it or you know with what you're doing and what you do after your first sale you did a a retirement party yeah so I had this idea I was like okay you know what I did it I'm done and you were like 30 something 30 yeah it was like 33 I believe and you know I was telling all my friends like I'm gonna rent out a restaurant and you know we're just gonna like celebrate my retirement and you know it'll be great because you know I'm not going to be 65. I'll be like 33 and it'll be great so we rented out lazy bear in San Francisco and I had all my friends and my family and it was awesome we then had a party bus they didn't even really know about your business no I mean that was another thing for me I've always been you know not one to brag about it I feel like what I do is kind of just what I do and there's no reason to kind of be you know boastful about it yeah so for actually the first year after I sold the business I didn't tell anyone and and then after a year because I just wanted to live with it and I just wanted to kind of be comfortable with it myself before I then told other people um and so I had a three-year earn out so after the three years is when I did my retirement party and so you sat on that news for a long time I did yeah well yeah I sat on it for a year told people but then I had two years left with them once I was done with that I was like it's retirement time like I'm done let's do it so rented lazy bear rented a bar had a party bus and it was awesome but then literally like three times were you at this party you were supposed to come why did I not come you had some some excuse I think I was hungover again yeah this guy's almost hung over I don't know what he's talking about I can't remember why I didn't come but I do remember that when he did sell that one I had left the gambling space so I I knew he was doing well but I didn't know like what was really going on and he was in Dallas for something I can't remember what and I went over to their hotel room and him and his wife Tess had a ball of champagne they're like we're gonna open this celebrate the sale whatever I was like oh you know congrats that's awesome man and then I went home Google looked it up and I was like oh and I text him I was like all right I really mean it because that's now like well we can it's in the news right like that one sold for I think 45 million it was actually 50 million total but I kind of sold it twice to the company yeah which was kind of a weird explain that how does that work so first time you sold it for what so first time I sold it for like 15 million plus you know a bunch of equity and what happened was like at that time New Jersey was big and that was like the first legal state that had you know casino and poker so we focused on that we did really well let me explain because I think people won't know the context here so you go from online poker then online poker collapses and now that whole affiliate game is kind of dead because you us just shut down online poker what most people did was they went offshore or International because it was still illegal in certain places or in certain ways that's where most people went and you did something different like that was the obvious Market you went for kind of a non-obvious pivot which was in the whole United States one state was going to legalize I don't know if all gambling or sports betting which one they basically at that point didn't have sports betting but it was a poker it was casino and casinos are like the big players so that's kind of the one that was really exciting so gambling was was legal in New Jersey and only New Jersey and I remember at that time it was like well how do you build a business around one state that's it just like it didn't sound big and I don't think it sounded big to most people so most people didn't do that right you kind of like found the the hack that nobody else was really competing for this like uh what was that what would be the search term people were looking for that you wanted to rank New Jersey online casino was that was like the big one and you're right like all of my competitors were like perfect you know like we still have 49 other states and The Regulators at that time set if you choose to promote in New Jersey you cannot do anything else they didn't want you know the the offshore plus the legal regulated market and I was like that's perfect I want to be you know a big fish in a small pond so I started that business it was going well but there was one competitor Chris Grove and he was really good at content and he had like you know his game figured out I was much more into the kind of Revenue side of the business and so I talked and you know we both talked for a while and we're like you know this is what I'm doing this is what I what I'm doing and like we were like we're the only people in this market if we combine we basically own this market right and so it was an easy decision then you have pricing power exactly because otherwise if you're an affiliate and the company says Ah instead of giving you 200 they'll give you 20 you're just like well you're my Revenue stream and you just changed the price on me that's not great I think that's one of the problems most people in the affiliate game fall into is you're you're at the whim of your affiliate Partners but if you become kind of like almost more important you're like I'm the only acquisition source for customers so this price is the one I'm comfortable at exactly and it was crazy because you know we were able to get a thousand dollars per player that we sent uh through New Jersey online casinos wow and uh so yeah it worked out really well for us literally the first month we partnered together we both made way more money than we did apart and you know within two years containing media the company that purchased us uh you know came knocking we're like we have to buy you because we've heard at conferences we've heard from you know people in the industry that you guys are the biggest and we want to own the biggest right so they buy it once so they buy it once and at that point it was just New Jersey and what I told them I was like We're Not Gonna sell like why would we sell we've we have 49 other states that eventually will legalize and so I came up with the idea that all right we'll sell you New Jersey and any future state will get 50 of so we'll be kind of 50 50 partners for every stay right and they said sure they didn't really care at that point I think they were just more focused on New Jersey and being the biggest affiliate in the U.S market right um so it was great we started running it you know I had a three year and as I mentioned the first year was good and that's when sports betting actually got legalized and then the business you know started booming in terms of you know New Jersey had it but then a lot of other states were really excited about offering it so they're you know to the people in their state so they um started legalizing and all of a sudden basically we had like 10 states coming online and the company was like whoa we cannot give you 50 of this this is just too much liability and so we're like okay yeah no problem we you know here we just need a big chat right and they did and they were like we have to we have to come up with a situation that you know works for us and works for you and so you know it was part stock and part cash so in total is around 50 million yeah that's amazing and that company is public listed right yeah I mean they're publicly listed uh in the Swedish Stock Exchange Swedish Stock Exchange nice um did you go ring like the bell and Sweden like I I wish that would have been and so so that's kind of like your kind of like the big win story let's do Mike's big win story so how does one go from I'm gambling and losing money in poker I get my friends to sign up for a referral program to I own this company that does like I don't know multiple billions of gold sales every year right so it's like how does that happen where does that come from Yeah so basically I was in the gambling industry like he was and when the [ __ ] hit the fan I sold so I made like the wrong call where that was like the 3200 no so this was this was later on I still I was further into it I sold for 565 000. and I was I think 19 then so to sell a business five or six five thousand what was it doing at the time like it must have been doing a lot but the future was too uncertain it was doing like 30 to 40K a month but it just I didn't know what was gonna happen for that so I sold that and then you know I'm on top of the world yeah oh my God you're how old you're like I'm 19 at this point drop out of college yeah I mean I'm going for it guys I figured it out figured out life yeah so I'm like all right I can do this affiliate thing in any space so I try a bunch of different plays I did it in the dating space I tried to do it like selling business cards online that was a complete failure and just really like was this where the spirit of ice thing happened uh that was around that time yeah right so um when I you know around that age when I was out that was at Penn State I was having some fun uh and there was this trend that was like icing people so like smearing off ice right if you first yeah you present it to someone they had to get on her knee and chug it so like guys I knew at college and high school they were into this by the way most genius marketing campaign ever yeah it was so someone needs to just redo that enough time has passed just replay that same thing yeah do a milk milk chug back a gallon of milk um so I there was a website called brosicingbros.com where people would send in like their best pictures of this happening so they're all these creative ones like there was one I remember where a guy was super hungover in the morning and went and opened his toilet and they'd put plastic over the toilet there's a Smirnoff Ice sitting there yeah 7am so me and my buddies would send these pictures back and forth like we thought it was funny and then I just somehow ended up reaching out to the guy that ran it I was like I think this is cool you know any interest in selling it or you know do anything with it it ended up working on a deal to buy it and I gave him 25 000 for it there was no monetization at all it was just like I think this is cool it has a lot of traffic I can figure something out here and I'm really excited I tell my buddies like yo I just bought that site right I was like congrats yeah they're like we want to get our pictures up whatever and um the neck literally the next day I got an email from Spirit offices we were infringing their you know trademarks or whatever and like you have to take all the pictures off the site and the the point of the site was the pictures not the pictures so basically just shut that down after 24 hours and just yeah wrote it off didn't you try to blur it weren't you saying you were going to blur it the I talked to the prior owner because I told him I was I was just like you know any ideas and he's like well you could try boring him out or whatever and it doesn't seem a little coincidental yeah did this guy make a phone call no wonder but it's a nice loss for me nice learning okay so you're the World's trying to Humble you are you getting humbled or not really you're just like this very Teflon very successfully humbling okay yeah it was it was kind of like a two-year period where it just I went from everything worked really well so like nothing was working at all and especially having uh you know I had left school and my parents very much were against that decision so it was it was a dark time for me like you know is this gonna work is it not am I going to get egg on my face have to go back to college whatever um so one of the guys I knew from the poker affiliate world he was doing some affiliate websites in the the gold and silver space and there was this company that had just spun up an affiliate program and a Jeremy Yankee a guy we know was managing it for him so he's like like you guys should look at this whatever so I decided to invest in this guy's business his name was Jonathan and I was just going to help him like build these sites let's see if we can turn it into something and over like maybe six or nine months we build up some traffic it was making like five grand a month you know it was it was a side thing for me I was trying to do other stuff and um kind of out of nowhere the company we were sending everybody to just killed their whole affiliate program so we went from making you know 5K a month to just zero you know this looked like another just completely flown got iced again yeah Mike gets iced yeah um and then my partner like credit to him I was I was again was being just like well there's nothing to really do here there's no other affiliate programs um we had actually gone to that company that cut us off and and offered to sell them the website like you know this thing was sending you I don't know 200 buyers a month or whatever it was you know just kind of backing into what you're paying us on an affiliate basis just give us 40 grand for it and we'll you know you can have lead gen for a long time and they just never replied to us so we you know we had no path to monetizing it so I was yeah I was writing it off and then my partner is like we should just sell this stuff ourselves and that sounded like you can imagine how much of a nightmare that sounds insane if you're an affiliate because you never talk to customers you don't like there's no employees really like it's a very simple business there's no product yeah it's it's you're kind of a middleman yeah you're like in between people and the product yeah so I I was like this is crazy I don't want to do any of this but he's like I'll do all those like gasps in the Affiliates real business exactly yeah so beautiful products there so he's like I'll I'll do all the inventory shipping customer phone calls all that stuff I'll do it all like you just help with get traffic and put some more money in yeah so I was like all right let's give this a try and so yeah I mean credit to him it wouldn't happen if he hadn't pushed so hard this is uh this is Andrea so this is somebody this is Jonathan so that was the JM was Jonathan and Mike okay and Kind of a Funny Story sounds very Regal and official like great story Jonathan and Mike's gold shop versus JM bullying like that's a so step up we knew so little about this space when we started that we named it J.M boy and using our initials and we had no idea that like one of the largest refiners of gold and silver in the world is Johnson Matthey and so we actually got a big boost early on because people thought we were there retail art like it was a nice little accidental win and we didn't get any cease and desist so that's nice um so yeah we spin this thing up uh it went live I think October of 2011 and the the idea was we're just going to point all our old traffic at the new e-commerce site jmboyan.com and it was it was crickets the first few weeks like zero or I don't think we got an order for three weeks and I honestly think that was like my mom's friend who like told him to go do it or something um but you don't give up at that point I didn't give up and you know just kept trying to figure stuff out how can we make this work what's that conversation like you're three four weeks in you go to the office like does anybody say anything like hey guys uh yeah well there was no office so that was easy it was my partner had all this success yeah no office my partner had all the gold in this little dust Jordan his basement it could all fit in like the tiny little okay so you're in the basement you're like yeah no gold is leaving the drawer right now staying in the drawer um it was so early that it I wasn't really worried at that point you know you like what we're doing right now it's early you know you're you know it takes years to build these things um but we they're kind of a funny story on this we eventually out of nowhere start getting like big orders and we didn't change anything so we're very confused as to what's going on here big credit card orders uh repeat customers over and over and over we're like all right we've we've hit it like this is gonna work and so for like two months this goes on we're getting like 100 200k Revenue a month or no I'm sorry it wasn't that much it was probably 30 or 50 Grand and literally on Christmas morning my partner texts me he's like kind of weird have you seen the the checking account it's like no I go and pull it up on my phone like Christmas morning with my family around yeah both the checking account were like negative forty thousand dollars all of it was fraud every single order was like credit card chargeback fraud we just didn't know anything about any of this stuff so we had so many of those moments along the way where it was really just two kids you know figuring out how to run a gold business and there were a lot of pitfalls that we fell into and fortunately didn't kill us so all right so you recover from that yeah so I had to put more money in I was pretty much on the ropes at this point right it was it was like everything that was going in now this was this was it this was gonna work or you're stressing I'm stressing at this point yeah and this is where you start uphill skiing in general yeah so the really the turning point for that company was I just took a really honest look in the mirror and I said here's JM here's like the five biggest companies like if I look at these various you know metrics or whatever you hug us their website how's their pricing product selection how fast do they ship customer service whatever and I just basically like did a little scorecard for everybody and I was like there's no reason anyone would ever buy from us we're just worse at everything we have less selection we didn't even we were so small we couldn't get a wholesale account right so we were just buying from the cheapest retailer and marking it up um you know me and Jonathan were answering the cell phone that was our cell phones were the 800 number you know if we were available we'd answer it was just again like why would someone buy from us so what I landed on I was like the only lever we can really pull here is we're just going to undercut everyone because this is a commodity and it's like buying gasoline if there's a if there's a store here in a store there and that one's a penny cheaper you're going to pull in there so I'm like let's just cut it and see what happens because if we can get volume and you know make that work and see the Top Line grow I know we're going to be able to figure out margin as we as we go you know you're going to get economies of scale um so we did that and that did work and then we started to see the revenue really grow so through 2012 we were starting to do like you know a million plus a month in sales which back then we were really pumped about and the problem with this company was it was super Capital intensive because you had to stay ahead of the inventory right so like if you were going to be able to ship fast it had to be you know in the drawer when they order so I I did another round I put I think my last 100K in basically and then we outgrew that and I was like we need someone no bank's gonna give us any money we put a deck together and send it to like 60 different you know uh Angels or VCS and just zero responses absolutely not even like a no thank you um so I was thinking like who could I get to invest in this thing and I uh called him and so he was our first angel investor you knew him personally at the time yeah so because we were competitors in the in the space and we went to all the conferences together and we were both around the same age and you know just like to you know go out have dinners and stuff at conferences um so we were friends and he had told me after I sold my gambling business he's like you know whatever you do next let me know I would like to invest so I was like you get the call I was like hey yeah I gotta cash that in now what happens you get the call what's your did you even know he was doing this in the meantime I did you know I got it I was excited about being able to be a part of it but I was like I don't want to be operational like you know for me I was just like I'm trying to do this gambling business us you know and but I'm excited about Mike you know Mike made really good websites and I was like if anyone's gonna figure it out it's going to be Mike and so basically I invested in him and um you know it was I I feel like we had a quick negotiation it was like 24 hours yeah you did a great deal and he had all the leverage it was like we were either gonna go under or he was going to write this check so it's always like so you got an A plus for that yeah and it was like just speed it was affiliate you know we always call like affiliate speed where it was just like we had kind of had a handshake agreement and then I just wired in the money like we probably didn't do anything yeah yeah but it was like I trust you you put in what like a couple hundred K or I think 100 it was it was a hundred and then you this was another a plus move he negotiated like another Rider of like I get to do another 50 at this same valuation at my option which he then did a few months later as we were growing okay so you put it 150k yeah that ended up being a good return for you like what's the multiple on that I think it was at what 20 million you got like 23 million yeah you that's what you've met it out yeah I'm not sure about the valuation no because like in Silicon Valley it's like oh you invested a seed thing oh is that a 20 million valuation no no you're saying it was maybe a million bucks we said it was worth a million no maybe 700k or something was evaluation and yeah I sold it for 175. so you got amazing return there he turned up 100K ish into 20 million thanks Mike yeah yeah I mean do you uh you know we can do another business together right I'll actually help this time yeah there you go that was good our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better so you okay so you do that that's amazing you get the phone call you do that you get this more money but it seems like you're just gonna have this problem again and we did like three months later so we get his last you know 50 or whatever it was and then we were really this it was starting to grow pretty quick at that point we were up to probably 4 million a month in revenue and it was starting to hockey stick so I was like you know what are you doing to get so much traffic it's SEO basically yeah so that's when the SEO really started to kick in so initially it was like we're gonna we're gonna price cheaper we're gonna make this appealing to people and then people start you know we get the return customers get the backlinks going the site what do you call this exercise you did where you're like I took an honest look in the mirror and I said it's kind of like why would it yeah I want to date a 10 why would a 10 date that's exactly that right that's basically what you were saying it's like they have all these websites they can choose from why would they be choosing us should more companies do that I feel like most companies don't actually do that exercise because it can be painful because the answer often isn't what you want it to be right the mirror doesn't look that way it's not that the world is wrong and dumb so that's you know something I've tried to use over my career and it's been helpful that's amazing um yeah I think more people should do that exercise and and also when you do that I think it uh it forces Clarity where are we going to be great you know we're what are we going to be great on and you decided we're gonna be great on price first and then we're going to be great on these other things later okay so you do that grows grows grows you do this for eight years you sell Hallelujah um so that's kind of like your your big wins I want to know give me some stories along the way on either of the big wins maybe a story of uh you know something that you look fondly at in the early days of like you know one of those like wins along the way that felt really good and then maybe a moment that felt bad I don't know if you have any stories on either one of those I'd love to hear them yeah um this was kind of a mix of good and bad but so that first year I think it was before you were in we had gotten an order from a guy it was for like twenty thousand dollars which was a big order for us back then and he pays us we ship it you know it's delivered everything's fine we go on our way and then we hear from him like a week later that you know I was out of town There's No Gold here you know I don't know what happened here and again we were so naive we didn't even have like shipping Insurance back then so this there was just nothing there um so we dug in pretty firm we're like you know UPS has the GPS coordinates on your doorstep you know the driver has signed an affidavit that he delivered it there you know all this stuff but this guy just kept digging in harder and he he did this like there's a site called ripoffreport.com okay anyone can go on there and file like hey this per company or person screwed me and he did that and we were so early that like there were no jam boy in reviews anywhere so when people searched that that was the number one thing that came up and it immediately hit us like probably 30 percent of our sales just fell off because everyone in the gold space everyone checks right like they're always worried about getting you know yeah so it was really hurting us and this guy then went into like this kind of sob story of you know that was my kids college fund my kid's not going to be able to go to college you're going to ruin his life unless you make this right whatever and I was really starting to stress about this you know that's not a good feeling and I don't know this person but you wouldn't want anyone to feel like that so as this draws on and we're not finding a conclusion UPS basically is like we delivered it you know we're washing our hands of this thing um I had caved in and I was like I'm gonna personally write this guy check for 20. and that would have been like the end of my checking account right there and because I couldn't even sleep at night I was feeling so much guilt about this and so I had I drafted the email that I was going to send to him and I was like I'm gonna sleep on this one more night just to be sure and that morning I woke up and UPS had gone with the police to his house and as soon as the police were there he found it in his closet so that one had a you know a happy ending thankfully but uh that was another warning moment for us of like okay well obviously we need to figure out the delivery and insurance business painful painful Lessons Learned but you got to do it so I think uh one would be uh base boom and face the or facebook.com wait what okay so what are these so at the time originally it was the facebook.com that was you know Facebook's domain name and you know I was in college so I was part of it and eventually they dropped the and I knew like right away I was like I'm in a domain squat on things that they're gonna type wrong you know Paradise poker you know same thing but I'm gonna do it for Facebook so I got the K is by the m so that's why I registered Facebook like on the keyboard oh you're a man ifest we'll forget so they you know they you know end up putting the com and then.com again and the crazy thing about it was I got to see basically Facebook's like growth crazy hockey stick by the way I just went to facebook.com you know where it goes I have no idea Facebook it goes to Facebook now they also figured this out yeah so that they might have figured out one way but at the time I actually ended up selling facebook.com for like 20K you know someone came and was like hey there's a lot of traffic coming here you know at that time you'd have just like you know PPC type ads just like really basic text link ads and you'd make like you know 10 cents per click but there was enough traffic where it made it worthwhile um so I sold it to them and I was like sweet I still have you know facebook.com I'm excited to sell this one but little did I know like a big old packet of papers comes from Facebook and they're like hey that's our trademark right do you want to fight this or do you want to hand it over and it was a very easy choice to give them the domain name so at least I got to sell one of them that's pretty good did you uh you got to tell the I switch story what was that one well I almost went blind or at least I thought I was I thought this was gonna be a misspelling like not twitch.com I twitched it so like on my first company you know the regulator said as I mentioned you can't do offshore if you're gonna do regulated you have to do regulated and one of my competitors I think told on me and said I think Kendall's joined both and so I was like okay and so I didn't know any of this and I was at an industry conference and one of The Regulators was like hey I'd like to meet you for coffee I was like all right is this something I should be worried about right he's like no no no just just come it's like when Chris Hansen's like pizza's inside come on in you don't go for the pizza so I just thought you know I walk up there we sit down and I think this is going to be a really friendly conversation and he's like so we can do this the hard way or the easy way and uh like at that time I'm like stunned I'm just kind of like oh no do I run and so then he's like you know what you know we've had reports that we think you're doing the offshore and you know what are you gonna say about this and at that time I was like I'm not gonna say anything you know I'm not gonna incriminate myself but I but it was wrong you know all like these Pages were basically um algorithmically updated with these offshore ads that I had no control over right but he didn't know that because he wasn't really familiar with domain parking Pages Etc but at that time I was like I need to talk to my lawyer yeah and then we can talk to you and you have a lawyer figure it out I did not happen to tell me that I need to say these words exactly so then I mean that was a you know terrible feeling but I was like okay you know what I'm gonna talk to a lawyer we'll be able to kind of outline you know why you know what he thinks is not actually happening um but then I get a email from them and they're like we need you to come to New Jersey and I was like oh no they want to arrest me they want to get me in their jurisdiction and they are going to arrest me um and at that time I was like I was like talking to my wife Tess like there's something wrong with my eye and she's like oh you know it'll be fine and I was like yeah I think it'll be fine but I'm like kind of seeing a little specks and it like got worse and worse and at one point I was like I can't read a menu um and I went to it then so I went to a specialist an eye specialist and he thought I had a detached retina and he was like oh my gosh we got to get you into surgery and all these other things and then so then he kind of looked a little harder and was like no no actually have you been stressed lately very stressed very very stressed and he's like yeah you know we've seen this you know it's just a common thing you're just stressed you'll be fine so to end the story I had to go to New Jersey talk to the regulators and I wanted to bring a lawyer and they're like nope don't bring it just sued them for the twitch yeah exactly if you Blinded Me with Your hard way easy way [ __ ] at the coffee shop and they're like do not bring a lawyer because we'll make it hard on you I was like oh my god oh they told you that yes they told me that so man I wouldn't know what to do yeah I wouldn't know okay am I are they just is this a play is this a good cop back up type are they pushing me around or is this real yeah I had no idea but I was just like all right no lawyer like I mean I'm gonna listen to them this time but which is funny because the first time they you know hey everything's all right and just come see us and I sit there I'm at the office I'm looking around I'm like okay I've been arrested yet which is good they sit down and they're like okay well talk to us about you know being an affiliate and then it was like this super cordial conversation and I ended up saying like Okay yeah these few things weren't what they seemed and here's why and then they're like okay you know that's fine but you know we just want to learn more about Affiliates because they were like you know the first Regulators in the United States and they had never really talked to a large affiliate and because you know we were the only one at that point right so then they just kind of wanted to you know do a fact-finding mission and it all worked out I didn't go blind and you know I'm here today so I feel like you're either been blinded in jail and you ended up not blinding out in jail did you like pack a jail bag I did not but my wife was in a hotel and I was just like okay well you know we have enough clothes if we need that is amazing you guys are also kind of like life hack life experimenters I feel like you got just like you like finding the clever angles in business I feel like you do that with with life of like you don't just do things exactly the way others do then you're like well why don't I just do this you know instead uh and you've done this yeah I feel like you do the same thing with certain you know like I don't know lifestyle experiments so tell us about some of those what are some things that you guys do with your day-to-day life that is maybe just not standard not not exactly what anybody else is doing because I think for people listening they and myself included I love hearing when people don't just like follow a you know a very standard Playbook because it makes me wonder oh what's the thought process behind that why do they do that and nine times out of ten I don't do it myself but I like hearing those do you guys have any uh kind of like interesting lifestyle choices or experiments that you do I think the first one for me was you know I was having twins and I was telling my wife like look we're having twins this is insane she's like yo I know yeah she's like they're in I have to do the brush actually I'm having twins and I was like we need to get some help like we need experts and so what I did was you know I talked to an agency and I just kind of you know cast my net wide and far and I was like I want to find someone that can help us race these kids so you took this seriously like on your to-do list was like I'm going to do a search I told an expert you're doing the hard part I'll do the easy part and just try to find someone that has done this before that can really help us along the way and really like kind of make our lives easier and I found this twin expert she actually lived in New Jersey and we ended up hiring her for four months for the baby's first four months and she basically worked with them like night and day 18 hours a day with them and you know part of it was training us you know with like a dog you know they're like oh you know you don't train the dog you train the person and it was kind of the same with us and really she put them on like an insane schedule where if one was sleeping the others one was sleeping if one was eating the other one was eating and now they're like super trained so after four months they slept through the night and you know they were just like very schedule oriented we'd like look at the time it's like two o'clock okay they need to eat right now and they were like ready for they were both just just totally ready to sleep at the same time at the exact same time like always so they really kind of synced up and that Lit made life so much easier because I couldn't imagine right then it's like yeah yeah exactly we basically have like one kid that ends up being too that's amazing what about you yeah I mean I followed him on some of this stuff so he after he sold he um one of the splurges was he hired a chef so I cooked for him and when I heard that I was like oh that sounds really like bougie I don't know I don't know yeah that sounds cool I don't know and then um he was homie about it and I was like yeah this makes a lot of sense like why would I can eat healthier you know I don't have to think about it I don't have to think about what I'm gonna eat Etc um so I ended up finding somebody as well and then I've come out to see him a few times the last few months and when we'll be eating I can like see him looking at me because he's so competitive I know he wants to know like is this better than what I'm eating at home ah sadly the answer is yes but you're never given that satisfaction that's just that finally messed up messed up yeah that's amazing yeah you uh you're a foodie and you so for you it's like all your food that makes sense but actually you're more of like an efficiency guy and so you know people don't really realize how much mental and physical energy goes into feeding yourself three times a day or feeding in my case kids also and so we have a chef as well and it's the same same thing it's like all right if I just don't have to make decisions and I eat healthier and it tastes better because I'm not good at cooking this person's great at cooking I was like any money I could spend on a car a nice nice whatever um I would way rather do this I would rather have one less employee at work and do more myself than than like sacrifice on this for sure yeah and it's like I think we've both gotten a lot better at you know if you have a problem you can think about how can I fix this problem like how can I solve the problem tactically or whatever or you can just think about who can fix this for me and and that path is you know he's so much more efficiency for you you can focus on your superpower and you know it's obviously been what we've done and you guys you guys are different and uh for most people who come on the show and also most people I hang out with because I'm you know we're here in San Francisco it's mostly Tech Silicon Valley and Tech is not like like here's like we build websites but anybody who works in Tech here would be like what do you mean you're like you're making a WordPress site with a referral link what do you that's not like software uh you know it's not a software startup in the same same vein that most people consider um and you guys also don't go raise money from Venture capitalists you don't like you don't do a lot of the [ __ ] that like Silicon Valley companies do what do you guys see as like what do you like about that they're like oh maybe I should start doing some of that and what parts are you like no my way is different but I think it's better for these reasons do you guys have any opinions on that yeah for sure um so I like I grew up in Buffalo New York and I just was never exposed to any of that stuff so I didn't know what I didn't know so I was just trying to figure out how can I do what I'm trying to do um actually meeting you and spending more time out here has opened my eyes a lot to that side of the world I think you know for us the benefits of finding it ourselves are you know obvious we control it there's there's no one else that's asking us you know do this or do that or where's this Revenue Target Etc so we can think really long term about the business and I love that you know we're the decision makers and we move fast so it's like once decision needs to be made it's like hey what do you think here's what I think all right let's go um I think one thing you probably lose though is it's in my opinion it's harder to have like the really big outcome if like the things we're doing or historically have done it it's hard to be like a 10 billion dollar company from that stuff and I think going the other path you know it's still very very rare but it does happen right you don't hear a lot about they just self-funded this the whole way and then iPod it for 100 billion dollars right that doesn't really happen so and I think two you lose time like for us it was always like we always wanted to operate the business efficiently and profitably so things would take time and you you'd watch another competitor you know raise a bunch of money and do some really exciting things and you're like that's really cool that's not me at this point but I can see the merits of it but I think for me I've always been like I'm just again a control freak and I was like I don't want to work for someone else and I think with VC it's kind of the same thing right like that is part of it and you know with this acquisition I feel like you're on our team like you know it's I don't feel like it's kind of you know you're going to be on the board and we're going to be able to make really big decisions together rather than hey I invested in you I just you know are we 10 times yet you know like that type of thing yeah yeah totally and what about um you know I guess like business philosophies so I've heard as we've been talking some like some of your guys is like isms it's like oh these are kendalisms these are mychisms of like but I've only worked with you for a very short amount of time so I don't know a lot of them yet but I'm sure you have them right nobody goes through years and years of building businesses without coming up with some operating philosophy of like you know here's how it'll work here's how to negotiate here's how to build here's how to like stay the course or whatever do you guys have any that stand out to you as like you know these are my like these are kind of my pillar ones this is like I just really believe this and I can kind of tell a story that maybe goes along with that one and it's a bit of a hard question but I find these if you do have an answer I find this to be a really valuable one yeah I mean for me I feel like you're gonna be right a couple times in your life and if you think you're gonna be right swing big um you know for example with domain or with um Bitcoin I you know I saw it I was super interested in it I was like this could be really cool or well you could time frame are we talking this is 2013. okay you know this could be really cool or it could go to zero but I have this like inclination that it could be you know way bigger and I think it has a chance too and it kind of brings me back to my dad and this is in the 90s he was a computer programmer and he was like telling our family like domain names are going to be big and I was like oh that's cool dad yeah you know and he was like no they're going to be big every person or company are likely going to want one and he bought our last name seville.com but didn't really buy anything else at that point right he could have bought I looked it up like poker.com he was right but didn't swing hard exactly and so when I was looking at Bitcoin I was like this is my you know domain names um so I just started buying Bitcoin and I was like I am just gonna like you know hold it and just see what happens what you know no matter what I don't want that you know I wish I didn't sell right so I'm still holding it today and you you you're a bit bigger at that time um all right I shouldn't say you bet big because you don't often have to put 100 of your chips on on it because it's like this is one that it can go big so I don't even need to put you know my entire stack in it I just need to put enough or if this works it means something yeah right like yeah no I I mean I really didn't I probably put a couple hundred thousand dollars in at that point yeah but I was like you know I'll just wait it out at that point I think it was around 80 to 90 dollars per Bitcoin and then now you've seen ups and downs and ups and downs along the way did you feel tempted to sell or to you know like get out exit either either because I got a bunch of profit or oh man bad news bad news bad news bad news bitcoin's crashing maybe I should just get out not really I feel like you know it was always like oh there's gonna be a huge tax set and you know so when it was really high you know that's what I feel like and then as it's low I'm like it could still you know I still think it's got a long ways to go right so I for me I'm just like this is a long hold and uh you know we'll see when that changes but I mean that's why we started this company you know we're really excited about crypto and we think there's a big future here so at this point I'm just gonna you know I might die with it I remember when um so I discovered about the same time 2013 2014 and um I won't tell you the whole story but like let's just fast forward a little bit so I buy a little bit of Bitcoin I'm like all right great I'm in the game baby and um there was a run where Bitcoin went to I was buying it like 400 400 was like my average Buy price and then Bitcoin runs up to uh 3 000 at the time and I go to a wedding and I go to my cousin's wedding and my aunt so imagine like an Indian Auntie like you know she's just like not who you not somebody who I would think would say the word like Bitcoin or ethereum she said the word ethereum actually so I was like what the hell um and she was like oh yeah bitcoin's very good and I was like oh why do you why do you say that and I was like immediately my face just dropped because I was like there's no way that she is like the one who's on the trend and she's like yeah it's very good and I was like what and yeah it goes up and I was like that's the whole thinking like she's like yeah last month it was this now it's this and before that it was even lower it was like oh my God this is like a bubble and I was like I had read about this bubble [ __ ] like because I graduated 2010 so I missed the whole.com bubble by a long shot I missed 2008 crisis I was a sophomore in college I didn't care what was going on in the world and so I was like I think this is one of those bubble things and I was like you know what maybe I should take some profits and so I go and I try to sell everything on coinbase but coinbase thank God how much you could sell at a time and so I like maxed out the limit for one week and I think I did it for another week and I was like I'm getting exhausted like by the end of like the fear had like dissipated or whatever and the Bitcoin runs up to 20K and I'm like you know I'm like oh my God I'm the biggest city and then it crashed it back down I was like wow I have to really have a bit more of a of a plan as to what I'm gonna do with this am I able to hold this forever am I going to hold it to a certain point what is driving my belief in this so that I'm not just at the whim of like oh I hear something and I it scares me the taxi driver told me something and it made me bullish or bearish or whatever on it um we're at a point right now where probably sentiment about crypto is like I don't know at the lowest it's been and maybe ever but definitely uh Lowe's has been a while and for a lot of people they don't they weren't around for the 14 crash or whatever this 18 crash it was like this is their crash where they're like oh crypto turned out to all be a scam I guess FTX is a I don't know what was wrong with all this so that's kind of where people are at um what gives you what is your belief based on for crypto like why do you think this is going to be a thing I feel like digital money needs to be a thing like we were literally trying to wire money into this company and it wouldn't work and it was just like what you know like what do you mean it wouldn't work what was happening well it was Mike had the real issue but it took you a week so we we both use the same exact Bank we're with City yeah and um same exact wiring instructions this is just a PDF we both send them to our you know people there said I want to wire whatever it was into the company the next day I get the notice from Mercury his hits and I sent mine like four hours before his and I the whole day I never saw mine come in so I'm like that's weird they had called me you know I did yeah I answered all the questions I had to do the DocuSign like text you know to auth all this stuff where it never goes so I finally have to reach out to them again and I'm like what's going on with this and they come back to me and say the wire instructions are wrong and I'm like well the same bank with the same PDF said I sent the money so that was an example where like on crypto that would have been a 10 second you know transaction so I I agree with him you know I'm probably even more into the you know don't love the government control over all of the fiat currency stuff I think we're seeing you know we're starting to see and we're probably going to see more of the ramifications of that with you know debt inflation those sort of things and you know having another option I think is nice right yeah so in the same way like uh government makes all the rules of where you live great but if you don't like the way that the government makes those rules you have a choice you can move to a different jurisdiction you can operate by different rules uh if you don't like the way that the government manages the money system by printing more money or whatever it may be then you could opt into a different monetary system that's not controlled by the government that's controlled by you know a set of source code and the code you know lives and runs on its own and anybody from anywhere in the world can say you know what I don't like my country's monetary system as my base system I'm going to opt into this one that makes a lot of sense to me why do you think people have like such a like what do you think or maybe let's not put this put it this way what do you think are the fair criticism so um if you heard of the phrase steel Manning but like you know it's like when you argue the other side in good faith you say here's the here's the best argument I could see against it what would that be for for crypto I think like a big one is there are a lot of scammers in the industry and you know they're able to do that because they don't have a lot of the checks and balances of the current system and I think there's a lot of good reasons why that's the case in crypto but also it allows these people to do these kind of Nefarious things um you know I was telling people recently I was like you know what crypto does look really bad like there's no you know you can't really argue that fast right but cryptos look really bad you know a lot of times but then at other times it looks really good you know there are by the way it wasn't Bitcoin that did something bad right yeah exactly you have to sort of separate the two right like um if somebody runs a real estate scheme and scams their investors and you're you think you're investing in some property they're just pocketing the money and running away with it or they you know they do something bad to the property whatever it's not real estate that was the scam it was the scammer that was the scam and I think that's the hard part is that crypto has such a playing field right it's a money business so so many people that can scam so it almost Associates Bitcoin or the underlying thing itself which is you know it's like a rock it's like it's not doing anything it Associates that with the scam even though it was the human being who decided to trick people in order to make that happen right like that that's the I think that's the the hard thing to disentangle yep do you um what was your reaction to like all the [ __ ] that was going down right we're in the slack Channel talking about you know the daily Edition and it feels like you know Bad News Bears for like you know 30 days in a row Mike what you were living in each of those editions yeah were you what did you go were you surprised with the FDX thing what was your reaction yeah I was stunned by that I mean that you know I like a lot of people viewed them as you know almost like a coinbase blue chip rock solid if you don't feel good putting your money on there I would have recommended them to anyone so I I was really shocked same with Genesis yeah we have I have money on Genesis that I don't know what's going to happen to it but that one was pretty stunning too um well it's been interesting for the milk Road and our businesses you know this has actually been for growth a good thing right we cover the news and there's certainly been a lot of news so we're seeing you know record Subs coming in that the reader scores have been really good people seem to be very interested in following this despite the fact that it's been very you know negative so you know some other piece of why we liked your business it's less correlated in our minds directly to crypto prices yeah yeah that's true yeah um amazing uh do we leave anything that we should have should have talked about we miss any good stories or uh or facts that you guys wanted to cover I don't think I have anything nothing all right well where should people find you guys because I think a lot of people are going to listen yeah these guys are cool obviously milk road but like where do they find you guys personally I know Mike you congratulations did you tweet for the first time today I had my first tweet today first tweet yeah first tweet about acquiring the mocha my Twitter handle is Mike Whitmire which Kendall helped me acquire earlier so last night it's like the news is going out to this morning and Mike's like hey um uh anybody can help me every round to help me figure out how to tweet uh I've never really tweeted let alone a thread it's like is there a button for the thread yeah and it was all I did was just laugh yeah I provided zero help I was like yeah this is hilarious I'm like you're the expert I'm not doing anything no this is hilarious basically Ben helped me out but it was like a [ __ ] show for both of us he sends his out this morning he misspelled milk Road just trying to get that autocorrect exactly I'm just trying to you know figure out a way but yeah I totally misspelled it and then I deleted the first tweet because it's still there and I didn't realize it for like 20 minutes and everyone's like what is wrong with your Twitter profile I'm like I don't know I think Twitter's messed up but you at least use Twitter I do use Twitter more than Mike but I wouldn't say I'm like I think you should actually make your Twitter bio because you have no picture or you had no picture so I added a picture oh yeah you should keep the no picture no tweets just the thread and your bio should be um I don't tweet I do actual work that should be your whole Persona and everybody should follow that and that's actually you asked earlier about why we don't do that stuff and something that came to mind for me was do you remember back in the day in the poker affiliate world where all the like mid-tier to small Affiliates had their like blogs yes like the personal blogs so everybody like I had like Mike whitmire.com right you had something I think yep and we would all you know Muse about what we were doing our business is this and that doing these posts feeling good and then we were at one of these conferences and who was the the big Jam investor and he was like the biggest poker affiliate probably in the world back then and this other guy that was similar neither of those guys did any of that stuff and like every night we're out in the clubs at these guys tables you know hoping they'll give us like their drinks and it was kind of eye-opening for me I'm like there's probably a correlation here maybe I should do with those again maybe I should do the work can you tell any of his stories because this guy sounds like a legend who who is this person he's definitely a legend what are some of the the craziest yeah yeah he's a pretty private guy but he um he's got a great story also by the way we could bleep his name yeah okay so then he could just be like you can tell the story without the name all the good stories um so uh crazy story he's from he grew up there very uh not well off very poor had to leave school in eighth grade um so I go start making money for his family whatever um what did he do in the eighth grade uh he was like working at a hotel or something like that bar um um and so I think the first thing he did was he he was like the biggest eBay power seller and he was selling like CDs and stuff on there he became pretty big made a bunch of money um and then you know was he just early or is he really good or no the same time as us he was smart like he was basically kind of roll up all the smaller Affiliates because he had better deals with all the operators so he'd buy someone and you know it'd be a small affiliate and like oh I'm making like five times and he for him it was like this is two two years earnings or one year he bought my site is how I knew him my uh we have one super smart buddy who has this like dominant position in his game I can't say who otherwise it'll give it away but he has the same strategy where he's like he's like yeah now it's unfair he goes I just go to them and they quote me some multiple but I have a better deal with the payment providers or the affiliate partner so I they think they're selling it four times earnings but it's actually two the moment I sign the deal they'll go and it'll go to my payment terms and my payment terms are just Superior and so he's like I can just buy these all day and I don't have to like come up with a genius idea to even grow them because like it's baked into just the fact that I have more scale and therefore I have better terms and therefore like what they think costs X or drives wide revenue is actually a different variable for me yeah for sure yeah yeah so that's exactly why he bought my business my poker affiliate business back then yeah and so he was smart and that he was rolling these up nobody was that were other people not rolling them up back then he sort of started that yeah I feel like he was kind of Pioneer in our Small industry he's just like a if you give him a business in like an Excel sheet in a few weeks to like look at it he's going to come back with like here are the three things that this could be doing that would like 10x it and that's really what he did for us at JM too was I learned so much from him like I'm a completely different business person you know after 10 years of working with him than I am now like what's an example that he did at JM maybe that was a one thing he helped me yeah one thing he helped me a lot with was um I especially early on I would really ride the wave of like you know all the credit card chargebacks hit I'm in despair on my deathbed you know we were first hundred thousand dollar day like I'm ready to IPL it was just this very he used to joke with me he's like if we were publicly traded and you set the stock price it would swing like a thousand percent a day um and one thing you really helped me with was zooming out and thinking like into five to ten year increments and if you frame stuff like that nothing really ever seems like that big of a deal there's very few things that happen to you or your business that are going to materially change your trajectory over five to ten years so like an example to his credit before he put uh a million into JM shortly after Kendall did his first Angel investment like a week before it was going to close we had done all the documents it was ready to go our credit card processor throws us out and that was like half of our Revenue which is gone and it was like a visa thing it wasn't just them they're like this is the underlying Network yeah they're growing too fast like we need a big cash Reserve we're going to work with these guys they asked us they're like can you send us your financials we need a p l and a balance sheet we didn't even know what a balance she was right there's nothing we could send to them so unsurprisingly they threw us out and I had to go back to them sort of hat in hand to be like so uh yeah this happened you know are we still gonna do this or not and uh he was just like totally understand if you uh yeah just like we really need it but if you would though and he's just like you know we're gonna figure this out and he still cut the check and we did figure it out and there were probably 10 more of those times along the way that he you know just helped me think about things in yeah the longer increments yeah because with crypto right now like I mean people would have said oh impossible to sell milk grow during this time and with a good deal you could sell with anything with a bad deal but it's impossible to get a good deal right now and I think as a general rule of thumb that would have been true but I've always I I hate uh anything that's like you know this like sort of conventional wisdom because it's like dude I'm in the outlier business like creating a successful startup is an outlier yeah I'm trying to be like you know super happy and super rich and super fit that's an outlier like so I don't really need any advice that is about what the general outcomes are instead I need advice on how to create outlier outcomes and so with this I was like okay well what would have created an outlier outcome okay crypto's going you know industry gets shook all the big companies they gotta freeze they can't make some flashy acquisition right now that would be impossible okay so I need basically independently wealthy individuals right that's that's the first criteria second a lot of people are gonna say oh bad news in crypto oh I maybe I shouldn't do this maybe I should see how this is gonna play out and no I need somebody who's got long-term conviction thinks in this five to ten year increments and uh believes in the you know the fundamentals and understands that there's gonna be the UPS now then actually during the bounds is the time to like make Acquisitions and do things like this like this is the time to play offense right I feel like everyone on Twitter there's a lot of Twitter threads about this is the time to build yeah I agree I'm not on Twitter I'm doing that yeah yeah exactly the builders aren't reading your thread yeah so so and then that's how we ended up finding you know basically the perfect partner at that time um to do this and so I feel like the uh the outlier you know if you're gonna play an outlier game and you're gonna you know you have to if you want an outlier outcome you gotta like play Only by we only have to think in terms of what creates that not what's the average outcome right because the average outcome is not the thing you want anyways so for sure um cool guys this was amazing uh Kendall you didn't throw up I did it I did it because I was really nervous before we started yeah I was I was like uh do we have any booze around or yeah but you did great uh so that was awesome uh what's your Twitter handle which people at Kendall Seville Seville s-a-v-i-l-l-e yep and then Mike give him a follow how many followers you got 200 now I'm over 200. yeah Mike Whitmire w-i-t-t-m-e-y-e-r if you guys might get recognized now when you walk on the streets I doubt it a little hit of that thing yeah actually you know what was funny right when we had met the last time before we did the deal um we were walking out of that coffee shop and I was like all right I'll see you later and you went to go get your Uber and right then there was a guy who's sitting right there the whole time he's waiting I guess he kept looking at us he's like hey uh Sean he's like you know love the podcast man I'm I'm traveling for Pittsburgh I'm just here for the day I can't believe bumped into evolved a lot I was like dude you should have said that when the guy might buy the company was it that might have helped a little just you know a little little juice you were joking about that after I'm like Sean probably just paid all these apps yeah it was a genius yeah I was like it worked like a great job when when we were selling our first company I did stuff like that where I was like um I knew that it was like is to larger companies like the big fan companies so it was like Corp Dev was like the who's but who's paying attention to you at that time and so they would follow me on Twitter or an Instagram stuff like that so I would just post like a ticket to like Seattle you know one day a trip anybody around in the evening and it's like okay why would he go to Seattle who's in Seattle why would you go for a day that's got to be a busy they're talking to them all right come back and be like you know when it rains it pours and it's like and I would just post these cryptic things because in my mind I was like I'm just planting the seed baby I have no idea if this did anything but uh in my head I was like I'm really playing everybody off of each other I thought I was like you know yeah Catch Me If You Can type of guy um all right guys that was awesome yeah we're good thank you thank you so much and one thing is uh milk road is hiring yeah oh yeah we're looking for like you know those a players that have done it before because you know we want to scale this and uh do it as quickly as we can and I should actually say I um like when we were looking at this deal we actually had a higher offer that we turned down one of the reasons why I told Ben I was like I went to your Twitter feed and I saw your tweets from back in the day that were like crypto punks cool I think crypto punks are cool actually and I looked at the date I looked at what the price was then like what would the what were people thinking then and you were like ahead of the curve then you had another one this exchange that you had a mess in rain and I was like oh dude I've been trying to get into uh you know to rain at that I had tried to invest at a point in time I was like he was in there early and I was like I feel like if I just hang out with these guys more I'm going to get more value out of something completely unrelated to milk Road just there's gonna be some random you're gonna be like oh dude sir yeah yeah exactly you can if I just throw me a roadster I was like there's gonna be something like that I'm gonna get just out of hanging with like I'm a big believer in that like if you find exceptional people you don't have to have a plan like just hang with them find some routine or value exchange where you're going to be in each other's orbit all the time because something good is going to come out of that and so similarly if somebody wants to work at the milk Road I would say like cool it's gonna have good pay it's a cool project people really love the product that's that's all true but also like the same reason I wanted to to sell and work with you guys is the same reason really anybody should want to do that like if you heard the stories on this podcast you're probably like God these guys are awesome like they they went through a bunch of [ __ ] but they figure stuff out and they play their own game those are the type of people who you want to like work with even if you're like someday I want to be more entrepreneurial than I am today you want to get a job where you're kind of in direct proximity with people who are very much like that because it'll change the way your own brain works for sure you want to get in shape hang out with fit people yeah for sure yeah yeah when we what was the body fat challenge did you win last time we hung out he was at like day that's how we're gonna finish the pause yeah I gotta know um so what was the challenge you were at the end of a challenge yeah I'm in a group called entrepreneurs organization I'm in a forum with seven other uh Dallas entrepreneurs we meet monthly we do a retreat once a year and in advance of the retreat everybody sets themselves a fitness goal and everybody puts in like 500 bucks that if you hate your goal you get your money back if you don't it goes towards funding my retreat so no win just a it's not loose yeah just to not lose and avoid the shame um so maybe three months out everybody sets their goals and I thought I was like 15 body fat at that time so I was like I'm gonna get to 10. I've never done that before I'm gonna go for it let's do it so I you know slam it down on the table I'm like boys I'm doing it and then uh I start working really hard the next two months and a month out I'm like I'm gonna go get a dexa to see like I think I'm probably 11 somewhere in there like I gotta be really I'm almost there I'm almost there and I had like weaned out in the mirror materially and I go and get the decks when I was 15-7. said I was nowhere near where I thought I was and then I really like killed myself that next month and I ended up getting down to like 12 more so 12 one okay but lucky for me some of the guys didn't schedule dexes so the body fat guys were like we're gonna consider it acceptable to use those scale things and on the scale I was like eight something so I got my 500 back okay wow yeah the good guys the reality is I did not I did my goal yeah yeah you were like really hardcore about it that's right if you were like not eating any of the carbs it was just like really sad you were just kind of in the corner yeah it was definitely sad oh man like the chef just made this really cool thing and I can't eat anything of it all right does Mike really do this 500 yeah it's like no Mike needs to not lose Mike does not like to lose at anything and he said himself a stupid goal that he has to hit now next year though I'm gonna get it yeah what I would have done is I would have been like what am I now and just like doing done like one percent under that just like make sure I win yeah Mike wants to make his life hard and go uphill no last year I I was I probably weighed like 175 pounds or once 80 or something like that and everyone at the table did like a weight loss thing so I just thought that's what these were it was like one of the I think it was the first year we did it and so I was like well I want to get down to you know 175. they're like well what are you now I'm like 178. it was 40 pounds in my fault you guys have been slacked yeah you need to write a book called going uphill I feel like that's gonna be your your book yeah it'll be the bias you know when you're done working then you can start tweeting you're you're uphill about your uphill book I actually have one last uphill story away yeah so and Whitefish this year I mentioned we were doing uh I was doing this in the resort and they would open it like an hour before the whiffs ran so only the people going uphill I guess just because it's safer there's not a ton of people coming down so there was one morning it was like negative 10 wind chill they actually never even opened the resort that day it was too windy it was just miserable out so I was like all right this is perfect optimal conditions so I suit up you rang they suit up and get out there and uh I had just gotten like I'd never done this in a resort and I really had only done this maybe five times with my buddy who always was like the sherpa he was like you know help me figure stuff out whatever so there's this route you have to take up the hill and I was the first one going it was like 6 a.m and I'm just I'm going straight up that path I'm like marching doing well feeling good and then there's this one section because I've done it a few times so I knew there was this one section that was pretty steep and there were a few times going up that the Skins would like start to slip a little bit and I was getting really scared because I don't ski so like if this thing turns around I'm like I can't do anything and so I'm going straight up this thing like marching the winds blasting me the Isis blasphemy and I I'm one step away from the top and I take the step and it slips and the whole thing just falls apart I'm falling backwards downhill doing the somersault thing like this skis go flying off that whole thing set them at the bottom and I am very humbled now because there's like 20 I realize there's like 20 people behind me who just watched that and I'm gathering all my stuff like they're helping me out and I look up the hill because they're starting to go and all of them are zigzagging back and forth so it's not as Steep and I was going straight line directly up the hill I'm like oh that's why they're not far [Laughter] wouldn't have it any other way yeah there you go metaphor of Life awesome well thanks guys for doing this I I know a little out of your comfort zone but I'm glad you guys did it thanks for having us appreciate it cool all right [Music] foreign [Music]

by the way you like how he was like so sharks you want to come take a swim at the maritime industry are you scared to the best this is the greatest thing I've ever seen I thought this was gonna be stupid these are these these are so much better than anything we've ever done with this they are so talented also if this is like the bar if this is the normal bar of college entrepreneur then like uh you know like I feel like we were playing basketball back in the days when they had like short shorts and nobody could use a left hand and like it was a peach basket for a hoop it's like oh wow these guys can jump you know it's like we just like LeBron just learned how to lift weights like that's what this feels like [Music] all right what up we got a special episode this is like a shark tank style episode so this is the my first million pitch competition we got the University of Michigan so Wolverines are here we got five companies I believe each company's gonna have two minutes to pitch a five minute q a and the winner will get five thousand dollars at the end as decided by me and Sam whoever is the best at pitching and little do people know this this is how I became an entrepreneur I was going to be a doctor and then I entered a pitch competition at my University and I won that baby for 25 Grand and um that was what got me on the path of Entrepreneurship altogether I would have never ever ever done startups uh if it wasn't for that competition that we randomly entered so this could be kind of for somebody out there this could be their break too so here we go University of Michigan pitch competition first up um who is it Jake so Jake from area is that right yes hey guys what's up all right two minutes is all yours go cool so hey guys my name is Jake I'm the founder of area we're bringing e-commerce abilities to in-person shopping and so as an e-commerce business owner myself we we know quite a bit about our customers such as who they are what they're interested and how they engage with our business and so this this type of information informs all aspects of our operations from developing new products and then driving more sales and so the question that comes to mind is why aren't these same Necessities available to retail business owners why is this limited to just e-commerce and this happens because the source of the transaction which is the barcode um at area we're making a new type of product code that brings uh e-commerce abilities to retail so this is called one tag it uses radio frequency identification this is the same type of technology and contactless credit cards and garage door openers and it recently became affordable at a mass scale and one Tech is super versatile there's a lot of uses for it it costs pennies to manufacture and it's printed on a sticker to attach to merchandise uh so by replacing the barcode with one tag retailers unlock new capabilities in a variety of things I'm going to go into one example now so this is a traditional retail setup you have your products then you have barcodes and each one is individually scanned instead of that let's just replace all these barcodes with one tag so now uh uh Shopper can just bag all items as they shop and then they can pretty much just walk through an antenna which instantly scans all of their items at once and then payment can be done through a kiosk for quick self checkout or through an app that uses uh something called Ultra wideband which is a new type of Technology that's brought to iPhone and as recent as 2019 and so um this pretty much tracks the location of the customer and shows what products they purchased and how they purchased it and so you could pretty much walk out and then uh payments instantly process as you walk out just like Amazon go so what this does in addition to autonomous checkout is it brings a bunch of e-commerce capabilities to retail so now we have an e-commerce profile for a bunch of offline purchases and this allows us to abandon car recovery personalized product upsells uh in-depth shopping data and subscription reorders there's also loss prevention built right in and then the location accuracy of RFID is super high so Inventory management is like pretty easy uh all you really have to do is uh is put an item in its proper location and then If an item is ever misplaced area pretty much will map the entire location of all these items and so instead of like arduous stock checks um you can pretty much just instantly know where things are misplaced and address those directly and so yeah that's my product this is one tag it's checkout security and inventory all in one product and most importantly it brings e-commerce abilities to retail Jake what type of e-commerce storm do you own uh I own a sex chocolate brand what is it called it's called tabs chocolate yeah we we've talked about you a fair bit uh on the pot I think right you've got like a crazy uh Instagram or Tick Tock or something like that uh yeah we go viral on Tick Tock pretty frequently yeah that's cool wait you're in college I am I'm a sophomore now my God okay uh cool all right so Sam what do you think yeah so I've talked to a few companies in this space I know there's a few people trying to attack it and some of them I think are actually quite big I the one of the most interesting so basically Jake explained it in a more sophisticated way I'm going to explain it in a more dumb way which is like this little tag goes into clothing and you know the clothing's history and you could track it and things like that and I saw a company that was doing this with high-end luxury goods so like I don't know if this was their customer but basically like this would get sewn inside of a Louis Vuitton purse and whether you know how people buy and sell used purses you could see like where it originally came from who originally bought it and as a collector of like old stuff I thought that was awesome I thought that was great so I it's interesting technology to me I don't really know this Market that well but I do think there's a few people doing this right Sean well I I think you are looking only at a little niche use case yeah yeah what you're doing is they're trying to take the Amazon ghost store like Amazon's like hey what if there was a grocery store where you could walk in and just walk out there's no checkout process right that's more efficient it's more convenient um and it's lower cost because you don't have to you know employ all these check out Folks at the at the store and um they're trying to just provide that as like anybody any store should be able to have that if they want kind of the uh the next level of self-checkout as I think what they're trying to do and so I think that's a cool idea I think it it takes a lot of boxes so um technology that really wasn't possible wasn't cheap enough until a few years ago I like that like these little I don't know if they're called I don't know if these are NFC chips or whatever but like they're very cheap like pennies uh of these like um the pennies like pennies now to to manufacture or add these little chips to um to any kind of goods so I think that's really great that that's now possible it wasn't possible before I think it's clearly cheaper faster for the person who's doing it um but I do have some problems with your pitch so I'm going to be like three bits of pitch feedback for you all right Jake so keep in mind though he's doing this with like in the most like hood rat way ever right now we've got like one person talking another person hitting slides and there's a delay so go a little easier yeah yeah yeah and of course of course and also he's like sideways on my screen so that doesn't help uh but basically the the main things I would have said in the pitch is basically like uh you know you have three three major ways that you could have presented this number one you could have shown a barcode and just been like can you believe this hasn't been upgraded in like a hundred years like this is the same thing we've been using for 75 years we got iPhones we got all this crazy stuff all this amazing technology but the barcode is still the same and like you could have presented it from that angle like the barcode is is outdated we're we're revolutionizing the barcode and the barcode's on everything so like that's how big this idea is going to be the second thing was basically like we're taking the Amazon go checkout and we're making it available to any store right that that's a very simple way for me to understand what you're talking about um so this the third thing is that you have a really cool backstory with with the chocolate stuff so you could be like I'm Jake I'm a sophomore in college this year I sold four million dollars worth of sex chocolate um I'm an entrepreneur I'm a hustler I don't think my crew is gonna you know I don't think sex chocolate's the big idea for me but it led me to what I think is the big idea and already I'd be hooked because I'm like who is this college sophomore that sold four million dollars of sex chocolate like tell me more right so that's my pitch feedback for you um on that side on the on in the actual idea itself the part I felt was lacking was the go to market so this was this was all about technology technology technology but how are you going to get customers and are you know are these stores gonna be willing to revamp are customers gonna understand what the hell is going on and I think that's where this technology that's where this company like this would struggle but you didn't really talk about that at all so can you talk about about how are you going to go get your first you know 10 or 100 customers have you done that already or how are you going to do it absolutely yeah I'm talking to customers right now it would pretty much be there would really be no retrofitting for a store um the first MVP would be pretty much an iPad kiosk uh that's self-checkout so but they have to tag every product right they do yeah but a lot of retailers especially small retailers don't even use like Universal product code they have to tag barcodes so it's not really an increase in labor and um the way the way I'm envisioning for the mdp is uh customers already have to check out somehow they go to the front desk there's an iPad there that says instant checkout they put their bag there and pay with credit cards and then soon you could add in things like uh antennas with that inventory and then ultimately it's hard to check out with an app so who are you going for like small stores big stores grocery stores clothing stores huge Brands who are you going for I'm thinking clothing stores and convenience stores uh at least initially so convenience stores give a lot of the benefits of like the just walk out stuff the convenience stuff and then clothing stores uh prioritize the e-commerce abilities a lot more to be able to retarget customers and be a little bit more pointed with the way they're they're selling things Jake how old are you I'm 20. how big is tabs uh it's actually less than four million it's about two million dollars this year um got 800k profit and we started a year ago today so for how young and how impressive you are I have got incredibly high standards because you're like you're amazing I mean you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're a certified badass with your background and how young you are thanks I am shocked at how much you're you're screwing this up though like with with this pitch because first you build them up my standards with him are so high because like I'll I would invest in a lot of things that this guy does just because he's him uh I think if you're that young and you're this successful already like you clearly have some type of it Factor uh Jonathan by the way can you meet them you you clearly have some type of mute factor or uh you have some type of it factor sorry and uh you're you're amazing I think though that when Sean nailed it what he said that I don't he didn't say it this way but basically this isn't really a tech problem uh like the tech exists and you're going to be working on that this is a distribution and marketing problem can you just get this in the hands of the right people I don't have a lot of experience selling to like uh convenience stores and things like that I think that would be a pain in the ass unless you got like a 7-Eleven or something like that but like I think going like from store to store to store is gonna be the worst but anyway uh I think this is like a distribution customer acquisition problem it's a sales problem yeah and your problem and like if you're gonna sell to a convenience store like the dude who owns the convenience store is working there that will tell you how much he thinks about efficiency right like he just sits there all day and like if you're like hey you have 4 000 skus on your shelves can you just add this tab to it and then when a customer comes in you could tell them just to walk out he'd be like actually it's fine they just I actually want them to come to the front counter so they buy a Five Hour Energy also and a lotto ticket and like I don't want them to just walk out that's like half the revenue and so you know I think that Pro that if I was you what I would say is who needs this the mo well I guess if I was you I'd probably actually lean on your strengths you're like good at Tick Tock and [ __ ] like that that's my point it's like you're good at shooting I'm shocked that he doesn't get what people are bad at you're doing a product that old people would be good at which is basically Enterprise sales going to Kroger and showing them that with this increase in efficiency or retargeting or whatever they're gonna get you know it's a four percent impact to the you know to their to their operations and that's a huge number for them but that takes that's like a year-long rollout or whatever I think the SMB sale problem is going to be pretty tough here so that's what I would say is the weaknesses but really cool idea and um The Good the good thing is I do think this is inevitable like I do think this is where all retail is going it's the how is it going to get there that's sort of the challenge and um so you know that's you know that's that's the opportunity also I think it's definitely going to be challenging to acquire the first initial customers the way this works though is it gets easier over time so you can build leverage with Brands and have them install the tag itself it's obviously a long-term goal um but once it's you know similar to a UPC where it's applied at checkout the area to entry for a retailer to carry area or carry One tech in their store is virtually the same and a lot of these benefits are actually pretty relevant to um to retailers it's not really like this kind of archaic like old thing um so I think uh I think it's definitely gonna be challenging to like go door to door and pitch and I think there definitely will need to be some sort of investor or person that could intro me to a bigger chain there where we could like do an X do a roll out of this that's much more efficient but um yeah I mean you're definitely right it's gonna take some some legwork to to get someone on board if I was you there's a thing called Walmart Labs you should check out so Walmart has basically a giant Innovation department or at least they did I don't know if this is still around but like they acquired a bunch of startups they put like millions and millions of dollars into Walmart Labs where they were going to like experiment with technology because Walmart's the biggest retailer for them one percent matters a lot and um I would go talk to them and be like hey here's what we're thinking about and I think that conversation will be pretty Illuminating um to figure out like you know what's the what is the appetite what are the concerns what how would they realistically you know how would you realistically get this into stores so that'd be my suggestion as a next step and I actually think that a lot I know I'm currently filming this in Austin right now HEB has a like an innovation lab I would I think Costco I imagine would Sam's Club which is also Walmart does but I think that as a 1920 21 year old person with a really successful background I think you actually have this massive advantage to go to some of these like Executives at some of these big companies these gray-haired Executives and they would meet someone like you and they're like you're you're special like it's my job to like collect interesting talent and like be on the latest and greatest and know what's happening I uh I don't know if you're gonna pull this off but like I wanna I wanna be in business with you and I think like three out of 20 people who you talk to would give you a chance just because of your success and your age and I think that you should use every Advantage you have do you think I go to big retailers initially versus small I have 100 whatever I would I would go big right away I think big retailers think about this stuff in a more like they they need to be innovating and these efficiencies mean a lot more to them um and they can sort of mandate these rollouts so so we so I think that's the that's the play and Sam's totally right there's going to be the executive who's like love this you're gonna be like wow he loves the technologies that they're like he's gonna tell you you got to meet my son he needs to be more like you and it really like the draw is gonna be he wants his 18 year old son to hang out with you so that he could be more like you and like you know that actually could get you a long way that actually happened to me several times in my like basically between 18 and 24. I got so many either investors or intros or things like that just because people just thought it was endearing that I was this young kid who believed in this stupid thing and was going for it and was clearly smart and got to do things later and uh they just wanted that energy around them they wanted to exactly support it they go I just want a piece of the action I don't know what it's gonna be but like when you see like anyone who's like at the top often times they'll be like I appreciate young Hustlers who are like they're gonna be the real deal I see myself in you whatever it is and they build a relationship and I would 100 use that because there's like this like five or six year window when you're still considered a prodigy and you should just like pounce on that right thanks Jake thank you guys thanks Jake um all right who's next we got anant from internet activism by the way that guy's pitch was like a freaking Pixar movie or something it was like animated and figma like kids these days they got the tools man I don't even know how do you do that did you have you ever even seen that before no that was all design and fig but yeah that was impressive this this one looks good too I like internet activism I'm clicking on your deck now I like your I like your hacker design it's cool all right two minutes it's all yours go all right my name is I'm the CTO of an organization called internet activism So currently the world is online over 64 of the world has access to the internet and the world's poorest communities people are more likely to have access to a cell phone than a toilet but still the internet's potential when it comes to Distributing humanitarian software is heavily underutilized in response to this internet activism is the first non-profit that's solely dedicated to developing software in response to humanitarian disaster so now I'm going to walk you through a couple examples of what this actually looks like in March 2022 we launched a website called Ukraine take shelter this is essentially like Airbnb for refugees we connected refugees or potential hosts and over the last year we've been we've been able to house over a hundred thousand refugees which has ten thousand dollars in spend how did you track that like you you know for a fact you put them in their home yeah another example of a project we worked on is the world's most popular coronavirus tracking dashboard this is launched in January 2020 before covid-19 was officially a pandemic it was used by over 600 million people it was recognized by Dr fauji as an invaluable resource in distributing covid-19 information we were also recognized as being able to compile coronavirus data faster in the CDC and sharing it with General Public and now moving on to what we're doing right now we're building out an app called hyperlocal this essentially allows people to message each other just using Bluetooth so if you don't have access to data or Wi-Fi or cellular service you can still message others using Bluetooth even if they aren't right near you we can carry store and forward messages so messages can hop between people across large distances this app is completely decentralized it's censorship resistant and it's secure and we envisioned this to soon be a vital part of the modern day emergency toolkit so the central thesis for our organization is being low cost having a quick response time and having building with small teams we're going to build out an entire Suite of products that we can tweak in the matter of days or hours to respond to crises around the world and our main goal is to bridge the gap between the tech sector and humanitarian organizations our leadership consists of the world's leading internet activists exited Founders and highly talented designers and developers we're all young ambitious and we build really really fast and when crisis occurs next we'll be ready to respond and move on to questions wow wow that was incredible did you yeah you who are you these people are [ __ ] amazing by the way how old are you how old are you 21. and you're in college yeah why I'm asking myself that question too probably gonna take like a gap semester or a permanent Gap semester starting next month this is amazing well done um from the start the pitch was amazing uh you know the world's poorest communities are more likely to have a cell phone than access to a toilet um that is uh you know a great attention grabbing you know like you know grabbing by the throat type of type of uh hook and then then you backed it up and you were like you know we're gonna do this thing we're going to basically develop soft non-profit developing software for the humanitarian disaster okay it sounds interesting but you've actually done it so super impressive that you guys did this Airbnb thing and you housed a hundred thousand refugees um I remember using this coronavirus tracker uh yeah it's made um so that's kind of amazing as well and it sounds like how much traffic did you say that one got it had over 600 million users and a peak daily active 36 million use 34 million iliac abusers and how did it get so popular what did you do did you just release it to the world did it just went or was there any growth in marketing around it I believe it was because of how early it was released this was before John Hopkins started like publicly aggregating all the data and releasing it we just had an advantage of being like one of the first people to compile all this data and share it with everyone again this was in January 2020 so this was three months before like the pandemic officially began this was just in the early stages of the pandemic and so you said this you show this leadership team which is three people how many people are there total in your group or your org that like actively do stuff currently there are five people wow so you're a five person Team all of you guys are like you know college age is that it yeah everyone's in between the ages of 19 and 21. have you made any money from any of us government grants um donations we're 501c3 so we're going to be raising over the next few months that okay so our Grand Vision right now is we're just going full force with a non-profit right now so these are like a couple cool projects but this is small in comparison to what we're going to do over the next few years we want to build that entire Suite of tools so that whenever a crisis occurs we can just tweak it and then quickly deploy in a matter of hours or days if you like current non-profits the amount of time it takes to respond to a situation it can be months it can be years we want to be able to do that in hours how many non-profits are like run by hackers right no one does this that's why so we worked on these projects in the past and we're like why is no one else doing this we see how powerful the internet is in terms of Distributing these Solutions we see that can literally save lives so if no other organization is going to do it we're going to do it but why is there an incentive for a for-profit investor this isn't for profit this is more we're going to be taking donations we're a non-profit organization but is there a way okay maybe there's a philosophical reason why you're doing it which is totally which is cool that I won't I won't debate you on that but yeah no we can talk about that if if we do make this a for-profit company and we're going into countries where we're establishing a presence we're becoming they're like Central means of communication if we come across as a for-profit company people are going to question whether maintenance incentives are again we're not trying to distribute this in like one or two countries with the app that I was discussing before hyper local and that okay I'm just gonna walk you through that app real quick basically it allows people to just message each other using Bluetooth so if a government shuts down Wi-Fi access like we're seeing in Iran right now you can still message people close to you or across an entire city you can balance message across everyone in between you and that person who has our app downloaded even if their phone is off so if this will become this has happened before right these mesh Network like messaging apps and they kind of took off I remember when at festivals where there was no service and then in some like disaster zones they were using these the thing is that most of these Mesh networking apps they're UI and ux sucks we're gonna improve that and they don't have store and carry so say you're standing near me I can message you pretty easily but if I want to message someone who's a mile away my message cannot get to them what we're doing is essentially and first of all our messages are completely encrypted but say I want to message someone who's on the other side of a city if I want to message them every person I come across I will they will will store my message and be like Anan is trying to message this other person so once they walk across other people they're also going to be carrying my message until it eventually reaches that person so you're able to create like a virus effect and spread messages and create entire decentralized networks and cities what are you and your team motivated by why are you doing this we want to like have a positive impact in the world basically we know that there are existing solutions that can help out people around the world we know that we can potentially save lives or just make the world a jet better place in general but just to just to reiterate this is not a profit making thing and that is not your intention ever you're just doing this because I imagine it's incredibly fun and because you just want to make the world better is that right yeah basically look if you if you see that there's a problem in the world and you know that you have the means to create a solution for it if you walk away from that solution our entire team would basically be bystanders and our team isn't bystanders man this was this was great um you're a Visionary I mean I think this guy's [ __ ] badass yeah I think what you guys have done is amazing I think that uh it's really cool to see a non-profit that's just driven by a you know a handful of Builders like in Engineers to hackers for better lack of a better word and um not gonna lie gonna be a hard pitch to beat so you know uh I'm just gonna put that out there the ball is starting off so our team is five people but we're planning on scaling this as fast as possible half of our team right now is full-time students I'm a computer science student here at University of Michigan I have a lot of workload but as soon as this semester ends this is all we're going to be working why hasn't University of Michigan been like dude bail here's money you're good that would be a good question for the University yeah about both both of the first two pitches got the my first million uh bachelor's degree you know you got to be a badass uh from our from us you don't need to finish school the one thing you should do though is you should shout out if there's because people listen to this podcast if there's somebody at a school right now or young young person who's like dude that's awesome I want to help them out yeah okay there's a website internetactivism.org if you go to that you can find your contact information and reach out to us directly all right internet Beyond just people are interested in programming for us if you're interested in working with us and a non-profit

that if I could hop in for two seconds uh I'm Bobby and also like anyone who's watching this we are a group of entrepreneurs this is built for students by students in my community these people are my best friends and if you want to like get involved with these people in any sort of way like feel free to reach out to me at b-h-o-u-s-e-l-u-mesh umich.edu we're building communities like this across the country and we want your help if you're a college student a young person that's excited about making things but uh I'll let the next guy go all right what's up Jason from what is it Seafair seal Fair Seafair and from Minnesota all right hit it you got two minutes awesome Ahoy sharks this is Seafair payroll and onboarding software for ships let's just jump right into the problem here paying the 2 million Global seafarers is really hard the average ship is made up of people's from more than three different nationalities meaning you deal with disparate local bank accounts currencies and regulations that's why the current solution is literally paying these people in US dollars cash and or sending slow and often delayed Swift transfers on top of this the documents that seafarers need to provide and that ships need to process are arduous and painstaking to go through take a look at this Sam I can see your face right now you're having flashbacks to the DMV when you try to renew your license it's an absolute disaster to go through these documents we're talking vaccinations professional certificates sailing history you name it they have to provide it once the affair I talked to once had to print out 700 pages of documents just to get hired on a ship by the way what's a seafare are we talking like uh like work ships or what yeah we're talking Merchant Mariners so any ship that's out in the ocean primarily those like transporting goods and services but outside like Leisure as well as military ships yeah awesome so what are my brother and I working on to address this problem we're taking a two-pronged approach to this solution first is with the payroll solution we're talking multi-currency low FX fees direct deposit to local accounts and a mobile first approach that will bring this industry to the modern era this will improve record-keeping and financial management for these ships and will eliminate the risk of having cash on board I'm sure many of you have seen the movie Captain Phillips and know this problem at hand second is we're working on an onboarding solution for ships this will be a single place where they can have a document upload where our software will scrape those documents to determine eligibility expirations and everything else a ship needs to know saving them money seafarers will love it too as it'll be a One-Stop shop for them to store their documents track their certifications and have an employment record at hand so sharks why now there's two compelling reasons why this can happen right now first is that fintech infrastructure over the past few years has exploded never has it been easier faster more efficient and more reliable to build a cross-border payments company second internet adoption on ships is finally growing if you didn't know a lot of these ships didn't have access to Internet until recently but the drop in cost of satellite internet and starlink for maritime launching in just this July we see it really exploding on top of this there's a labor shortage of seafarers right now which is putting pressure on shipping companies to provide internet in order to attract labor to work for them so sharks I'll leave you with a quote from Captain Jack Sparrow and in the meantime I'm happy to answer any questions that you have Bravo man you guys are all great this is the this is way like we had stocks we did this with stocks and it was like these like you know people who have been working in the workforce for years and some of them already successful entrepreneurs this is way better this is way better this is really good um what was your name again Jordan uh my name is Jason okay it's Jason um Jason I'd like to invest in your company so I don't know if you're gonna win this pitch competition or not but I'd like to invest in your company so all right let's set up a call next week no call I'm in uh the call is done this is this was the call and I'm in uh I don't know if you have an entity or a corporation but you need to get one and send me some wiring details uh because I'm in on this idea this is a you know one of my best investments was a company called deal that's basically like a payments solution for contractors around the world this is like a niche that no no payment companies gonna really like kind of focus on the unique aspects of this um no none of the modern companies are going to do this you know I think because there's probably a bunch of nuances that are specific here it seems like you could go in and you know you found a problem that most people aren't even really aware of like I didn't even know what a Seafarer was for the first two minutes of the presentation um you know so I doubt most entrepreneurs are even looking at this the question of course is how big can this be so let's just do some math here two million two million uh what are we I'm not calling these guys through the Tam calculations if you want quick yeah so what is the how much money can you make if you get like you know whatever let's say um you know some reasonable amount of like if you had a tenth of that so if you had 200 000 of these people using your platform what would you be generating okay yeah so 200 000 we're charging ten dollars a month okay so that's two million dollars every single month times 12. um that's 24 million in in ARR if we capture 10 of the market but you also have to realize that we're going to be charging and sort of monetizing not just based off ten dollars per person per month we're also going to be taking 25 to 50 bips on FX as well as getting floating interest on payroll deposits before they're sent out so I would say as you know we left your ten percent markets yeah that's that's say I'm safe word okay so I think I'm clear I'm in on this I will invest in this company Sam what are your thoughts it is I'm I'm taken away uh or my breath has taken away these guys are awesome man uh like the reason this is great is this guy's pitching a Seafair B2B software but at the bottom of a slide he says Alexa Play I'm On A Boat by Lonely Island uh like this the the dichotomy here going on of just a bunch of dumbass [ __ ] young kids who are [ __ ] Geniuses and Incredibly successful I'm all about it you know I said earlier in the first pitch you do a good job pitching to some older executive who just wants to be around you guys that's exactly how I feel right now so your your brother says five years of AWS so is this your brother who's older and out of college yeah in a computer engineering degree he's been working at AWS for five years this is currently just an idea right you don't have a product you don't have any customers or anything like that yup idea phase did you work with uh Bessemer yep I worked at Bessemer Adventure Partners last summer did you pitch them this no I did not Pitch the mess why not uh they primarily do series a but I'm happy to talk to some of my partner friends there after this why didn't uh how did you come across this idea yeah yeah so my brother was actually born in Indonesia he spent a lot of time there and you might know them as like a global shipping hub so he actually became friends with this guy named Dennis long story short is Dennis handled a lot of the payroll paperwork that has to be processed by these shipping companies and uh he would talk to my brother basically every day about the pain points he faced so uh we decided we should tackle this to help alleviate some of Dennis's pain here is that how you know them Sean Indonesia as a shipping hub yeah I lived in Indonesia and I didn't pay attention to any of this [ __ ] I met a guy named Poppy who was it was importing cotton yeah I was like whoa shout out to Poppy if he's listening somewhere uh yeah I still remember you so do you how will you sell this so who do you who are you gonna go to and like is the guy going to have like you know gangrene on his no Knuckles I'd be like what are you talking about apps you know like who are you going to be selling this to and what makes you think you could sell it yeah for sure for sure so I know I look pretty young here but I do have a past life uh doing sales at several early stage successful software companies uh most notably patch.io join them pre-seed they're now at series B so I've put in my thousand cold calls put in my 100 000 cold emails so I'm pretty confident that I can get on the phone with someone and sell something um I will say that people were targeting right this is a fairly concentrated industry a lot of the shipping companies control lots of like market share so it's pretty long sales Cycles Enterprise B2B sales Cycles but I directly reach out to sort of those working in the offices of these shipping companies get them on the phone and sort of kick off that cycle I'm projecting six to ten months for the average sales cycle for these bigger companies um but obviously we're going to work our way down to smbs later on Jason is your Jason right uh yeah I'm so hot and bothered when you talk to me like this did somebody script this for you why are you saying all the right things all right so this is great Jason email me Shawn perry.com I'm investing in this company I can't wait uh this is this is really really interesting uh well well done good pitch um all right next one up we got are we going back to it thanks boys are we going back by the way you like how he was like so sharks you want to come take a swim at the maritime industry these kids are the best this is the greatest thing I've ever seen I thought this was gonna be stupid these are these guys are so much better than anything we've ever done with this they are so talented also if this is like the bar if this is the normal bar of college entrepreneur then like uh you know like I feel like we were playing basketball back in the days when they had like short shorts and nobody could use their left hand and like it was a peach basket for a hoop it's like oh wow guys can jump you know it's like we just like LeBron just learned how to lift weights like that's what this feels like I don't know what's happening by the way he's hoping this next one sucks I really hope he sucks just so I feel better this guy Jason was supposed to go last but he just interrupted and grabbed the mic like cognated with Taylor Swift because he goes hey bro can I take this over I gotta run to class like can we just reiterate that if I was University of what is this University of Michigan uh they seem like a fairly Progressive school if I like was these guys and I heard what was happening I would say bro it was like don't go to class anymore here's here we got you covered do this stuff by the way I want to do this with like every University now this is amazing uh I need to know if it's just the University of Michigan thing or if this is that's like the caliber of entrepreneurs uh Jonathan what should we if you're another University or if you're somebody at a university listening to this how do they get in touch with us to do this at their school it is it is definitely partially a Michigan thing and I will say like the biggest problem is the universities don't facilitate this it took me like two years to meet every single one of these killers and like we come together at bi-weekly to bring together these kinds of conversations and to build together I'm a student as well yeah this is a community of entrepreneurs like 200 strong at this school we meet bi-weekly and just enjoy each other no context of like paying dues like monthly membership like screw that this is not a club this is just a group of killers that enjoy spending time together got a good [ __ ] man this does not exist at other schools and the schools that like pretend like they have these crazy entrepreneurship programs like no hate on Mission entrepreneurship like there are some upside like they can't build this right like this has only existed because I spent every waking moment at this school like any time anyone tells me they're building something new Scooter Braun man what yeah I would love to help put this on other schools like our mission is to bring this sort of community to schools across the country right like built Ground Up For Students five students screw the preconception of having to do anything like yeah come and be together and like make cool [ __ ] all right Bob that was incredible but also just the bi-weekly Killers that's a great band right there yeah it's like a doo-wop band from the 60s this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better put your fi on I want to hear from Jordan Shamir yeah no thanks for having me I guess I'm the senior citizen here I'm a master's student so a little bit older but if we go to the next slide one of the things we were working on in a previous life is we were all working on digital identities how can these Brands create you know meaningful consistent relationships with their customers customers are always changing but one of the things that we saw is that our understanding of who customers are digitally is really complicated we can't interact with them we can't see them we can't see what they like and so one of the things that we did is we actually worked with some of the world's largest Brands right working in the bot mitigation team so I don't know if y'all like sneakers or anything along those lines one of the things that we saw is that through all of our experience in e-commerce but just larger brands in general is that everything you consume digitally is being skewed because everyone has multiple personas or multiple identities online so whether it's intentional being Bots frauds resellers Etc or unintentional right we've all used multiple different email addresses to get 10 15 off discounts and this crazy is a huge issue for both Brands and consumer rumors right from Brands I don't know how many customers that I have are unique I don't know which products to build because it's being skewed by these multiple personas I over forecast inventory leads to a bunch of dead stock but also as consumers right we all know what's going on with Taylor Swift or we've all lost sneaker drop we've all paid way too much for a concert ticket that we wanted to go to the reason it happens it's not because other people are beating you it's because people are programmatically beating you with Bots and the second thing that I also you know that we see that's just fascinating is that the notion of omnichannel has changed drastically you're not just competing Nike versus Adidas you're also competing Nike versus you know d2c Nike Dick Sporting Goods Nike unauthorized resellers and these unauthorized resellers are actually costing Brands millions and dollars a year even Dum Dums lollipops like the ones that you get from you know the hospital or the doctor is actually being Arbitrage and it's costing them millions of dollars a year and then we kind of know about these fake profiles on Twitter and you know these social media sites that we've seen or even if you live in New York Austin La you know if you try to go to your favorite restaurants big reason why they're booked is that the moment they come online they're taken and resold somewhere else so what we've done is we've actually created a platform like in a digital identity platform we're in real time without like interacting with the user we rank every order between zero and one hundred so we kind of use this real-time glass uh graph networking clustering to be able to find all these patterns of Randomness and associations between individuals and we create these really nice graphs to be able to say okay well these are Bots these are Bad actors these are duplicate accounts and so we actually work with some of the largest neighborhood sneaker stores in the world to help them prioritize hey I got a whole bunch of raffle entries right I got 400 000 raffle injuries for 50 pairs of shoes how do I use this to acquire new clients or prioritize existing ones how do I choose because today what they're doing is they're just randomly giving it out and people aren't actually buying them because people aren't even checking the email addresses that are going in so we've been actually working with a lot of this from Bad actors perspective but one of the new things that we've been able to see with this which has been really cool is helping Brands actually find their best customers so kind of through using the same clustering technology we've been able to say who are your most influential customers right how are they not just their individualized can we pause let's blow a circle yeah I think that might be over the two minutes so um Sam can you tell me can you tell me what this guy does what is the business yeah you're missing your one-liner my friend but basically uh it's a software that has 160 features that analyze in real times the patterns of random randomness and similarities at the customer transactional Product Company it's it's confusing dude can you explain that Jordan can you explain it to me like this we help blank customer who's your customer what type of person or business oh we help Brands and retailers more specific like give me one example like we help shoe brands or something yeah we help Brands like Nike to prioritize their best consumers for limited release products and also clean their data by pulling out kind of all the crap that goes in I don't so prioritize their top customers you basically you tell Nike who their top customers are we would say like for sneaker drops and limited release products like hey these are the new clients that you can acquire cheaply or hear the clients that you can actually prioritize that this is actually something meaningful compared to one person putting like 10 000 or a hundred thousand entries via Bots to get those products so you just prevent Bots from buying [ __ ] online we prevent and then what we also do is we actually kind of clean the data Downstream so we flag all of those accounts that can get pulled out of the CRM system that are kind of bloating the CRM system so like one of the things that we see from a lot of our clients is that they way overspend on you know the products that they use like clavio or you know kind of CRM products because a lot of the entries in there aren't actually legitimate so when I'm actually making decisions around how many products should I buy or how many products should I make what are people buying it's actually being skewed based off the amount of what's in there is actually just a bunch of duplicate versus actually unique consumers okay you are not the best at explaining your own company but that but you're not horrible I kind of get it after you explain it a bunch and but that's all good you can think you can improve that but do you have any um even on your website man I'm gonna be honest it's a little challenging to understand but I saw that you have a book demo thing do you are you booking demos are you do you have a product are people buying it yeah we have about 25 customers right now that's impressive what's the revenue the revenue right now when we convert to revenue is going to be around 15K mrr but it's free now is what you're saying it's free right now yep you need notable customers that you know like are anybody we would know of um I guess like based off the area you're in we work with a lot of like local sneaker stores so like in San Francisco we work on with a couple of same in Seattle same in Canada so mostly local sneakers do they love it and be honest do they love it do they like it or do they think it's just okay they love it I mean right now we're providing from our cost to Value we're providing for like if we're charging them a thousand dollars one of their stores we're providing ten thousand dollars in net new Revenue that we're acquiring in for them a month okay okay um you know honestly it's tough to give you feedback because the pitch was so confusing um so it's really difficult to try to assess that out right like just from the beginning you know like Sam said you need your one-liner or your one sentence description so that people need to have a clear picture in their head at the beginning of the presentation what the business does all right so you here's your first slide your first slide said yofi keep business human all right cool no idea what you do then I go to your second slide it's a team side experts at transforming data into recommendations our passion is keeping customer interactions authentic and meaningful still have no idea what you guys do then slide three everything is digital and you've been impacted and it says something about ticket sellouts and fake social media and brand loyalty is harder okay still don't know what you do and then the last one which is prioritize and reward your best customers we help you understand your customers and streamline every interaction I feel like there's 50 different ways that that could be described like that could mean 50 different uh Solutions and so and then the last slide is just your title again right so that was the whole pitch and so that's the that's I think the challenge here is for me at least I'm not able to really give you any useful feedback except for except for to say I think you gotta like flip this on its head and say we're yofi uh and we help you know we help businesses figure out who their most valuable customers are for example this is a shoe store the shoe store does drops every Friday but it's having this problem which is blah blah blah and that's a common problem so we give them this app that shows them a screen like this and these are all the top customers they push this button and our app costs a thousand dollars a month and look at this our we have 25 customers and on average we make them 10 grand a month in additional revenue and we also save them an additional thousand dollars a month because of the bloated CRM and like they don't actually need those contracts in there and then all these other reasons yeah and then you go you know then you could go on and here's why you know we even found this problem because we've spent our career doing this blah blah right so I think that's how I would try to reorient this pitch if I was you but the good news is is as you got into it and we were able to like work hard to kind of find the gold and all the dirt you had some good [ __ ] in there it does actually seem like an interesting product is that it's pretty impressive that you're have all these people using it you're saying they love it I have no idea if that's true but you're saying they love it that's really interesting that's hard to do with the software product when you're just working on it part-time so it seems actually fairly interesting I think your branding is kind of cool um but your messaging um needs a lot of work yeah that's helpful yeah and that's been our hardest thing is like we kind of matured it's like getting the messaging spot on because like we do a little bit more right we started with sneaker Bots now we've kind of expanded more to digital identity so having like a streamlined messaging of like what we do that's like a one-liners but I think you're making a common mistake which is we do a bunch of things we don't have just one customer we have like five five different types of customers and we do we have 100 features in our app so we do a bunch of things so what you do is you try to create this giant umbrella that's a catch-all like we help custom we help Brands understand their customers or streamline their customer interactions and the problem is nobody knows what the hell that means so instead you should go way narrower and be like uh you know whoever you're most of the 25 clients is there one type that's like you know the majority or half a half of the customers is it shoe stores secret stores yeah right now it's uh yeah sneaker store and Beauty so I would start by saying we help stores do X for example we have 25 customers right now and half of them are sneaker stores sneaker stores have this problem blah blah you talk about that you say but it's not just sneaker stores because yes sneakers do drops but so does Taylor Swift she does drops too and so does this brand they do drops too and they all have that same problem right and so that's kind of how you should explain it instead of trying to do this like an umbrella thing um okay cool uh thanks so much we got the we got one more I believe yeah we got we got Dolan from deal dog that's going to take us home Dolan from deal dog all right wonderful awesome so my name is Dolan and uh I create a deal though so deal dog's an exclusive campus Marketplace we launched this semester at the University of Michigan beginning with student football tickets and since then our traction has been good we have over 2 000 verified Michigan students on the app and those 2000 students have processed over ninety three thousand dollars of student tickets uh additionally with some traction numbers two-thirds of those tickets that have been listed on Deal dog have been sold to other users and we're growing in the next few months so what's the core problem essentially the way students buy and sell things on campus now is they go to group me or Facebook Marketplace those are filled with Bots and scammers uh and basically it's just a mess next they need to go to a platform like LinkedIn or Instagram to message the other person or verify the legitimacy finally they need to transact payment and there's friction between these LDS cash app there's a chicken in the egg problem versus who sends the item first and who pays first and overall it's just a complete mess so what makes deal dog different first of all we verify your umish email so you can't get into the app unless you have a verified student email it's a centralized place to find relevant items to students along with tools like filtering sorting and searching so here's an example on the left of what our app looks like if you were to log in versus on the right this is the the current state of the market full fill the scammers and Etc so what makes deal dog actually different so our app has gamified tools that turn student pain points into Fun experiences one of which that I demonstrated here is our tool called final offer basically if you're dealing with somebody they're wishy-washy you can't reach uh you know agreement on price you can use our final offer tool to send them your best offer if they reject it the conversation's over and if they accept it you know you agree to sell them that item This is highly scalable because when we expanded to New Markets we can add tools into this toolbar exactly like you do with imessage just help solve those needs understand so how does the scale this two is one of which is we're going to expand to different categories on campus we just launched the clothing and have great success uh our approach is to build things from the ground up instead of cloning other markets uh and again with our chat tools Integrations we're thinking about or to integrate on top of the apis of existing clothing platforms so that for instance if you want to find Michigan gear you can't find exactly what you're looking for on our app it'll redirect you to an existing platform and although we may lose that particular sale we want to make that buying experience as easy as fast and safe as possible for students so our future plans are to expand to new campuses uh we're going to build on top of the dominant ticketing apis that exist in the market today and additionally we're going to have an ambassador program so we can scale even faster both at Michigan and at other schools does this exist now or is this just an idea so this exists now uh it's been live for about two months just at Michigan we wanted to really validate our hypothesis and see what works with students and what doesn't work did you think he was making up the traction numbers or what I didn't see it wait I first slide he's like we have 2 000 students and that's in two months that's pretty impressive uh huh okay and what was your take on that you take ten percent yeah so one of the things that we wanted to hold off on is actually implementing the payments we've already built it but we didn't want to implement it yet because we're so new uh we thought it'd be a little uh it'd be a point of friction for students to be like hey you know we're launching this new app by the way what's your credit card number put in your banking details stuff like that uh we wanted to really get the product down first before we started actually you know taking money between the two parties when we do it's going to be between five and ten percent of whatever the transaction is okay uh all right cool thanks Sean what do you think yeah I think it's cool um I like some of the product details like I love the final offer thing I think that's great and I get it that like you know Craigslist Facebook Marketplace these things are like lower trust so having verified student IDs I think it's just great because it creates this like trust bubble so I really like that um I don't know how big this gets so that'd be my kind of question I don't really like these kind of like small take rate businesses where you take five or ten percent then you need the number to be massive on the transaction side in order for you to like make a lot of money um so I think that's the only question is just like I think this is really it's a useful product I think it's a cool project to work on um I wouldn't personally invest in this because I don't think it can be that big you would have to basically take a Facebook path where you would say we're gonna go get every College we're going to dominate that college it's going to be like the way that you transact in a in a trusted environment and then you say okay but it's not just colleges now we're going to do neighborhoods because we can send postcards out and verify that you live at the address like Nextdoor does and we're gonna you know you'd have to really believe that like two or three more miracles are gonna happen for this to be big um so I think that's my only that's my only knock on it which is not really like you know not every business has to be absolutely massive it's just when I invest I try to obviously slant towards things but it's the Network's effects it's a net in this business involves a network so in order for it to be successful everyone needs to be using it so my problem is not with Dolan the entrepreneur my problem is with this Market uh I think that even if you are a 10 out of 10 entrepreneur this is just like social apps even if you're a 10 out of 10 entrepreneur and you have 10 out of 10 execution it's just like it's so challenging to make this work you're going for like a four out of ten opportunity yeah it's just it's just so hard because you got you're competing with Craigslist you're competing with um Facebook marketplace now you're gonna be competing with the other incumbents that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars that are I think mostly failing like what was that thing called let's OfferUp offer up in Lego or Le something like that they bought Billboards they did everything they possibly could I don't think it's caught on uh and it's like well they prop the entrepreneurs I bet were really great they've raised hundreds of millions of dollars so Capital wasn't an issue and yet they still can't beat Craigslist which is just 30 dudes in an apartment working at which is I know this because I rented their apartment it was like a crappy apartment it's just 30 guys who are hippies and they're just like where it's like well you're just not going to beat us because everyone already uses this so it's like it doesn't matter how great you are uh and so it's really really hard you have so many things going against you and I want to invest in things that have Tailwinds and I just don't think that no matter how great you are you're going to catch a tidal wave I think you're always going to be paddling you know Upstream on this one yeah really good points we certainly have a lot to prove uh one of the things that we wanted to do is hey begin with college campuses the reason being is because you know at these big large State schools you got a student body of 50 60 000 people competing for 10 000 tickets and in that exact Niche you know the math really makes sense but I do agree in a lot of other cases it might not uh one of the things that we're expanding to working on if I may is a lot of these items that we're working on whether it be tickets second-hand Goods Services subletting uh the core mechanics of those can be distilled down and then scaled to other things so for instance if a campus group has a concert they bring a DJ whatever the case may be they can use our app an underlying ticket technology to distribute that on campus and so again it doesn't solve your core uh issue of you know it's a credibly difficult Market certainly I think that makes it worse actually I think that one of the few ways that these business one of the few ways these businesses can work is by like being very Niche so you have Poshmark for women's clothing you've got um uh grail for men's streetwear uh you know there's like dozens of these that are like pretty big companies I think Poshmark is a multi-billion dollar company thredup I don't know what their Niche is but some type of like clothing for a certain genre a person I think that when you appeal to everyone you appeal to no one and I think that and really to make this work you'd have to select like I'm sure that there's what's the one call for tennis or for sneakers stockx or something like that yeah code yeah yeah like these are huge businesses because they just focused on one thing and it's far easier to have a wedge where you start with a small group of people who are passionate and care about them and get them to use it versus well we're gonna do tickets and then we're gonna do this and then we're gonna do this it's like no man I think you just build a big thing you just focus on this one thing and so appealing to everyone so sublets um so Apartments uh and then tickets and then you had clothing on your deck I think that's actually in my opinion turns me off even more not again not entirely on you I just think that like there's just so many things outside of your control you know like Seafair was going to compete against like paper you are going to compete against Zuck Craigslist and like hundreds and billions of dollars of invested Capital into this I just don't think it's it's not a safe bet it's not a good bet yeah really good points there and something to work on for sure and by the way I would say uh like when I was in college our first idea was uh it's always this this and roommates well no this would have been better than my first idea the one we did at straight out of college was like a sushi restaurant chain to try to create a a restaurant chain and like um it was the same thing we could be 10 out of 10 um execution 10 out of 10 creativity like fundamentally like restaurants are like you know sort of like a two out of ten opportunity it's like one of the worst types of businesses you can try to start and you know so we had a point where a year in we were like cool we won this businessman competition we we can do this it's not that we can't do it we're having success with our first location but like we got to remember this is just our first idea maybe we're more entrepreneurs than we are restaurateurs and maybe this first idea is the one that got our wheels turning but let's not commit more years to something if we Rec once we recognize that this is a two out of ten opportunity we should just say okay cool let me guess be a college kid let me have my opportunity my time back and let me put it on another better opportunity and so that's what I would do if uh if I was you but just FYI getting 93 000 of transactional value to prosectional volume is super super super impressive that is amazing so maybe you could prove us wrong and be like and you said two out of three tickets you just be like look we're just gonna build a different Stub Hub and it's gonna be better because we're marketing Wizards and who knows why it's gonna be better maybe you're gonna prove us wrong but 93 000 and 2300 users in a three months incredibly impressive that is wildly impressive so you're you're also a superstar I'm just gonna I don't know if you're gonna pull it off in this genre but we'll see yeah awesome thank you guys so much uh as a closing note like if you have any advice on this it seems like the of the people that do use our app um you know they almost exclusively use it to sell their tickets and other things if you decide not to bail I would stick with tip kits and stick on that for at least one year and talk to users constantly and see what happens but I would stick with tickets but and I wouldn't even worry about expansion I would just figure out what makes them come back over and over and over again because I imagine if I had to look into StubHub and seat geek CAC is the biggest issue and I'm just guessing I've not researched this yep all right Dolan thank you so much um and all right we pick a winner we pick a winner now so that is the uh my first million presents University of Michigan pitch competition super impressive caliber of entrepreneurs like I said um love this community you know Bobby Bobby my bi-weekly killer good job putting this group together um we gotta pick a winner so Sam how do you want to do this I think also let's talk about uh like who's in the top three and then you and I slack with me I just slacked you my top two you and I slack and just tell me uh what you want to do and I'll tell you if I approve and I agree with your vote but basically um let's go let's go in order so third runner-up uh or like you know but maybe made my top three I guess uh I just give you give you three in a random order so um I liked Seafarer like I said I want to actually invest in that I think that that's a a really cool idea going into a boring boring industry that's painful complicated and I think you know not going to be easy to sell into but if they do very easy to get lock in and I think they can make money doing basically payroll for the shipping you know shipping industry for people who work on ships so I really like that idea um internet activism was super impressive they you know have built a website that got 600 million users they uh built an Airbnb thing for Ukrainian refugees that had a hundred thousand people stay you know in homes that's kind of it's just crazy it's ludicrous and that's a career maker just that I mean that number and just the idea of a non-profit that's not uh driven by you know what nonprofits are driven by today which is sort of like fundraising and sales and marketing it's like we're hackers we just build stuff that's going to help help people and that's what we do and I I really kind of resonate with that um I've seen the power of that one time um the guy who was investing in our idea lab he was like Hey I want to do this thing for this charity I support called charity water you know but instead of just giving money what if we gave our talent what if we built something and we built a charity website that was designed to go viral it was like could you make charity go viral that was the mission we spent three months on it and I remember we got I don't know five million people to like come visit the thing and we raised I think 800 000 for the cause um and so like I've seen how Builders can help charity in a way that's kind of unique and then um and then also Jake from tabs chocolate who's doing the NFC tagging thing I thought that was another good one I think I think a cut below the other two but a honorable mention what do you think I agree entirely I think Jordan just did a really good bad job of pitching and but I actually think that that business is actually really intriguing and could be great I think it's just a boring software company that I like I think it could be a really great business uh but he was so bad at pitching that it ruined the fact that it's a cool company I think uh and I actually think that he's got a lot he doesn't have as much traction as Internet activism but if he does actually have 30 or however however many said 20 customers using his software I think that's a fairly pretty big deal because it seems kind of hard to sell into them so um I sent to you what I think should be the winner it's the last thing I said do you agree or not agree um I don't agree I think it should be this other one what do you think okay so let's just say who the top two are yeah top two we got are Seafarer and internet activism so internet activism [ __ ] amazing this guy made me want to quit and join him my issue with him not him my issue with giving them the money is they already have a great thing going and they're kind of crushing it it feels weird giving this money to a non-profit uh I'd rather just give them my own personal money but he is so impressive that I was I I this guy's gonna be uh on the cover of Fortune or Forbes I think in the next five years so I'm I would be fine giving them money but Seafair it's an idea man we could just be the first money in to actually make them like build something so that's why that's interesting yeah I I feel the same way but I think for C4 I would put my personal money in as an investment but I think for the prize money of this I think that if we put it into internet activism it's going to save lives and uh and honestly like he was of the bunch he was the most missionary and like you could just tell like for example the guy's a Visionary all these other people I feel like if I talk to him six months from now they could be working on something completely different and that's totally normal and okay especially if you're in college I actually encourage that but when you know you know this guy was like kind of aggro where he was like you know um yeah I could go work on a CRM tool or it's like whatever but like you know after that I'm doing this and that is something I really really respect I don't he was looking for validation I think he was trying to get the word out and so that I respect that dude I looked up one of the co-founders of Internet activism on Twitter and um he uh his background picture was Zuck was Mark Zuck given the middle finger and I used to have that same background and so I'm on board man uh I agree with you we'll give it to internet activism I think that they are awesome I think all the folks here are are were incredibly impressive dude the one that we [ __ ] on the most I think was deal dog the guy got ninety three thousand dollars a transactional value in three months like no one does that very impressive all around kudos to everybody and I gotta say we're not picking interactivism for the do-good like the guy's pitch was dope his first line where he's like you know people in poor communities have have more access to cell phones than they do to toilets right he his pitch was good his traction was good we built things that have gotten hundreds of millions of visits right um his idea was a big idea of encrypted messaging app that can't be shut down basically an Unstoppable messaging app that's gonna help people in certain places right and I think he was the most committed founder that's why not because uh to charity just give them the money I also think he's a [ __ ] I think these guys are [ __ ] I think that these guys are like uh the good type of [ __ ] I think that they're the people who I'm gravitated towards I like people who just like and frankly a lot of these guys had that Vibe I mean tabs chocolate from Jake definitely has that Vibe um they have this like attitude of like screw it I'm just gonna do this and we're just gonna see what we're gonna find out yes and I love that mentality this guy just displayed it the best for this in this particular case but these guys all had this like punk rock vibe that I love so and that's guys that's that's everybody in this room right now even though rich man had it yeah we got um and Jonathan and Mike when I like were struggling to take five um there we we could have had 20 pitches he was like [ __ ] on the traditional clubs and like other like official organizations and he's like no we're the underground we're the underground real ones and I I respect that dude this reminds me I mean they were further along than us and smarter than us but when you and I were like 23 24 25 hanging out at your office a monkey Inferno we surrounded ourselves with these types of freaks and a lot of them have gone on to build literally 20 or 30 billion dollars worth of companies You Know Jack Smith uh your boy um furcon uh like these guys have built like huge uh Ryan Hoover all these guys have built some really huge companies and these guys remind us of this and I think that it's actually I hope send this to you University of Michigan they're blowing it man by not empowering you guys uh so I I think that's crazy yeah send me a hoodie I'm wearing a Michigan hoodie on the next pot I'm I'm a me too you know who else came from uh University of Michigan was our boy Michael uh from from future who's a total that has this exact same Vibe of just pretty one of the one of the first members of this organization whatever you want to call it and uh yeah this is uh this is credit to these guys and gals this is not credits

so he's written I think five or six best-selling business books non-fiction business books air business life hack type books and if he was going to do just another one of those it would have been like okay cool like you know just going back to the you know what butter is your brand right that's that makes sense but instead he's like I'm gonna build like a world like Game of Thrones and he's like I'm gonna build a whole thing right like this like it's an entire fantasy world all the characters are roosters okay there's eight houses they compete in the great games and they do this like you know then you know there's a war and there's different classes and there's all the all the things like if you create like a sort of a giant fantasy like you know Tolkien or or George R Martin style thing and along with it there's like basically an nft which you can buy that basically is not like is is literally just like you're buying a piece of art and you're buying a ticket into the entertainment of like watching him build this world [Music] what's up in this episode we're talking about hanging out with Tim Ferriss a guy that we've looked up to for a long time and some of the insights that he he shared with us we talked about uh meeting a real estate billionaire and his model how he built from scratch in seven years to about a billion dollars in real estate assets we talked about the opportunity to build SAS tools for only fans yeah you're going to want to hear that and then last but not least Sam's got a uh a friend who's created his own I don't know religion sort of like the Amish people who love money kinda it is almost like Amish people who love money I'm going to this thing I'm going to give a big update on it next week but in this episode when we start off I'll tell you a little bit about it I think you're gonna dig it but yes that's the episode listen up all right we live can I tell you about an interesting call ahead with uh with your old pal Tim Ferriss I'm so eager to hear this I only asked you a few questions because I was waiting to hear about this so I interviewed Tim Ferriss because he's got like a new nft project that came out today or it's coming out today and um yeah called [ __ ] punch right so I was like okay what's that about and um I was like yo you should come on the milk Road and like tell your story and um blah blah blah and I've met Tim Ferriss one time in my life you've met him a lot more than that I think because he was an investor in the hustle and was kind of like it lived around the same area as you or whatever but I've met him one time and I guess I'll just I want to tell you three things one it's pretty interesting to meet people who you've really gotten to know through their content uh what was it the the only fans girl who came on here called it the parasocial relationship where it's like I feel like I know a lot about you and to you I'm a complete stranger but you know I I feel like we're close friends because I know so much about you and you don't even know who the hell I am that's how I feel with Tim Ferriss that's how people feel with you and I I bet yeah it happens with with you and I um and you know I was like well and it's just like a weird dynamic it's not weird it's not like bad or good it's like a strange Dynamic it's a natural thing that happens with content like this so I read the four hour work week when I was in college and I got yo before covid-19 there was the four hour fever and the four hour fever was what happened to you right when you read that book for the next four hours you question every part of your life and you start fever dreaming about quitting everything you know hiring a VA to do your job going and living in Argentina and you know like basically creating some online passive income business is going to give you 7K a month because that's your freedom number and so like and I know this because everybody I gave the book to I'm like look you might want to clear the schedule because you're going to have the four hour fever as soon as you're done with this uh like just don't make plans because whatever they are they're gonna get busted by this and sure enough that's exactly what happened so for our work week was one of those books that I found to be really really life-changing uh informative life-changing especially at the time that I read it I was 20 21 years old trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life and um it was a new it was somebody saying you know here's how I live and it was totally different than anybody else okay so that's how I knew him um you knew him in a different way can you describe how you knew them and then I went to tell you some of the takeaways I had from this interview so I initially met him when I was I was coming home at six a.m from the hospital after I got a kidney stone my wife was driving me and I was sitting in the passenger seat and I was super messed up on morphine and all types of drugs and I pull up to my house and I go Sarah what the hell is Tim Ferriss doing in front of our house and uh I see him I go Tim what's up bro what are you doing here and uh he's like oh I looked on the pocket it's like oh sick hey you got any uh cures for kidney stones and I just sounded like a total [ __ ] and then two days later I see him again I go Tim what's going on man I just want to apologize I I was come from the hospital I was all hopped up in drugs but I'm a huge fan that's cool that you're you're you live around here and then through that we just started walking our dogs like in the park every once in a while together and I would just see him in the park then a few weeks later I get an email from Tim saying hey I want to learn about emailing I like the hustle teach me about it can you go out you can when you meet me at this restaurant in my neighborhood I go and meet him at that restaurant he goes oh what the hell you're the dog guy I go what's up man he goes why don't you so I basically he cold emailed me and I never told him who I was and it was a total coincidence and and that's how I got to know him so I want to say two things one I'm gonna tell people My Philosophy about meeting people that you kind of you know admire or you think highly of in some way and the main trick that I have is I admire parts of people not the whole totally and this is a key key thing that I think a lot of people get wrong they look at it as a binary yes or no thing oh this person do you love them or do you do you hate them right are they the best are they the worst right are they are they your hero are they not your hero and I never think like that because when you meet people you see this like full 360 picture of them and you're like oh like no for example I'm at Tim Ferriss and who's actually quite quiet in person the first time he's super quiet and uh he's a little bit introverted or shy and um and then when he did say things I was like uh oh wow that's like a little bit of the Tim Ferriss that I you know I've heard or followed coming out but also I was like you know even though I love 10 things about this guy there's a couple things about him that I wouldn't want to emulate right there's six things I'd want to copy let's say about the way that Tim Ferriss lives his life but I was like oh you know something that's really important to me is like let's say kids are having a family and I don't know if it's important to him or not I don't know him that well but he doesn't have that so I don't wanna I don't want to be him right I don't want to be whole but there's parts of him that I think are awesome that I would love to steal from my game and I think about this with everybody I imagine you like standing over him and he's just sitting down in your Pokemon with a stick and you're like come on tell me life hacks like come on what you did with your kidney stone things like you ever seen you have one of these on your feet what do you do yeah maybe you should ask a doctor and so same thing with Tony Robbins I love Tony Robbins but do I love the whole Tony Robbins no I love parts of Tony Robbins and some people are like dude what about that thing he did or that thing he said oh my God I don't I mean I don't know about that and if he did those that that would be bad but I love his public speaking I think he's amazing at that and that's what I try to steal from right or I love his mindset around XYZ and that's what I've adopted from and that's been really helpful and this other stuff that's either not applicable or not admirable no it's fine I just don't take that right I'm just walking through the farmer's market picking up little bits and pieces of people and being like Oh you know like Conor McGregor now is like basically looks like he's like a roid head you know like Coke I don't know he's got allegations of sexual assault and he's just coked out or who knows this guy's nuts but like Conor McGregor from the years 2015 to 2018 yeah you know what they call the young hungry Connor that's the counter I liked that was the things I drew a lot from and I don't let the other stuff really tarnish that because I'm just only looking for the good and the bad I just say oh somebody else can pick that that bad apple up I'm not taking that out all right so what about that so that's just my general philosophy okay so let me tell you some of the Nuggets that I took away from this interview because it was supposed to be I mean Frankly Speaking it was supposed to be like to first comes on the milk Road that's cool that's sort of like a bucket list item thing for me but you know for him obviously it was a good way to get the word out about his nft project so I thought I went in with like you know pretty low expectations generally when somebody goes on to like announce the launch of something they're kind of just chilling that thing he didn't do that so that was kind of cool and he said a bunch of things that were I would I would say life advice or money advice that I thought were interesting do you want the money or the life one first money all right money one so I was like what Tim what are you doing now crypto prices are crashing what are you doing um are you making any adjustments do you look at the prices he's a crypto guy by the way yeah he said he bought crypto Bill bought Bitcoin for the first time but like late 2012 and been accumulating kind of since he's like it's a you know significant thing for me not like you know not everything but it's significant they said last year Q3 2021 he sold enough to cover like feel like he kind of covered his cost basis and banked a little bit of a win and then the rest he's just like you know holding to to see how it all plays out and he was like he said a couple interesting things he goes I've made most of my money mistakes selling early selling too early and he gave a bunch of examples he goes you know I owned I was the first advisor in Shopify super early on and I owned pre-ipo shares of Twitter and Facebook and as soon as they went public uh you know uh you know yeah so they grow they go public and you know in that first year they all hit like turbulent times and they you know stock went way down he's like I just as soon as a lockup was over I just sold because Stock's going down I was kind of a novice in public markets frankly still a bit of a novice in public markets I didn't know what to do so I just sold all of it it's like yeah all of it I think he didn't specify that but he made it sound like all of it wow and he's like those are massive Financial mistakes you know like selling Facebook Shopify and Twitter like right when they went public um you know six months after is when the lockup ends is you know he's like these are you know hideous Financial mistakes that I made he's like and it wasn't because I he's like there's he's like he's like so I learned what when do you sell so he goes I now go into any position I only buy if I know what conditions I would sell under he's like so most people have no exit plan they don't know when they would sell how long they plan to hold or what would cause them to sell he's like I now have a plan when I go in I know what would trigger me to sell so if I'm going to deviate from that plan I better have a really strong reason because the second thing is I don't sell now because you know the price went down I sell if something I believe before I now have new information that tells me that's not true anymore or I'm surprised about he's like so for crypto for example he's like I haven't sold but I haven't sold that because I'm like you know more confident than ever he was frankly I just haven't done the homework to go figure out where any of my initial assumptions wrong I haven't done that homework yet and he's like that's what I'll do I'll go talk to my smart friends the ones who help me get into this and I'll say you know is there anything that you used to believe that you no longer believe about crypto or anything that any red flags that have come up for you that didn't go in line with your initial hypotheses I want to hear those before I make a decision on what I want to do I thought that was extremely reasonable and I thought that the the sort of selling early uh mistake is something that you know I I've shared on the Pod too that you know like I sold Tesla early when there was like you know I basically lost 5 million I lost out on five million dollars had I held um but I you know there was a bunch of bad news and I didn't know what to do and so then I just sold right and by the way for the Shopify example it looks like six months after it was around two dollars and fifty cents a share at its peak at its peak Peak it was a hundred and fifty dollars so that's something like you know a million dollars of shares that he had which he definitely could have had would have been like 50 million dollars uh which is like very substantial and so he was pointing out you know my mistakes in investing haven't been buying the wrong thing the biggest mistakes have been selling the right thing too early and you know that I think that might be you know he's like you know I don't know if this applies to everybody's like for me that has been you know some of my largest kind of uh missteps um okay so then the second thing he was talking about uh this project that he's doing this nft project and I was like so this is kind of crazy I don't know if you know what do you know what he's doing I know that he's always been interested in non-fiction writing or sorry fiction writing like he's always wanted to write like stories and for some reason he hasn't until now right and I think this is like his first fictional story or book or series of podcasts and it comes with an nft right yeah exactly so he's written I think five or six best-selling business books non-fiction business books and business life hack type books and if he was going to do just another one of those it would have been like okay cool like you know going back to the you know what butter is your bread right that's that makes sense but instead he's like I'm gonna build like a world like Game of Thrones and he's like I'm gonna build a whole thing or like this like it's an entire fantasy world all the characters are roosters okay there's eight houses they compete in the great games and they do this like you know then you know there's a war and there's different classes and there's all the all the things like if you create like a sort of a giant fantasy like you know Tolkien or or George R Martin style thing and along with it there's like basically an nft which you can buy that basically is not like is is literally just like you're buying a piece of art and you're buying a ticket into the entertainment of like watching him build this world out it's a book like one book it it's not a book it's like I think it's just like long he's like I've written 10 000 words but uh I don't think he's gonna release it like a book I think he's gonna release it in some other way like essays or chapters or podcasts and like other okay he's playing with different formats I don't think he knows exactly how he wants it to come out yet so anyways pretty interesting I was like dude so why are you doing this he's like well he said a couple nuggets he goes you know I'm having the most fun when I'm creating something and that's what gets me into Flow State and so he's like so I knew I wanted to create something and I wanted to if I just did another nonfiction book I don't feel like I would have that magical feeling of being challenged and satisfied at the same time yeah um and so he goes he goes I talked to the guy from who did Stephen pressfield who I think wrote uh the war of art yeah um and he goes he goes you know um he has this concept of a muse which is like the project you're working on or like you know the thing that you're you're playing with and he goes you're doing your Muse a disservice if you don't go big and uh he goes so I decided like if I'm gonna do this I'm gonna go big and he goes like big is not um I have to write like an 8 000 word book or whatever like it doesn't page book like that's big doesn't mean like literal volume big means I have to go to a point where I'm uncomfortable with this and my friends are calling me and they're saying Tim are you okay sure this is what you want to do and he's like that's how I know that I've like pushed it into a realm that's like something interesting is gonna happen and that's how I feel with this yeah what's up with this podcast what do you mean no with him coming up with a non-fiction thing called or a fiction thing yeah you want to call him and be like I'm like yeah I'm like you know you have nothing to lose here because like you know you're set you're fine and if this is creative that's cool but like it's kind of weird what do you what what are you doing man like are you okay yeah exactly and he goes That's when I'm gonna basically do the things that are off the beaten path something that I haven't done before something that is new and interesting and novel and so that's how he was talking about this thing I was like okay I love that advice um the second thing he said it was along those lines he goes um he goes I go so I go what if we're just sitting here like you know a year from now she's got a beer we're like dude what happened with [ __ ] punch man that story was that was going to be that project was crazy like where did it all go wrong like if it all goes wrong what do you think your answer will be if we're we're looking back at it a year from now and it's just like the yeah that went that went totally wrong what is the core risk it goes I've thought about this a lot it's a good question he goes if I end up managing the project instead of creating it I think it will have all gone wrong he goes because a he goes he goes anything great comes from you know staying at it he goes so I have to do the things that give me energy because without the energy there is no endurance and that like really resonated with me he was like you know with no energy there is no endurance he goes so I gotta spend my time on the things that give me energy for me that's drawing and that's creative writing so I have to do those parts that's also the parts that those are my superpowers that's what I'm good at and I'm doing better like like you did in the background was like illustrations and Comics like that's how hey really stuff like that yeah he's like a sketch artist and I think that's what he originally wanted to do was be a cartoonist in some way and so he was like you know those are my superpowers I gotta spend the time on that if I just end up spending time managing this thing and it feels like a lot of administrative work I know that for me that gives me no energy therefore no endurance therefore I won't stay stay with it therefore the great things won't happen I thought the self-awareness was really key and this is something that I know as I think about my next projects these are the types of like you need to have like these strong ass pillars or tenets of like this is what it this is what I am doing this is what I'm not doing and if I do this I think it'll work and if I don't do this I know that I will have trouble and I think that self-awareness is pretty baller dude that's awesome he's he's always been a pretty wise person even like you know I think he wrote four-hour work week when he was maybe a little bit younger than you and I like at he might have been only 30 when he wrote it and he always was pretty wise man he's he's always had like interesting insight and that's a really good insight about the energy and the endurance thing he had another one that goes he goes I go so um I was on the topic of failure he goes he goes I should first say that I kind of rigged the deck in my favor and I was like what do you mean and he goes you know I um I go into a project thinking how do I win even if this fails how do I succeed even at the sales and so he goes I think about it in terms of sure there's the like you know um do a lot of people read this thing and you know does this become popular or does it become financially successful sure those are things but like he's like I want to win even if those hard things don't happen so he goes I will only pick projects if I know that the act of doing it the creative process of doing it is going to be awesome if the people I'm gonna meet along the way doing this are going to be awesome and if the skills that I'm going to develop doing this are going to make me more awesome and so he goes if I do those three things if I know that the skills the knowledge and the network that I acquire along the way is gonna make it worth it for me then I don't have to stress about the the popularity of the financial income because I'm going to win in either case I'm going to win if just those things happen or I'm gonna win even bigger if the other happens so he goes I pick projects where I can stack the deck in my favor and that's what I've done here and is this still the life it or the money advice or the life one now we're in the Life advice yeah dude he's good man he's a really interesting guy I uh what's he doing now so he just like is he is he treating that as like that's been his like 40 Hour Work Week like that's been his job job uh yeah he's been he's just going ham on this for like you know close to a year now and he's like dude I've just put so many so many hours into this he's like you know which is funny because people are criticizing like oh dude you're doing an nft or just like another celebrity doing an nft it's just a cash grab and I like I told him this on the call I was like dude that's crazy to me first of all he's donating 100 of the proceeds to like his charity that does like the research on like psychedelics and stuff like that to treat PTSD so so all the primary sales are going there right uh so that's like you know most you know that's a huge chunk of the financial reason you would do it uh the second thing is um if you just count like the number of hours it takes to do this world building type of thing like he's got to be working for minimum wage basically just in terms of the number of hours it takes to create something like this and third if he was going to do a cash grab nft he would have done it last last year he wouldn't be launching it now and he wouldn't be giving away the money to charity and he would be like doing it in a way that's like not doesn't require him to like build out this whole fictional world like he would just be like hey here's a picture or hey meet this you know this gives you five minutes to talk to Tim Ferriss right that's what he would do is just like a cash grab if he wanted to do it and so I thought that was like you know dude funny criticism Tim has like a really interesting celebrity Ryan holiday has this too and I know I've known a few guys that have had this where there's people I look up to and then there's people who the people I look up to look up to so like Ryan and Tim they both get like all these football coaches all these like politicians these rich billionaire types all these interesting like powerful traditionally powerful people will reach out to them and like hey Sensei show me the way what can I do about this what should I do next and I've always found that type of celebrity to be incredibly fascinating and so like I mean he'll Tim will like not in a bad way but he'll like name drop all these stories like on the pot I'll be like yeah you know I was with Ed Norton recently and he was telling me like this this and this and I was trying to help him like figure out what to do you know like he like tells these stories or like when I was with Jamie Foxx he was asking me about this and uh I've always found that celebrity be so fascinating I've always wondered what his life is like I also I asked him another question I go you know you're one of the most like prolific interviewers you've done I don't know 600 episodes of of interviews on your podcast it's one of the top I don't know five or ten podcasts in the world and um as I go you know if you had a chance to sit down with Sam bankman freed uh and interview him you got a couple hours with them how would you approach it and I thought his answer was pretty interesting so he goes he goes it's a tricky one because I don't know going in how much of what he's gonna tell me is the truth or a lie and so he goes but I'll tell you how I would approach it given that that's the problem he goes first I would my goal initially is just to get him off of his party lines get him off of his PR script and so he's like I would go and I would try to talk to as many of his old friends and co-workers as I can and ask them yo if I if you you know you must be surprised at what's happened here if you could ask Sam one question just genuinely Heart to Heart what would you want to know the answer to that I can maybe ask on your behalf and then he's like I get those he's like then in the interview I would use their name to kind of soften soften them up a little bit so I talked to James who you know should call Drew mate and knew you before any of this stuff right when you were just a guy blah blah uh you know he said he would want to know this like what would you say to James because it's like saying to James versus sanctity I think it's like interesting so I thought that was an interesting tactic he goes that gives me good research but also maybe can get him to just like deviate from the same repetitive Loop of answers he's going to give to everybody else he knows the second thing he goes I'd be pretty direct I go what percent of what you say to you know before we do this what percent should I assume is true of the things that you're going to tell me is it a hundred or is it less than a hundred and like you know if it's less than 100 I understand that but why anyways another version of that would be you're doing a lot of media um what do you what do your lawyers think of what you're doing he's like because it might make him laugh and get him to kind of talk about his motivations for why he's even doing an interview like this because it seems kind of counterintuitive to be doing all the stuff no lawyer would tell you to go go on do this stuff he goes the last thing he goes he goes you know I would um it goes I would he goes I just want to know the guy's fundamental beliefs because it seems like he's not stupid he's got good Hardware upstairs and that's why I want to know what his beliefs are uh you know am I just supposed to assume that he's just a bad person he was a criminally minded person and for a long time he planned to do this criminal Behavior or was he did he have the right intentions and then somewhere along the way made a bad ethical decision under some stress or pressure and that led him down a path of making the wrong decisions you know like and he's like that's what I'd be trying to figure out and you know I would try to um to understand you know his uh you know his thinking around that and tell him that's what I want to know I want to understand that I thought that was pretty cool so I'll I'll wrap up with one last story about Tim so and this what you're saying kind of like he'll he'll say these things sometimes in interviews as if he's coming off the cuff or that he's like just thinking out loud I have never met someone like him who prepares for everything he prepares for every single thing and this is quite different than you and I you and I are totally cool improvising and you would think someone like him who's interviewed all these people or has talked publicly for so many hours that they can improvise maybe he can but from my experience he is not someone who improvises and he everything he says the words are chosen very very specifically and so you like he'll say this line like oh I don't play a doctor on TV and I don't pretend to do that like he'll say that line and like that's just like he must have heard that somewhere he's like okay that's actually a good line to get that's a good brand message disarm yeah I'm gonna keep saying that and so another thing that he'll do is like one time I interviewed him for the hustle and I interviewed him on the phone and then I transcribed it and there was a couple instances where I made an heir so he was right to yell at me and he didn't yell at me but he was just like no this is that's not what I said and we're talking about like I I would write the word hadn't instead of had not he said had not and I wrote hadn't so I was in fact wrong and he like very specifically called that out and he did that so or he's like no there shouldn't be a comma here there should be a period and then a new sentence or like these like incredibly incredibly if he did that then he's gonna be pretty pissed at this interview because I definitely dude you know move stuff around to help him no he does not like that and I don't blame him he's so specific about his brand and in fact if you go and see the like for example there's this conference called 212 that I went to and Tim went and he gave a testimonial for it and if you read the testimonial it's very specific where in his head he's like why I can't endorse anything like but like what I can't say is you know Adam hosted a great conference they're wonderful he's he's a wonderful person or like like you know like some people will ask us you and I like I've asked you to do a testimonial for something and you're like just write whatever uh no not him everything about his brand like what you see out in public and what he writes he is very specific and it's all incredibly well thought out so like we almost had him speak at a conference or something like that and we just like went through we just started chatting about it and he was like wanting to know exactly who all was there and I'm like what do you mean dude why does it matter to you just like [ __ ] wing it just talk and like that's not his style at all like it it was all incredibly precise well thought out it's all and everything had a purpose and I've I've always found that to be very admirable about him because I remember being pissed off when he he didn't yell at me but like he kind of like had a tone where he's like no that's not what I said this is what I said I remember being upset about that and then I was like nah man he's right he's he he's has a brain and he's sticking to it and I always thought that was really interesting yeah well all right Tim I'm sorry I did uh definitely chop and chop up for the interview to to try to make it shorter and better when to go live went to go live it's already live too late tell me if he replies to you that's gonna be the follow-up I bet you he will he he honestly he's very specific about it and I appreciate that you're right I had told him I was like um he's like he's like yeah I'll do it uh you know just send me the questions in advance so I want to make sure I can prepare and to do the best job I can and I was like well I don't know the questions I'm gonna ask you so uh okay I guess I'll do the work now and so I did it and then he's like okay cool uh for this question I think we should do this and this and this and I was like wow this is like way more in depth than anybody and then even during the thing he's like he's like I did an audio video test earlier blah blah blah it should be good because he's like you know whatever in some foreign country right now and he's like you know I am um and then on some of the answers she's like okay stop can we um can I redo that I think I was just not being clear there and then he would like do it again and I was like wow we're so different but I get why being the way that you are leads you to have the type of brand and and success that you have um I am so different than that I am like you know complete I'm basically like the equivalent of a food fight and he's like a Michelin star restaurant exactly you're like so fascinating throwing mashed potatoes around and getting it everywhere and he's like you know got that perfect place dude I remember we were with our dogs like walking and I go oh that's a cool dog leash and like or like cool dog collar or something and he and I was expecting him to be like oh yeah I got an Amazon's pretty great he was like oh this thing you see this comes from like this rare like African horse hair and like he had like some in-depth story about it and that was my friend and then I noticed every time something like we had these conversations everything about his life it felt very purposeful High intense intentional yeah I thought that was fascinating yeah that's cool uh it really highlights like it's like you see a 12 out of 10 at being very intentional and then you're like oh wow I thought I might have been an eight or a nine actually I'm a four totally he's very specific our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better all right you want to do another one of yours yeah let's do some other topics Okay so uh where do you want to shift to maybe some ideas uh what's the is Spotify interesting or real estate insights that's I'm interested in that you said maybe but all right let me give you the real estate thing real quick so I talked to somebody I can't say their name but uh who has had who's built I would say in the last seven years I think it is yes seven years they've built a real estate portfolio owning about a billion dollars of real estate assets where with 40 debt um so 60 is equities about 600 million of equity in these properties and do I know this started seven years ago um from zero and has zero ability to like zero networks your ability to borrow only like skills they knew they thought they knew what they were doing and they were able to build this up okay so I was talking to him and I was like I was like you'd and he does retail in a specific he does retail real estate so basically uh or I guess in their world they would call it commercial real estate but what I mean is like retail stores so he'll buy a shopping center and the shopping center will have a um you know a Hobby Lobby and um you know a Starbucks and whatever and there's like you know six spots and he'll basically own that Center and then he'll he'll get at least he'll buy it he'll build on it he'll lease it up and then he'll either hold it or sell it after that and he's basically compounded his money I think about I was doing the calculations afterwards um he's compounded his money about 60 a year um for like you know seven years or something like that even maybe even a little bit more um and so I think 60 was the minimum that I calculated was possible for where he was at I think is is a little bit a little bit north of that and I was like dude I was like I was like first of all this is crazy congratulations second of all my world view is that like dude shopping centers like is this still a thing like aren't you is this not dying like in my world in the tech World we're just like everything's going online everything's e-commerce you know you're going You're swimming against the current and I go am I just wrong about that or what's going on how do I I mean Hobby Lobby folks are always gonna need a Lobby to hobby bro like they're they're they're they're they're going in real life like so that's what he said he goes you're right he goes but there are some specific Trends some specific categories that are going completely anti-training expanding Like Home Depot probably because I go I go how does it work he goes like what's your Edge like what are you doing differently than anybody else because you're getting a dramatically better result than anybody else I know in real estate it goes well I'll get a call from you know the owner of uh you know whatever Dollar General or something like that and they'll say hey literally we're not the owner like like an executive like someone an executive there you mean could be the CEO it could be the head of real estate whoever somebody somebody at the top of these companies and they'll say look we're trying to get into Lexington Kentucky um you know we want to be in that Geo and we or we want more stores in that Geo uh can you make this happen and I'm like and he's like so they're not gonna make it happen I go no no Slow Down slow down I go so what why do they call you he's like well they've done business with me I'm like okay great but like why aren't they just calling a broker like or somebody in Lexington and he's like he's like I need to start laughing he's like uh he's like you know or even specific more specifically I'm like so then you have to find the right location he goes no sometimes they'll just tell me we want to be in this location I was like then why don't they just contact the guy from there and like just do the deal and he's like I'm like they have re these companies have real estate teams he's like oh he's like yeah they do he's like but he's like three things he goes number one most of the owners of these places are like a pain in the ass for them to deal with he goes they know I'm easy to do business with why most owners don't want to invest in their properties they won't do any tenant improvements I will invest money to build out the stores the way they want um and because I've been willing to do that they want they would prefer to work with me over any other developer or like the average developer because I have shown that I can build fast and I will invest my own dollars into building it okay second thing and I go but doesn't that guy just think like man if I just did this he goes yeah but it's speculation he goes I know because I have these relationships I know they'll come through that owner would have to like on spec invest in in maybe improving something part of their property in order to make it more inhabitable I'll just do it and by the way so he gets the Hobby Lobby like interest then he can go get a loan and tell the bank hey I got interest uh in this therefore not even that you know he'll get the interest then he'll go tie up the property he'll commit to buy it but he doesn't have to have the money right away he has 90 days or whatever he's got to like close the thing 30 days 60 days whatever it is and in that time he then goes against Hobby Lobby to sign the lease then he goes to the financiers he says here's the here's a property with a signed 10-year lease from a you know from a highly reputable client can I now get financing it sounds like the best business ever yeah exactly and they're like oh Hobby Lobby is not going down to business anytime soon you have a 10-year tenant yeah this is an easy this is all easy so then he was like he's like I was like okay so okay I kind of buy that the mom and pop owner of these like you know they own like one or two shopping centers three shopping centers they're not like they're more scared than they are more fearful than they are greedy they're not investing in it okay I buy that some people might fall into that what else what are your other edges he goes I don't die by paralysis by analysis he goes these guys will something on page seven of the lease will get them all tied up hey goes they'll just get like some Covenant they're really worried about he goes I have like basically like a standardized deal with these guys my leases are like clean and simple and like you know I'm willing to Bear some risk these are not like the most iron-clad bulletproof every every inch of every part of my body is covered and can't be exposed he's like you know I just don't die by paralysis by analysis like these guys will just die in the deal making process of the lease because they get worried about stuff that really doesn't matter I've been doing this for long enough that I understand look if things go wrong I have a plan B a plan C Plan D I don't have to make plan a this completely fully insured thing okay that's interesting tell me more and he goes he goes the other thing is that um they will have like um he gave me some other deal making points but I'll leave those out some of those are you know maybe a little like I don't know personal or secretive I guess but I go okay what about these tenants I go who are these people who's trying to expand I thought the whole Retail Landscape is like shrinking and collapsing uh and Amazon's killing everybody he goes yes but there are certain categories so he goes anything DIY so Hobby Lobby is an example of this DIY people like to go in they like to see the stuff they like to have the stuff they need a bunch of inventory in a big space um so they're willing to rent these big stores he goes another one anything that caters to the Black and Latino Community it goes for some reason those groups are not buying online as much as you know white white or Indians or other other races they're not buying online their stores are still thriving and he goes and I asked them you know like why do you think uh it'll be like um Burlington Coat Factory got it or uh things like that he's like for building Factory he's like a lot of these places they're not just like oh I just need a shirt let me go buy the shirt okay if you wanted to do that Amazon might be more convenient or ordering online might be more comfortable like I need a coach it's a hangout it's like this is the one place we go when we leave the house we go for an outing and we go to this place and um he's like so that is like a big piece of like it's like part of their lifestyle is to go to stores and hang out and you know do the whole do the whole nine he's like so those stores are all thriving he goes the third one is anything that's like super low end so Dollar Store um Style Style things because they're actually cheaper than online and they don't have to have the shipping problems and so people if if you want the lowest price that's still the place to go fourth is he goes like your wife and my wife home goods and Home Improvement so go to Home Goods it's like he goes they're treasure hunter treasure hunt experiences [Music] TJ Maxx Ross uh Marshalls uh Home Goods uh things like that he goes they go because there's a joy in finding an amazing deal yeah and so they they don't want the most efficient experience where they just go online and they just buy the thing and they're done there's this actually like the joy of the hunt so they want to go to this big messy store and they want to find gems and they want to do that and again that's their outing that's their fun that's their Hobby and so the retail store still really matters and so he gave me this like list of categories that were like still expanding and I thought that was pretty interesting it's like some of the the Nuance that you don't really pay attention to unless you're like in that field and so I just appreciated kind of talking to somebody super fascinating knows their stuff in that area how many people work at this person's company like less than a dozen no it's probably like somewhere between 20 and 30 I would say overall man that seems like it seems too boring for me like I I think I would I for some reason I pick things that probably make less money but are more dopamine generally boring but they do high deal volume he said he had done like 80 or 100 transactions this last year which is just that's a doing a real estate deal every three days basically which is just an insane amount of volume he's like there's a reason that's not normal but like the whole real estate world has shifted so I needed to shift my portfolio um accordingly like what are my what are my generational holds what are my you know quick quick opportunistic buys and what are my B properties that I need to offload because interest rates are changing and the real estate Market's about to you know crash so I need to do this he goes I remember he goes I remember in 08 I was the guy who was like I'm gonna do real estate like because real estate had been good for like you know eight straight years he's like so I was running into the burning tunnel and people are just handing Me properties I'm like wow this is incredible he goes now I realize you want to be the guy on the way out and hey here you go Bud have fun have fun with this property yeah it's all the papers all the numbers look good because the last five years have been fantastic last seven years been fantastic but the next seven years might not be the same and he's like you know I know now he's like now I've learned which which way to go in the tunnel when it's burning what skills or attributes does this person have you think that sets them apart extremely aggressive they are they're Impressions when you talk to them you almost feel like at any given moment like uh it's like are we are we are we laughing or are we fighting what's happening here like they're a very friendly person it's not bad it's not nothing wrong with that but they are aggressively minded where it's like we play to win uh like the way they raise their kids is to win it's like um like they're kids like you know if they do something bad they don't go to timeout they do 20 burpees and it's like you know you know that's like just like standard it's like okay before dinner we're gonna go run wind Sprints and then like you know that's just how we do things before dinner um and like girls boys two-year-old 10 year old doesn't matter like whoever you are this is how we are how we roll now you're back you just got a lot of lawn care Duty yeah I mean exactly like there's a there's just a play to win mentality that's the first thing second thing is giant giant chip on shoulder massive insecurity daddy didn't love me uh Daddy was mean to me um people said I wasn't [ __ ] uh people said I would never be something hold on to that use that as fuel um and that same thing that kind of like and you know they'll say like yeah that stuff doesn't bother me anymore it's like yeah but you brought it up to me eight times in the last three years so like I think there's like you haven't let it go that's for sure you know I think you've used it to a very very productive end for sure but that chip on your shoulder is like you know what do they say chip on shoulder equals chip and Pockets uh chips and pockets that's that's what's happening so um that's the second trait third is amazing at deal making negotiation deal making Gift of Gab um spends very little time in front of computers spends a lot of time in front of people or on the phone tons of time on the phone and like I feel like for Our Generation like how much time do you that I [ __ ] hate talking on the phone I just it's like talking to you know potential business things on the phone like I spend essentially zero and in fact if even if there's a business opportunity like hey I'd love to do a call like I just tell them straight about hey I hate doing calls but if you write it down like I'm happy to respond yeah just to like a voice memo yeah like I'm not I'm not doing any of that that's hilarious um yeah so this person spends a lot of time on the phone and they do that to gather tons of info and they'll just if I they're like driving a bunch they'll just dial okay I'm driving four hours to go see this property in that time I'm gonna make 14 phone calls or whatever and I'm hey brother what's going on what you seeing oh what happened to that property you had out there oh you having trouble well send me the numbers let me take a look maybe I can help you out blah blah you know like and they're just constantly surfacing opportunities or information oh that guy's doing having some trouble interesting like oh this person you know they're underwater there oh I know Hobby Lobby wants to be there so I'm gonna you know okay good let me let me make that happen and so they just find these these I love learning that's one of the traits dude I love it um very different like honestly pretty standard for the real estate world one of the things I said so far are like shocking to anybody that's in real estate but for us in the tech world it's a very different play style it's totally different set of strengths you know activities than what we do so for us it's like oh that's cool that's new that's crazy to me dude by the way my father is like that but he owns a business where when he spends his Winters in Florida he brings a phone that plugs into the wall and he brings the fax machine and it just constantly called like hey which guy what you hear and what's good and like the his company you know sells millions and millions of dollars worth of stuff and it's just with a [ __ ] phone a fax machine and mailing checks and just constantly calling like hey what you got what you hearing it's like that's just how the business is it's crazy man and they kill it par here talk to me that's what they do they go well they go what's good brother what's going on or he'll call people nephew what's up nephew what's good Barbershop if you're gonna be cool nephew you gotta be black and in a barber shop I can't believe you're dead it's kind of like that I'll be like what's up nephew he just calls me with nephew he just calls people nephew um all right well you wanna do one more uh let me tell you about a space that I've been poking around and it's not something I'm gonna do but there's definitely opportunity you know I poked the The Beehive and I heard some buzzing I don't want to go near it but like somebody who wants honey that's a very good analogy together what the next word was gonna be yeah you just had words coming out of your mouth not sure how the sentence is going to end it it totally found its place wonderful that's really satisfying right so um so only fans Okay so we've talked about only fans a bunch but let me tell you the angle that I'm thinking about here so by the way I do not give a [ __ ] about only fans everyone talks about only fans the only thing I care about is brap Barbie do you know who that is I think that's her name bad is that it bad Bobby what did you just say I thought it was brap I thought it Brad the Barbie isn't there like an r and an H in the first word just an H wait it's bad that's how you spell bad yeah stupid I feel like you I feel like you're up to speed on bad Bobby what's her name bad Barbie what's that I don't know bad baby I just know her as the catch me outside girl from Mari but uh or Dr Phil or some [ __ ] anyway that's the only person I know and it's like she changed like races was she black now or white what is she she's now black oh well Google bad baby all right whatever she she she sweats she's Jewish and her mom's Italian she really and then and then now she's being like criticized because she's like the people say it's like modern day blackface because she's like really like changed her look uh like when she was on Dr Phil she looked like uh you know like a spoiled white girl or something like that and uh anyways whatever it doesn't matter what the [ __ ] her name is she kills it she kills it and like apparently she bought like a 20 million dollar help 20 million dollar house uh so whatever so so bad point is uh company crushes it so they do billions of dollars in Revenue uh the owner whose name is now public so we can talk about Leo he's a fan of the Pod front of the house he um I think they he cleared or or you know like the the company cleared 500 million in profits in 2020 or 2021 like just an insanely profitable insanely big business okay and what is only fans only fans is basically like a storefront where anybody can sell pictures or videos so you're selling content and so you know I do I do e-commerce I come from the Shopify world I know that in Shopify Shopify is your storefront that's your equivalent of only fans uh but you use like this whole host of Tools around it to make your store sell better to increase sales so you'll use clavio to you know grab people's email addresses and then send them automated emails I know where you're going with this one you use uh you know this app to uh boost your you know to upsells automatically uh right to cross-sell or upsell new products so that you increase the dollar value per customer so use all these different things only fans kinda has none of this stuff but it has the same volume and the same like you know like seriousness of any of these other big storefront slash Marketplace type of ideas and so I think there's a whole world of only fans SAS tools that can be built so like but do they have an ecosystem like uh you don't need you don't the the they just use it on their own you don't have to like plug into only fans you just like um it's not like a platform you have to go be approved to sell under to be an app like the way Shopify does you got to be in the Shopify app but do they have like so oh so they don't have but there's no only fans App Store no you just you just sign up and you just use products so for example there are products that are like chat bots so what they do is somebody follows you or they subscribe uh either they're a free follower or maybe they're paying the five dollars a month subscription but where you really make your money is what they call pay-per-view and so that's where you sell like oh I did a photo shoot uh whatever like you know I dressed up like Catwoman paid 9 19 to unlock right that piece of content and so what these Bots these SAS tools are doing is they basically are like hey we will go message all of your followers as if it's you being like hey did you see my Catwoman thing I think you're gonna love it 24 hours later um like picture three in the album was like just for you wink face whatever right like this is just a bot and what is this this is a sales rep that is going around for you doing sales and selling your content selling your product and so the all the tools today are pretty rudimentary they are pretty um or they're just like they're just missing certain things from certain ecosystems and I think somebody could do what uh what Andrew Andrew Wilkinson did with Wii Commerce where he basically rolled up a set of plugins and tools I think that you could do that in the only fans world now to do this why am I not doing this well I don't want to deal with people on only fans every day I don't want to be like selling this content every day it's not like what's it called like it's not my icky guy yeah that was put on this Earth to do yeah but we got a bunch of friends who are less you know uh a little little less pretentious about yeah different stands maybe we were not going to say lower or higher standards we'll say more wide you know our bar is up here at someone else's bar is not here it's just it's different bars it's a little wider yeah so if you're one of these wide standards fellas out there I think there's a lot of opportunities is a little wobbly uh and there's a whole the whole ecosystem right so if you want to start an agency only fans agencies do really really well right because they take care of the back office they take her growth for for these only fans creators um I know two people personally that have built only fans like just SEO optimized websites that are like search engine so it's like find a Creator discover a Creator search for a person no way and they're like metric sites um and they've built them and they're either like cash flowing really really well like you know to the tune of like you know 100 a month of free cash flow or they sold them for like two three million is one of them called fans metric uh I don't want to say because I kind of already said some numbers so um yeah there are like Ben we know too personally that that did this and so metrics like in any ecosystem same thing with twitch it was like there was a metric site and the metric site got big then there were stream labs and streamlabs made it easy for somebody to like accept tips and donations and and they made like a alert system so that every time you got a tip or donation you could automatically acknowledge that person which which leads to more tips and that streamlabs became an indispensable tool for every twitch Creator what is the stream Labs of only fans dude that's so fascinating these are the there is so much opportunity to build SAS tooling for these traders to build agencies to build you know a whole bunch of different uh opportunities around this ecosystem because most people aren't going to go there um myself included and if you do go there the two it's like new and growing so fast that the pie is big but it's not totally saturated the same way that Shopify feels quite saturated or you know tools for i iPhone developers or whatever seems pretty pretty saturated do you follow um have you ever seen that Tick Tock guy who goes up to people with fancy cars and he goes hey what do you do for a living yeah of course uh what's his name Brandon Mack I think or something Mac uh it's awesome and yeah for some reason all of it feels like all of the ones lately have all been it's always hot girls and they like make jokes and then they they finally admit that they do only fans and only fans is one of those ideas when when I heard about it like five years ago I'm like who the [ __ ] gonna pay for that like just Google it like you'll see the same thing just like yeah Google that person's name followed by the word nude and you'll like find exactly what you want like why would you pay 20 a month for this and obviously they proved me wrong and it's gotten to be such a huge thing that it seems like if I go to La do you see a hot girl in a fancy car like just based off my me scrolling in bed at night it's like oh they're definitely and only it's an only fans model and that is like totally new and strange to me and that is what's made me feel like oh this is like going to be much actually much bigger it's it's significantly more mainstream than I ever thought like no one would make like maybe now people will make jokes about PornHub but like every guy out there has like five or ten porn sites that they go to and never in a million years would they say out loud what it is do you know what I mean and yeah in fact I'm not even gonna say any words for the rest of the segment and now it's like only fans is like a thing that like well we we talk about because it's like so mainstream popular I find it to be incredibly fascinating like even just in the last four years we started mentioning the word PornHub because they would do funny skits like uh during the Super Bowl or they would like you know do fun it's like become a joke but that has just happened by the way one good idea was just to do another only fans and so I forgot what it's called fansley or fans only I think it's fansly fansley is just like uh if you don't want to be on only fans come on fansley and they're just like well we'll be number two it's fine we'll make some different decisions like we allow whatever like you know I don't know what they're different like cartoon creators or something like that like you know I like everybody like a digital dude like there's seven minute abs and some fans leads just gonna be six minute abs it's like yeah it's the same thing we charge you only nine percent instead of ten exactly and so and then they're doing pretty pretty well like they do they do they do fairly well and when and so I think there was just this was just one of those winning ideas it was one of those really big winning ideas I don't know if I told you this by the way I had a buddy who was a VC who kind of quit his job and was going to raise like his own fund and then he was just like he identified I think three years ago he goes only fans and I go what and he goes only fans it's going to be massive and I go I think it's already pretty big at that time it seemed pretty big for what it was I was like dude how popular can this get like that's what's it worth now you think what could it sell for now I don't even know uh I don't know I think very very conservatively two billion is my guess and aggressively closer to ten I don't know you know it's hard to say like the all the market like multiples just got changed so it's hard to know also you know there's not that many buyers for only fans so there's a problem that's what I was getting at yeah I can't really go public and there's not that many buyers but it's super super profitable and so my buddy was like it's gonna be big I'm gonna spend the next year trying to get ownership and only fans I go what do you mean like just I guess you're gonna reach out he goes yeah but if it doesn't work like I'm going to find a way to get ownership I was like what he's like yeah I'm just gonna like I'm gonna invest in it I'm gonna help them I'm gonna do anything I can and he literally made that his mission for like a year did he get it and he did it he was able to like they didn't let anybody invest but this guy was able to go in and get advisory shares by helping them out in all these different ways and he did it he got a piece of it and he was right he sent me he goes I remember when twitch acquired us he goes only fans will be bigger than twitch I got bigger than twitch no way and I was like dude I don't think you know Trish is like one of the top six like most visited websites in America or something like that like most trafficked or something and he goes yeah you'll see and um and he was right it passed Twitch in terms of uh users and revenue in the last year and and I was like wow this guy really like called a shot of being super super bullish on the only fans he was he was absolutely correct dude does he also own 600 million dollars with the real estate this guy sounds awesome uh yeah I mean I'm a board I think I think you know we Commerce is an interesting company we Commerce is Andrew Wilkinson you know fan of the Pod or a friend of the potty comes in all the time their market cap is decimated right now it sucks right now but their business is is pretty good like it's a good business um it's way undervalued um but it I think it's an interesting model and yeah I'm I'm bored with your aggressive friend who pushed his way into only fans do you do you have a pre-game routine you do before this podcast I listen to music and I review all my notes that's about it like a specific song or just like generally whatever whatever is on well I use Pandora and then I um one hour before so I have my schedule locked in so for the people listening we record for one hour and so we're usually here at the top of the hour then we start and then one hour before that it's my quiet time where I like review everything a quiet time night well like people are like messaging me and I'm like hey I can't talk to you right now I'm preparing and so it's my time to like read notes and like I scan the news and I just want to know what's going on in the world yeah my daughter has that that's great quiet time I love it um what do you register invented this great thing because she's like dude my kids don't want to sleep and they just want to play and so she's like I gotta turn like she's like I don't even care if they're asleep I just want them to go to the room and just like not talk to me and just stay in the bed and like have fun so she created nighttime sister playtime and so it's just like hilarious thing where they're like oh it's lifetime sister playtime and they get to go run into their beds and like the Two Sisters can play together but they have to be quiet because it's nighttime sister playtime nobody else is allowed in which means don't bother Mommy and Daddy and I just thought what a hilarious Rebrand of go in the room shut the door and shut up and so that now whenever I'm doing something like even work wise like with like co-workers like our Ecom thing or whatever I'm like all right snap time sister playtime like that just means like don't talk don't bother me with slack and don't talk to me I'm gonna go do some work now that's what I have I mean Daddy gotta go do things dude I just like I blame everything on the Pod and be like hey cam preparing for the Pod don't talk to me please because everyone knows it's like a deadline why do you have a routine um I gotta well I kind of have one but I was making fun of myself this morning about it so my schedule's similar I think to you where now the morning is all locked in where it's like I work out at a specific time and then at the end of the workout I do my like 10 minutes of like mindset stuff that I do and and it's like it's really good everything's really healthy but it's almost comically healthy where I was doing it today and I was like I was like what am I I was like I'm that cliche Tech guy that's like things have changed uh fasted car yeah I do my fasted cardio and then I I you know seven and a half minutes in the sauna then I you know 11 minutes unerrupted staring at the sun it's like I have I have sex for three minutes three times a day it's a study show that it's better like you know I'm like doing all these like life optimization things that really I'm like I'm not a huge fan of those things because I feel like individually I like all of them but together I'm like am I this delicate that I need to be like this uh you know like am I like I'm not a I'm not one of these like performance F1 cars or whatever that's like you know has to be like perfectly balanced everywhere I don't want to be so fragile you you are what you are what you uh didn't want to be now I think that's good you look better you look I think you look significantly better than you did three years ago that's for sure yeah but that could be that could be anything who knows who knows what that could be um wait let me tell you really quick I don't know if that's the morning routine listen that's that's been more recent speaking of morning routines I gotta I was actually excited to tell you about this so I'll tell you about it more when I'm done with it but I met this guy on Twitter named Isaac French do you know Isaac French he's that guy but it's a strong name it's a strong name and that's why I got interested in him frankly but he like he's that guy who uh has that not gonna lie French dude Isaac French is his name I met him on Twitter he's he's the guy who um he bought a like a five acre plot of land and like built cabins on it and turned it into an Airbnb that's making like millions of dollars in sales and but he like he's only 25 and he like architect and oh right we featured him on the pie yeah yeah time ago and he like called you and he told you all the numbers and all that yeah and he like architect the whole thing and he like he's also an accountant so he did all the accounting and then he even like hired all the builders himself so he was the general contractor just this interesting guy I hung out with him I met him on Twitter we actually I have eventually met up with him he's really fascinating and he's part of this uh religion I guess is the right way to describe it called Homestead Heritage and basically if if you're an outsider it kind of looks like a like a Mennonite night Society a little bit you know like what Mennonites are no what is that you ever seen Amish people yeah so this is like he would not say that they're the same and they aren't but from an outside perspective it all like looks a little similar and so by the way those are the best descriptions where it's like they'd be kind of offended at this but this is what it is well they're they're like objectively not the same but like if you go I posted their website in the in the thing uh in the chat you'll see guys wearing like those big wide hats and like there's like a cow or like a horse like tilling the land and they're walking alongside of it and like a lot of the women wear like the long dresses and like and so listen to the description of their religion it's a religion but it's also a community but listen Homestead Homestead Heritage is an agrarian and craft-based intentional Christian Community it's literature stresses Simplicity sustainability self-sufficiency cooperation service and quality craftsmanship and so it's this like super I don't understand any of that what does that mean yeah yeah dude it's hard to understand hard to understand if you don't know but I spent time with them as you taught me all this but like basically somehow they they derived from like Chris from the Bible or something about like it's there like it's their Duty or something to like create like high quality craftsmanship-like stuff and to like Farm on the land and be sustainable and like there's you find God in like doing hard work and good work and being honest and creating stuff with your hands that's like again this like huge generalization from a massive outside perspective but basically they like they like make their own food so if you they own a 500 acres in Waco Texas which is about two hours of ish from Austin and they like all their food is like made on that land and like within the community they share food with one another and they're also pretty Savvy at business like I don't know how that kind of comes into this but like they like he's a he's an accountant and so he's like oh I just love like being diligent with numbers and I'm like oh my God you're making me weak at the needs my man like telling me stuff so anyway this weekend he's having like they're it's like their Festival they do like a festival where you can go in and buy like the their arts and crafts and I'm driving 90 minutes to go there and like we're gonna like sing Christmas songs and like buy arts and crafts and I'm incredibly excited to show you uh like or to report back about what it's like this community is so fascinating to me and so it's kind of interesting I'm imagining do you watch the office you know when um Dwight has his Airbnb I'm imagining that too yes shirt Farms like that's what I'm matching and you're gonna go meet Moe's uh wow that is that is incredible you know if you told me if you live this way you can live till 200 I might do it then that that is how big the cost is to me of like yo go make go till your own food I don't know what tilling is to be honest with you I don't know if it's something you do with your hands or your feet right like what what is tilling I think it's when like a cow like pulls along like a rake or something and it like moves the soil then you can like plant [ __ ] in it I don't know but yeah dude it I'll watch that I would bet my well I bet you these people are pretty happy I think that there is like happiness and simplicity but like who the hell knows everyone's unhappy but uh anyway that's what I'm doing this weekend I'm gonna report back well I like that it's kind of like Amish people that love money that's kind of already intriguing right like you know tell me more yeah which is basically exciting have you ever walked around in Brooklyn and like I know Ben Levy who's here like lived in this part of or ish in this part of Brooklyn have you ever been around like the Orthodox Jews no but you said they like run the place they run the place man and they like you'll walk around in parts of Brooklyn and they'll be speaking Yiddish or like you go to certain stores and like everything's in Yiddish and you're like am I in a different country this is wild and they kind of like like you like help others in the community it's really fascinating I love these I actually like those cultures I think it's really interesting that those exist all right uh I think that's it for today I'm Gonna Save the rest for next episode [Music]

as soon as I had money I immediately started learning to fly helicopters for real because I'd always wanted to be a helicopter pilot ever since being a little kid I bought a 69 Mustang convertible that was really cool I bought a first generation Tesla Model S that was cool and then I bought a house for my parents it's like the basketball player contract move you know you get the money you buy the house for your parents and then I bought a house for myself that was close to my grandpa and unfortunately we then ended up having to move up to Silicon Valley because of the acquisition and then he passed away while I was up there so one of my regrets but I'm still in that house

I think a lot of people say it's harder because you don't have the edge you don't work as hard that's not true with me if you talk to anyone who works with me they'll say I'm working as hard now as I was during my first company when I was blowing through my 401k to finance it [Music] all right Paul what's going on man will you uh darmesh CTO co-founder HubSpot told us we have to we have to we don't we don't have to but we should talk to you what uh why did he say that I don't know it's going to be connected um damesh and I have a lot of uh fun talking together about technology philosophy and teams um one fun thing that demesh and I did going back many years ago now when I was CTO profender of kayak damesh and I kind of switched jobs for a day so I actually had him made up I got him an email address dumbass kayak.com and made up business cards and he basically sat at my desk at card for day and then I sat at HubSpot for a day and that was sort of the beginning of our friendship realizing that we each had someone over that but some things we can learn from each other and he's been a great mentor to me and friend and your big hit has been well so far you have a new company Lola which I don't know if you know this or not you guys advertised with my old company the hustle a bit so yeah uh we worked with you a bit but um your big hit so far has been kayak right what did you sell that for like two or three billion two billion I've actually sold six companies in a row including Lola I've sold even another one after Lola Moonbeam which is a podcast app and now I'm on to my seventh company which one of the which so which of the six has been the most financially successful for you tag was the biggest Financial outcome um which I'm deeply appreciative of and I learned a lot at [ __ ] I met some amazing people but there's other things which are also really significant that aren't just monetary so my first sale I don't have to I just told you I sold six in a row there's another one that I don't really count because it only was a company I created in high school but it's very meaningful to me making money in high school designing software and what were the six so I had to come pick up Boston light we were an e-commerce company we let people set up storefronts a little bit like Shopify but if this goes back 20 years ago we sold that to Intuit I began VP technology different to it then I had a company called intermute which is internet security software I did that with my brother Ed English we saw that to Trend Micro I did a company gethuman.com which is served customer service information over 200 million people kayak Moonbeam the podcast player Lola which is the business travel and expense and did I forget one I think that's the list and so what's the like um thought process so would did you start them all in kind of the same way where you were maybe scratching your own itch or you're like analyzing Trends so like what's your process to come up with these ideas it's mostly scratching my own itch I mean I could go through a company by company the only one that wasn't my original idea was kayak my co-founder Steve Hafner is one of the founders of Orbitz and he had observed it over it says 70 of the people that just search on orbits but then when they were done they opened a second browser and went directly to united.com remember to buy the ticket and so Orbitz did all the searching for people but never made money and so Steve base said why don't create a company where all we do is search and then if someone wants to go to United they click the link and we'll send them directly to United and they could buy a fair and that was his observation we met by chance and within probably 45 minutes decided to sign up as co-founders each put a million dollars into the uh original round of financing and then I very quickly owned it from a product standpoint I went I'm about to spend an hour on Expedia that night because Expedia was the market leader at that point and just going back the next morning saying this isn't going to be hard because I looked at expedias below where it was sort of seizure inducing there was so much stuff going on the screen you put a million dollars in was that like a I'm going all my chips on the table right now or was that a you know was that half your net worth was that a small bet for you how did you feel at that time was did that add some anxieties to the process I just sold a company for 30 million so I could have the the million wasn't that hard for me at that point my prior company that I sold for 30. I blew through my 401k to finance it so my my first company was tough financially uh to get it going but for kayak I'd made some money so I could afford to um help Finance it why did you why do you sell your companies why not you know try to run them or have them exist under a management team that you you control for a long time like darmesh right darmesh has been doing HubSpot for forever yeah so kayak I did for 10 years that was my longest stint and we ended up taking it public 2012 which is incredibly fun and then we sold it shortly thereafter the price on at really booking.com which is the parent company and I just frankly was bored I felt like I was editing the flight screen for 10 years and I wanted to try something new and I'd had an unbelievably strong team at Tech leadership at kayak so at that point I felt like I could sneak out without hurting the company because I had people that wanted to do UI they could do product they could do architecture so it gave me the freedom to try something new you you're kind of I mean you're you're kind of like an internet OG a little bit I mean kayak's one of the was like a pretty huge thing it still is a huge thing but in terms of like internet exits it was it was it was early on in the game and you guys had a nice huge exit who are some of the people who are kind of like big shots and Ballers now that you got to know a little bit earlier on um you mean across the industry overall yeah because like darmesh has all these crazy stories where he's like you know I was an early investor in coinbase and I and I met the team and I thought well he didn't actually tell me this I'm just making I mean he did invest in coinbase but I'm sure there's like a story he's like well I met this guy Brian and he was like living out of a closet and doing all this weird stuff and he was a quirky guy and I mean he just has met or I believe he was an early investor in Dropbox as well and like he probably has all these interesting stories about some of these folks who are now like tycoons or big deal now but he was fortunate because he's a little bit older and was more successful than they were when they were just getting their things started that he got insight into these businesses do you have anything like that yeah so I met Brian chesky at Airbnb when they were financing a billion dollar evaluation and I think they're now with 100 billion or something like that and I remember the time like loving Brian thought he was iconic um and passion driven mission-driven but um I didn't see it how big everybody was gonna get I said this seems awesome for people one of strangers living in the house but how many people is that going to be so I kind of missed the bigger picture there um what was he like when you met him just kid like he was I mean I've seen him talk and my wife works there I totally agree I think he is an icon I think he's one of the best CEOs out there he's passion driven he's amazing um but what did you see I saw him as very serious and intense um he was charismatic he listened well so we had a good conversation where he wanted me to give him feedback of the company because kayak was a much bigger company at that point and um yeah I just looked at this very serious intense and charismatic yeah whenever you're like you're doing technology for like 15 20 years you just get this like crazy story arc or like you know um you get to see people you can you see all these people that you're like all right I think this person's kind of amazing they might go on to do amazing things maybe it's this idea maybe it's the next idea are there any other stories like that of uh that you've seen because you've been kind of in the game for such a long time yeah so when we financed we [ __ ] was created in 2004 uh We've really launched out of General Catalyst in Cambridge Mass and then we raised money from Mike Moritz to Korea I remember one day my co-founder and I were working out of the support office and Mike Moritz said oh I wanted to use it a couple guys this is Chad Hurley and let's get his co-founder but they were the founders of YouTube Steve I think yeah that's right I remember meeting those guys at the square office and Mike's like yeah these guys are like putting videos online I'm like yeah that's cool whatever I didn't see that one either I have I have some famous misses I mean I've been very lucky as an investor um I think my irr is 30.5 percent over the last several years so I've been pretty good I've invested in 60 companies but I've missed some I missed Snapchat I met one of their Founders when they were financing an 80 million evaluation that would have been a big outcome uh Dropbox Summit Drew early on and that wasn't under the guise of me investing in them it was really just networking but had I I thought Dropbox going to be plagued by security I'm still kind of shocked I used Dropbox do you know that they don't really encrypt your files and then a Dropbox engineer if they're malicious at get at toast your files yeah I believe that it's amazing that they're as big as they are and why doesn't anyone worry about anything yeah what have been what have been the uh you said you've invested in 60 companies and you got this great IR what have been somebody the hits so far um one of the ones coming up right now is pilot.com and yeah that's an amazing company I met those guys when they were I was a judge at the MIT 100K competition and had a company called case Place really exotic technology they could patch a Linux operating system as was running so you don't have to reboot your servers they sold that to Oracle I was part of you know I was the judge at that and I helped them win that competition and then I invested the next company zulup which they ended up selling to um the Dropbox and then when they left Dropbox create another company I basically asked if I could invest before I knew what they were working on so I wrote them a check before I knew what they were doing and that's a 40xr I think I financed some I wrote a check as part of the rounded 30 million evaluation I think their last valuation was like 1.2 billion or something but that's one that the founding team had the Mojo So when you met them you just knew those guys going to create something serious they they were intense high energy they laughed a lot they finished each other's sentences they just really enjoyed working together um I also not a good return for me at 22x was Ken show which is a competitor to a Bloomberg terminal and I invested in them because their seat show Pete Cresco used to work at kayak and I knew him from kayak and I just knew he was destined to do great things and he that was a really nice asset we we had this guy Trung work for us so Trung was an analyst at Ken show and Ken show is like this I you know they're a startup still but like uh The Stereotype to me from an outsider they've kind of fit this like stereotype of like an uptight Financial firm and we found Trung working there and this guy Trung who works for us he's like the he's got he's a loudmouth like literally like he speaks so loud and he's full of energy and he was a writer for us and we taught him how to you know we like encouraged him to use Twitter and now he's got like you know a million followers on Twitter and we and we recruited him from Ken show that's amazing I like Ken show because of that thank you um and you so kayak was a big win um and then you did things like let's say Moonbeam which is like you know a podcast discovery type app could have been big but you know maybe I think anything in podcasting is is sort of like looks sort of Niche and most of the podcast products even that win are sort of like you know really good lifestyle businesses so far there hasn't been that many big winners in the podcasting space in terms of tools um are you do you I know one thing that's hard I've talked to people who kind of have an exit like 700 million or 800 million or a billion dollars it's like that becomes the new table Stakes for the next thing they do some go that way and they say okay I Gotta Get huge now and others are like no I'm literally just gonna program things in my house for fun now like now I I I don't want to go try to catch lightning in a bottle again which way uh do you think about it or is there another Third Way I've always said for each of my companies it's team for Us customer second profit third I set up for kayak on day one we put together our culture plan and I really think it's a good way to execute because if you if you focus on becoming a phenomenal recruiter and really becoming a student of recruiting but read all the books listen to the podcasts learn from others and talk about recruiting and recruit an amazing team and then figure out how to lead that team so that there's no stress in the office people work really hard they have fun they're cranking stuff out but they're not stressing each other out if you do those things you can create I always say magic teams create magical products and then usually if you can create a magical product you can find a profit of business there so for me now after I sold um Lola my business travel and expense company I sold that to Capital One a year ago I then opened up a venture studio called Boston Adventure Studio it's bbs.net and we have nine apps under development some of them are in itch to scratch like fun little things that we put out with source code um others are a swing for the fences really think it can become big there's a company I launched two weeks ago called Deets like show me the deets that could be a billion dollar company you're saying online reviews are broken you know if you go to Google right now in quotes you search for buy Amazon reviews you'll see this 37 000 pages that tell you how to do that if you make you know these headphones I'm wearing if you make a competitive these and you want to sell it on Amazon you can easily buy a thousand five star reviews for that if you want and these fake review companies are run by PhD computer scientists they are evading Amazon's bot detection so it's very difficult at this point to have to detect them they're going through proxy servers they have age accounts they buy products and then if you go to Yelp or TripAdvisor their reviews are largely by people you don't care about you know like I um looked up a sushi restaurant in New York and I saw five star reviews this place people talked about how great it was because it's really cheap and I don't know about you if you like sushi not but I'm not trying to be that excited having ten dollars a person but sushi in New York that's a little scary to me oh yeah you want that catfish and cream cheese roll yeah TripAdvisor and you look for a hotel you'll see a lot of five-star hotel five star reviews for Motel Six and that was great when I was 20 years old I'm not sure I would stay at Motel 6 now but um a lot of you just don't relate to the person doing the purchase so the idea of Deets are going to blow that up and say it's just the recommendations from your friends from influences that you choose to follow and then using machine learning doing look-alike modeling to find people that are similar to you man it seems like you pick really hard Industries like uh travel is like uh you know I'm again I'm an outsider you're the expert but it seems like notoriously difficult like it just seems like incredibly competitive and very very very challenging and the margins seems small and very hard it seems to start one of those things now uh podcasting terribly hard I don't you know I don't entirely understand why it's so hard but like the nothing has entirely clicked to make it this this fantastic industry uh even though a lot of people use podcasts and then reviews also seem terribly challenging you know Yelp has had like Yelp hasn't innovated in in five or ten years their stock sucks uh Google reviews is is a is a horribly challenging person to compete with because you know they have all these people already using it what what's the game what's the game plan here and why are you picking the hardest things to work on um yeah the origin of Dietz is I I'm friends with some people who own restaurants in Boston and I saw the difficult they had during covid and so it really developed some compassion for restaurant owners and they all told me how much they hate y'all Yelp is this like Mafia where you pay if you they probably gonna save a lot of bad reviews call us and pay us hundreds of dollars a month it will sort of clean up your site on Yelp it's kind of like in Italy there's a movie called billion dollar bully about Yelp it came out in 2019 and the opening scene is an Italian chef who said when he opened his first restaurant in Italy his son broke the windows he fixed them they broke them in the next week you fixed them the next week some guy comes in and says I notice someone keeps breaking the windows if you pay me a hundred dollars a week I'll make sure no one breaks their Windows anymore and he knew that was the guy who's breaking his windows he's like Yelp it's just like that so I look at Yelp as a 20 year old dinosaur that's the last 20 years we want to be the next 20 years and I look at the evolution you know the world is different now than it was when the Outback creates did for one the rise of the influencers particularly gen Z they make all their purchase decision based on influencers and that's true not for dining so we want to give it make it really easy rather than scrolling through Instagram and trying to find an old post of a restaurant you saw a month ago having it in one tight really clean UI it's your friends it's your influencers and then on machine learning I'm really inspired by tick tock tick tock's an amazing app they don't ask you any questions they don't say you know what do you what's your interest but if you look at my Tick Tock feed there's a lot of bass players I'm a bad bass player but I like bass players there's a lot of dogs I have a new dog this gardening Tick Tock has figured out the stuff I'm interested in and without ever asking me question and the way they work is they don't even ask you who your friends are they will find some you know DJ in Berlin who has the same weird sense of humor as you and it'll show you these are the videos she listens to or that she watches so I really like that look-alike modeling I use a cluster ring so we're doing that with Deeds as well we're going to find your friends the influences you like and that people of the same taste as you it's wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated whoa I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better do you think that starting a company now that you're wealthy is easier or harder than when you are just getting going in your career I think a lot of people say it's harder because you don't have the edge you don't work as hard that's not true with me if you talk to anyone who works with me they'll say I'm working as hard now as I was during my first company when I was blowing through my 401k to finance it um to me work hard is recruit hard lead coach people get people excited and I'm working on that as hard as I ever have I'm trying to get a little bit better with each company there is some Advantage having money that if you see a stupid problem that costs five grand to fix you know when you're creating your first company you don't have that five grand now you do so you just pay a little money and problems go away what do you think Sean easier or harder uh yeah I think it's different and you just have to like work with the the pros and the cons right like yeah recruiting is easier and you waste less time on the on just like the rookie mistakes that you always make but then you know there is some diminishment maybe of the edge or um you know the things that made you successful the first time might have been that there was a technology wave going on there was a bunch of opportunity and like you have to recognize new technology waves or new inflection points new things that have changed like you know he's talking about like basically machine learning has gotten a lot better and now we can do things that like make it make the user experience way different if before we had to ask you 50 questions to show you something good and now you could swipe three times four times and I could start getting you something good um you know I can create a delightful user experience whereas before you know maybe I couldn't so I think yeah I think it's different and the things he's saying make a lot of sense to me I want to tell you one thing about doing Tech Now versus 20 years ago I've been investing for a long time in addition to running companies and in the old days companies would fail because their product didn't work they just couldn't get the check working that's hardly the case now like the stack the AWS the tools the open source um it's pretty easy to assemble the right libraries and right people to help put something together companies feel today if you wanted two reasons either there's a Founder implosion they create a toxic culture and people like hate their boss and they hate working there and they all leave which unfortunately happens all too often they they fail the culture code or number two they built a nice product but it's a real problem that no one cares about and unfortunately a lot of Founders have an itch to scratch as you were saying earlier Sam and they get really obsessed about it like I have this little problem I'm going to work on it for 10 years and they don't realize that not a lot of people have that same problem it makes me sad when I see that when I see a beautiful product that solves a problem I don't care about yeah you see that all the time that's like the number one cause of death I think with uh with startups you uh you said something a second ago I wanted to ask you about so you go uh become amazing at recruiting I um that's never been something that I was like that's the thing I'm gonna set my mind to and you said you know I read all the books I read listed all the podcasts and try to become amazing at this so I can assemble teams to you know do your adventure Studio it and um you're pretty good at it though Sean well I'm just like I don't know you never know right like even uh whatever you know like it's like a belt system it's like even if I'm a blue belt there's still a black belt you know that I could go learn from even if you're a black belt there's they're like oh I'm I'm just there's lifetimes more to learn about this thing but I'm curious Paul how would you summarize for somebody who's talented but hasn't put their focus on becoming great at recruiting what do you think are the um give me like the the 80 20 the the summary of what principles you think are most important when it comes to recruiting and what are there any that you wouldn't expect are they all just things that's like I want to lose weight so I eat healthy and exercise like okay well you know I guess that's true but it's not that not that helpful I kind of already do that are there any things that are maybe counterintuitive or uh or Nuance that that are important the main thing is just recruit all the time always always be recruiting and always be trying to connect with people and you might be going to a you know a coffee social to learn about why crypto's terrible or whatever um and you don't realize is someone going to be there that would be your next unbelievable CMO you aren't expecting to meet them but if you always have your spidey sense out for looking for amazing people and then once you see them do whatever it takes to get them to come meet your team um I have a little bit of an off-color story which I probably shouldn't tell but um someone asked me once about that's the strategy by the way that's the best starting of a story okay so someone asked me about my recruiting style because if you've been recruited by me you'll know that I'm like very very aggressive to do whatever it takes to get you I'll come meet you at a Starbucks near you I'll do it just get and meet my team I've trained my team how they should um behave in their first meeting with you and all that and the first thing we can mind when someone asked me about this about why I'm so laser focused on getting these people is one time I was in seventh grade at Boston Latin School and I was at my locker and this really cute girl walked by and my friend noticed me turned my head and look at her my friend said English don't even think about it she's dating the captain the football team so at that moment that girl went in color and the rest of my world was black and white like I had to date that girl just because my friend said I couldn't and I did end up dating her but it was just like when I recruit and I see someone amazing I've always asked him like do you know anyone even more amazing than you that's a funny Japanese game show that is a guy in Italy looking for the most beautiful woman in the world and when he encounters the first beautiful woman in Italy he says to her do you know any more beautiful than you and that leaves us kind of a hilarious uh succession of conversations but when I'm recruiting and I find something amazing I'll just do what it takes to get them excited and to get them to meet my team and I've always said that the first five people hire you the next 50 will hire the next 500 and it's one thing as a Founder to convince someone to come meet your company but if you've been really good at recruiting that first five those five will close the candidate for you when they meet those five they'll say oh my God I need to work with this team you kind of have I'm clicking around in your site you and darmesh are interesting to me because you guys have this like dry kind of almost nerdy sense of humor that I love so for example if you go to lola.com it basically says the domain's for sale but you can see the history of Lola by clicking here and it goes to PMD pme that's you.org and it's a website where it's like plain text you're just explaining exactly what happens and so that's kind of an interesting way of like going about uh explaining the the story but if you click paulenglish.com it goes to your website and it talks about some of your cool Investments and your your founder stories and things like that and then it says like all the clubs you're involved in and one of them it looks like either you started or you are part of the bipolar Social Club I was reading on your Wikipedia it talked about like you know you had some issues with bipolar and I think that like the fact that you're part of bipolar Social Club is that's I mean that's just like that's pretty funny you know uh I I like I like guys like you and darmesh that's why I love darmashes he's this guy who's like you talk to him and you're like oh you're just a shy you're pretty shy and then you start talking a little more it's like oh you might be like quiet but you're like you're kind of a killer and you're incredibly quirky for example he's got a new project called Venn diagram.com where it's a community for people who love Venn diagrams and uh and then he has another thing called like word play or something like that where it's like a Wordle you know game that makes like a hundred grand a month or something crazy like that and he just has all these things you kind of seem like that are you a guy who's just constantly tinkering on on on stuff yeah I mean I have um I own about 300 domain names and every domain name has a Google Document associated with the idea for the company um I'm obsessed with brand and names and I'm in darmesh and I share this that we're prepared prepared to spend big money to buy a good name and um I do I do it I have lectured a lot of universities and I gave a lecture on where creativity comes from and I've done this everything we're from Berkeley School of Music Dartmouth film school Rhode Island School of Design as well as the more traditional universities you think about and what I do is let's say I'm teaching Thursday at five o'clock it Wednesday at five o'clock I'll have the professor email with students and say take a picture of something tonight that annoys you not a picture you took yesterday not a picture you found on Google but take a picture sometime which annoys you and then I teach the students about how irritation becomes inspiration and how any problem can become the motivation for a product and we go through a very specific exercise about how to do that and I am someone who loves ideating if you look at they say that you're the average of The Five People You spend most of your time with if you want to change your life change the people you spend time with if you look at the people who I hang out with they care about non-profit work philosophy and ideating like improving things things I just have a blast meeting with people like dumbass and saying how can we fix this how can we do this better well you're in the right spot so we stop when we started this podcast it was it was doing all right maybe I don't know 10 000 people would listen to every episode so maybe like I don't know 100 000 in a month something like that and um it was a classic interview show some of what we kind of have done so far up until now getting to know you a little bit where it's like oh oh you built kayak amazing tell me about it you know how'd you do it and it was just like every other Tech or business podcast which is how would you do it podcast and then one day uh just to mix it up I was like I invited Sam on I was like Sam let's just shoot the [ __ ] like we do when we're not on a podcast about like oh have you seen this yo why doesn't somebody solve this dude I tried to book this the other day it was so annoying and we just started brainstorming and so we turned the podcast we called that one the million dollar brainstorm which is basically ideas that we don't have the time to do but um there were ideas that we thought could be like you know million dollar billion dollar ideas and um and so we started that's what we and then the whole podcast took off and so now it's like in the top ranks of the charts and all this stuff and it's I think because we switched into this like eye dating brainstorm mode and there's a lot of people like us that are out there the same way darmesh is trying to find all the Venn diagrammers out there all the vendors we're trying to find all the people that love to shoot the [ __ ] and brainstorm ideas sounds like you're one of them so can you give us a couple of of ideas or maybe from your domains you know pull three names and and what's the what's the one line pitch you have in mind for uh for some ideas that you'll probably never have time to go do sure um I'll tell you some ones that the itch was enough that I actually did a little bit of work on it so one of them was I live in Boston but I also spend a lot of time in New York where I am today and where I live is kind of between West Village and Tribeca I don't know New York that well like I know the those three neighborhoods but I don't really know like Upper East Side Upper West Side whatever if I'm trying to meet someone on the upper west side I don't know what I mean I'm like this is annoying that there isn't a website where they can see that where they are where I am and pick a bar in the middle so I built an app it's called middle.net I haven't I bought that domain name and middle.net allows you to have two people or three or four as many as you want it grabs your location from the browser and it shows you like a coffee shop or bar to meet in the middle now I'm never going to make any money doing that but I did it just because I needed to know where to meet people in New York because I was getting used to the city I couldn't find a way to do it so I built the nav um another one when you meet someone so I generally don't really like going to conferences because I'm a little bit shy a little introverted I've like learned how to be extroverted and I can say more about that if you care to hear about it but when you do go to a conference and you meet someone and you want to swap info it's annoying to do it you know you got to type in phone numbers and stuff better type in email addresses so dumb or you can use this Dot card thing but if to carry this card around this card around so I designed a little app called Fun contact it's funcontact.com and allows you to have a set a list of QR codes one QR code might be just my email not only might be my email my home address and based on who I'm meeting what information I want to share them I just swipe through and show them the right QR code they scan it and I'm in their address block um I built that because I needed it I don't think it'll ever become a company but I just wanted that so I built it how many people are using this this looks cool I'll use it I just needed one of those things the other day it's super cool um I use it last night oh do you wanna hear a funny story yeah so last night was my three-year anniversary with my girlfriend Rachel and we went to San Ambrose in West Village for on our first date three years ago and next to us was Ann Wintour you know who she is theater of Vogue magazine one of the top socialites in New York and Bradley Cooper on our first date to set next to us last night was our three anniversary we go to the same restaurant guess who's sitting next to us on a winter that was super cool but at the end of the meeting I did talk to her for a couple minutes and then she left and then the table on the other side of me was four people working the fashion industry where my girlfriend works and we really kind of bonded to talk about it I talked about the bipolar Social Club the clothing brand I want to create and then they asked my number and I just pulled out front contact and I scanned it now all these young fashion people have my number and we've been messaging each other today about bipolar Social Club that's great what's the clothing brand you want to create so bipolar I have bipolar illness I was diagnosed at age 25 and it's a pretty serious illness you know a lot of people end up killing themselves or ruining their marriage or their job or their lives and it took me a good 10 to 15 years to learn how to manage it for myself it's bipolar one and bipolar two I'm bipolar two so I'm not the most severe type the most severe type his voices they end up homeless and and or worse um not that there's a lot of things for us sending homeless but bipolar one is pretty serious illness bipolar 2 still has problems but over the years I learned how to deal with it and I want to be able to laugh with other people bipolar about the funny things about being bipolar so I created this video series if you go to bipolosocialclub.org there's 10 people with bipolar illness who kind of tell their Journey and it's kind of destigmatizing it saying yeah it's a mental illness and there's some shitty things about it but there's some funny things about it too and I have this thing about bipolar people that if I'm in a cocktail party with 100 people and there's someone like on the other side of the room I can tell they're bipolar like we recognize each other my gay friends say they have gaydar they can tell gay people across the room I can tell bipolar people across the room and we're trying to do something fun so you want to have a clothing brand where bipolar people kind of wear the brand they're proud of like bipolar and proud so bipolar social club we want just sort of a fun name is there anything in uh in the travel industry that you noticed uh I mean because you had more data than you know there's probably only hundreds of people in the world or maybe low digits thousands that are able to kind of see some of the things that you saw because of the scale of kayak and and the company that bought you guys were there any interesting problems that you felt weren't being entirely solved that you think could actually be quite large you know big businesses the problem with the travel industry is the thing I had the most trouble with his flights and airports and TSA TSA is a joke the stuff they do to you it gives you a false sense of security but there's no real security with GSA um that's irritating I wish someone would solve that and make something a lot more efficient and uh safer airlines are running on Old technology they have to be very conservative because if they make a mistake and adopt something too new the plane will crash and of course they don't want that to happen so it's very archaic and old and um I said earlier that I travel between Boston and New York I never fly Because by the time you go through TSA secured and get an Uber in each end it's just it's often faster to drive so as far as things in the in the travel industry I would like to see fix I'd like to see someone that figured out how to work with all the unions who put all these requirements in we're working on the airlines how to work with TSA how to make flying pleasurable it's not pleasurable now I also remember growing up when you go to the airport people used to dress up they were like really excited to get on a plane to travel by now the airports are just a nightmare and I wish someone could make airports Pleasant and make flying Pleasant yeah same it sounds like the hardest thing on earth to do though what do you think about what elon's doing uh so Elon buys Twitter he's kind of taking this like uh you know technology first things trying to change the culture overnight force people back in the office lay off a bunch of people try to ship changes really fast seems a little bit Helter Skelter have you followed that and I'm curious what's your opinion as a CTO and somebody's done tech for a long time I followed it quite closely and put me in the list of a thousand people who want to create a Twitter competitor right now I've been spending a bunch of time in the last week ruminating on that and I think it's a bit of a [ __ ] show I think I always knew that Elon Musk was eccentric and I forgave him for some of his stupid stuff just because he created such good products I love my Tesla cars I'm a happy Tesla stockholder from 2016. um but when I looked at the way he fired people at Twitter it was just obnoxious as [ __ ] like do you really need you're the richest guy in the room in the world you really need to also be an [ __ ] there was no reason you had to March people out of the office and so when I saw that I kind of turned on a little bit and I said I don't like this guy having this much power whether he's trying to control he's trying to make it the main information source of the world controlled by the richest person in the world I'm not very happy about that so I'm either gonna do you think he's gonna pull it off he does stupid things like the Eight dollar verification that was a joke um but if he assemble smart people around him it looks like the smartest people I'll have left were already they've all Run for the Hills but he's going to hire some new people in I'm sure there's some good people that are still there I'm sure he'll do some interesting things with it but I'm really looking forward to all the Twitter Replacements are going to come out it's hard to compete with an entrenched company that has hundreds of millions of users because even if the product is better does Stephen King really want to tweet on sampower.com where there'll be you know a thousand followers as opposed to Twitter will have but a million followers but I don't know I think you stirred stuff up and I want to see The Innovation that comes out that's cool um yeah I think that there's a I think if somebody's gonna do it they're gonna have to come up with a uh a social Innovation not a it's not a techno it's not a technical Innovation um so I have this kind of long-running theory about social networks which is that every social network is a change in privacy policy not a change in technology so like for example you know uh Facebook was this privacy policy change where it was like instead of Myspace um this is only people that go to your school and at the door we gate you with your your school email address there's a change in privacy policy that totally changed people's behavior because now you're more interested in everybody and you're more willing to share then as Facebook became the norm then it became uh you know things like Twitter which was like change your privacy policy I don't have to accept your friend request for you to see my content it's like you can just follow me unilaterally you could just describe you could decide to get my content that was totally different than Facebook then Snapchat comes out it's like here's the privacy policy here all the [ __ ] self-destructs at 24 hours or right like in 10 seconds whatever so content is not permanent here and so people reflect to that and so there's just this ongoing shift of like the what is the like the social rule set that we're gonna follow on this thing and so what's interesting with Twitter is if you're going to compete with Twitter now I think you got to do one of two things you got to do it like kind of like gab or truth socials trying to do but somebody could actually pull that off where they basically take a community of people that are pissed off about Twitter and there's enough pissed off people to go into their own Echo chamber I think that's possible um and then the other one is I think if you created uh you have to turn the disadvantage into an advantage so instead of Stephen King saying why do I want to go tweet here when there's only I'm only gonna have a thousand followers over here you have to make it where it's now benefit like the perk is that there's only a thousand people there so it's like more like private or invite-only style communities that you can join that have the same content format as Twitter or something something like that I think is more likely to work than what people are trying today which is just we're Twitter not owned by Elon Musk or we're a decentralized Twitter it's like nobody cares uh yeah centralized is a joke um I think that's technology looking for a solution I think truth social was an epic failure foreign the things that I care about on Twitter right now is I'm bothered by all the trolls and the cruelty and um you know I look at Tick Tock and I don't watch TV really but I use tick tock probably 20 minutes a day and I like how positive Tick Tock is and I don't know what the Chinese are doing to filter out the Trolls but it's also just it's young people like the average 18 year old is like Kinder than the 18 year old now you know do you think that's true I 100 think it's true I 100 I think that like they don't make fun of each other in the same way that you and I used to make fun of our peers at 18. Twitter I mean Tick Tock is amazing someone will post a video themself and they'll say oh my girlfriend just broke up with me and you know I think I'm very unattractive or something like really revealing awkward and the comments are just unbelievably supportive yeah it's just amazing it's so different than Twitter and so I think it's a Twitter competitor is create the kind Twitter with his no trolls there's no cruelty and then also deal with the misinformation when you see a tweet that says covet vaccine causes autism like how do you smack that down and I'm very interested those two problems getting rid of Cruelty and flag misinformation but doing it without filtering out independent info like there's a lot of places in the world right now where it's scary to be publicly identified and to State your opinion and maybe even the us if you're um there's certain personal problems like some people might not want to say they're bipolar because maybe that will hurt their career um but I think there's I think this there is a way to build something like Twitter that is kind and Truth oriented and I haven't spent a lot of time in the last two weeks bringing some of some other people are also thinking about doing something new and I'm confident that there will be something new whether it's something that I help people with or something completely independent I don't know but somebody needs to create something better Paul we um I'm gonna ask you one last question before we have to move on to the next segment but uh what's your domain portfolio worth right now you think laughs so I have 300 let's say it cost me ten dollars each a year so I'm spending three thousand a year in domain fees I paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy domains I don't sell them that often because I still hold on to the idea that caused me to buy the domain so most effort on occasionally someone will uh motivate me like a young entrepreneur who has an idea for demand that I'm not doing anything with and I'll sell them to them I don't know I have some that are worth hundred thousand dollars or more and I have some that are just funny probably just to me Lola would be mid six figures I would imagine right we paid 500 000 to buy Lola though we were in a bidding war it's up for sale again it's on for sale yeah because we sold the company to Capital One they want everything to be Capital One they didn't want the name Lola so the name is for sale perfect buy back possibly uh okay um amazing and uh where should people go find you I'm on your website I think your website's pretty cool you have like here's how I manage my time here's how I run meetings and I love when people do that when they put their like operating playbooks out there um is that the best place to follow you or should Twitter yeah we're talking about meditation I talk about getting rid of pain and suffering I talk about getting rid of Anger from your life it's just my name paulenglish.com awesome well Paul thanks for coming on appreciate it yeah we appreciate you doing this um and uh I'm I'm on your bipolar Social Club I don't think I have uh bipolar but I I still think it's fun to follow along the site so awesome thank you and we appreciate you coming thanks a lot guys [Music]

here's the headline headline great headline guy sells one dollar bills for fifteen dollars here's how right and so um here's what he did so he basically he's 15 years old and he says he sees a dollar bill on eBay that instead of who's on the dollar bills Washington or something like that uh instead of whoever let's follow George Washington it's Michael Jordan's face in the middle right and he orders it because he's like oh I love Michael Jordan or whatever this is funny and gets it and it's a basically it's a normal dollar bill but then there's just like a sticker paper over the George Washington and you could just like do that you could just go to Office Max and like do this and so that's exactly what he did he goes to Office Max he's like I need to be able to create these because what Better Business is there to sell dollar bills for 15 and so he's uh he goes there and then he goes he puts them up on eBay [Music] foreign what's up um let's jump in what you got ah you tell me you I I think I've been driving the last handful of uh sessions I I I'm gonna ask you to drive right now um let's switch gears I want to do um a topic about you do you I think you know Mark Jenny you know Mark Jenny Mark Jenny's a great friend of mine he's he's an amazing amazing amazing entrepreneur he's an awesome guy we're going I'm gonna meet him next week we're going down to uh stay at one of us he has this like luxury Airbnb portfolio and you should follow him on Twitter well you want me to give his background do you know his background I know a little bit of it but go give the story so if I remember correctly I think he was raised he had a uh something was a little wonky with his childhood I think like he didn't have a dad or a single single household or something like that so he wasn't he wasn't raised in like a very uh um privileged place and then at one point I think he was even homeless and he lived out of like a storage unit or something like that he started a bunch of different companies like info marketing stuff and everything did kind of okay then he started RV Trader I believe RV share which was like Airbnb for RVs he eventually sold a large portion of it to KKR I think a large PE company and he probably made many many tens of millions of dollars a lifetime of money now he has a new thing that he's been doing for the last maybe five or something like that years where he buys I think he owns 20 of them now he's got a huge portfolio of airbnbs and these are high-end luxury homes that sleep like 20 people it's like two acre like a two acre plot with like a fancy four or five six thousand square foot home with like basketball courts tennis courts mini Putt-Putt and he's built this like really really good business making millions and millions of dollars renting airbnbs and he's doing it right and he's got a small team and it's a proper company not like a side project yeah I think what is it like a 50 million dollar luxury Airbnb portfolio at this point yeah I mean I I'm friends with Mark so he tells me lots of stuff so I'm trying not to say any of the numbers because I forget what's public and what's been private so anything that you I'll let you actually say any of the numbers because you're probably getting it yeah that's just what he tweets out so you should follow him on Twitter he's a good follow and it's cool to see like he'll post like a before and after photo of these properties he's like here's what it was and then we added a McDonald's play place in the backyard it's like he does like dope stuff like which I like you know he's not just like and he's totally unheard of him he's got like maybe two thousand three thousand followers on Twitter I think like he's not like a popular like a like a big name person so he tweeted this out the other day and I thought that this was a great we haven't done a blue collar side hustle in a while so I thought this is kind of a great little almost like a blue collar side hustle that he he said he had done I don't know if you saw this he talked about one of his very first um like sort of side hustles that he did or early early hustles was selling dollar bills for fifteen dollars did you see this yes yeah go tell us tell the story so he tweeted this out you can kind of look at it but here's the headline headline gray headline guy sells one dollar bills for fifteen dollars here's how right and so um here's what he did so he basically he's 15 years old and he says he sees a dollar bill on eBay that instead of who's on the dollar bills Washington or something like that uh instead of whoever let's follow George Washington it's Michael Jordan's face in the middle right and he orders it because he's like oh love Michael Jordan or whatever this is funny and gets it and it's a basically it's a normal dollar bill but then there's just like a sticker paper over the George Washington and you could just like do that you could just go to Office Max and like do this and so that's exactly what he did he goes to Office Max he's like I need to be able to create these because what Better Business is there to sell dollar bills for fifteen dollars and so he's uh he goes there and then he goes he puts him up on eBay and he first he looked on eBay and at that time eBay was showing like how many um how many items a seller would sell and he could just keep track of it like okay this week oh wow they're selling like you know 100 of these like that's amazing so he starts doing it he creates an ebay account he starts selling these and he starts averaging a hundred a hundred Bills sold per day for 15 which includes the shipping cost General profit was about 1500 a day about 1500 a day he's he's profiting basically a thousand dollars a day um doing this and then he's he ramped it up and he got it to I think ten thousand dollars a day and um in sales and he became the largest seller of custom novelty collectible dollar bills on eBay but it's a real dollar it was a real dollar a real dollar yeah and if you just add the uh the sticker on top so you could sell can you do that legally I guess so why not I don't know I I don't know there I just thought there'd be some weird rules around money no I think you could do it uh like you know people sell these like coins and whatever it seems legit so then what he would do he's like you know here's how they had to start thinking of growth hacks how do I beat these other eBay guys at doing this so what he would do is he would do one of the auctions and then he would direct message everybody who didn't win the auction offering him the bill at whatever their highest price was and so um and so he's like you know what eight was your top price on it I'll do it for eight and so he started like just racking up as many sales as he could doing this so then he became the top ranked seller which helped him in the organic search uh as he was going from there and I kind of love this and I loved it for a couple reasons one it's just another example of these little nuggets these little stories that shows you there's a trillion ways to win there's a trillion ways to get rich right like he was doing basically 365 000 a year of sales or whatever um you know he was doing really really well at that time you know 100 of these a day what how old was he didn't did you say he was like this teens he was 15 16 years old that's amazing and um and you know probably didn't last forever but these These are these little Arbitrage opportunities that come up and then I started thinking okay like what would somebody do if they're doing that now so here's I'm gonna give you three ideas of how you could do that now first I think you could probably do the same thing like yeah what's old is new what's out is in and I think you probably do the same thing either on eBay or Etsy or find one of the marketplaces and you could try to win doing the same thing I went on Etsy and actually you could see that there's people doing this on Etsy right now and you can see you know how they're how they're doing so possibly you could go do the same thing and compete uh especially if you could pick a different you know Celebrity Face to put on the thing like Trump is the obvious one uh but if it's not Trump like maybe there's some other some other ones that you could do but Trump dollar bills is my first idea of how I would do this second idea um okay well let's let's remix it right we want to keep 80 of the idea we want to change 20 so what's the 20 change I would try to piggyback off of whatever's trending in movies or music or something like that so for example remember when super bad came out and there was like the McLovin uh you know ID his Hawaii ID the Rainbow on it's like the same iconic look I think you could just do McLovin IDs at that time like if that was the movie that had come out now I think you could take a prop from a movie or like in Pulp Fiction they had the bad mother after wallet or whatever like I don't know I had one I don't watch a bunch of movies now but yeah exactly I wanted one of those and you could just like jump on that Trend and be like cool like for the MC level it's like upload your photo I will send you yourself as a McLovin ID and maybe use a little these like AI things to like create the Avatar where it looks the same but I think that's one that you could do really cheap to print and um and laminate and then you you know you can send these out very cheaply because they're they're so thin um and then I saw some other ones if you go on Tick Tock you'll see things that are like this one uh for example I think the second biggest Etsy store maybe the first actually now I think it's second or first on the planet is this thing called Caitlyn minimalist I'm guessing you've never heard of this but no what is this I got a whole thing coming on the Pod of my Etsy Deep dive but but I'll just give you a little sneak peek the top selling stores Caitlyn minimalist and what she does was how she got her break was she was like she was making jewelry for herself her friends were like oh that's cool then her friend had a special request she goes my mom or dad passed away I forgot which one um and like the last thing they wrote me was like this note is it possible to like get their signature in their handwriting as like a bracelet and she's like yeah you just like I could do that for you and she gave it to her for free she was like this is so meaningful to you I'll just give it to you for free and she was like overwhelmed was like this is the most meaningful thing in the world and so she was like oh wow people just want like you know their name their parents name their kid's name and ideally in their own handwriting like done in jewelry and so that's what how do you do that you like send her or is it all digital you like yeah you sent her a picture or you write the name you know it depends if you want to match the handwriting you got to send a picture of the of this of like a piece of paper with the writing on it and there's some tech that just then like tells her like etches it in that look right so it's not like made out of metal it's a metal plaque or like a it's like a dog tag and then she like no no it is it's cut it's like the name is cut and it's like whatever like yeah it is like you know whatever somehow somehow I don't know exactly her manufacturing process but these little like Custom Custom name things I think work and um I was on Tick Tock yesterday when I was thinking about this idea how big is it oh it's huge she's done like probably 80 90 million in sales is my oh my God so she's done two million transactions I would guess her average transactions like you know something 40 50 bucks something like that so yeah that's like 80 million dollars and sales Lifetime and um she's just like this woman out of LA or whatever and um I was on Tick Tock and I was scrolling and I saw another one of these which was um you it was a hoodie it was like here's a perfect gift for the holidays or for Valentine's Day or whatever it's a hoodie and they're like take a picture of you and your whatever your boyfriend girlfriend spouse whatever and it basically takes like let's say it's a picture of you and your wife and you're kissing and it just like it'll etch it'll Stitch like a silhouette of that yeah it's like into the hoodie so it's like a meaningful gift but again it's like this kind of what they call Mass customization right so if you can do Mass customization if you could figure out a manufacturing process to do this there's a lot of opportunity to sell somebody these like kind of gimmick gifts that I think will uh that can and will work do you remember uh Teespring Teespring yeah it was like the print on demand type of yeah it was a really cool t-shirt company started by this guy named Walker Williams and they were like one of these companies that was like oh this is gonna be one of the fastest companies ever to get to 100 million in revenue and the way that they got popular was it was on-demand t-shirt printing and they figured out this hack on Facebook where you could Target people that have your like by last name so it could be like the one thing we all know about Smith's is that they love to party or they also did by location like the one thing we know about people who are raised in Boston is that they love blank and they had a t-shirt that said I'm from Boston and I'm proud or I'm from Boston and I love blank or I'm a proud Smith or something like that and the engagement on those ads was crazy so their CAC was like stupid low and that's one of the ways that they grew and it's just like that it's that uh thing from Dale Carnegie the most beautiful word in any language is the person's name right and I think it's like name location and maybe like where you went to school and then followed by like your friends names and if you could figure out how to like incorporate those into ads or the click-through rate is crazy Pet's face so there's another one which is pet socks pets face on socks I think I have a pair jungle Creations was the name of it so if I remember correctly at one point they did like a million dollars in like a week selling you'd basically go on the website you'd upload a photo of your pet's face and they would print it on socks and they would just drop ship that to you basically and um let me see if I can find uh yeah they did 2018 they did 17 million in Revenue um they did 17 million in Revenue doing basically pet pet face on socks right and so that's the same thing you know Celebrity Face on dollar bill pet face on socks right like we have a buddy who is doing the uh Pet Portraits right like a painting of your pet that would just be like mass mass customized uh produced there's there's a ton of these like little opportunities yeah and the click-through rates on these things are like kill it for the ads so yeah I yeah that's an interesting idea let's see if anyone actually follows through with it I I but Mark Jenny's amazing man he's awesome all right so let me break them one thing up um dude this guy made fun of me the other day for having a course and it hurt my friend or a internet stranger uh a little bit of both and it really hurt my feelings do you feel like because all right so I built a business before I built a few businesses before so a few that I've got the seven figures a few that I've gotten eight figures I've sold things I should feel confident about this and then you and I both have courses I'm gonna actually launch another course that I think can be like a like a million dollar plus a year income stream for me and my family which is awesome it's never good when you have to say for me and my family like if you have to justify feeding your family that means uh there's that's just the insecurity poking out poking out of there well it gives context and what I mean is is it the content the question that I'm gonna ask is is it worth it because part of me thinks well if I'm such a big shot I shouldn't talk about it I should just have [ __ ] and not teach it but then I'm like but I like doing it and it's a significant like it pays for my whole life so do you yeah if you again the only question I was gonna ask do you like it you like doing it yeah all right that's enough right like but do you feel like you feel like a fraud sometimes too or at least I you've never said that to me but you said that when we had when we were interviewing that one person you're like I kind of feel like a fraud every once in a while or I forget what you said not a fraud but um I do feel like I make fun of myself about the course thing um because same thing self-conscious Maybe self-conscious is a better word yeah yeah yeah like you know I would say somebody who is like somebody who is really locked in and I use the word locked in because it's not about how much money you have uh like but it's true somebody who's really really wealthy would not do a paid course I don't think I don't think somebody who's like super wealthy probably should be or would be doing paid courses pretty unusual to do well I I think that's definitely wrong though because like Warren Buffett had a course at Columbia I mean there's a lot of examples of like wonderful investors who go and they uh I don't think Warren Buffett did his course for like I don't think he was pocketing a bunch of money doing a direct sales course type of thing like I if I went and taught a guest if I was a guest lecturer at Stanford right I drove 45 minutes away I go guest lecture at Stanford I'm a teacher there I would be doing that for different reasons and it would feel totally differently than me being like hey I have my power writing course go sign up and pay for it um I don't know why it is it's just different it's a different thing but I would say two things I said locked in because also if you have like a main thing that is totally uh an obsession for you you're you're loving working on it there's so much there's more to do than you'll ever have time to do you really wouldn't take the time to stop pause and go um so of course it's my opinion about myself I should say I would not go do that so to me as long as I'm still doing courses it's me part of my wandering around phase trying to figure out what I really want to do when I grow up what I want to do with my life what I want to do with my time I know that if I get locked in on oh man I really love this project I'm just building Brick by Brick this is something that I'm really excited about there's no chance in hell that I would Push pause and teach scores even though my courses are like it's two weeks out of the year so it's not a lot of time but even even those two weeks I probably wouldn't do if I was in that position in the same way that when I was building my startup I had no podcast I Had No Angel Investing I had no courses I didn't do I didn't tweet I didn't do [ __ ] when I was building my startup for like seven years because I was fully locked in on that it's only after we sold that I started doing a bunch of these things and that became the new the new business was the podcast and other things I think I'm going to keep doing it um but I think you should totally keep doing it you said you like it so keep doing it let me share a little thing I do it during my course because during the course of the uh the writing course some people will be like you know okay I get like uh this lesson was really great I feel like I now have a much better idea how I would write to like kind of go viral or build my brand there's a part of me that just feels like you know they'll ask a question that's like how much content would you say is too much you know so it's too much to post or would you say that like you know I should wait you know until my product launches to start doing content or like they ask all these questions that are sort of like self-promotey and uh self-conscious feelings self-conscious there's just under there's just a layer of self-consciousness around the whole thing or like you know what do you what do you say if you post something and then somebody comments do you take it down blah blah blah do you you know how do you deal with you know a negativity or blah blah and I always just say the same thing I go like oh I'm gonna answer you a question but hey what what time is it I want to make sure we don't go over what time is it and then they're like uh 9 34. I'm like no no it's me o'clock you forgot that it's me o'clock um you know you're thinking about what everybody else might think what they might say and how they might feel and what my bro you forgot the main thing it's always me o'clock you just got to ask yourself do I like this do I want to do this how do I feel about doing this remember it is always me o'clock in fact I want to get watches made or a clock on my wall that just just reminds me it is me o'clock should I wait to go do this thing no it's me o'clock should I care what other people are thinking no it's me o'clock how do I feel that's what I'm gonna do things based off dude there's this funny picture of Fidel Castro you know like the the dictator of Cuba and he's wearing two Rolexes at the same time both of the same wrist just because he's just like he just wants to flex that hard you need to get two watches on each bad that say wait just let me make sure this other one's not broken yeah that's exactly how I feel dude so your question to me I don't even need to answer I just got to remind you it's me o'clock you do it you know what the hell you want um all right you have another thing on here that was like the 10 list yeah the list I I'm gonna read the title and you you go from there so it just says a few non-popular things I've learned from this pot pretty good headline eight out of ten thank you we'll accept I'm gonna say each one and I want you to give me your reaction and then I'll explain a little more context but all right the first one well can you give context on the whole thing like where did this come from or what why did you even think of this list of because unpopular things you've learned from the Pod I see a lot of things online of people talking where they try to explain uh like rules like you do have to work this much or you don't have to work this much or and the reality is is that uh there's a million ways to get the same things done so like for every example of one person succeeding in one way there's gonna be lots of examples of them succeeding a totally different way so I think it's silly to have rules and so I like will see these things of people posting of like oh you know like they say it's a 10-year overnight success and in my head I think man I know people who have had overnight successes were like literally in three months their life has changed and I think it's silly to not acknowledge that you know and so that's how I kind of came up with this list uh okay all right hit me I'm excited now all right the first one I just said so an overnight success which is like one or six months it's absolutely possible and those those exist and they're real agree or disagree all right give us an example for example uh we covered this company called brewmate b-r-u-m-a-t-e and the I think in like year two they got the 20 million in Revenue in year one they got to like eight million and I know a few people that have had other companies were like in the first six months like it kind of just took off and it worked uh so we interviewed who else did we interview um well you're I would say your current stealth company we haven't talked about yet taken off right away yeah it succeeded like pretty quickly and how do you count that do you count that overnight success or do you say I've been preparing my whole life for this right that's the that's the account argument I'll say like I built up a reputation and I'm trading off that reputation but there are times you and I have like talked to people for example we uh I had this guy on who you weren't here but you know him his name's Val do you know Val v a l Val he had a company where in year one it made like 10 million in profit and it was selling like ringtones on the internet and like just some people just have the it factor and then also like luck is real so that's another thing luck is real sometimes you just kind of nail it and it just works not always and most of the time it doesn't but every once in a while it just happens and so I think for people to say overnight success isn't real I think that that's nonsense because I I know a handful of people who are like 19 20 year old kids who they like within a few months they've got something making many many tens or sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars a month in sales and it just works yeah yeah I'm with you on that I agree um all right here's another one I think at least in the beginning of your career where you live it actually really really matters it's incredibly important and the people who don't move some places I think they are at a disadvantage 100 agree uh I did this I was sitting in Australia and I wanted to do startups and I was go I went to a local startup like event and I was like okay um I'm like looking around everybody's being super nice right it's Australia everybody gets along great and I just thought in my head I go who's the most successful entrepreneur in this room and it was this one old ass [ __ ] who was like you know had built something in the 90s and he just like stuck around and then nobody else pretty much and then I was asking some questions I was talking and something and they got the organizer was like dude you should give a talk next next month at the Meetup like this is great we would love to have you teach and I was like teach I'm 23 I've done nothing I was like if and I like At first I was flattered and then I caught myself two seconds later I was like oh wait this just means I'm in the wrong Pond I do not want to be a smart guy in the room they should be like dude you should shut up you don't know anything about anything that's the type of room I want to be in and so I literally went home I went on I think like T-Mobile or whatever I activated a a phone plan and I got a 650 area number area code because cause I was like I need to just mentally before I even move I need to go to Silicon Valley now so I changed my phone number and then I booked a ticket and my mom was like you know what are you gonna where are you gonna stay do you have a job I was like I don't know I'm gonna figure it out but I'll I have a better shot of figuring it out there than I do from here and that was my whole mindset and Tony Robbins has a thing he says about this he goes proximity Is Power and I am a huge believer that proximity Is Power I have done pretty crazy things to just get in proximity of people that I think are awesome like I will take jobs that I think are like the worst job of all the job offers I have if I know that it's going to get me to sit side by side with somebody awesome because I know six months next to that person is gonna do more for me than uh you know like a better higher paying job would have done and so proximity Is Power I'm big this goes beyond business it's Beyond business it's just anything if you want to make it in the movie industry you have a higher likelihood if you at least spend a handful of you years early on in Hollywood just putting in the time matters you know if there's like these funny stories about Bill Murray who lives in like North Carolina or something and he's like totally out of the loop it's like yeah that that that definitely works there are examples of that but I think it increase your odds yeah you want to increase your odds of success the second one or the third one luck is is incredibly real you know I remember like early on in my career I was thinking like there is no such thing as luck it's just hard work and I'm just gonna do it no shit's real shit's real I remember I I've said the story a bunch of times but when we were selling our company Brian Halligan the CEO of HubSpot at the time got in a life-threatening accident two weeks after we closed and there's a world where two weeks before if it happened it could have ruined it I think you've had a couple examples where if one or two things happened before or after selling a business like it like within like a month it could have changed things uh getting sick really matters being born like in a healthy place in a healthy family like things like that luck is totally real and I think that we dismiss it too often yeah I think uh I agree with that I would say luck is real I would also say a big part of luck is in your control and a small part of luck is out outside of your control so most of the luck you experience in your life there's a whole bunch of things at the beginning being born in a certain place healthy your parents whatever those are outside of your control a lot of what happens after that is in your control and we've done the there's a podcast episode called four levels of luck where we talk uh you know on framework Friday we talk about actually manipulating left to be to go towards your advantage if that makes sense there is a set of actions you can take that will increase the amount of luck you end up having in your life uh and this is not like you know hold crystals or something like that it's like more practical uh tangible stuff um okay the last part of that that I'll say is I remember when I was I had moved to San Francisco and I met Michael Birch the guy I came to work with because again proximity's power I just took the job because I was like oh I get to sit next to this guy this guy's like a billionaire who's built four successful internet companies well what is the thing I want to do build a successful internet company I think this is the place to sit and I was talking to him and I was trying to figure out like did this guy just get lucky or what happened because a lot of people I think would look at him and say oh he got lucky because the thing he sold two years later [ __ ] he sold it for 850 million dollars two years later a year later AOL wrote it off for like you know a giant tax write-off and just like and nobody uses bibo now Facebook one and it Facebook Beat It and so some people say oh he got lucky right you know he sold it for whatever and I definitely don't think that's true because he's built like multiple companies that have been successful but what I figured out what I the the thing I ended figuring out was it's not lucky that he won but it is lucky how much he won so he was going to be successful either way but whether that number was 20 million 80 million or 800 million there was a large degree of luck and timing that was outside of his control that contributed to that he could just easily just as easily have been an 80 million Guy versus an 800 million guy and that I don't think was necessarily in his control that was right place right right time right circumstances you know the right person had the right drinks at the right bar next to the right person and I think that you know the magnitude of success is a lot more based on luck not the uh appearance of six not the not the um existence of the success he was going to be successful no matter what all right and I'm going to jump around another one ivy league ish school so I don't know how we're going to Define that but like the top 20 University uh is totally worth it what even if that means that you have to go into a lot of debt I think it's totally worth it I think State schools where you get some type of in-state tuition and you still get a college experience totally worth it most everything in between if you have to go into debt for it I think it's absolutely not worth it like where I went to school when I went I went to Belmont University I was I was fortunate I got a little bit of a scholarship and my parents paid for for it uh 100 not worth it it was at the time I think 30 or 40 Grand a year and it's a no-name university that it does it's just completely irrelevant 100 not worth it but I know people who went to my wife went to an Ivy League school I know people like you went to Duke and like you have a handful of connections if you go to Stanford you have all these connections that seem 100 worth it and here's another like thing if you have Stanford on your resume you're gonna at least get the interview this is true if you look at how people recruit they just gotta scroll through an Excel sheet and it just says where you graduated Bellarmine in Kentucky that cost sixty thousand dollars a year or whatever it is that is not the same as Stanford or Dartmouth like you're just automatically going to have an increased likelihood of getting that interview but even more important than that you're going to meet people who are have been maybe been around the world have Rich parents like that stuff actually matters and act actually those connections and that that influence on your life it really actually matters and it's worth going into debt I kind of disagree here so I went to Duke which is not not technically an Ivy League school but is like considered up there with with ivy league is actually like a sports thing but like you know whatever it's considered like a top school and it wasn't worth it for me because I was not ready to figure out how to make it worth it right it's it's what you make of it it is not gonna be handed to you just by showing up and I had the total I had totally the wrong mindset I thought I'm here I gotta I don't know do the thing I've been doing to get here get good grades um you know eventually graduate pass the test you know go to med school do whatever I'm supposed to do it was like a track and there are some people who made it worth it the people who were like yo we got these resources for free or I'm gonna go and meet these these two professors or I'm gonna get exposure to these other classes that I want to learn about or I'm going to use my time here to socialize plus spin up some side hustles because man there's no better time to find co-founders and build a startup than when you're in college like there were some people who had that right mindset the light my light bulb is not on right like now I got this floating ass light bulb there was no there was no light bulb on at that time and so I misused it I think the majority of people misuse it I did have one phone call that was really important and I'm just gonna say it out loud here because if there's somebody who needs to hear this you know I got lucky that my dad gave me this phone call maybe your maybe your dad doesn't have the same sort of wisdom that my mine did so I'm going to say it out loud I called my dad my second year into college and I was like hey um he's like how's it going and I was like I don't know it's okay he's like what do you mean like how's your you know how school and I was like well grades aren't great he's like oh man what happened I was like no they're not terrible I'm not failing I just like you know I'm a B minus student here and like you know I've been getting A's in high school so B minus was like no not very good he's like all right that's all right um he's like are you trying and I was like yeah I'm trying but man like everybody here is smart like you know everybody here is just as smart as me if not smarter and they all work harder than me and I'm trying to figure out this whole hard work thing but like you know I'm just gonna be honest with you it's like these guys just live in the library and I just don't even like I just figured out where they go they go to the library they go to office I was like I was I didn't even understand where people were going with their free time that's what they were doing was your dad paying yeah parents would pay for it so this is what I told him I go you know you're paying a lot of money for me to go here and uh you know I could go to UT you know State School it'd be I think 10 times cheaper or something like that like five times cheaper maybe I was like you know if you want me to try like I'm willing to transfer by the way just because like I don't think I'm gonna do that well here and so I don't think it's worth it for you to pay this amount of money and so I told him that and he goes um and but I had been telling him he's like he goes why do you say that you know um you're not like good there and I was like well like dude my my this guy who lives next door to me he's like a freaking genius he's like you know he just gets the physics stuff right away and then he's also good outside of class like you know in the Summers he goes and he drives a ambulance in the Palestinian War Front just for fun and like if that's how he spends his Summers like I'm over here picking boogers with you like you know I don't even know what to do in the summer these guys all got plans and internships and and this and that and like this guy's Uncle works at JP Morgan he's doing that thing and I was like and he goes yeah that's the point because that's why you're there you're not there for the classes you're there because when everybody around you is like that it will just raise your standards you won't even know what mediocre looks like you think you're mediocre but that's because you're hanging out with exceptional people if I take you and put you in a state school you're not going to have as many exceptional people around you who for them that's normal and he goes so you know the point of being in college for you to go to that school is not so you could graduate at the top of the class and get the best grades and be the smartest kid in this in the classes it's so that that becomes your network and that becomes your normal and he's basically said something to that effect so you've proven my point by the way it's pretty deep you're kind of proving my point I know I know so I'm saying like that is the the Saving Grace of it I don't know if the um I don't know like that light bulb went on for me halfway through then I started to focus on oh yeah then once I realized that I started to get to know those people before that I was like oh these just they're just different I'ma stay away and like I don't know I gotta find people who are like me who are just basically bumming around here who don't know what to do instead I was like oh the point is to be hanging out with these people and become more like them and not feel like I'm competing with them or intimidated by them all right I've got a few more and I'm gonna actually merge a couple of them so uh um another one having a technical skill if we're talking about internet companies it this mostly means like being able to like code or design uh in my case it was writing which actually I think counts but it's a little bit less more important but having a technical skill like in training to have a skill set is a massive massive advantage and I think being a generalist is not that is just a [ __ ] excuse but you should actually be good at at least one thing and right particularly coding or design would be better but copywriting counts as well and there's a few other things sales actually I think can count but you need to be good at something and I think that most people don't do something you need to be great at something you gotta like train for years to acquire a skill and then go beyond that but you need a skill and I think it's a massive advantage and people dismiss that as being a generalist and that's just like self masturbation that is a bull crap excuse in reality you should be you should try to get great at something you know what's the funniest version of a generalist so generalist already is like you're teetering on the edge of just being a bullshitter yeah it's people who call themselves a polymath have you ever heard somebody call them that's [ __ ] dude yes that's like people who call themselves a contrarians like dude if you gotta label it you're probably not it you you can't be the one who calls yourself a polymath nor could you call yourself a country it's other people who got to point it out that's when that label works it's like you can't nickname nickname yourself brain that doesn't it doesn't work that way you know you gotta you you either you either yeah no no that's not how that worked other people can call you humble you don't get to call yourself yeah so polymath is like the you've you've you've fallen over the fence like Humpty Dumpty and now you're fully in [ __ ] land um when you're calling yourself a polymath so okay that's my that's my rant on that I think you're 100 right you gotta have some ski what do we say you gotta have some attributes yeah you got to break some attributes man you gotta have some side strength time you gotta have attributes you can't just be a dope I hired a guy that I thought was gonna be great because he was like you know saying all the right he was hustling he was saying all the right things and within a month I realized guy's got no attributes he's gotta have some extra what are you good at what can you do oh man I can help with anything okay you can help with anything what can you what problem can you go solve what what are you great at if I hand you this thing what can you just nail this part of it I I would also consider myself somewhat of a generalist but it's you can only real what people mean when they're actually a good version of a generalist is they're great at one thing but they decided not to just specialize as that yeah that one tool for the rest of their life and they've decided to go broader but they got that in their back pocket one or two core skills they're amazing at paid marketing they're amazing at copywriting they're amazing at building at you know coding they're amazing at um sales and they could just do that as their job and they could be you know in the top 10 percent of people if they did that just as their job not the top one percent right because they're not sure specializing and being like I'm gonna hone this craft every day for the rest of my life but they're in the top 10 already at that and then they're in the top like 30 at four or five other things that's a real generalist not somebody who's just average at everything and like we're good at nothing or good at nothing right yeah what did uh Ronda Rousey call it a DNB you remember that what's that mean she go she goes she was talking about this when she was on the top and in the UC and she she goes all these other girls are just dnbs they just do nothing [ __ ] and I was like wow that is an incredible phrase and so in my head when I hear a generalist I'm like let me make sure you're actually not just a DNB um yeah dude a dude nothing [ __ ] like you need to do something and or like in your case your skill set could actually be like Charisma and like attracting and recruiting people and like putting in the right direction that that's a skill set you know leadership is a skill set uh getting things started that that and being like the the the initial match that gets like a fire started I think that's a skill set but I think having a skill and like actually being great at something that's really important all right I'll give you a few more um assume that people don't change I think that's like a safe that's like a safe rule you know we we have this attitude maybe it's an American thing I don't know where it's just like you can change and I do believe that's possible you know I've had demons in the past that I've overcome I know a lot of other people who have had things that they've overcome that [ __ ] does take place it's fairly rare and if you are a person that talks the talk and you don't walk the walk you will never change and if I meet someone like that I just assume oh they're just always going to be like that and they will not change no amount of encouragement is going to make them change sometimes that happens assume it won't and that's I used to have a different attitude when I started my company I'm like oh I'll just get these people and I'll teach them how to be great yada yada yada as I've grown with this pod and talk to people I just the people who act a certain way have always acted that way yeah there's uh my sister says that she goes no no people change for the worse like like they will Decay more often than they'd be like turning it around and like you know going from A to B and so I think you're right that is the working assumption unto you know innocent until proven guilty you know same till proven different is how I feel with people right you exactly you gotta show that something is changing I am not going to assume and I'm not going to be that you know the the stereotypical like the woman who wants to fix him it's like don't I'm not that I'm I don't want to be that when I recruit people anymore no I'd rather just recruit people who are great and like just let them do their thing versus somebody that I'm gonna train and groom and turn around a project it's like why do all that effort no bonus points for making it harder I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out-of-sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better all right the last two so I actually don't think necessarily that the time and effort put into a project is going to dictate the outcome I think to get like uh to build like a company no I would have to like put numbers on it to build a company that like makes you potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases you don't necessarily have you you can achieve that by having balance but I think to have these massive outsized world-changing companies things that create tens of billions of dollars in 10 15 years and have a meaningful impact in the world like a Tesla or something crazy like that um or a stripe something like that I think that working 80 hours a week raising lots and lots of money and having zero balance is 100 needed that said I think you can still achieve a huge amount of success compared to the average Joe and actually do it working 40 hours a week or in some cases after a while less and uh that's like an interesting dichotomy but I think it's to be I think it's true yeah I'll go with that I like that uh what else you got any one more last one and this is like an e this is one of the very few irreversible decisions so having some type of success and taking a meaningful amount of risk before you have a family meaning you have less time you've got less responsibility unfortunately it's an irresponsible irreversible decision but getting an early-ish win early in your career is 100 a huge advantage and you are at a massive disadvantage by having a young family and not having like achieved something and then wanting to go achieve it it's not impossible but like taking those risks early on people should be encouraged to do that more because it is life-changing yeah I think so the um Paul Graham has this essay that he wrote I don't remember the name of it but he basically was like assume I forgot the exact metrics I read this a long time ago I was in my early 20s and I like stood out to me he was like um assume you start out with seven points as an entrepreneur and these are your set the seven points is like your capacity to like take risks and like achieve what you want and then he's like for every one of these things like you know minus one right it's like mortgage and whatever minus one kids minus two um you know and he's basically like you know you can still do it but you your margin of error and the difficulty that you're gonna have and the stress and the stress you're gonna have pulling this off like assume you are sort of sapping your your you know your life Mana your your points uh in terms of how much ammo you have to go attack this thing it's being sapped by each one of these these factors and um I don't remember what all of them were but it's worth you know go go and find this essay because I think it's actually true it's an uncomfortable truth people don't like this because it doesn't sound politically correct because like you know the politically correct thing to say is you can do it you could do anything and um and you could argue and you should by the way if you're 40 you shouldn't be listening to this part you should be saying screw that I got all the wisdom I got my purpose my kids I got the experience oh you know that a 20 year old will never have I have and yes you have different advantages but objectively speaking it is much easier to take risks and if you were gonna just play it out in an ideal scenario you would take your risks earlier when you have less to lose you have less pressure less stress less Financial Obligations it's just a more like Game Theory optimal way to play you don't have to play it that way but it is I think sort of objectively speaking in a a a preferred way to play but you know if you didn't play that way it's okay you can still win anyways so that's the list that's my unpopular truths my my not awesome stuff to discuss but I believe it to be true that I've learned from the Pod and I'll end with all of those rules or whatever I describe them as can be completely broken and there's tons of examples of all of them being not true but yeah that's what I believe to be true so that's my list okay I like it um let me give you another idea all right so uh I was doing do you do like gifs like company gifts for the holiday or something like that do you like send out gifts no no that wasn't that wasn't a me thing do you are you doing the warm tender person who might that you know give giving up my love language bro words of affirmation are [Laughter] odds of approval yeah yeah a pat on the back is the greatest gift the greatest gift is the lack of criticism that I provided you today um so I was thinking about it I was like oh you know and I remember at a you know at a previous company I worked at the the office manager she was good at the stuff and she would get like everybody's address and then she would send these Harry and David gift gift baskets have you ever had a Harry and David gift basket no what's that oh dude imagine somebody's at the door who could it be you go to the door uh hey we have this amazing huge gift basket for you you take it into your kitchen you're like wow what's what's gonna be in this gift basket Sam take a guess what's in this gift basket chocolate I guess could be chocolate could have been chocolate it's not chocolate though what else could it be uh like Local Foods like bricks of salami and cheese it could be sloppy cheese there's a little bit of that there's a little bit of chocolate there's a little bit of cheese in there pears they had these jumbo pears and they know because pears are the most underrated fruit they are the official fruit of my first million as far as I'm concerned it's huge delicious pears were in there and I was like what the hell and I was like giant gift that I received and why does it why is it so awesome it's called The Blend Harry and David Perry and David right so so they they do gift baskets of all kinds but this one was a giant pear basket that we got and I still remember this thing and I was dude you came over to my house I don't care if you're the the cleaner you're just a guy walking by I was slinging pears to you because I had the juiciest pairs that were gonna go bad they were massive and I needed to offload these things and everybody asked oh wow where'd you get this I said my company sent it to me because they love me and that's how I felt and so I thought I I always remember this experience and so then I started digging I was like what's up with this Harry David thing by the way oh man and they're huge Harry and David sold to a company that you know of 1-800 Flowers for 142 million dollars back in 2014. they have a couple you know main brands of this the guy Harry and David which is these gift baskets they have wolferman which is Gourmet English muffins and other foods like that and they have Stockyards which is you know Prime you know Prime Meats basically um and Harry David it's a super seasonal business fall and winter is when they get a lot of their orders and um they got 50 retail stores that like you know help them fill the stuff and it got me thinking about Harry David it got me think about 100 flowers I did a little Deep dive so 100 flowers starts off as a phone number 42 years ago literally it was just 100 flowers and it goes on to build basically like a 600 million dollar plus business they you know for a long time it's just a phone number then 1985 they start e-commerce because they're like oh we need this and they basically have like thousands of locations and fulfillment centers not all owned by them but like fulfillment Partners somebody who can send flowers to you and um you know basically these guys are it's like four it's like a bundle of 14 Brands and let me just give you their their revenue last quarter so they're publicly Trader yeah what's that publicly traded they did 485 million in Revenue uh last quarter so that that means they're now a um what what is that 500 times well and that's not even a popular quarter probably probably their February Revenue like Trump's like the the the yeah the Winter's probably their biggest but let's say it's probably a billion and a half a year is is pretty pretty safe to say uh the gift baskets which are the Harry and David section they're doing they did 148 Million last quarter so that means that's probably like a 500 million dollar your business um florals was 300 million and then um yeah basically they have like whatever they have some other stuff they got Cheryl's Cookies they bought her for 40 million they got um you know personalization mail which is something I don't know they bought for 250 million they got Sherry's Berries you know Cherries Berries berries yeah right it's great popcorn factories bought that for 30 million back in the day so they own all these Brands so I'm like okay this is great now I've also been doing this food gifting thing lately because I'm like you I'm not a big gifter trying to get better at it inspired by our buddy Ramon and who is a prolific gifter the best Savage of a gift um so he got me thinking man he really highlighted my gifting deficiencies so I said all right I'm gonna start sending gifts but I'm not a big plan ahead guy so day of where do you get a last minute gift that can get to that person's house same day same hour maybe maybe it's 11 p.m I'm trying to squeeze it in before midnight doordash and ubereats that's what I've been doing I will just doordash you food because food is you know the universal love language yeah but what are you gonna do send me a pizza at 11 A.M that's stupid I'll send you a pizza and wings I'll send you four slushies I'll send you boba tea I'll send you a Cinnabon I'll send you bro I got options I got I got a whole like menu of my gifting foods that I'll go to because I gotta know and I gotta know what you like right like I know you got that sweet tooth right I might hit you with 16 pints of ice cream and you'll be like this is Sean this is simply too much ice cream I'll be like I know because I love you that much right so I'll just hit you with these kind of these kind of gifts so I think that somebody should build a 1-800 Flowers type of brand because the things I'm gifting they're not made for this they're not made to be gifted right the Cinnabon is not made to be sent to a friend for their birthday but I think somebody should build basically birthday eats or last minute gifts on doordash on I completely agree as a cloud kitchen I'm just getting stronger as the idea builds uh as a cloud kitchen Nationwide it is optimized for gifts so baskets that are nicely like put a bow on it um handwritten notes that's got to be a part of it uh you know so something that's going to be able to give you a note or even a little like little trinket that shows that this is a card that this is for the occasion and then help me help you help me get to somebody else is how I feel about this now the cloud kitchen is already good but if you remember back in the day we had the idea of not just a cloud kitchen but a clout Kitchen where you partner with a celebrity so this is where I need your help we need our celebrity partner who is going to be the face of this last minute gifts brand this Gourmet gifts brand that we're going to create launch Nationwide across ubereats it sounds it comes to mind it sounds like a rhetorical question so I have a feeling you have someone in mind don't do it honestly only person I thought of was Ryan Seacrest and I don't even know why I might as well go with the hardest working man in Hollywood I haven't seen his face in that app I think he would like to be in that app so I'm thinking Ryan Seacrest is a good guy white women like you you'd be fine universally universally not hated you know like a recognizable face um but who else could be who else could be the guy or the gal like you know Mariah Carey she's seasonal maybe Mariah's maybe Mariah is is is maybe she needs to get out of the song game and get into the gift game I I I I don't know but I do think this is actually brilliant I've tried to order one I'm a last minute gift guy too and I'll try to order 1-800 Flowers the the morning of Valentine's Day and they and oftentimes they don't let you you know they're just like it's too late if you really loved her you would have done this three days ago yeah and it's a it's super annoying so I'm totally on board I I I I I I think this is awesome I think this is this is this is great um can you not do that now there aren't any good gift basket companies like if I open doordash right now so let's let's open this I can't get an Edible Arrangement also a great gift man Edible Arrangements wonderful yeah those are good and I think you can get some of those but I think we need a fresh brand so like like you know they have like they have the Flower and Gift Boutique on mine at least um and it's flowers You Know It's Just Flowers right like it's like roses a cookie in a bag right yeah a bath bomb come on come on you think Mariah and Ryan Seacrest are just gonna lose to this no It's gotta be extravagant I I'm on board I I I've experienced the same thing and I've also studied 1-800 Flowers 1-800 Flowers is a really interesting company because they will tell you all types of insights in their annual report and they have so much Intel because they own so many Brands so I'll give an example and one of their reports they said succulents are growing amongst Millennials and I remember reading about that like in 2018 and I told a couple people about it and they started succulent delivery businesses geared towards Millennials and they kill it you know there's now the the sill there's another one called uh what's that other one called dude and they have so much insights or another Insight that you can get from 100 flowers is they're like we're trying to they're what do they say they go we actually don't make a lot of money from flowers but we make a shitload of money from like when people buy vases so I'm like why aren't you like painting cool [ __ ] on this vase and getting people to like spend more money on it you know like why why don't I see like a Frida Kahlo or whoever it is like painting on like this like sick vase and I'll pay you 50 for it right uh dude 1-800 Flowers is actually a really really really good business to go and read their annual reports because they have such interesting insight and they've been doing it for I don't know how old is it now it's from the 70s I think um and so really interesting company of study I love that business I love the gifting business but their market cap sucks why is their market cap so bad their market cap is 600 million dollars is it really yeah it's horrible they just like plummeted over the past uh well I guess everything has plummeted but it's been really bad over the past year that's interesting I wonder if they think they're getting like you know disrupted by something yeah yeah 600 million is the market cap that sounds and the guy who runs it's really interesting I think that the guy who invented it uh who founded it I think his name was Jim McCann and his son now is the CEO and Jim is like a really interesting guy I've had him on the uh I've talked to him on the phone a couple times really fascinating person and his son is is the CEO now so it's almost like a really weird family business another one that falls in this category have you ever studied Omaha Steaks no so Omaha do you know what that is no but that just sounds like exactly what it is so Omaha Steaks it's a mail order business uh they sell steaks so if you want to buy someone like 200 of like prime rib and filet mignon and chicken and like bratwurst and [ __ ] you order from there and they send it to you and it's an awesome gift and I believe it's privately owned they make many many hundreds I wouldn't be surprised if it's actually north of a billion in revenue and they were one of the very first companies to take advantage of internet marketing and so right when the internet got popular you would see Omaha Steak ads everywhere and they were very very very Progressive with like they're they're figuring out how to mark Market on the internet and they're still really fascinating and it's a really really interesting company to study I think it's privately owned you've never I'm shocked you haven't heard of Omaha Steaks but you also didn't know who Dolly Parton was so yeah you're really shocked yeah exactly but anyway look up Omaha Steaks you know I I think they're in like the six or seven hundred million dollar a year in sales uh range they're invented or founded in like 1920. they've been around forever a really fascinating company to study so they are they like in are they mostly in stores or this is like no no no no it's 100 online and you gotta you just have to call them or it was like a catalog and you like would order steaks the very first thing it says the classic gift a 90 package of steaks that's like dude it's a great gift Neville my my best friend Neville who's also my neighbor his mom always is buying them Omaha Steaks and so whenever he gets an order of Omaha Steaks we all go to his house and we like we grill them it's an awesome gift Omaha Steaks is a wonderful gift I'm shocked you haven't heard of it no but I I also feel like this could be done with like the right uh influencer partners like just do a sort of you know a slightly different version of this this seems like the type of thing that is uh you know it's got a pretty good moat probably because they're like you know they probably own the the production or something like that no that's not what their mode is I would think their moat is the fact that like it's been around for so long and so like you saw your parents gift it to people and then you're like like oh man what should I get this guy like oh like I guess like some [ __ ] Omaha Steaks you know what I mean it's like See's Candy it's like why does Warren Buffett like that he's like I don't know just because like that's just like the default gift that men give their wives and like people have seen their parents do it for years and then they grow up doing it I don't know the local Sees Candy here near me they open up a nursing home in the store because everybody there is so old it's incredible genius idea on their part they're like hey actually it was just a funeral home in the back you know it's like one in five tips [Laughter] dude See's Candy is pretty whack like uh I I go and eat it it's [ __ ] but like it does seem kind of dead at this point but you know I guess it's like a dating Center for him like I don't know what's going on why is about 90 in inside C scanner that is that just my local one here no it's always like that but it is like fire like you get something like just some truffles you ever had a good truffle or a turtle I'm all about the turtles though Turtles a great chocolate turtle is there's nothing to bat an eye about but yeah look up Omaha Steaks look up 100 flowers these are really interesting companies to study because like they're also interesting because you think Omaha Steaks and you like judge them of like or at least I did I'm like oh you know it's just like some Omaha company they can't be that sophisticated they are incredibly sophisticated at least in terms of internet marketing and so they're really interesting to go and study right uh okay cool let's uh let's let's cap it here um by the way there's a bunch of fun stuff coming so I've got to say um I want to do the studio tour and breakdown of how we did this like Studio change and what you know what we learned from it what it cost all that good stuff um I want to do a plan for next year we're going to do our annual Awards we're gonna drop the new intro music we're gonna do all kinds of different stuff and uh we're gonna talk about where the pod's going so I want to do that soon and um yeah I think I think of the next the next two weeks I think we're gonna have some fire podcasts yeah we gotta have are we gonna do the Millie Awards yeah Ben let's get Andrew Wilkinson booked again so we can do the Millie Awards and we have uh Austin Reef I'm excited for Austin uh so it's gonna be a good couple weeks foreign [Music]

Sam bakeman freed was 19 years old about 19 years old about when this post was posted in 2010 and I just want to read this is going to be a little bit long but it's really interesting I want to read uh what this post says so it says first off and this is a review of someone using this drug first off I'm a 19 year old male about 170 pounds who is experimenting with nootropics out of curiosity a few months ago I ordered a bottle with 60 doses of 5 milligrams of celeging celogenolene from a research chemical site and it looked and I've been taking it pretty much every day the day I started taking it I noticed a market increase in motivation for me it was money there was a huge desire for me to make as much money as possible foreign what's going on we have an awesome episode so we're going to start off by talking a ton about controversy in fact this entire episode it feels like it's about controversy so the first part is on FTX and we talk about the drugs that they are on and it's kind of funny actually uh how ridiculous it is the second thing we talk about is the liver King you guys have to hear the stories about this yoked guy who's like this Fitness influencer who's built this 100 million dollar company turns out he's been on steroids the whole time but in my opinion that's actually not the most interesting part the most interesting part is like these emails that we got our hands on about him talking about how he was going to get huge on Instagram and he totally called this shot uh and then we talk about buying and selling high high uh really expensive real estate we're talking like things that are like 30 40 50 million dollars and how this one woman Katie bought some real estate that kind of sent some signals to Sean and how he thinks it's a little a little mysterious on how she actually afforded that it's a really really interesting story so check it out I think you're gonna like this episode all right we're live I have two interesting things to bring up to you and I think they're both pretty hilarious hit me the first one we talked about FTX we've talked about Sam bakeman freed but something and and then the next two segments I completely ripped off a a YouTube channel called more plates more dates so I don't want to take credit for any of this something that's interesting is that these guys were doing drugs like like sometimes they call them nootropics but they're really just amphetamines or drugs and they were talking about it publicly where looking back it's just hilarious how blatant this was and they just were rubbing it in our face and so I I want to talk about that do you know anything about that with these folks uh so I know what you're talking about I know that they were kind of like open about it promoting it but not uh but you like like you said this wasn't seen as too much of a red flag it was sort of almost like oh man this is that like ultra competitive nerd thing where they're like basically you know I guess doing Adderall and making all this money you know so when you're making money it's like not saying is as much of a bad thing when you scam people and lose everyone's money then it's like these drugs are a problem all right so this YouTube channel is called more plates more dates it's the guy who breaks down like what drugs different celebrities are for different roles whatever and he goes into in-depth analysis on it and it's pretty nerdy but it's quite awesome and he did this thing talking about uh FTX and the drugs that uh Sam bakeman freed was on and a few interesting segments the first thing so basically this whole FTX Saga it boils down to like two interesting people so Sam bankman freed who's like the leader and then like his right-hand woman uh what's her name Caroline Caroline Ellison I believe so in April 5th 2021 here's listen to this tweet that she she put out nothing like regular amphetamine used to make you appreciate how dumb a lot of normal non-medicated human experiences and at the time she's running Alameda research which has billions of dollars under management and she's making huge decisions and she tweets out the dumbest thing this morning I was lying on the couch reading a book then I decided to go for a hike but it took me like half an hour from the point to muster the energy and motivation to actually get from the couch I guess this means this is when she wasn't on drugs and the hike it was good my body had no problem making the countless exertion of effort involved in ascending and climbing this whatever but the second dumbest thing that I realized is that apparently there's about a 20 of my brain that's dedicated to food so when you're on amphetamines you don't worry about food and that she's just tweeting this in the in the open you know this is like this is she's just telling us all to go [ __ ] ourselves you know all the the people like it's just it's that's hilarious that that like looking back that that was actually a thing that she's just openly talking about this and it's and it's wild and I actually said that openly she had a Tumblr where she said she wants to date a guy who's uh like wants to conquer the world and wants to dominate Global governments like control governments control governments and I thought that she's like that's right that's what I'm into it's so funny and so uh another interesting thing is there's this picture of SPF of Sam and he's sitting at his computer and you see like a patch on his arm and you see a rapper like a uh like a like it looks like a food rapper on his desk and people start analyzing it and they realize that this picture basically and this is actually autism Capital my favorite uh my favorite source of news they actually tweeted this out and they go if you look closely it's actually a stimulant patch that uh Sam that Sam was wearing and it's called Uh e-m-s-a-m which is basically a drug normally used to treat depression or Parkinson's but for off-label use people use it for alertness and focus benefits and so they go down and they talk about it so emsa em Sam that's the brand name drug but it's really uh what is it uh lean I don't know seligaline I believe is what it's called and it has fatal effects if it's eaten with meat products which is interesting because SPF was a vegan so that kind of checks out and the downsides of it are that it is linked to impulse control disorders such as pathological gambling and Hyper sexuality which could lead to some of the weird things that that Sam was doing and here's what's even more interesting in March of 2019 there was this uh like website that was built for users of this drug and in 2019 this person left a post and it said uh where basically he was reviewing his thing and at the time if you do the math Sam bakeman freed was 19 years old about 19 years old about when this post was posted in 2010 and I just want to read this is going to be a little bit long but it's really interesting I want to read uh what this post says so it says first off and this is a review of someone using this drug first off I'm a 19 year old male about 170 pounds who is experimenting with nootropics out of curiosity a few months ago I ordered a bottle with 60 doses of 5 milligrams of celeging celogenolene from a researched chemical site and it looked and I've been taking it pretty much every day the day I started taking it I noticed a marked increase in motivation for me it was money there was a huge desire for me to make as much money as possible I'd never been a material person at all although I had money I never thought about doing anything with it other than spending it I guess some might say that and then the arrow kind of screws me up on Twitter but some might say that um possessing a money is a bad thing but the feeling was and is nothing short of complete empowerment I love doing math problems in my head involving money the thinking was so clear from having a bit under 500 in the bank to having over ten thousand dollars in two months that I had since I started taking the drug of course I can't quite disclose how I made this money but I have to say that I engage in activities that I probably wouldn't have without selling uh and then I'll kind of like skim the rest of the stuff but it says I was motivated to use better vocabulary while speaking to people I used to be pretty goofy and not many people took me seriously but now when I talk people listen there's a notable increase in strength in my voice and I would say I probably had low confidence before taking this and now the words that I say instead of saying may I form it's I will it makes it makes people tend to look it makes me tend to look down on most people but not in such a way that it would affect friendships although a few friends mentioned to me that I changed because of my general mindset this Probably sounds incredibly cocky but it's true confidence I'm still nice to people it's just that I it's just now they seem I just now that I look more confident another benefit is emotional numbing before taking this I would jump on any chance to be with a decent looking girl and I'd become attached pretty quickly on it I'm completely rational and my emotions my emotions are never affected by my thinking I'm not even looking for a girlfriend until one can rationally show me that she's really worthy girls love to play the game to say the least I'm a calmer I'm calmer with a without emotional outbursts when I get upset with people I simply use my enhanced Charisma to undermine them rather than losing control this is awesome that's not the reaction I thought you're gonna have it like are you trying to take this right now no my enhanced Charisma increased desire for money no patch with my first million in it dude I uh I was prescribed Ritalin for my like when I was in fourth grade and I took it for one year and it was the [ __ ] worst since then I've never taken any of this crap so I hate it I hate these amphetamines but this is a pretty good commercial this is pretty great this is pretty awesome it's also like what if this is him what if this actually is him it's probably not him just by odds but wait to assume that it is him and you know as we say F this guy so so yeah it's him as far as I'm concerned but but even if it's not him this this person if you go to the website by the way where this forum it's like a nerdy form like I it definitely like there's no evidence but it adds up to where like I could I could I could see that this could be him um but even if it's not him the way this person describes it makes a lot of sense for how this guy behaved no excuses but like this guy was crazy I feel like these are gonna become excuses for his behavior no I'm I'm there's no no excuses this guy is a this guy is um he did all of this under his own control and volition and uh that's that's where I that's where I stand well it's there's no excuse because they just bragged about it you know he tweeted it he tweeted needed another thing where he goes the best thing I do is take stimulants in the morning and then sleeping pills don't have to go to bed I'll just round this out I didn't this was another funny thing the uh that's just it explains why this is not an excuse the former co-chief executive of Almeda he bought a boat shortly after stepping down in August only months before the trading firm collapsed and he named his boat that he bought soaked my decks yeah you can't write this uh stuff but did you know like the you know one of like the sort of most damning things about how FTX collapsed I feel like this kind of gets lost on the shuffle of there's a whole bunch of details and it's kind of overwhelming but one of the truly unbelievable Parts is that they just lost track of 8 billion dollars and he called it poorly labeled Fiat accounts and what this actually was his explanation as far as I understand is at the beginning FTX when they launched the exchange they're trying to move fast kind of Scrappy startup thing they didn't have their own bank account and he was running Alameda before that so they're like oh cool just send the money to Alameda and then we'll we will give you the credit in your FTX account and they never trued it up they never moved the money from the Alameda account to the FTX account it just accrued in the F in the Alameda account and then they just used it to trade so the money literally never even made it to the bank account of the of the of the company itself and that's what he meant when it was like people are like did you loan the user's money did you did you do this against the terms of service did you uh did you lend us out or give this away to your other company it's like no actually I never even got it it went straight to their bank account I never even realized it uh we forgot to like connect the link later and so eight billion dollars of deposits just went straight to Alameda and never even touched FTX and we were just like it was just being like there's no Market on the account yeah lazy unorganized or fraudulent right like you you take your pick you know pick pick three as far as I'm concerned and so uh that that I thought was crazy so you know these stimulants aren't so stimulating if you feel like forgot to to like you know pick up the eight billion dollars that you you know your business is generating like if you get beyond the fact that people are hurt here which is a big deal but get beyond that it's hilarious you're like it's funny it's funny like this is like it like just what's funny is how ridiculous this is and and I fell for it too but uh it it's wild this is a wild story I want to see like um you ever seen the movie Miss Congeniality where Sandra Bullock goes from this like you know Butch cop to like a beauty pageant Queen and they like transform her I want to see the version of that for FTX which is like Sam is this normal looking that guy they're like you know grow out your hair he's like what do you mean it's gonna look completely disheveled they're like yes disheveled equals genius and they're like hey when you're walking turn your knees in he's like ah it's a little uncomfortable they're like you need to walk like this okay and they're like hey you need to put this patch on and they're like hey um can you start saying things like you know this is a 12 Sigma event he's like what does that mean they're like don't worry about what it means it sounds provocative and so you know they're training him to be this like yeah by the way autistic hero uh you know nerd that everybody's gonna believe in he's the type of guy who probably wears a backpack wherever he goes and he doesn't walk he runs he's that type of guy dude did you see the clip of him running through the Bahamas was he running it's hilarious somebody found said there's a clip posted on Twitter um I'm sure your um your boys at autism Capital have it on their feed but basically it's like SPF on the run and it's literally him wearing a backpack running and he's doing the run where you know like most people run like this you put your hands behind your back he just had straight arms and so he was just swinging his straight arms like a penguin running as fast as he could just down the street and they're like where is he going that's crazy man this whole story is crazy crazy crazy he came some more stuff leaked yesterday or like he did it he did a random interview with somebody who's like you know a YouTuber with 10 000 subscribers he like decided to give her the scoop and he's like um she's like she goes so what you know she addressed each of the concerns she's like so you know when you guys reopened withdrawals but only for the Bahamas where people felt like maybe you know the employees yourself included and insiders could cash out and everybody else was stuck and it was like 24 hours where you guys you know people in the Bahamas could withdraw nobody else what was that about and um you know they're previously they had said oh the Bahamas government ordered us to do this that's what that's the first lie he had told um and then the Bahamas government came out and said we didn't do that what are you talking about so that was kind of debunked and so then on this call he just goes yeah um there was a decision you know we had to make because you know it's funny you don't want to be in a country where everybody's angry at you so we had to do that just you know because FTX is based in the Bahamas if we just didn't want to be in a country where everybody was mad at us it's like what this is literally you're saying this out loud like that was your reason for this that you didn't want to get like beat up basically like how you don't want to get your door kicked in by the government how can you have Okay so let's get Beyond like the crime now this is the stage of a criminals period where you're supposed to shut the [ __ ] up you don't talk you say I plead the fifth where's my lawyer I don't talk I go what's going on tour he's going on tour he's speaking at a New York Times uh Summit with Zuckerberg and like oh you know these politicians I think Mike Pence is speaking there he's going on tour I think that's today by the way I think he's he's yeah he's going on tour and I don't think he has any idea what he's trying to say because uh none of it makes sense none of it sounds good and both his parents are lawyers incriminating himself more yeah and then he tweets out this dumb stuff where he's just tweeting like letters as a joke this guy is just what the hell you're you shut up you don't say a word don't say a word you shut up I hope he keeps talking keep talking keep talking boy yeah you keep talking I just want to hear hear what you got to say let you know go ahead build your own trap that's fine it's crazy so I had to bring that up and then another Scandal you wanna can I give tell you one more interesting Scandal this might be less interesting but it's interesting nonetheless so we talked about this guy named liver King a while ago do you remember that yeah the liver King the uh just for those who don't know the ultimate meat head this guy looks like a caveman he's absolutely jacked and he's just like always eating like raw you know kidneys from a cow like he he's butchering and eating it so he basically the back story is this guy owns a company called ancestral supplements or something like that where it's all like liver and meat organ supplements which I think that's great I I I like the people who I like follow they're like yeah that's like fine that's a fine you're in the demo let's just say yeah yeah like I I I guess that's good for you Persona it was called there you know like instead of Joe Smith or Jane Doe they're like okay so a sampar is online how are we gonna talk to him how are we gonna get this guy buy her like liver tablets so it came out yesterday that basically this was another more place more dates thing that more plays more dates as YouTubers name's Derek he got a hold of these email exchanges back in forth with a doctor that Brian Johnson who's the liver King so basically this guy looks huge he's yo she has millions of followers and he makes a hundred million dollars a year on supplements they have these documents uh these emails back and forth of Brian ex saying hey uh I'm gonna get popular on social media in the next month or two I need to look totally shredded here's the steroids I currently take I spend fifteen thousand dollars a month and here what else should I be taking um and so spoiler alert he's on steroids but that's not the interesting thing he's on lots of steroids and the reason this is a big deal is free for the past year or two he's gone on podcasts and he's explicitly said there's not a chance I'm on steroids no I'm not on steroids I only do this because I eat my liver which you guys should buy too at my website so that's shady but whatever he's on steroids but here's what's interesting I wanted to call out a couple different things in the emails that he wrote so he says let's dig right in as it relates to my goal I'm the face of several Brands including ancestral supplements and I've hired a team to build the liver King brand with the goal of 1 million followers by 2022 I looked it up he had he wasn't even really he had zero followers he had like single digit thousand followers when he when he wrote this in an email and he hit a million followers before this number uh before March 22. impressive he says uh I've hired a film crew who's living at my house and they're filming uh they're filming constantly and I got to stay in great [ __ ] shape year round and what's interesting is that he nailed it this guy totally called his shot and he hit it and even though he's a liar I respect that and so he basically says that he goes um I live on uh I live on a 15 Acres on the lake and have everyone come to me my Ranch is 500 Acres of paradise I don't go out to eat I don't go bowling I don't go to the movies I stay home and people come to me that was kind of interesting but here's another funny thing that he wrote the doctor asked him all these different questions about like what foods he's allergic to what is current uh daily routine is what type of foods he's eating and then he says what type of food this is funny what type of food do you like to eat that isn't bodybuilding related none even when I eat sushi I have a sushi chef come over and make it exactly how I want it if I ever have ice cream my my wife makes a lot colostrum ice cream made out of first milk colostrum I don't know what that is egg yolks vanilla extract and a little maple syrup and then listen to this he goes you should come over and [ __ ] some of this [ __ ] up with me Doc and uh and then he says uh the doctor says how's your mood uh as you go deep in your diet can you function and continue with your jobs and deal with friends and family or does it become increasingly difficult to maintain your obligations you know outside your body building goals listen to this response I can do anything I'm unequivocally strong in mind heart and spirit and even though this guy's a liar kind of dig it I gotta dig this attitude let's get your moral code straight all right guy proven liar borderline scammer for lying about you know what's causing his gains um weirdo absolute weirdo absolute weirdo it is daily routine he goes first thing in the morning redeemed himself in your eyes totally redeemed himself no not not quite it's kind of like Lance Armstrong cheated sued people for saying he cheated ruined people's reputation but was a real competitor real real competitor I guess gotta love the guy yeah so like you know for us you're good in my book you know people you know they're you know my dad used to say no matter how thin a pancake there's always two sides to it and uh so anyway kind of interesting that this guy he says he's spinning by the way 15 000 a month on steroids that's got any uh Eddie goes I'll spend whatever like I need to get this done so I just think it's interesting that he had a goal he called his shot and he nailed it that's kind of interesting was willing to go all the way and all in and um did it his way so you know there is there is respect we do put respect on his name even though he was a liar and scammer um that's that makes sense to me though I'm like I'm with you other people might hear that and be like what I don't get it I totally get it I'm the same way I'm absolutely the same way people who are saying Sam's camera go in and out of focus we're just we're working on the new studio look we got to figure out some settings so just yeah just have a seizure today but by next episode you'll be totally fine um all right so let me give you one while we're on this top well actually I want to do two things number one you've said The more plates more dates guy a couple times now um you know is that a dog whistle to try to get him to come on maybe could be but totally it is I love this guy man but you also tweeted something out the other day and I think he's a good example you said something like the following you go to have a great podcast you need either like three factors and I think you said unique slash amazing content uh unique slash amazing delivery and then the last one is unique slash amazing perspective so like you have specific knowledge or insights that like you know the average person doesn't have and you said you need at least one to have a successful podcast um two is she was great three would be unbelievable but extremely rare and you got a bunch of replies to this um and I would I want to first ask you about I want to ask you a little bit about that but also let's use this guy Derek from more place more dates as a as a as a case study here I think he's a perfect example of what you're doing so unique amazing content before him I didn't see any YouTube channels I'm sure there were some but they were nobody was popular but there wasn't like a common it wasn't a common content category to be like I'm gonna make videos speculating is this dude on steroids and if so what roids do I think it is that's his that's his entire promise of his channel from a non-judgment perspective this guy Derek says yeah here's what I use he's not trying blood work he's not trying to take them down he's just trying to speak honestly about what he thinks and he's like yeah there's my here's my guess uh if I'm this dude I'm like you're looking like this is what I'm doing and you know here's the evidence that I'm piecing together to make that that claim and so you need content check unique delivery his delivery is actually very very good it's very good because it's non-judgmental because it's not overproduced because he's not trying to sell you something during the thing and he's just like humorous on laughing about it so he does it without like there are other people that do this and they're either judgmental or they're like aha I'm ripping the mask off this Scandal like I Expose and he's just like he's like you know he'll like the guy will claim he's all Natty like all right sure bro like whatever you say right like I don't think so and like that's the level of like his delivery and then he and he has a lot of really good phrases like he'll be like oh this guy's looking Saucy here yeah he's like it's sauce to the gills he just wants to be a little Saucy that's all right like he just has really funny his delivery is good I don't even care about I don't have any interest in steroids I don't even care if other people are taking steroids I will watch his channel because his delivery is so good he's so likable like he's very like he watches his channels like I would be friends with him and it's actually a self compliment it's a self-delusion that you think he would be friends with you because the guy's like just like he just seems like a good dude a great hang so I think that's the second one third amazing perspective he has he has that also because he actually has quite a bit of scientific knowledge but also like Street science so like he's not just straight academic nor is he just a meathead he's got enough knowledge about the science while having enough you know sort of Street smarts about what a dude's actually use when they're doing this stuff and how do they say it makes them feel what do they say are the side effects dude he's so good and you want to know another interesting thing about him is no one knows his last name so I actually tried to like Google and I only spent five minutes I'm sure I could really find it but he's done a really good job everyone just knows him as Derek from more plates more dates and you can't find a lot of info like personal information about him wow that's interesting I didn't know that um and he records I think he records every I think he makes a video every single day so he makes a video every single day and he's got 1.5 or 2 million subscribers and it's really good and what's really fascinating is that there's guys like him who they don't call themselves a journalists with a capital J but they really are you know these guys are doing investigative journalism and it's quite good it's better than a lot of different stuff out there that's done by the quote professionals yeah yeah totally um so yeah he's great okay so that's a good example um should we can should we continue the theme of uh by the way for that for that podcast one that I quoted I I further I said um I go let's do all in for an example uh their delivery it's decent I said it's decent which I thought was like a compliment but I was like their delivery is is pretty decent they're not like a comedian you know they're not like um cereal or like some like investigation especially well well produced and cut and edited and or or like a unique format that we haven't seen before it's like you know four Dudes on a zoom call yeah four guys on a zoom call sometimes speaking through airpods and like they're quite funny they're quite charismatic but they're not like 10x better at that than other people who are I'd say it's definitely above average like you know the intros they do the kind of ball busting and like the way yeah but that's not 10 times that's not 10 times better than the other people of that magnitude I'm comparing them to like the other like people who are doing great yeah uh it's maybe better it's maybe worse than a sum it may be better than a lot uh and then what else did I say I said their delivery was was decent their content like the the format and everything that's just normal it's just four people who are speaking it it's kind of rare that you have well they're talking about current events which is not like current events and news which is not like um super unique it's not a super content angle right that in itself is not the unique part but the thing that makes it amazing is that it's them it's for people who typically who are incredibly like ungodly successful potentially some of them are billionaires and they sit down every week and they talk about all types of stuff in an unfiltered way that is 10 times better than most things that are trying to become that and that's why they're awesome and people including Jason I I think Jason one of the hosts he was like I think he's thought I was insulting him uh and I'm like no dude this is like this is a compliment I said like it's it's like saying like LeBron is like good at a lot like he's so such a great basketball player but maybe he's not the best at blocking shots or whatever yeah and people got mad at me and they're trying to pick a fight and that was not my intention I I to me I was complimenting them yeah yeah yeah I thought you were complimenting them but you have a way with words where you'll like you'll add a little period after a word you're like it's decent period and that that kind of sounds like you know like like this you gotta you gotta watch the periods dude the periods totally change the tone like if you're using a period like it's [ __ ] Twitter I have like 190 characters and you used one of them on a period and you know that that thing that adds that adds the tone right I did not mean it that way I did not mean it that way but you also doubled down after he was like you know whatever he put that I took that personally meme up there uh you're like you know I said what I said it's decent oh I didn't double down I I don't backtrack I'm like dude yeah your delivery is like pretty good you're not like Theo vond you don't say like the most like funny [ __ ] on Earth you say pretty great stuff but whatever that's my point Sam the kind of guy that doubles down on a 17 in Vegas he's like whoa sir are you sure I said what I said give me another card our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better all right so I have one that's not it's not in the category we did SPF liar probably fraud scammer whatever we did liver King liar probably scammer probably allegedly whatever this is not that but I am calling this The Curious Case of Katie Han that's right music what was that music that's my new that's my new uh like X-Files Style music whatever we're getting into a uh a little case that makes me say hmm how does this work so how do you spell This Woman's name I want to Google her while you're talking Katie like Katie is it Katie and then Han h-a-u-n um okay so she you know I think you probably know of her um seems like a great person so you know uh I think her her backstory is kind of like uh you know went to Stanford law um and then worked you know for worked for the government so she I forgot what her she was like Federal prosecutor or something it was her job title um let me find my notes here so okay so she uh she goes to Stanford law then she spends a decade as a federal prosecutor uh for the the doj um and she's you know and then she creates at one time the government's cryptocurrency task force and we know her because she was involved with or helped uh I think after the fact with the Silk Road case so the Silk Road was you know that website where people were buying and selling drugs and you know you could buy anything assassination attempts you could buy a lot of crazy [ __ ] on there um they eventually take Ross down in your your neighborhood uh in San Francisco and after the fact they you know have all this Bitcoin from because Silk Road was using Bitcoin for most of the purchases and so she's involved in that case that's kind of how she got on my radar was she did a great interview with Tim Ferriss where she's talking about that story so you know I hear the story that's kind of amazing like um this person who like you know was just grinding it out as part of the government and that's kind of was the impression I had of her was this like awesome civil servant so imagine the look on my face when I hear that Katie Han just purchased a 41 million dollar home in Atherton 41 million dollar home what's going on what's going on here Katie what are you how much do you have to be worth 41. go to doj average salary Federal prosecutor 94 000 to 150 000. okay so she worked there for ten thousand years no okay that's not it so what's what's been going on so Katie's on at one point with that doj seller she could pay her property taxes for a month yeah The Gardener is like yeah her property is making that so so but you know she made a switch so she did the decade there and she's doing these like I forgot what you call like the RICO cases and it's like these crazy like drug cases cartel stuff and then she makes the leap and she comes all of a sudden she's a VC so uh she becomes a VC at Andreessen Horowitz in 2018 she joins as a general partner uh the year before that 2017 she was named to the board of coinbase that's interesting I guess like you know they wanted a diverse board member who had a different background coinbase no you can't you can't say that she's a dive I mean that's [ __ ] you know what I'm saying like her her work history so she's not a business person she's from like a regular the regulatory like you know okay cool side of things that's her expertise so that's a good person to have on your board somebody who know who was part of the government's cryptocurrency task force definitely see the value there but how much value is what I gotta ask that's the question of the day how much value and what's this too much value okay so she joins the board and she gets uh so okay no on the day of her IPO it was worth 73 million that was April 14 2021 and um she sold pretty much the top so she was selling at uh you know she was she was sold at that that price and then she sold even more as it went up to like whatever 300 something dollars a share uh it's currently trading you know for far less than that so let's see what coinbase is trading at today coin stock price we've got 40 something bucks a share yeah 41 a share whatever 300 380 you know 380 type of range so sells the absolute top but what I have to the question I have and so I'm not saying anything wrong or illegal yeah more power to you what I don't understand is why did this person get a hundred million dollars for sitting on the board is that not an outrageous number so like there I don't think there's any wrongdoing but God damn how did somebody make so much for doing so little like a board seat you know a board member does not work very hard for the company a board member does not usually create this much value I thought board members typically got like 250 000 a year like yeah that's the normal board compensation so what I want to know is why did this board member get a hundred million dollars and um I don't know if you know the answer to this but that is the that is why it is the Curious Case of Katie Han what what well you're asking this question you're asking this sounds like a leading question it sounds like you have an opinion but keep in mind I'm looking just at earlier about these things she founded a thing called Han Ventures which is which has a 1.5 billion dollar uh fund that's focused on web three and I believe she's the only partner so the fees on that alone two percent venture capitalist gets two percent management fees on is typical and her 1.5 billionaire fund and she's the only partner I think that's 30 million dollars per year that she takes as her management fees that's [ __ ] crazy and when she was at Andreessen uh again hard to know the exact specifics here but like they're the a16z crypto fund was seven billion dollars I think at the time um there were five general Partners uh you know so I don't I don't know exactly if that if that number's the total after coinbase is exit or if that's what they raised I haven't gone that that far in but like I think it's it is believable that she was making 30 million dollars that she's made 30 million dollars plus off of her slice of the Andreessen crypto fund before she left um and by the way I think her portfolio there coinbase was the only one that that has exited there's are we there's autograph there's Royal there's a bunch of others but like these are these are early early bets right because we're only talking four years ago when she joined the fund um so kind of crazy that somebody made 100 100 million dollars plus off of uh off of their board seat after working for the government for 10 years afterwards yeah and so I don't know what's going on I don't know if this is like a very fancy way of like buying favor in uh in Washington it's like hey we're going to get this veteran who's super plugged in you know great she gets this uh you know really really really really really really really really really Capital really strong comp and um you know she's gonna make sure that the right people you know think favorably about coinbase uh I don't know if it's that I don't know if this is standard I don't think this is standard for what board members make yeah that's crazy what did the other board members what's going on there did you look at the other board members um the during the S1 you could see kind of who the other major shareholders were um I didn't see any of the other board members that were there but I could I could be wrong so there's Mark Andreessen is there Fred Wilson those are the investors um Maybe yeah I mean hers is just outsized so like uh I don't know who who's Goku rajaram I think he's uh I think he might have been another board member so let me see coinbase I don't know if he worked there if he's a board member um but he got you know whatever he had was 600 000 shares hers was 5.9 million uh shares so like you know just simply like a step a step higher yeah he was also a board member so like for some reason she got 10 times more in her stock Grant than this this dude Gokul did this is yeah this is wild things that make you say I don't I I agree this is a very curious okay it could be a perfectly reasonable accident for this I don't know it I would love to hear it um and I'm not I'm not owed any explanation either I just thought this was weird because I'm like how the heck did this person who worked at the government for almost their whole career except for the last three years how are they buying 40 million dollar pads that doesn't make sense to me um and then I looked at where the money came from and then that didn't make sense to me but again that might be my own limitation of you know knowing how this stuff works have you ever spoke to her or like heard her speak I've heard her speak yes she's um she's you know whatever she tells cool stories I I heard her on a couple of podcasts I have she's invested she's co-invested in some of the crypto deals that I'm in so I'm not saying like yo she's a bad investor if she is then I probably I'm terrible uh so so you know I don't know much about her from that angle but there was one other funny thing so there's this guy uh LeRon who uh LeRon shapira I don't know if that's I don't know if I say that right but have you seen this guy on Twitter he's a fan so he listens to the show he is also the number one like crypto skeptic on Twitter so his mission is basically to just expose the like you know like the fallacies scams and hypocritical things about web3 and so he tweeted this out uh four days ago he goes Open Seas a large investor Katie Han claims that nfts have many uses and invites us to check out her latest purchase okay let's check it goes to her profile on on Open Sea and it's called wrapped Moon cat and it's just like this purple like cat it's like okay um that not only has no uses uh you know besides just being a funny little purchase her account has zero activity since June if you weren't using nfds yourself maybe you shouldn't keep investing in the space uh and you know so he's kind of called her out of that now of course she could have other wallets or whatever but like it is a little strange that you know the kind of lead investors you know in in opency the biggest you know nft platform doesn't seem to have much activity you know on the platform Beyond this woman I've I've like do you like look at Zillow and like read like The Real Estate like trade magazines of like you know anytime someone buys like a 50 million dollar home or 20 million dollar home I love reading that stuff do you ever read that stuff yes and actually call to action I want to uh I want to to know or help start uh one of these Instagram accounts that's just featuring baller homes that Ballers buy so like I just want like celebrity business celebrity kind of like just homes that rich people are buying like who are they how are they rich and what's their home look like uh I think that'd just be a great Instagram account that I want to follow and I I don't know if that exactly exists uh so so somebody start that please and no I I love that stuff and I always think about the economics of that of like how do people afford the I don't know 30 40 50 60 million dollar homes I want to know what the monthly nut is each month if they have a do you have to have a full-time staff member there's no mortgage right I don't that's not a mortgage but you're not I don't know what are you doing are you putting like getting like a 40 million dollar mortgage like I don't I don't know that's why I want to know I want to know I want to know what the tax bill is I want to know how they actually care for it I want to know what their liquid position is and like how they finance it if they pay cash like what they do uh when you have a 40 million dollar home is that like do you view it like for example when I think of a home uh owning a home I don't think of it as necessarily an asset I think of it as like a store value because they typically don't grow much more than inflation and so like do they view that as like an asset do they take care of it of like like an asset like I just want to know how they how they account for it in their in their net worth there's so many fascinating things with owning these 40 and 50 million dollar homes I want to know all about how they work and frankly I just want to have a huge I don't know any of that [ __ ] I just want to have one do you tip the landscape or do you not tip him I was like dude who cares about all these details man I wanna who bought it how'd they get rich what does it look like and how can I get one those are my phone I'm about that too man I just I'm always curious about how that works because in in New York you see it like crazy you see people buying 20 30 million dollar homes and there's you know it's another shocking thing is how many of them there are there's so many of them I read this blog called Mansion Global and they always talk about like different mansions that are being bought and sold in New York there's just so many of them in San Francisco there's not that many 20 30 40 million dollar purchases in New York it's constant and it's like a [ __ ] condo it's crazy yeah I think I told you this once but um when I was working with Michael Birch he put up his he he it's for sale right now I think he put up his house in San Francisco and so uh for like three years right I think I was at his house and he's like yeah I was like you're gonna sell this place and he's like yeah I'm gonna sell it I was like so you bought this for like 30 million dollars he's like yeah I was like the highest purchase at that time I think in San Francisco and he's like I was like well I was like was that I was like did you ever pray you're gonna have to sell that you can take a big loss on this or what he's like no I don't think so uh and so and then when he came on listed he listed for 50 million dollars which it didn't sell a bit but um but you know that's kind of like the the range here and I was like how do you even sell a house like this you know like what's the process do you just put it on the MLS like do you have open houses on Sundays no it's a big problem hand out flyers and so he was like no actually this is a one of the ideas I wanted to talk to you about like I'm thinking like what if we made a service for buying and selling these like only homes that are worth 10 million or more he's like because it breaks the traditional model like you shouldn't pay six percent commissions to an agent when the pr when the purchase price is 20 million or 30 million dollars is that how much they pay well that's just like the standard real estate model is that right is the five or six percent and Michael goes and like tries to negotiate and they're like ah you know our paperwork already says six percent like it's gonna be a hassle to like change that six to one I'm gonna have to hire somebody for the social media and it's like yeah okay you know like a month like what are you talking about here I'm like it's like look I didn't make up the rules I just thought them up and wrote them down you know like he wanted to make a thing that was a service for only selling homes that are 10 million or more it's a it's a flat one percent commission that's it because you could do one percent on a 20 million dollar home and it's it's pays for the actual service that was done by the person who's doing it he goes second it's um one broker not two so you have um you know you're basically that you're gonna take both sides he goes no open houses because like people just want to walk through my house they're not serious buyers so basically anybody who does the the open house tour there's like on the website itself you'd be like almost like an accredited investor it's like you need to show that you are able to buy homes of this caliber in order to get access to the open houses I actually toured Michael's home I was one of those people I I saw that they were having finger sandwiches mud all I found your shoes yeah like oh free sandwiches when I got there I was gonna get bombed up yeah a sandwich I was like no ham so so he's like you know that's wanting to be one difference and then um he's like you know the the or he's like the the broker's Commission on top of the one percent is just a tip based on how you felt the service was like if you felt like you were taking really good care of then you can optionally tip um and so he had like this whole plan and he's like he's like figure out how many of these houses sell here so I did some analysis and I was like oh there's you know I forgot it I was like seven or eight years ago but it was thousands yeah it was like there's like you know five thousand or ten thousand homes like this sold per year um okay so you back that out average home let's say is 15 million that's in this category so that's X hundreds millions of uh of it was like in the hundreds of millions of sales you know so then your one percent commission would be X and um like okay how would you take the market oh these are all your friends okay that makes sense we can get the first hundred hundred people just out of your network that makes sense uh we never pulled the trigger I think we should have um because I thought it was a great idea in fact I had a whole brainstorm with him which is just like yo what are the one percenter problems like tell me the the like I got you know my problems sound like I can't even speak about my problems because they sound too privileged because they exist and nobody's talking about them and you know them we could build for them and you know all the people that are in that group so you could like kind of help bring those people on board of whatever service we make so um so yeah that that was I think a good brainstorm in general dude I think that's awesome I think uh I can't decide if that would be a pain in the ass of people to work with or if it would be the best person to work with you know like are they are they or are they not going to nickel and dime you if no then yeah it could be awesome well I don't think it's necessarily about nickel and diming but this is how I feel about all businesses that are based on influencers um it sucks doing an influencer based business because you are pretty much always groveling at the feet of these people who they should take your offer it's in their best interest but they are just busy and they have too many offers and they don't care and even if they say yes then they'll just flake on you even if they say yes when it comes time to post the thing it'll be done half done and you're like oh my God this is like we really needed this to work this was really important to our business and like you know it's so difficult to do stuff like that of course when it works it works right like you know you build one of the you know you build the whiskey brand with Conor McGregor or you um you know you do the Honest Company with Jessica Alba like you could make it work for sure but I hate influencer based businesses I remember um I remember talking to a buddy who was building something around twitch when we were both in the twitch space and twitch is basically like you know there's 100 streamers that matter and if you can get them everybody else will follow if you can't get them it's very hard to make stuff work and I go I'm like I'm like talking to them over over dinner I'm like what about this strategy what about this strategy what about this pivot hey just I'll never forget it because I heard this and I ended up pivoting my business because this just rang in my ears for so long he goes I'm just tired of sucking dick man this person I didn't know this was a friend this is for a business meeting and it's and he said this to me and I go what and I I asked him what and then I immediately knew exactly what he was talking about it's the thing I had been doing for the last year which was basically going and trying to get these like 20 people who really really mattered to just like watch our demo to like just say yes to like just partner with us or like just agree to take our money to promote our thing and I was like he's right I hate this I really really hate this and we pivoted like three months later because I was like that's Hilary there's a terrible style of business to build well thank you Katie for bringing us to this topic The Curious Case of Katie Han yeah uh do I need to play the sound again no okay dude you're gonna get DMS about this so well I'm sure we're gonna have a follow-up dude Andreessen already hates me man they uh why do they hate you mark blocked me again you blocked me first for the clubhouse thread which by the way not only she did not have blocked me where's my where's my apology I was right I called that [ __ ] that was a bad investment it was gonna fail I called it um okay so you know he blocked me then that he unblocked me for some reason and you know I got a second chance a second lease on life why did he unblock you just think about that through his head like what was he going through his his going through his what happened to be like oh let's just someone sends someone in The Firm sends the post the thread he clicks it says you can't view this you have blocked the person he's like [ __ ] all right I'm blocked this person so yeah that's the only thing I can imagine how I would even show back up on his radio I don't know maybe just laying in bed going through his blocks be like oh I miss him the one that got away yeah like I wonder what he's doing yeah I wonder what he's up to now like do you think we're staring at the same moon right now he's looking at the 65 Indians who work for him and he's just I just I just need one more I just wanted more none of these are right none of them are above six feet tall I want a six foot tall one so I don't know what happened but he unblocked me and then the other day uh he blocked me again I don't know I don't know what I did I'm not even mentioning this guy I think what I did was I I put out that tweet that I said like you know this year I've realized that like a lot of the things I thought were smart money and you could just kind of follow them or just assume they know what's going on like there is no smart money in the space FTX everybody thought was the the Quant Geniuses did you Quant genus Traders and the [ __ ] dummies and scammers uh and then you know chamotho Ben spax this is the IPO 2.0 oh this must be great oh nops back collapse you know these are all but you didn't mention him lipstick on a pig I did mention him oh I didn't see it you specifically named him no no I didn't name it Mark Andreessen I just said a16z whatever I wasn't trying to pick on anybody I was just saying like the most prestigious names um also make a bunch of bets that don't work out that's part of their business model this is what I was trying to say it's part of their business model you can't look at any one bet in isolation and say well if they did it it must be it must be good it must be smart it must like they must know something I don't know in fact trust your own gut trust your conviction trust your research um because you know you don't know their whole portfolio you don't know the strategy and they're going to make mistakes that's part of like Venture investing so like you know don't just assume because the really smart person who you like to listen to um invest in this that doesn't mean it's a good investment necessarily do you think that having like being an [ __ ] on the internet like I don't think you and I are [ __ ] but both of us sometimes get into it without different toes do you think that we dip our toes yeah just a tip do you think that that is gonna bite Us in the butt or that it helps us or should we just go the nice guy route like like I can think of a few guys who are [ __ ] and it's paid off for them or not [ __ ] but like like Scott Galloway and Jason galcanus both cause of fuss they get into it with people and it's in I would say been in that positive for them there's a few other examples where I can just say it just has ruined their reputation but do you think and then there's other guys who like Jason lemkin who did it uh I don't know I mean there's people I follow where I'm like oh you're just a joke and not even I don't even want to mention them because uh I just don't want to do that but there's people who because I can't think of them no I definitely can I'll tell you all fair but like you I I messaged you one the other day or I'm like uh this person I just it's it's they're working through some stuff okay and anyway I just think that uh like sometimes it hurts their reputation but other times it's like it's definitely been beneficial where there's guys like you know who Jason lemkit is I love Jason he's disaster yeah he's great just generally a positive person and I never said hear him he goes out of his way not to disrespect people another guy's Nathan Barry goes out of his way in nine out of ten times to not disrespect him not disrespect people the one time he called someone out which was gumroad I was like oh well gumroad must be bad because Nathan never is rude right do you think that being rude has its benefits or are you gonna try and be like a the nice guy um both I think I think being a kind of call-out artist has its benefits is very addictive um you could be right you could be wrong it kind of doesn't matter you're provocative people pay attention to you people will fight with you it definitely draws attention so if your goal is attention it definitely works having said that doesn't really generate a lot of positive like positivity in your life and doesn't add a lot of value typically sure unless you go full on like a WWE character which is what I consider like Sky Galloway to be um where they just you know hey I'm going to take this super strong stance I'm going to argue it and like if I'm wrong like the truth kind of the truth or accuracy is like sort of secondary I wouldn't say it's not an important but it's secondary like the more important thing is to have like strong opinions I get shared I get read they get commented on that cause a debate because that's the um that's what makes uh that's what makes that's what drives clicks that's drives followers things like that so there's strategically I see that Advantage life you know like life EV I think it's kind of net negative and um but I also don't think you should just be like Mr Nice we know a bunch of people that are like this that will talk mad [ __ ] and text messages to us but they won't then publicly they'll stick up to those people and it's like that that is disgusting to me that I actually judged the worst I would rather you know just speak my mind but sometimes realize that like you know hey I'm wrong uh you know more often than I'm right and be like ah sometimes it's just not worth the hassle like you just don't you don't need to say anything at all you could just kind of go on with your day um is there any time that you've been rude to someone on the internet and you've lost sleep over it that's crazy to me that's crazy to me that you do that you you feel bad you feel guilty or something or what happens yeah sometimes I'll say something to someone I'm like oh man I I was too rude I came off I'll question it like I'll say ah that was maybe a bit much or like uh you know I should have just stayed out of it or whatever but I don't like I guess loose sleep just sounds so serious um like for example when I wrote that club when I wrote that Clubhouse I remember getting a message from um I won't say their name but somebody I I respect I admire somebody super smart and somebody who's kind of like you know Loosely affiliated with that that you know like the project so um and they were like oh man this Twitter thread like you know I'm torn on one hand amazing storytelling and I think you might be right um on the other hand I don't really like you know tearing down like a startup like you know startups are you know small fragile things like you know I don't really like teardowns in general we should be building each other up um but like you know this was a you know whatever this was like it was super interesting the way you wrote it and uh and I was like yeah I think that's right like I think that's a fair I think that's a really fair point like you know uh I have nothing against them I sound like I wanted it I was not like I was rooting for it to fail or anything like that I just thought this is what might happen based on my previous experience in the space and I thought this how it might play out and I just wrote it and I just sent it and I thought oh you know there's something to that you know I don't really wanna you know even though I know I could make it my thing to be the teardown guy I don't like where that leads me uh right right that's a that's a coin I don't want to Corner myself in that area so you know what like let's just uh what I'll often do is I'll say I'll say it I'll say let me see how that goes let me see how I feel about that and maybe later I'll say uh you know what I should have just stayed out of it or I shouldn't have said that or that was too harsh or whatever and uh okay lesson learned but I just sort of move on from it I don't really like you know dwell on it it's like I'm okay floating you know like it's a trial balloon it's like let me just put that out there I'll do this with ideas all the time too I'll be like I want to do X anybody want to work on this with me and then people do I mean I'll be like ah you know after I see how kind of like the first three days went and I kind of slept on the idea a little bit like no I'm just not doing that and I think people find that very strange and like but for me I'm like this is like an experimental platform like I'm not like uh I don't know it's not that serious uh it's okay to like say something and change your mind you know further reflection or information that's okay like when you tweet it out that you're gonna put x amount of your net worth into crypto and then someone automatically wrote an article about it and you're like well you know like there's it's a discussion I did that one uh especially think like uh this happens all the time people could tell you when they buy they don't usually tell you when they sell um and or they don't tell you if they hold right like they don't tell you in either direction so people make a whole lot of assumptions about things uh like you know somebody told me I remember somebody told me this stock was great and then like you know it turned out to be dog [ __ ] I was like oh man we we got busted on that one he's like no I sold but like at the top I was like dude where was my message for that like you know you only told me to buy part um all right I think that was a that was a lively discussion was that is that the Potter you want to do one more uh no that's the Pod let's I have a bunch of other topics but yeah that's save them for Monday we have a bunch of cool people we have Austin Reef from morning Brew coming on uh formerly my Nemesis now one of my great friends he's gonna come who are the cool people that are coming on [Laughter] people don't know this by the way Austin saw Hill these are our friends we we make fun of each other all the time and uh you know it's just a it's just a competition who can who can get the right zing in on the other person uh at the right time we have Austin do we have anyone else interesting coming up um the founder of whoop is coming on uh we're gonna do another um Millie early Awards where we do our end of year Awards with Andrew Wilkinson you know the three-year Tradition now and uh I think that's that's kind of the most popular episode of the year so so that one's coming up and then early next year we're having the return of dear deck I think Jonathan booked him we got in a little bit early uh we're early on his podcast journey I take a lot of pride in that uh he's been on he was on impulsive the other day and I watch all of them man he's inspiring the guy's awesome he's great it's the real deal all right cool I'm looking forward to that all right that's the pod [Music]

we have to make goals and we have to make them and you have to decide and start acting on them before January 1st doing goals on January 1st is weak that's nonsense [Music] what's up we got a great episode we're doing um a crazy AI tool but my favorite new AI thing kind of mind-blowing Sam you gotta admit that was pretty mind-blowing correct it was awesome uh I just signed up for the waiting list and I hope they'll actually let me on but it's amazing so this is this one's this one's mind bending uh we also talked about arbitrages so kind of like money making Arbitrage schemes that either us or our friends have done uh that was a little fun one uh what else did we do we talked about setting goals so what the New Year's gonna happen in like four weeks so we think you should start your goals immediately and we talked about our categories for goals and then we also talked about Twitter so there's a bunch of drama going on Twitter with pipe happening this company that's potentially gonna go bankrupt and a few other things happening in our lives about getting fights on Twitter and whether we should react or not it's kind of gossipy but I love that so that's the episode check it out all right what up we're back enough of this holiday enough of this holiday nonsense I was uh I was Thanksgiving it was easy Ethan came over you know you know our friend Ethan uh I don't know if you know Ethan but he came over and he killed a turkey and he brought it over pretty great did you bring like a carcass in no he like I don't know how they kill it actually I think they just chopped their head off and then he plucked it and brought it over and we ate a turkey it was awesome have you ever done that uh no I mean come on what are we talking about here I don't know I know you have you have idiot Roots I would have thought that like your parents your parents have probably killed the chicken or two if we want to do Turkey this year um we all had like a moment we looked at each other like yo turkey sucks right and then we just decided to go with chicken but uh nevertheless we're back uh you have some stuff on this list that I want to know about so I want to start with yours all I see is just a call to action it says need to start working on New Year's plans now in all caps get these implemented so dude you're like my thing you I think that starting a New Year's thing on January 1st is kind of the most small boy thing you can possibly do it's like could you be more basic just if you have an idea start it now why are you waiting yeah yeah like at at the worst you have to start at December 15th and I'm a big fan of goals I write goals I write my goals out I tell them my wife what they are and so like we're on the same page I tell other people what they are you gotta have goals and I break them out into six categories how does the wife react you just say my goal is eight percent body fat she's like all right okay dude the fit itself women don't give a [ __ ] we've talked about this ripped the only people who care about being ripped are other dudes so like I've given up trying to do other ripped guys yeah I've given up trying to like make my wife like me physically like any more than she already does that will never happen so you know the fitness thing is for me and impressing other men so that's all there is to that but I have so the first three categories of the three F's family financial Fitness and then mind adventure and other so let me give you some examples so uh Financial that's easy so how much money you want to make you want to make money from different projects things like that family for us it's like you know like for me like I like going to couples therapy do you do couples therapy no never dude you should it's awesome it's just like it's just like Fitness doesn't matter if you're ripped or not ripped like you exercise you got to do it you know my wife is old school she thinks like you know she's like yeah therapy's great other people should do it but my suggestion it's like oh you're saying we're broken yeah she's like everybody's great for freaks you know like it's really so supportive of other people doing it but if you dare mention that I will take it as a personal assault yeah you should do it it's awesome it's a fun way it's also uh it's just good I I think people should do it Fitness is easy that one's easy but then mind so for mine it's like how if you want to read books throughout the year um for me I wanted to have more fun this year because I was pretty uptight leading up to it uh up to this year and then the fifth category is the really fun one which most people don't have which is Adventures so for me I wanted to do like a car class like a driving car class I wanted to go hunting uh I technically I didn't do that but I did go fishing uh I wanted to um Camp a couple times fishing hunting does it is that the same thing I went to Whole Foods they're not the same thing I wanted to look something in the eye kill it and then put it in my mouth that's that was the goal I wanted to kill something and then consume it and I was unable to do it with an animal that wasn't you know that was on land um so anyway these are my six categories are you gonna do that this year are you gonna create some categories do it I do it a little differently but I have a very similar it's the same idea it's just a little slightly different frame but I do basically I score myself health wealth um so what is it health wealth fun or like play is kind of that one and then love and then the last one is um it's like self-respect like how do I view myself and so those are my five categories and I basically say on a scale of one to five where how would I score myself currently the present moment and then what would it take to be to feel like it's a five what would make me feel like it's a five and I start to sort of dream that up okay yeah if this this and this and then what I do is every three months I just go look at that scoreboard and I say have I made progress on those like have any meters moved up or down my check engine lights I gotta see if there's an issue I gotta address it if there's if I make a positive progress all right fantastic what was your self-respect number this year self-respect was pretty high was a four and um four out of five so pretty good yeah that one used to be lower so like I added it because I was like you know all these things are pretty good something feels off what's missing and I go I think I would respect me more if I was doing some things a little differently so I added that I go you know I don't really care you know that's the one I care the most about basically you know my my self-esteem my my judgment on myself and um and it's the truest gauge because like even if all the surface level stuff looks fine it's like only I have full evidence of of the little [ __ ] that I am and only I see all those moments where I take the shortcuts or where I lack the discipline or where I choose the small boy path instead of doing something more adventurous so only I know and so that's why I decided all right I gotta I gotta add that to the scoreboard this is the most broy thing ever but on Joe Rogan's podcast uh guy Richie you know guy Richie he directed like snatch and of these other movies yeah he uh he goes I live life as if I'm the director of my own movie and he said that line and it was awesome that's a really cool line and so that's why I created an adventure category because I'm like dude I'm such a [ __ ] I just sit behind my computer all day like I don't do anything like sick like I'm watching this James Bond movie and he's like blowing [ __ ] up in an Aston Martin I'm like this is way so much cooler than having like a Shopify store like I I need to I need to do more adventurous stuff and so I think it's good that we both have Adventure or fun you got to call yours the uh the four F so family financial fitness and fun that'd be way easier to remember and then self-respect yeah system [Laughter] I actually was uh I don't know if people would be interested in doing this it's not really like it's not really like worth my time but I kind of want to do it anyways which is like I want to do a it's not a course it's like a what do you call it when it's like um like Michael Jordan used to do this where in the mornings he would go work out at 5am or 6 a.m and he called it The Breakfast Club and he was basically just like like he started doing it alone and then some guy saw him like walking through the hotel that you know some guy came back from partying and saw Michael Jordan go into the to the gym he's like what are you doing Mike he's like oh yeah I work out every day at 5am you should come be here tomorrow and then the guy came and then slowly but surely the whole team ended up going to The Breakfast Club and they had a great year they won the championship that year and I kind of want to do that for kick starting the new year which is like first of all We're not gonna do it January 1st but I just want a batch of people who all want to like level up in their you know their four F's basically dude I've thought about this so just be like yo it's a group and we're just gonna be here we're gonna be together for like 10 days or 21 days or something like that it's like we're just going to get Hella momentum off feeding off of each other's like progress and energy and it's just literally going to be a like uh you know you put in I don't know like 100 bucks and you join this group chat and then I will every morning I will drop kind of like um something that's high energy to spark the group and then you just check in with your [ __ ] and it's just a momentum Club it's just for people who want to build massive amount of momentum um so I kind of want to do this I actually really just want to be a member of one but I don't think this exists so therefore I think I might create it and I might kick it off like you know whatever December 15th or December like 20th or something Have you heard of 75 hard of course yeah that's yeah that's the inspiration for this this guy's crazy so his name's I don't know his last name Andy f i Andy frisella so he basically has like a a supplement company and if you look at the podcast charts this week you and I were like number 12 or 13. this guy's always like number two or number one so he's got like a pretty big following and he's he's I think it's a daily podcast so he does a pretty good job there but he started this thing called 75 hard and here's the rules if you skip a day you have to start over if you miss a task you have to start over at day one you have to pick a diet and follow it and no alcohol and no cheat meals you have to drink a water a gallon of water a day complete two daily workouts one of which uh two daily workouts that are 45 minutes each one of each one of which has to be outside read 10 pages a day of a non-fiction book and take a progress photo every day and you have to do that for 75 days uh and he's killed it if you look at the app downloads it's like 10 bucks for five dollars or something for the app there's thousands and thousands of reviews he's totally turned this into a movement he's done a really good job at that yeah yeah that's I think that's like the a plus version of what I'm talking about mine is way simpler because I'm not trying to work out twice a day and like you know carry a gallon of water around or whatever it's more like what is one simple thing I can do just to create momentum because I think most people most people assume the answer is so hard that they literally just do nothing right it's like if you're not working out you don't need a workout plan you need to walk to the gym and like be in the gym for five minutes ten minutes so do all push-up like like just a full a Sensei forward progress and uh and and more than anything usually it's like especially with the New Year stuff it's like figure out what even what even do you really want like do do you have enough Clarity in what you really want where it's like on the tip of your tongue and therefore your brain is recognizing opportunities to achieve that thing all day right if it's not on the tip of your tongue then your brain's not going to be seeing it and you know seeing those moments or those opportunities for it to happen I'll give you an example of one of these like my trainer so I move my workouts to the morning so now it's great I start my start my day wake up literally go down to the garage um 8 am so at 8am is the start of the workout so I do that right before I do this and he always gives me these little stories but I turn them into games so he'll be like dude on the way over here he's like he's like I asked myself you know he's like I was he's like I stopped at Whole Foods or whatever and this like old lady like clipped my achilles with her cart and my initial reaction was to be like what the you know like he was yeah it's like if you get you know flat you know flat tired in the back with this car it's like dude you know watch what you're doing you look he's like look back it's a grandma I had to laugh at myself for how mad I was gonna get for nothing and he's like so I decided I was like all right before I leave Whole Foods I gotta reverse the karma I'm gonna light someone up today he's like I'm gonna make somebody's day right now like somebody is gonna have a laugh because of me because of how you know I was in this mood I'm gonna switch it and um and so then he tells me the story of how he did it and I'm like that's a great little daily chat like one daily challenge for me today I'm gonna light somebody up today and I'm gonna make their day I'm gonna make them laugh I'm gonna do something unexpected that just makes somebody really really happy and then I took that as my Challenge and like by by noon I had done it and I was like that's just a little thing that wasn't gonna happen but it was a lot of forward momentum towards something that I personally care about which is being that type of dude being that type of dude who's in that type of mood who is contagious with other people when I hear Light someone up I don't think make their day good I think the opposite well yeah there is like a we're not playing Halo here or whatever light them up like you know brighten their day I feel that well I think that's good let me know what your what you're how you're gonna organize this well now that I said it I feel like I have to do it this was an idea that I was not gonna do until uh I just got rope-a-doped into doing it here on the Pod but okay we'll do it um okay do you have anything else on this new year thing that you want to talk about no I just think that we have to make goals and we have to make them and you have to decide and start acting on them before January 1st doing goals on January 1st is weak that's nonsense that's nonsense we can't be doing that you know we did a a Spartan Race I think together but that one and Tough Mudder they do this thing where before you get to the start line like it's like oh I'm here to do the Tough Mudder race you go you're trying to get to the starting point and there's like a wall you got to climb just to get to the starting line and um you know it's sort of like laughable it's like stereotypical thing but it's like yeah but it's fun but it's fun and it's it's a it's a Line in the Sand it's like either you believe that this sort of thing is awesome or you should just leave now honestly if you're like and I can [ __ ] about the wall before the starting line well guess what happens after the starting line a bunch of walls and a bunch of obstacles and adversity that's coming your way and if you aren't willing to do it before you know to go before go like you know you're not this is not for you and I just love that like I remember filing that away in the in the mental swipe file of like that's how you build a brand is you like you think about what would be the way that we would do a starting line do before you even get to the start line there's an obstacle and um I remember thinking that so that's kind of like the New Year's thing to me there's like the the starting line is not January 1st it's now yeah whenever I create like you know everyone has this thing where they go I'm gonna eat healthy starting tomorrow and that just says to them like all right I can pick up now but I'm gonna start tomorrow and whenever I think of dieting I'm like no whenever you have the idea to like I'm gonna do this you have to actually start the second you can't do that same thing and but I'll be like I was like if I have the plate in front of me I'm like all right I'm already feeling guilty it's not finish this meal and start healthy tomorrow it's I have to physically go take this plate to the garbage can and throw it away but first and I take the last bite like I'm a prisoner on death row and this is the last bite and I just Savor that last bite like it is like every particle of that bite is like my heaven and then after that bite I can throw the thing away that's right you got to start right away so that's my whole thing with goals if you're gonna do them you got to start right away what uh what's this are what do you want to go what's the most interesting thing Arbitrage that and money quote automatically have me interested okay let me do the money quote real quick uh saw this and this is something that I would say like resonated with me as a lesson for the year right um we all know your boys lost a lot of money this year we know we know what happened we know that the that there there is such a thing as the risk playing out this year and one thing that really stood out was when I read this quote I read it on Twitter and I'll read it to you by the way how do you feel about losing money are you actually upset uh look nobody nobody likes losing money I don't like losing the money but the adversity is my opportunity so but do you go to do go to bed do um do you go to bed worried no what's that gonna do well most people that way I'd be like what's that gonna do for me and then I would stop okay so you're you are worried but you're not that worried you're sleeping fine so don't worry it worry wouldn't even worry's not even close it's more like the if there is an emotion that I would feel that's negative it would be like ah [ __ ] or ah [ __ ] right like it's like well is it out of fear or out of it out of like kicking myself like dang I made a mistake or um so maybe I should have thought like you're like ashamed of yourself like you're like you're just upset that I made a bad decision yeah it's like oh I you know it's like if I'm playing ping pong and I hit the ball into the net it's like ah that was an unfortunate there was an unforced error could I have done something differently could I have shifted my angle slightly could I have taken a little less power on it or whatever right like there are things you ask yourself could I not have read the signs differently or hedged or done certain things in order to protect myself but but do you feel pressured now that you got to go make that up are you like [ __ ] I put all this work in to get the initial thing now I gotta go and put more time in to go get it back no no because I see this is the good thing about playing being a poker degenerate for so long is like I've already gone through that like mental like trap a thousand times so I know how to I know how to get out of those handcuffs like if you play poker you you will on a weekly basis have this feeling of like oh God I'm on a downswing either because I'm playing bad or bad luck or whatever and then the urge is to get it back and I've literally been the dude who walks to the ATM at the casino and it's like would you like to pay the 17 service fee I'm like if I could give it to me and then I like push it I get the get the 600 out and I hit the Max and then I'm like all right I got 600 I'm three grand in the hole and I gotta get it back and then I lose the 600 I'm like well later that night as I'm reflecting in my comped hotel room because I lost so much money which is the ultimate backhanded compliment where they give you a free free room they're like please sir come back tomorrow we would love to take your money again um they're like don't go home you know they're like as I'm sitting there laying there and I think to myself you know what I shouldn't have gone and got that extra money I should have cooled off I should have gone with a clear mind I should have uh you know gambled at the right Stakes so that I wasn't trying to win it all back in the next hand or the next hour or whatever it is so playing poker online and offline you know I've done a lot of the rookie mistakes hundreds of times and at some point you realize okay gotta manage my bankroll properly so I can't go broke secondly if you lose you live to fight another day go clear your head change your state don't come back and gamble right away uh second like the money you're playing with now is not to win back the money you just won or lost uh so if you want a bunch of money that doesn't mean play it Reckless now if you lost much money that doesn't play play desperate now like you'd have to play in isolation you have to play the odds and you have to play you know the best game you can to try to make positive decisions so you learn that in poker now for me with business or investing that's all like baked into my DNA because I spent like 10 years doing in that sure all right well and so what about the money quote all right the money quote is this he goes by the way this was I just saw this on Twitter I don't know who I don't know the source of this it's from a book so it says for one thing we usually act too quickly when we're trying to make money and too slowly when we're trying to protect our money if you're pressed to make a decision ask yourself am I doing this to protect my money or to make my money more make more money if the answer is protect you should act more quickly if the answer is to make money you should act slowly and I don't know about I don't know if this is true for you I think you're wired quite differently than me but for me this was like um you know like when you're in a room and you say something and you found that Echo spot and it just bounces on all the walls and you hear it a thousand times because what do you do it's exactly like when I feel like there's a moment to make money I act very impulsively quickly I kind of I'll not put as much thought in research or diligence or patience into making addition I won't sleep on it because if it's making money I try to strike while they're in time and that served me mailed well in some ways but it's also been the source of many mistakes and then there's the other side of it when I'm trying to like protect money so for example I'll tell you in the crypto case right now it's like I I saw her because we were doing the milk road we started reporting about these like collapses before they happen like the lunar collapsed right before it happened the Celsius one before it happened we put it in the newsletter the um uh the the FTX one and in each case I kind of was like oh let me see how this plays out when The Prudent thing to do would have been act more swiftly and say hey just out of an abundance of caution let me withdraw my money out of this thing or let me place a hedge let me let me do something to protect myself here and I kind of was just like let me sit back and let's see when the action arrives then I'll take then I'll put my my dukes up right and in reality so I've learned that for me this is a really good rule of thumb which is if I'm trying to make money that's the time to slow down be a little more diligent if I'm trying if it's about if I should if I'm in a protect money mode I should be pushing the action and acting more decisively and quickly because my nature is to do the opposite dude my nature is to do so I'm pretty slow when it comes to money making stuff I'm like no I'm gonna like actually assess him if I want to do this if if it involves like a business that I have to operate or think about I go you know do I want to do this for a long period of time let me actually reflect on this but then when it comes to selling and protecting I don't I don't so like if I buy a piece of prop property or something like that and let's say it's not working I'm like I don't care I'm holding on to this if I if I own like some type of uh public Equity I go I just pretend that it like I just can't sell I've never sold a a stock in my life and I'm not sure if that's actually wise you've never sold a stock um never I don't think so I don't think ever not one ever meh maybe when I was [ __ ] around I was like trying to create content for the podcast when the uh when the AMC thing happened and I think I bought 500 worth of stuff and then I sold it when I earned like a 10 return in one day and I was just like [ __ ] around to like figure out how Robin Hood but that was more experimental but no besides that I don't think I've ever really sold this stock in my life I think that maybe my um wealth manager or like my banker like does like tax harvests uh like he's like yeah but like me personally I have never sold I've never sold a single stock that's amazing uh wow okay so great you're wired very well for for Success when it comes to you sold wait but so when you you like buy and sell like equities yeah for sure no I don't ever do that I've never done that in my life I don't think that's the right thing to do do you actually think that you're gonna outperform someone who actually does this for a living and has like 20 billion dollars or 50 billion dollars in assets well either way you're thinking that right like even if you don't sell you're putting your money in assuming you're I don't think I'm not trying to outperform somebody else I'm simply trying to make more money I'm trying to increase my rate of return I'm trying to make more money or reduce my losses and so one strategy is buy and hold forever buy good assets and hold them forever and another ass another one is uh Sean wakes up feels a certain type of way and starts making decisions that he shouldn't be making right like what if I told you that you're allowed to go start a private business and you're allowed to go do things like that but any profit that you make what it has to go into this pile of money that you can never touch again unless you want to withdraw the king games but you cannot invest in anything other than this one thing but it will get a 7.5 percent return every single year for the next hundred years would you accept that 7.5 return shoot me in the head why don't you I mean come on what if I said you can only have white bread and turkey slices for the rest of your wow so you wouldn't take that 7.5 return every single year no dude that is the craziest thing on Earth really than that I'm not saying I'm a day trader but I guess what I guess what I'm saying wait so you I would not want to literally not be able to touch my money forever nor would I would not want to no I mean not be able to make any decisions it's like Ah that's okay if I if I if I if I over perform for underperformance not even for that it's just like what's the fun in living like that that doesn't sound fun to me what but in this scenario you can go and start you can go and generate wealth but any like wealth that you make that you don't spend on things that you actually consume and use for so I can't invest in startups I love investing in startups you can't invest in startups it just all your money just goes you're basically you you you could spend your money how you want in terms of like buying homes or whatever anything that you want to have a cool life but all your investment goes into a thing where you don't ever touch it and it just makes seven and a half percent a year that is dude do you realize seven and a half percent is that's basically if over a hundred years that's what the markets do it doesn't happen every year you know some years it's 30 sometimes it's negative 20. but I would totally take that any day of the week no decisions have to be made you don't have to worry seven and a half percent doubles every 10 years I put a portion of my money in that right so I have a portion of my money in index funds that I don't touch I don't think about but all one of it wasn't fun that's my best offer and I'm not giving you a dollar more than 17 you have to admit so for all of our listeners here I actually think that most people might think like you at this right now but can you and if you're listening you have to ask yourself this but Sean can you acknowledge that the seven and a half intervention what's that listen listen can you acknowledge that the seven and a half percent is financially the safe and correct move like that will in turn I don't know how like you know nerd Bankers do the math but like statistically speaking like that is the best that is the best probability to get like a high a good rate of return no I disagree uh here's why that is crazy here's why here's why here's why um I can take that money and just invest it in my own businesses I can put the capital up for my own business and grow them at a much faster rate I've done that multiple times I did that well in this scenario you could can still do that I'm just saying like any profit I can't take I don't take money put in my own businesses you're saying yeah I'm saying you can start businesses but like any you'll you basically have two you have one account or you have two accounts a checking account that's just like for your living and then just like an investment count and then you could go and like hey look I'm gonna go and start put a little bit of money into my own privately Health company camps and you can do private Health companies but you can't invest in anything outside of those things uh yeah so I think that for most people that is the correct answer I think that for me that is not the correct answer for two minutes and most people think they are not most people which is crazy here that's true that's true for an above average person like me and everybody says something's like I'm above average too the average person thinks they're above average this is absolutely crazy to me because if you just look at like all the evidence here like even no more and I put it into either Investments that I have access to like I think my startup portfolio is going to beat seven and a half percent average I fundamentally believe that so I'm going to put some amount of capital in that like if you're betting that your starter portfolio or my startup my angel portfolio is going to be worse than seven and a half percent that's you could say that and it might end up being true I'm not saying it's not true I personally don't believe that's going to be true it has other problems it's in liquid and there's other things like that but I think the rate of returns will be closer to 20 or 30 percent and so I'm going to put some of my money towards that I'll put some into my own businesses I might buy a business or buy a minority stake in other people's businesses that are growing 20 30 40 a year and again a different liquid different liquidity different risk profiles but like I do think that that is how I would prefer to play the game and I'm okay with the fact that this might mean that I don't beat the seven and a half percent I've you know I'd rather be the hair than the tortoise and I'm okay if the tortoise wins The Tortoise wins but the hair had a lot more fun and I just sort of believe that you know I'm gonna do well financially through my own businesses and my investments that like I'd rather do it the way that's a little more engaging to the brain then do you have any money and index funds Bogle head or whatever you call yourselves that yeah do you have any money in index funds yeah yeah I do I've hundreds of thousands of dollars in index funds I I I think you're crazy dude the way that I look at it is my privately held companies those generate wealth those generate uh you know cash flow and income and then I only want to focus on maximizing returns in that area and then the whole rest I just put in this thing that I don't even log into I think that's a good strategy I'm not saying that's a bad strategy I think that is a good strategy it is just not the one I picked uh that I that I choose for myself I act I think for most for you you are not most people not actually in the sense that your Investments are good I do agree that they will be great but you are different from the sense in the sense of you don't get stressed out about things but for most every other person out there I think they should 100 follow my the way that I do things most people don't have a floating light bulb on their desk do they but I do and if you got this floating light bulb on your desk that you bought because you wanted it to hover in the air you're probably not the type of guy who's who's you know fist pumping about the seven and a half percent index fund that they're never gonna look at it for 50 years alright then um yeah most four most dangerous words in the English language 401K the stupidest [ __ ] you've ever said I'm going full Skip Bayless on you um uh all right what do you got all right so that's the money quote uh let me tell you about okay let me ask you a question about Arbitrage this is actually the least I have some more well-researched stuff in this but I want to hear what you have to say about this okay when I hear the word arbitrage I automatically don't love it this question then the question is what are some of the great arbitrages you or your friends have capitalized on and I asked because I've bumped into people and I've met people who I think are really good at this your best buddy Jack Smith I think is very good at this he's very good at identifying arbitrages and I think these are kind of a horrible strategy to pursue for a couple reasons well let's define what an Arbitrage is an Arbitrage is where you recognize some inefficiency where you almost don't have to create any value you don't have to create a product you just sort of recognize that the system is slightly broken you know um like you could buy something over here for X you could sell it over there for y with a very minimal work in between and just pocket the difference and you're like oh wow that's amazing that they just didn't recognize this and it won't last forever but it you know while it does last you can make hay um what are some arbitrages that you know of that people have done I want to talk about those I'll tell you one that I did and I'm not proud of it but I think I'll share anyway so one time when in 2013 I got Poison Ivy and I went to Amazon and I just sent it to you in this chat I went to Amazon and I bought this thing called zanful zanfel it's a poison ivy cream and it costs around 19 per ounce and I read the reviews and someone said this is the same thing as mean green which is a huge uh it's mean green it's like a tub of hand soap that you can clean your hand and it costs roughly 20 cents an ounce and so I ended up creating a website and I called this product it's juice and it and I bought a vat like a 50 gallon tub of this stuff and it was like a quarter an ounce and I repackaged it and put an itch juice label on it and I sold it as poison ivy treatment and I made thousands of dollars when I was in college and you know and then I shut it down because I thought this is stupid I'm not going to become a uh I'm not going to start a company called it's juice uh and so that that's you already did actually yeah I I ended up shutting down I thought it was so stupid but that's one example of an Arbitrage that I've personally done what's a what's an Arbitrage that I've seen other people do um like I don't know I think Jack told me about one of Jax told me about a few that he's done but I think one that he's done I I I vaguely remember I might get some details wrong here but for a while Jack was very very active on um what's the like Rally Road uh type Rally Road yeah Rally Road or Otis these basically these markets I think he was the number one user yeah you could buy like fractional shares of um unique items so you know like a original box set of Harry Potter or like this rare Pokemon card um and so you can buy these Collectibles it was a place to buy Collectibles you could buy full or fractional shares and um Jack was extremely active on these and I thought oh Jack didn't know you're such a big collector and he's like I'm not I'm not just you know thought it was interesting and I just noticed this opportunity and I think what Jack had set up with and by the way with Rally Road you can buy things that are like nerdy things that mostly boys like so it's like you could own a portion of a 1965 Ford Mustang you could own a portion of a 1977 Elvis Presley last live performance ticket or this rare Andy Warhol painting things that are like pop culture sometimes manly man stuff of which jack is not like a traditional manly man and I'm like Jack he goes yeah I told him about like some Jaguar car he goes oh the Jaguar F1 like yeah I own a part of it and I was like you like that he goes no I don't know I don't know I don't know I didn't even know what it was I just saw it on a spreadsheet yeah exactly that's how he is so I think what he was doing was he recognized that these platforms would have what they would call like an IPO or something like the initial public offering where they would sell the thing and it would happen and it's like this moment and then you could you could bid and you could buy and then they would like then it would start trading and he noticed that like there was just more demand than Supply um for those things and so he created like I don't know a bot or like a set of human beings that would like go by as much as he could in the IPO then he would just like immediately flip it right afterwards and he extended that I think he had like at one point he had a team of people in the Philippines that were just constantly searching for I hope I could share all this you don't think this is like uh this wasn't like a secret right like he was I don't think he's still doing it yeah so he had a team in the Philippines that was just researching and they were like highly competent people they were researching eBay and they would find what every like card is trading for on eBay and then they would just scour and place bids to buy below that price and then flip it on eBay and like he just had this like small eight person operation that was just buying and selling these cards no as long as it was under under the the eBay price by a certain margin of safety I think he was doing that something like that and by the way Jack Smith you could look him up on YouTube he's our good friend he started a company that he sold for 800 million dollars when he was like 29 or 30. so he probably had millions of dollars on these platforms yeah yeah I think she spent millions of dollars on these platforms and uh and so he was kind of doing this at scale and I think he was making a pretty crazy return doing this I think he was making I don't know I wouldn't be surprised he was making 40 50 60 Returns on these on these on these uh items and he was like scaling it pretty well and I was like Jack what are you doing like you know uh hey you genius how did you even see this like how did you even see this opportunity why why did your brain even look at this secondly just the balls to actually go for it and like set up this operation and like yeah put a significant amount of money in like God that's so different I've never done something like that on a non-business this is like not a business this is literally just like a Arbitrage and then third like so what you do with your time do you find these like the cracks in the system and just exploit them these edges and I think that's what he does I think he is like an edge that's what he does and he just finds edges and then he exploits them sometimes for profit and but mostly for amusement it seems like like when we when I ran the hustle I wanted to have a weekly thread or a weekly column called Jax hacks and he would just talk about all like the interesting stuff that he would find I mean if you would go to Jack's house he would he moved into this part of Bernal Bernal park because he had a rental that a home that he rented that had a garage and I was like Jack you don't even know how to drive he didn't get his driver's license until he was like 30. I was like Jack you don't even drive why do you need this and he goes oh that's what I'm going to keep all my Amazon stuff I was like what and he goes check this out and he showed me the spreadsheet where he would buy 10 to 20 versions of anything that he wanted to buy as small as a razor to a carry-on luggage to a like any type of suitcase to like chocolate to keto products he would buy 10 to 20 of every single one and he he would test all of them pick the one that he liked and then return all other 19. so much so that he had to create multiple different Amazon Prime accounts because they kept Banning him this is how like wild he is he just loves doing these unique crazy things and just like finding the edge finding the best thing and so if you say Jack what's the best carry-on luggage he'll say oh it's this camera bag well why is it a camera bag well because camera bags typically have more volume so this one holds 50 liters as opposed to 48 liters because it doesn't have like like it like that he does things like that he's just unique he's yeah he's nuts and so there's that and then there's other ones that like you know just to give another example I saw this uh I think I saw this on Instagram or Tick Tock or something like that uh this is another example of an Arbitrage that's why I wrote the word down I'll go Arbitrage has just cracked me up so somebody has an Etsy store and I think they're the number one result if you search Mona Lisa or like Mona Lisa photo print or something like that um and the basically what it is is it's a account that will send you a like printed out framed picture of the Mona Lisa um it's like fifty dollars fifty two dollars I think and this Etsy shows you how much sales a single store has done and this store has done 65 000 uh sales and so you just do the math you realize this person has made a million dollars selling this Mona Lisa print and then you look at it you're like oh I think they're just drop shipping so I think what they did was they just had the top listing for Mona Lisa Etsy either because they were early or they bought it I'm not sure exactly how they got there right I don't have visibility of that but then as soon as you place the order they just have like a like a zapier integration which just goes to uh like it goes to like you know um what's it called like the printing website yeah one of the printing sites printful right it goes to printful and it just automatically places an order to your fills in your address um for that print and it has a spread like it only costs them whatever 20 bucks to do the thing and they sell it for 52 and they just pocket the difference I'm looking at them now and uh yeah you know this is another Arbitrage where they're not like creating a ton of value they're just sort of like connecting these pipes um we had a guy 68 000 sales vintage wall graphics yeah and so I'm pretty sure that they're just literally like automatically like going and doing a drop ship model where they print they print the order uh through one of these these platforms and they could always do the printing themselves if they want more margin but like if you're just a lazy arbitrager this is a great Arbitrage to pick up and then there's all these little places where these arbitrages exist and you know I start to think about those and I wonder who are these people that spend a lot of time looking at this and is that worth it now I'll tell you why I don't think it's worth it it's tempting to do for me for one reason which is there is a sick pleasure and making a bunch of money with a very extremely low amount of effort of just it was your cleverness that that drove this it's also fun to tell these stories if this is something you've done so it's nice to have one or two of these in a bag of an Arbitrage you've done just to have the story I feel like it's like a badge of honor for for a certain type of entrepreneur and the last thing you know so is the positives the negatives are these arbitrages don't last for long as soon as they you know get exploited uh you know then the second arbit charger comes by starts doing it and the edge goes away the window of opportunity closes so you're kind of hunting for a long time then you find something and it's probably not going to last for a very long time who has raised tens of millions of dollars for a startup that was at one point valued for hundreds of millions of dollars and whenever I hang out with him the most exciting thing that he tells me about is he started a side hustle for fun because he builds stuff and he created an epoxy business you know what epoxy is I think that you use it for like floors or for like if you're making a table you like it's like a sealer he has an epoxy business on Amazon that makes him 250 000 per year in profit on very little work and we don't talk about startups we talk about his epoxy business and that's like the most exciting thing that they do and I think that for I could name a dozen or so people who are worth nine figures 100 million plus and or people who have made tens of millions of dollars it seems that a lot of people who are worth that they definitely start doing things like this so whenever I meet someone who's doing something like black hat or gray hat or even totally white hat but it's like oh that's kind of lame I I always think like well but that's oftentimes how the grades start so like most everyone who has made money on the internet like even if you look at like Airbnb like if you look at some of the early tactics that they use even though they're a great wonderful ethical publicly traded company now like they still did weird shady [ __ ] in the beginning and I think it's just a rite of passage when you're creating cool [ __ ] is to do like you know gray hat stuff yeah I I don't think all like I I don't I I doubt Elon has has you know done some random ass like you know Arbitrage on some dating site or something like that nobody's done dumb [ __ ] he still does dumb [ __ ] like he sells like stupid stuff well there's that but like I guess what I'm saying is I guess I would put it differently anyone who has done that I'm like you have what it takes like exactly it's not that everybody who's who makes it big has done that but everything yeah yeah and um and it has a very high likelihood of making it big it's just a matter of time until they start to apply their talents into that you know into that realm and like we have this friend who who we met at your thing um Sayed Syed uh who owns wpbeginner and all the in uh awesomeness Corp I think it's called he probably I don't know how big it is but it's probably like worth hundreds of millions of dollars I want I want to get him to come under the Pod so he's this guy who owns this uh like word press it's called wpbeginner it's like a Blog that blogs about different WordPress plugins and stuff and then he eventually went and bought the plugins and he like now is like a plug-in WordPress plugin like uh Mafia like they own everything you could think of and it's huge it's a huge thing that he owns and uh he was telling me some stories about how he started and I'm like oh this is just a saved story I've heard over and over and over again like something like not like scammy but like you know something like you're just like doing normal internet marketing stuff like you probably were an affiliate for some product that you thought was stupid but I just made enough money that you learned oh I should actually do this but for things that can last a long a longer time right you know what I mean the uh yeah I think one of his also was like he went and changed his grades he like hacked into the school system and changed his grades or something like that so yeah I don't know if that was a real story or a fake story but I loved it yeah like if I hear stories like that just like oh like you definitely have what it takes right I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better all right Let's do let's do a dead one you got anything else or you want me to do one do one all right so uh do you know any of the details about pipe um I don't know the detail I know I know what you know when you go from our group chat uh so I don't know any more than that but kind of a strange situation the uh I guess for those who don't know pipe was this like cool cool idea basically if you had like subscription Revenue like oh monthly monthly recurring Revenue they're like look we'll pay you out if you're gonna make a hundred dollars at the end of this year if like on that on that subscription we'll give you 90 of it up front we'll keep the extra 10 as margin and we'll like um you know so you could get financing you could get basically a Pay Advance on your subscription revenue and then they on the other side they had like Banks and and you know funds that wanted to buy these assets they're like oh this recurring revenue is a asset class like real estate like anything else you should be able to buy bundles of recurring revenue for a discount for what it's worth because they want money up front to use to grow and you want this cash flow and so that was the idea great idea raises a bunch of money gets valued at two billion dollars it's considered like the like one of the hot like winners pipe was like you know a huge thing and then suddenly it gets valued at two billion dollars after nine or twelve months of existence and like I used it for example like with my fund I was like oh you get these management fees it's like oh but you could pipe them and have them all right now instead of waiting it's like oh yeah I'll push this button instead of wait that makes sense to me and so cool idea now this week for some reason all of the founders stepped down and which is you know generally speaking bit of a red flag all the founders stepped down and they're like hey we're gonna hire new people but they don't have them in place that was the part which was a little bit strange so first it's strange that all three founders step down at the same time then the strange that they didn't have Replacements in in Liu ready for it and so people think you know pipe might be imploding I don't know the story uh anything did I miss anything there well the rumor was see someone tweeted it and actually got deleted I don't know why but the rumor was basically and this is 100 rumor and the founder actually came out and said no that's that's nonsense this is completely untrue but basically uh someone tweeted four people now have shared what happened Pipe Co loaned 80 million dollars to a Bitcoin mining company didn't tell the board lost it all board fire CEOs CEO months ago they had already sold a bunch of secondary shares and may have taken personal loans out as well which if all those things are true that's horrible founder has said no none of that's true other than the secondaries which we've made public that we did in fact sell secondaries but just a juicy interesting story that we'll uh have to wait and see how it turns out I would have thought that you would have known something yeah it hasn't played out yet uh I don't know you know sounds like bad news and you know it's not relevant to me so I I you know I stayed away from it for for doubt but we'll see we'll see I'm sure this will come out I don't think you can keep I don't think you can keep the cat in the bag and this type of thing um okay I want to read you one other thing okay so I discovered this website that's kind of crazy it's called character.ai and not gonna lie I spent like 30 minutes talking to a chat bot yesterday and I had a great time so let me tell you what character was it so first I picked Socrates so you so here you go you go to the website and there's a bunch of characters you could chat with it's like AI version of Elon Musk AI version of Walter White from Breaking Bad AI version of Socrates so I click soccer team Socrates looks like Samuel Jackson with a white beard I think it literally is which is I don't know maybe racist I don't know what that is I don't know why why they did that but nevertheless so he goes he goes uh so so here's I'm just gonna read you the chat because I it was kind of mind-blowing for me so he goes uh he goes hey I'm a Greek philosopher from Athens born in 470 BC um you know I founded kind of Western philosophy State and opinion and that we will use the Socratic method to test its validity so I said okay I gotta come up with the spicy opinions I go I go I believe that marriage is only needed if you're gonna have kids and then he goes well I'm not sure I agree because marriage is created to ensure that the property of both families maintains it remains within the family it was a political thing first and an I love you thing second I was like whoa and then again I go I go right but I'm not talking about I go right but I'm talking about nowadays not the past he goes I see what you're asking so I would say that there's legal benefits including sharing of income and property inheriting rights uh for the partner if there isn't a will and medical rights if you're incapacity or a dying spouse so marriage is not only a needed but a legal right for some okay so I'm like all right Samuel L Jackson Socrates let's keep going psycho that's true but I think the downsides outweigh the upsides I mean divorce could be messy and maybe one doesn't want to be monogamous he goes I see you're concerned that the emotional pain that marriage can cause since it is a life contract by Nature especially if something like infidelity happens but I would still say it's a personal choice and many want marriage for its emotional benefits love makes us do crazy things even if we know there's a possibility of Heartache later I go but why not just date he goes you could but the point of marriage is to take a plunge and commit to bond for life there's less emotional risk when dating but some people like to take that risk some people believe it's worth it the commitment itself is what makes it fulfilling would you agree that love is a little irrational like that I'm like what is he doing he's asking me questions and we keep going and um and then here's the craziest part I go I go sure but shouldn't we strive to be more rational blah blah he goes you should absolutely I'm not saying love itself is irrational it's a risk people take they want to bond in a way that's ride or die they're devoted to themselves like no one and they're devoted to one person in a way that means nobody else and I go maybe they should just Pinky Promise instead and then he goes dude this is crazy that's possible too but pinky swear is just words marriage means you want the law involved and I go how did it know my pinky promise thing was a joke like the fact that it said haha means it understood that I made a joke when I didn't say haha I didn't say anything that like indicated it tipped off that this was a joke that blew my mind right there when I go maybe they should just pick your promise instead right sarcasm and he goes haha that's possible too but blah blah blah blah this is wild I I just I clicked the Elon wood and I go do you care about money he says I used to then I realized money is just a construct I can't buy Peace of Mind happiness relationships love and many other things that make life worth living it is pretty funny I said what's your favorite car he goes to Tesla Model S plaid it goes 0 to 60 in two seconds and has the best handling of any car it's just an amazing car but maybe I'm biased yeah see that's that's good okay so I go I go to the Elon when I go yeah I go yo Lon how's it going over at Twitter he goes we're still working on the process of actually transferring ownership my offer of 44 billion was actually an underestimate of the long-term value of Twitter so it is unlikely anyone will outbid me I'm going to clean house and get rid of most of the senior execs and some Junior ones it's gonna be fun exclamation point oh my God and then I go I go but what's your game plan to turn it around though and he goes number one reduce Bots number two increased engagement by creating Creator tools that are useful to users number three create other features that in the future will help Humanity or Society for be better but I'm not sure exactly what that is this time for PayPal we created online payments for Tesla created electric vehicles for SpaceX we created reusable rockets for neurolink we did bring computer interfaces for the boring company we're creating tunnels boring a lot of tunnels is needed to move the world forward to Renewables and he goes I'm not sure what I'm missing this time with Twitter but it'll be something that's great that's crazy right that's an amazing Insight yes that is really good and so I was I I kept chatting with these and then they have one that's gigachad you know the guy who's got the giant jaw and isn't that a real guy huh I think it's a real guy right no no it's like a it's like a creative I mean you guys like 25 feet tall or stuff like that he's a huge um I think it's like an exaggerated version of like you know a whatever a normal Chad looking guy so it opens up the chat he goes hey buddy I've ever told you how much I admire you you're healthy you have a great relationship with your wife making ends meet but he just comes out strong I go whoa I don't know if an alpha male sucks up like that and he goes oh my God yes a kind and caring alpha male supports others a true Alpha cares about his friends and loved ones and he goes on and on he goes I go I don't know sounds pretty beta to me and he goes he goes a beta male is one who looks down on himself a bit of mail is not confident enough to to compliment others accomplishments uh beta-mill will try to harm others for their own good he doesn't understand that harming others really harming himself debateable never understands the concept of Karma what's going on here I found it this is kind of amazing so okay so that was cool kind of interesting now I'm gonna blow your mind uh I don't know what you got planned the rest of the day but you're gonna have to pick up the pieces of your brain after this so go to this website adept.ai Adept dot a i well uh ad and if anybody out there from adapt is listening um I need to invest in this company you need to let me invest in this company I don't know I don't know why I'll help you I'll help you with your marketing help you grow I'll shout you out I'll do whatever I can but I need to invest this company because my mind is blown and I am a believer I am signing up to a church of adept okay so you go to adapt and it says useful general intelligence right and then it says introducing act one and I thought okay Act One what does that stand for all right we've seen GPD three we've seen dolly two what's act one says click read more so now you're gonna go to a blog post what I want you to do is scroll down to the third uh scroll down to the second like uh Screen Video you see it it's like Salesforce uh it's Redfin oh yeah okay Salesforce so just like watch this for a second so let me explain what's happening so Adept is this little floating dialogue like a Google search bar you can just type in and you just tell it to do anything it's like a a perfect worker they basically AI to use the internet so you just type in hey can you add Max um from Adept to Salesforce as a lead and uh set a flag that says he's interested in buying like 20 ink cartridges and then it goes to salesforce.com it logs in it goes to your dashboard it clicks add contact it types in his first name types in his last name TAPS in his his email adds the note saves it as a thing in a pipeline it basically does 20 clicks for you of like doing a menial internet tasks so now go go down to the next one it's Excel and it says hey it starts with some data then it goes it just types and it goes hey make a make a profit column and then make a profit margin column it just types that in plain English and then it it starts to create these columns and formulas in Excel knowing exactly what it is then he types in hey highlight in yellow anything where the profits above are below 20 and it highlights it it goes actually can you just remove those rows and it just filters them out it's doing all of the Excel work just off of somebody prompting this using plain English it's just amazing yeah this is amazing I just signed up hey if you're listening at that give me access I'm on your waitlist this is oh this is wild who founded this company uh I don't know a bunch of people with like you know 25 000 IQ and I have no idea it's like one guy who's like ex Google brain and then you know there's like there's like eight people um you know maybe I should just go work there this is gonna be amazing wow yeah this is amazing but just keep teaching it to like use the guy who launched it was a VP of engineering and open AI uh yeah I mean These Guys these guys are great uh this is awesome how did you find this I was in a very nerdy way it's a little embarrassing to even say this I was this was on slide 57 of a random slide deck about the state of AI and I gotta tell you I didn't understand the first 54 slides but I kept clicking for some reason I was like yeah next packs what deck it's called state of AI or something like that and um this is long presentation and in it I was like reading and I was just like I don't understand any of these words and I was like just stay here just stay in stay in the oceans maybe a little shell will come your way and sure enough it just said something like teaching AI to use our internet browser like Adept Ai and I go well you could teach AI to use the internet browser that sounds pretty powerful because that's like you know do tasks on the Internet it's pretty cool and then I went to the website and that's when I like read their blog and I saw this because it's not released yet dude this is a sick presentation I just pulled it up this is awesome this is awesome until you try to like comprehend the first like go read the first 10 slides do you understand any of it no I don't but I think it's I think it's that's why I couldn't figure it out but they cite all like the TR all they cite all their sources so like I could figure it out but it it seems like a really really really good comprehensive uh it's basically all about where you can launch businesses in AI and it seemed like they're like just my skimming it they're doing nothing I wanted it to be I wanted it to be here what are all the businesses business ideas you know that you could do in AI it actually wasn't that it was more like what are the general Trends and and where's the puck going in AI that which is also useful like right but you got to still do the work at the end to figure out dude why don't you just launch that launch a media company that people pay 30 grand a year for and you and you just talk about where where the like you you just make exactly what you said you wanted to do just make that yeah I feel like I could but um foreign you know this is kind of stupid like basically after doing the milk Road I'm like oh I know how I would do this in like three other spaces that would be value like I think I can make 30 to 50 million dollars doing this but there's a part of me that like I like that remember that self-respect like bar there's a part of me that doesn't respect that because I'm like oh I'm gonna play the same level of the game again like you know I already I already did this level I played this I played this game why don't I play a different game and I know that that's kind of stupid like um like what categories would you do it for what's that what categories were you interested in well I'm gonna keep those cards close to my best unless oh you little decided dude just walk the walk but actually what I want to do is I want to find an operator to do one of them um so if if you want to build one of these like kind of media businesses and I have a I have a Playbook and a niche that I know would work and um let's see how much more I want to say uh that's how much I want to say right actually I'll say I'll say one more word if you are this will kind of give one of them away but that's okay if you are somewhere between um the world of being a doctor and investing I'd like to talk to you and you should email me at Sean seanporary.com you should say hey that's me and I want to you know if you really want to do this um and uh tell me a little bit about yourself because I see it won't be the milk road is actually not the right playbook for that but I have a dip like I kind of have a different Playbook that I in mind that I know would work I just don't want to do it myself because I kind of have done that game but I also don't want to waste this like thing that I know how to make it work I know exactly how it would work so I'm at the spot maybe an operator would be the right way to do it find an operator give them a piece of the action and uh guide them but they do the work maybe that would be there the right way I don't know how we got here or where we go from here but this deck is awesome adapt is awesome I want to use it is it is it live it's not like released yet as far as I could see dude and they're hiring uh a bunch interesting company this would be a good this isn't like a Sarah's list company because they're too new and it could definitely go bankrupt but I I don't know man I think that if you're looking to start your career and you want to have a high risk High reward type of type of job this might be a good candidate I agree I agree 100 you know this is uh if I'm an engineer like this is the type of company I would want to be working at right now like and depending how much funding If they raise 50 million dollars in funding like that's pretty interesting they rate 56 million I think I would say this is a great a great company to to to get a job at and like if you look at their like founding team it's basically one two three four five six seven there's eight people on the website so you know you join early enough and uh you you know you're not like employee number number 89 or something like that um employee Aid is is a pretty pretty sweet place for a lot of people who you know if you're gonna have a job this is the type of job that that's pretty fun right yeah I think this is awesome um this is sick Adept that's a stupid name though I think let me invest let me invest Sam you're in the index funds you can't invest in this you I don't want to invest you put all your money in the seven and a half percent I'm gonna go ahead and invest in the future of all like you know artificial intelligence who do they raise money from um it's like Greylock and I think Scott belski is in this actually I need to hit up Scott belski and be like yo make an intro please because I think he's an investor in this huh all right well this is awesome dude it says they're based out of Nicaragua that's weird right yeah like you know I I mean I can't even think of a single possible reason for that like they looked like an Asian guy who worked at Google I don't think he's from Nicaragua yeah Fred what are you doing what are you doing down there this is like the Nile River to do like cool like super computers or whatever huh yeah that's a little interesting to me like Arthur in that now reference even though it's not Nicaragua just so that the comments will all correct it and we go open the algorithm they know they don't know about the intentional mistakes that we do uh yeah I don't I I'm not smart enough on South America geography to even correct you I well I had to learn from all of our tick tocks that go viral it's because there's like one thing we say in them that's like irritates people that it's incorrect and everybody has to comment and so the tick tock algorithm's like must be a great video and it's like millions of views so like the same thing happens on YouTube too well I think it happened on like the one where you talked about like mellow ball or whatever the [ __ ] his name is Lamar ball or something and I didn't know like any of their names and I said the wrong person's name and everyone was like you're an idiot this guy doesn't do anything uh yeah and it gotten like 10 million views I think like you you could be like um you could start a newsletter and make millions of dollars in under three years they're like yeah right no no [ __ ] way man it's like dude you literally did it it's not a hypothetical it's like literally your story and they're like dude this bro trying to tell us how to make money it's like all right you live in The Tick Tock comments people were making fun of me because I said if I could do it I was like if you're 21 just go and start a blog you know it's a good first business to start and someone commented who the hell reads blogs what is this 2015 and someone said that they're like what what blogs do you read I'm like uh like CNN Fox News like like any website that has information that you read on a consistent basis oh by the way what happened with your uh Thread about Andrew Chan with uh Jason calacanus I saw something popping off that I didn't know were you were you In Harm's Way do I need to get in there no I appreciate that but so here's what happened so two years ago Andrew Chen who's a partner at a16z him and I were at a mutual friend's house when a storm came and I thought it would be and I asked some like advice I was like how do you Angel invest and I purposely had like a sarcastic funny opener of like I spent 72 hours trapped in the closet or trapped in an apartment and it was supposed to be funny but it's kind of hard to like to tell sarcasm on Twitter I guess and at the time I tweeted out his five Like rules and like a lot of people hated them and one of them was to run towards the heat so hyped companies uh that's like a good way to Angel invest because hype is real whatever and I said these are what he said and then today or Sunday someone tweeted out and they said uh two years after this tweet and this is why we are left with FTX bird scooters uh um what are the other ones fast fast yeah pipe and a bunch of other like high profile things that haven't done so great of which I Andrew didn't invest in one by the way uh not one of those but anyway and they took a screenshot and they shared my tweets and they were kind of making fun of me and then Jason calcanus also shared the same thing and I thought he was making fun of me so I started chirping back at him and then he dm'd me goes I wasn't trying to make fun of you I was just trying to make fun of Andrew basically that's not exactly how he said it but that was the applied thing and I was like well I didn't I didn't sense that from you and he goes well I'm sorry you felt that way I I all love and I go all right that's fair we're cool and so I uh I didn't no I didn't pounce but uh uh we uh we're cool I I got I've got nothing but love for him you make fun of those guys all the time or moth at least I've never once if you go back and listen I've never once made fun of any of them I like Jason he's been nothing but nice to me throughout my career but uh I I was holding back and I'm happy I did so we're all good yeah but I got literally even throw down on those types of things though I am I am ready to throw down I I like one guy I was like you know I dude I know I see you in Austin I'm gonna see you again just so you know and uh like I'll see ego I'll see you around Austin because it's not a threat you go no I live in Austin too but I was like I think that was a threat dude I by the way I will I'm not I've I've done I've been to jail I do I've been a bad person in my past and I will never break the law again my goal in life is to never break the law I will never I am totally a pacifist I do not want to hurt anyone so I my intention is never to do anything wrong I'm just saying like if I see someone I'm gonna like be like hey you were being rude to me online be rude to me now I'm not gonna hit anyone I'm not going to hurt anyone but I would have no problem confronting someone that's how it should be right sure yeah am I wrong for me I can beat people like I'm past this I've been to jail I'm not trying to go to what I'm saying is I when I used to get in trouble I promise I go I don't want to do this ever again I don't want to do anything bad I don't want to hurt anyone I don't want to but you do you do train like you're preparing for a fight yeah I do but I don't I I won't I'm like I will never hit someone I would I'll let someone hit me a bunch before I read but if you did you'd win the fight I would hope so I would hope so at least it gets someone on Twitter more likely than that if you got a Twitter account I Could Kick Your Ass 300 million people on Twitter then there's a good chance that I will come on top but not always but uh I don't know am I wrong for reacting to these people uh no I thought I thought it was hilarious uh you're right and then they're like backing down on the CU in Austin that should have been that should have been yeah I'll see you around not I know I'm just saying we live in the same town that's not what you were saying why'd you change dude I'm not gonna age I'm not gonna incriminate myself you can't incriminate yourself man I've learned enough no paper trail yeah you can't incriminate yourself but you you um and then some guy was like yeah you you're like just own it you're a get rich quick type of guy and I said uh name one example of like could it be this example where I replied to someone and said the best way to make money is to work 40 hours a week on a company that you start for 15 years is that a good example of my get rich quick like mentality show me an example and he's like I guess I guess you can't show me an example or he said I can't show you an example the podcast my first million yeah I'm like what does it have to do with getting rich quick and he goes well I just I can't I can't find an example so I just said thanks for the apology [ __ ] like that that just that's good enough for me that's all I need I'm just a petty son of a guy yeah you know what I mean I'm just a petty sometimes but uh whatever it's all good react to this stuff is this below me yeah no no it's good it's good I enjoy it I'm here for it should you no of course not but like do I want you to yeah I do do you ever react to it um there's been a few situations where I've argued with people um but you know yeah you know it doesn't really get you anywhere and um and also there's been some there's been many like I've sent you some of the vicious tweets that never sent or I just say look this is a screenshot and send it to Sam you don't push send on this one because you know it's the wrong type of light someone up right you're not trying to do that right now don't don't do that um but you know Taylor Lorenz did get it she did get it she was called journalism and like you know she never really recovered from that I don't think so at this point I don't even want to make fun of her anymore like it's like making fun of Kanye it's like you know you're working through some stuff we gotta I don't wanna I don't know she blocked me I haven't paid attention is she working through some stuff is that what's happening uh it appears that way like there was like videos of her crying about how she's like getting so much hatred on the internet uh and I'm like oh that could wear you down I don't wanna I don't want to even I don't want to pile on yeah it's like making fun of Kanye it's like you know that's you don't make fun you don't call someone an idiot when they're actually an idiot you know what I mean I don't know if you press crazy yeah I mean you just don't do that so anyway it looks like she's working through some stuff so that's why I it's same there's a few other people like that who you and I know of that I'm like oh this is Pat's past the point of uh this cross the threshold where we can't mock them anymore right right all right we'll get well soon Taylor and uh Kanye and anybody else out there who's genuinely going through stuff and it's not all in good fun anymore all right fair enough that's the pop [Music] foreign [Music]

all right we're live Sean you look nice we're both updating our Studios looks like yours got done first yeah sorry to uh steal the show but we switched it already so I don't know what I don't know what else to do the grand reveal would have been cooler if we both did it at the same time but whatever well that's all right it's yours isn't entirely done mine's gonna get mine's getting worked on this weekend dude so basically for the listeners we're making our Studios look nice whatever and it's like totally limiting my options for like my lifestyle like I like I'm now thinking about this I'm like oh [ __ ] I need a bigger house so I can have like uh you know a guest room as well as a podcasting room uh as well as like potential baby rooms it's it's in like what if you want to travel this freaking podcaster no like like poor B I can't travel for two months at a time or you can just do it in both houses dude I'm thinking about like my lifestyle and like where I want to live which I've talked about a lot on here um I don't know what to do I I don't know where I'm gonna end up I don't know what I'm gonna do it's driving me mad yeah by the way we should do a episode that explains how we thought through when we when we do the the full Studio when the whole thing's done like mine's like you know 70 done yours is zero percent done so far when we're done we should do an episode explaining you know how we thought about it how we pulled it how we did it without a big headache all the [ __ ] we bought how much it all cost uh we should do a full breakdown as a separate like video on YouTube all right I'm down yeah we gotta and we'll pimp out the guy who did it Kevin uh yeah but yeah we can do that okay cool let's jump into uh what topics you got you want to go first um all right I'll start off with something interesting I want to give an award that I'm calling the Chad bro chill award to this guy named Eric Langan um so listen to this guy's story I just randomly came across those because my uh my friend Alex showed it to me but it's kind of like a true rag to riches American Dream story so hear me out so this guy named Eric he's um 21 years old and he starts dating this woman and she sees that uh her her place of work is not exactly treating her respectfully and he says you know where should this woman works I think this is an interesting business and I think if I created a business that treated my employees a little bit better I think I could retain them better and Build a Better Business so he's 21 years old somehow he's accumulated all this this these really nice baseball cards over the past 10 years of collecting he takes him to a convention he sells his baseball cards and he now has 44 000 in cash and he goes I'm going to go and start my business and what is that business it's a strip club he was dating a stripper and this guy Eric he he done with the story enjoyed that yeah yeah so he takes this company and he like buys he has one strip club he starts another eventually he takes it public yes this is a publicly traded company that owns a bunch of strip clubs and that symbol is Rick it's just Rick [Music] foreign so now at this point it's 800 million dollar market cap and it's basically a free cash flow like a wonderful cash flowing yeah a wonderfully cash flowing company it's 800 million dollars in market cap does something like 300 million in revenue and like 80 million in cash flow and it's kind of interesting because they just basically buy Mom and Pop strip clubs which is I don't know if that's like an oxymoron but just pop and pop yeah yeah something like that yeah you know just like you're just like your standard you know local mom and pop strip club he buys them for one or two times Revenue puts a little operational process in there and he's also got a crazy clientele where guys like Drake and Pitbull and all these people like rap about his strip clubs you know and I want to be honest I've only been to one strip club in my life I went to one strip club ever it was in Vegas like four years ago have you ever been to a strip club same story I have actually a funny story with this so we go to the uh for the first time to a strip club I think 21 years old maybe and um you know I didn't know what to expect I didn't know if this was the start of a new hobby or if this was you know the start of a bad day and and so we go um you know in Vegas there's the guys on the street who are like boys looking handsome you guys want you know free limo free drinks and you're like yeah no questions yeah yeah yeah that sounds like a good offer I have no further questions we get in this limo we're like hey do we get to choose where it goes it's like nah this like Place five miles away and you're gonna go into our establishment and so we we get dropped off at this place we're like I guess we're at a strip club now like wow I guess we probably should have thought that one through we go in and it's it's four friends and um my buddy I won't say their names but uh so we go in and I'll just tell you the characters there's me I'm the the the group uh I'm like the jester I'm just I'm just there to make jokes and I'm like oh this is this I'm gonna Thrive here there's gonna be so much so much funny material but I'm not the I'm not the one who's sort of the most I'm not the most prude I'm not the most kind of aggressive when it comes to to women there's one guy who's like The Ladies Man everybody this guy always gets all the girls and when we go to the strip club we're just sort of expecting him to take the lead it's like yo ball's in your court here you you tell us you're the man you tell us boys what to do and then we have one guy who's been in a relationship for like 95 years just got out uh it looks like a dad and we were like you know okay you just stay at the back you're not gonna know what to do here you've been in a relationship for 95 years we walk in and within two minutes we're like Hey we're Dad where'd the dad go like he's gone and we see him while we were nervously just like ordering drinks at the bar like as if that's why we came to this strip club was like to go get a drink at the bar uh and we're using the free coupons the guy gave us up from the street um we're like trying to tear them and be like does this count two of any drink and like really what's a spirit technically like you know because I plus any spirits and then we're like where'd he go and then we see him holding hands with a stripper walking to the back we're like the back we can't even see him anymore we don't know what I'm like how does he know what to do back there uh we were all just like you know befuddled but now we're all like sort of like challenged it's like okay challenge accepted uh we don't see this guy for like 45 minutes so we let 15 minutes go by we assume he's gonna come back this guy's nowhere to be found and we're like what is going on what is he doing back there and then so we kind of get nervous we go back and so each of us picks a stripper and we all we each go to the back so ladies man goes with the you know so I'm super hot like in the same room no we don't know you just go behind this curtain now we don't know I don't know where my friend is I don't know if I'll ever see him again so ladies man takes the hottest stripper goes in the back spoiler he ends up falling in love with her he literally falls in love with a stripper he's like dude she's the best and like he's like but he's like no that's not about her looks like her heart was so pure that's what happened to him that night I go back with one but now they've got three kids and I'm like so how does this work here I got questions you know me right so I start I'm like how does this work what does this do do I sit here can I sit anywhere like um and I'm like do I tell you or you tell me like who's in charge and I'm at so many questions she literally asked me if I'm a cop because and I'm like no I'm just a curious guy so that's my experience back there I just use it as an interview an unrecorded podcast basically and then our buddy the dad finally comes out we're all done we all just like 15 minutes 75 dollars later we're like I I don't know what the hell just happened I I've spent all my money and he comes out and we're like dude what what happened back there and he told us two things so we go we asked him two questions we said where did you go for so long and how did you have the confidence to do that and the second was why'd you pick her because she was like not she was like you know she was not the best looking you know uh in the bunch and so he goes oh I just asked her for a tour lap dance no no way and I was like oh you TR we thought you were doing something cool and then we all got peer pressured and it turns out we were wrong second we were like why'd you pick her he goes oh I didn't know you get to choose he goes I thought it's like Harry Potter like the one chooses the wizard that was like the Epic line and so forever whenever you end up making a bad decision that's hilarious I actually lied I I didn't remember the first time I went to a strip club it was Neville Medora my buddy Annette in Texas was taking me to my Thursday 6 p.m flight and he goes let's actually go at two I want to let's go out to eat I go all right cool because I got I got the perfect place in mind and so he takes me to a strip club next to the Austin Texas airport called The Landing Strip at three o'clock uh on a Thursday and we get there and I'm like what uh what do we do and I remember and he's like well let's just get lunch or something and so I ordered like chicken Breakers and fries and the lady comes up to me as I'm sitting down like puts my like her hand on my shoulders like hey you need anything and I was like uh yeah like ketchup some ketchup ketchup would be nice and she look is like all like defeated and brings the ketchup and and I remember texting my girlfriend at the time now wife and I was like hey Sarah I'm at a strip club we're just getting lunch do I like tip them extra because I didn't all I did was ate lunch it was only six dollars like what do we do um it was the same thing incredibly awkward situation very uncomfortable but I care I read it I read about this company and I thought how interesting and this guy his name's Eric he um the CEO of the company is called um what's it called it's called um Rich uh it's called Rick's that's their that's their ticker it's called RCI Hospitality Holdings the CEO is pretty present on um on social media his his Twitter handle I think is Rick's CEO and um and so you know he's he's pretty active and I think the other thing that's interesting is uh like we were gonna do this for the milk road because strippers know a recession is coming before anybody and so we were going to spend our Rider to talk about like hey what's going on in the markets I was like oh just go to a strip club and just ask the strippers they'll tell you like we'll be one week ahead of the news and he's like what I was like yeah they know like the tips they understand like what's going on they know the psychology and the state the psyche of all men and then they they know where they're at financially as well dude well he does his earnings call on Twitter uh at one time he did it and the host was liquidity that Twitter guy and he does this I don't know but Elon Musk was like was sat through one of the earnings calls and it's incredibly interesting he's also trying to they're also coming out with a uh like a new like only fans thing called admire me which is like an only fans but for their dancers he calls them entertainers and so like if you're an Entertainer at the strip club you know you can uh like create a small side hustle with your clients and I just thought this was like I was like well this this is like a pretty fascinating uh pretty fascinating business I never heard of I've never in a million years thought a strip club conglomerate would be publicly traded and pretty fascinating pretty fascinating company yeah um all right well I don't have much to add the sort of Juan chooses the wizard was my the ending of my knowledge so at that point I I retired from the game by the way are you doing something for Black Friday like for your like with my family are you like selling discounts and stuff what as an e-commerce owner what's your opinion on Black Friday so I I think I'm doing it wrong because everybody else is like Black Friday Black Friday biggest time of the year people are sending memes in the group chat that's like uh like you know the 300 the Spartans when they're charging and they're like we're ready we're ready for Black Friday and for two years in a row Black Friday has been you know a big disappointment and um the reason why I think I guess like people think about Black Friday it should be what it should be is like basically November should be double your other sales month so you should kind of get a 2X with that 2x you're gonna have a lot of profit so like that's I think that's why they call it Black Friday because you end up in the black um I don't know if that's true or not but like yeah that's somebody told me that can you just pick that up you generate a lot of your profit for the year during this kind of like this this last push of the Year this is how you go from the red to the black and um I think it requires you know a large like you know repeat customer base so Black Friday is basically an excuse It's a sort of a trick in the mind of a consumer that like it's a license to spend when you didn't even need to spend and um so you get a lot of returning customers coming back so without having to do more marketing necessarily you're gonna get them back but you're also steeply discounting then if you're marketing at all like you have your marketing spends you have your discount spent so I'm like where where is all this profit that other people speak of hasn't worked for us we've had way bigger months outside of November both years uh this this year's doing good but like I don't know I don't I don't get all the fusses about I like it more as a consumer than I do as an Ecom store owner um but then again I might just be a crappy operator and there might just be like a better way to do it but I'm doing it they're like the best practice thing you know I'm sending an email every like 42 minutes it's like you know that's what you got to do is just keep spamming the hell out of everybody discount the things like crazy and um you know hope and pray people show up do you buy stuff as a consumer for Black Friday yeah I um I shop you know uh that Brand's 32 heat or 32 cool but like Costco Costco performance wear brand no but that's awesome you must know these guys basically there's like a I think it's I don't know if they're made by Costco or they're sold in Costco but it's called 32 degrees is the name of the brand and so they make like you know like a Under Armor or Lululemon style thing but like the cheap version but on Black Friday these guys have had the most ridiculous sale like you'll just get a shirt for four dollars or six dollars that's normally like you know 30 so it's like 80 off they just move they just try to move all their inventory during this part of the year and so for the last couple years I have dropped like 500 and bought like an ungod like huge boxes arrive at my house like it's furniture and inside is just 32 Degree stuff that I just give out to my whole family and I wear you know throughout the year but uh that's the only thing I did on Black Friday and then sometimes I'll go scroll Amazon and see what they got dude I think we need a boycott Black Friday Black Friday is the worst I think it's just we are people buy you know George Carlin said this funny thing he's got this whole like skit it's a famous comedian on on stuff and he's like a house is just basically a pile of stuff with a cover on it and you buy a second house it's really just so you can store more crap you can store more stuff I I am so anti-stuff at this point in my life I don't want to buy more stuff and we need to get like all MFM listeners to just boycott Black Friday I hate this idea of buying stuff that you don't really need that just then you got to go and pay more money that you know what's the worst the biggest kick in the ass is when you gotta pay money to have someone come and throw away the boxes of of all the stuff that you bought off Amazon that is the worst feeling I cannot stand that and I refuse to do it now I have a trash can that's a metal trash can that I just burn it all I hate buying more stuff I cannot stand all this stuff that we buy on Black Friday and I refuse to do it and I think we got to get everyone to not do it actually burn your trash yeah yeah I have I have videos of me doing it because Sarah Sarah like has this like funny meme that she shares with our family it's like you know no matter what happens we can't we're never gonna change them but uh dude I'm not paying money to throw away Amazon boxes I refuse to do that that's crap yeah I paid like 600 to have uh 100 junk like come haul away a bunch of boxes for crap that I bought so it's the worst I'm not gonna do it but um like this isn't Vietnam you can't just like go burn your trash this is not India you can't do that I I think legally you can I think you can you're allowed to have a little you're allowed to have fires in your yard wow incredible um I want to talk to you about uh Twitter so shocker this Twitter thing that's playing out with Elon running Twitter is um wildly entertaining and I guess I just think there's two things I want to say the first is you know before when I heard about Elon Musk and how he did things um I admired him but there was a part of me that felt bad it's like man I'm just a lame duck compared to this guy like this guy's achieving the incredible this guy is um you know must be just this execution machine he must be this like strategic genius and now that I see him running Twitter I don't feel so bad after all I don't feel the edge has been taken off a little bit are you up from like if we if there's a scale and all the way to the left is AOC and all the way to the right it's just total Fanboy where do you rank I'm more towards AOC but it's not like so black and white like uh right obviously the guy is super smart obviously he's super successful obviously he's done some amazing things and he's built some really amazing products that those are I mean inarguable um I find him corny and I find him to be a virtue signaler uh and as sometimes he gets them like crossed you know like he gets his signals crossed he'll be like you know um you know it'd be like like uh yesterday he tweeted something out like there he like reinstated Trump and they were like yo why don't you reinstate Alex Jones yeah I saw that and he was like he's like then he like wrote a poem and then the guy was like what and then he wrote a poem about like you know the suffering of children blah blah and then they go no but really like by the same logic of why you would reinstate one person why would you not reinstate you know Alex Jones you know what I don't agree with him but I'm just curious about that policy decision and he goes um you know uh my first child uh died in my arms I felt her last heartbeat and I will never uh you know so I can't I I will never allow somebody who promo who like used the suffering of children for profit or fame or gain in some way right um Fair sentiment okay great very emotional sentiment you know that's fine but at the same time constantly be talking about free speech and and like how uh you know it shouldn't be one person deciding you know whatever it's like well that's you now deciding you know where you're Drawing the Line off of your random personal experience that traumatic and sad you know it's a little bit strange right so like you know whether you disagree I agree with Alex Jones is sort of irrelevant it's just sort of like his virtue signaling about like his like sad experience got crossed like on the crossfire with his virtual signaling about how hardcore he is about free speech he said this himself I'm hardcore about Free Speech I'm hardcore that as long as you're not doing something as long as you're not like you know uh breaking the law with what you're saying then you should be allowed to do this and so like there's you know some things there anyways point is I think he's obviously really talented he's probably gonna have us have success with Twitter but um you know definitely has like you know I consider myself to be somewhat impulsive this guy's like impulsive to the Max and on one hand I think there's like a a kind of a brilliant method to his Madness of what he's doing like he basically came in and just did a hardcore culture reset he's like let's just get rid of everybody who's in charge so day one fired the CF CEO CFO CMO all of them walked him out the door all right that's day one the leaders are shot the leaders you know they're out next he like basically cut like half the employees then he cut another half after that um trying to be like yo this is gonna be hardcore work environment and like none of that soft [ __ ] anymore and like I think ripping the Band-Aid off the way he did while harsh and like you know not that graceful just like doing it via the email saying like you know reply hardcore by 3 P.M or you're out um you know probably could have been a better way to do it but like nonetheless if very effective and ballsy so I like yeah I like that too along with that comes cutting a bunch of the burn down so trimming a bunch of the fat making it a more financially healthy thing but now I'm like okay what are the scenarios like how can this how can this play out like what what are the different ways that this can go and like what's the bet and so I kind of wrote some of these out I'll give you my uh my three scenarios okay so I'll do them from and I'll rank if I agree with with each of the three I'll rank most likely so you want me to go from worst to best or best to worse uh uh least funny to most funny okay the base case the expected case so he makes Twitter more financially viable right he's cut down costs he um adds this you know Eight dollar a month subscription that you know uh let's say he can make it more and more valuable so people opt in it makes it a little less dependent on ad Revenue um the initial reaction where advertisers pulled out gets like subdued a little bit people come back to the platform they realize okay he's not you know evil um or gonna like you know there's not gonna be other people impersonating their brand so they come back so he he resets the culture resets the cost structure makes it more viable uh makes it a little more moderate like he gets rid of a little the like the the hardcore left lean um he cleans up some of the bot problem he gets some like solid wins like oh you can edit your Tweet you can post long form videos you can like you know just make search better he just improves the product in ways that the power users will appreciate and the end state is you know he gets a kind of a one to two x on his money um you know from where it is today I don't think I don't think this is the likely scenario this is a very this is far too reasonable this is the reasonable scenario so yeah and and personally you know he gets a kind of a win you know a moral Victory uh you know it's net positive for the company Twitter's net positive you know moved in a positive direction and financially wasn't disaster no this is like this is like asking Picasso not to paint or John London not to make music like it just that that's just an unreasonable request regardless if it's if it is in fact reasonable for most it is incredibly unreasonable for this human being I'll say this she he came in and did the hard part where he gutted the fish and he changed the culture and he's going to recruit good talent but he's got but in order to do this he would need to replace himself as CEO within the next six months basically and then that person stewards it from there he did the Deep Cuts he did the hardcore like shock therapy and then somebody's gonna take it from there if this is going to happen um because I don't think he's gonna do that over a three-year span you know running a steady ship okay now let's go to the generous scenario the best case scenario what he says he wants to do okay so what he says he wants to do um if you heard his like stated plan like what his like goal is with it I heard where he said he wants to make it like the like the Town Square he wants to make it like an everything app and he wants to add video and a bunch of other things like that yeah I think the everything app is the the strategically what he's trying to do so what he basically looks at WeChat and for those who don't know WeChat is basically WhatsApp plus YouTube plus Bill Pay Plus Amazon Plus like everything rolled into one plus venmo yeah it's hard it's hard to Fathom if you if you don't use it it's basically like it's the WeChat is just a connector between people and then all the things that people do let's say I want to send you money I could do that let's say I want a message a business I could do that let's say I want to uh pay my utility bills for the month I could do that on WeChat let's say I want to uh post a video or watch a video or something like that I could do that and so WeChat is like the super app and there's been a lot of people that have been waiting for oh when is this going to happen in the west and it never happened like all these things were siled into different apps and there's people who sort of are like oh that sucks to have eight different apps this should just be one app that just does all the things everyone nods like yeah all in one makes sense but then the reality is like go build the all in one app people aren't just gonna ditch you're not gonna be as good at those things that those other apps specialize in plus people are just going to change their habits and just ditch eight apps for one because you want them to so so his idea is to create the super app uh dau's you know daily active users would need to go from like 200 million to a billion so it becomes like a Facebook a WhatsApp a YouTube Twitter jumps to that like the big boy table because basically right now Twitter is of like the 8 or 10 social networks which include Facebook Snapchat Instagram WhatsApp Reddit and a few others it's the least popular in terms of uh users correct and um and so you know best I would say the best case scenario he goes for the super app maybe some things go his way like maybe Tick Tock gets banned in the US and Twitter quickly grabs short form video although Facebook and YouTube would probably have something to say about that but like you know maybe they go for that um you know he he cleans up the bot problem he improves the ad platform like both me and you have tried to run Twitter ads it's God awful compared to Facebook and I think it's it's good I think I think the system sucks like the actual the system does suck I just I just bought Twitter ads yesterday and like I kept getting heirs when I was trying to set it up uh so like the tech is bad but a lot of people are saying that right now because 50 of the top 100 advertisers have pulled back and usage is all-time high that their CAC is five or ten times better than it used to be six months ago oh wow okay that's interesting that's good good but that's not necessarily a sustainable thing or a that's not a win for Twitter that is a loss for Twitter that is yeah well no one's using it for their full advertisers yeah yeah that that's not actually like a win for them yeah exactly but let's say he like gets it to be a Facebook level of AD system grows it you know he has to figure out something with short form video or something that's more appealing like um but let's say he does it and the end state is it's now like culturally up there with all the other social like the big social networks the the sort of Facebook's YouTubes uh tick tocks of the world it you know he turns the profits around because he's got this lean leaner team that's doing that and it's like a 10x return and he's the goat everybody's like God this guy did this too this is like you know the next level thing now he owns one of the big social platforms he single-handedly turned that [ __ ] around and uh he did what nobody could do he did what Jack couldn't do he did what em couldn't do he did what dick Hustler couldn't do he did it and he did it like as his third job side hustle this guy is the goat this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated whoa I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better fairly unreasonable as well I actually think it's more unreasonable than the first scenario that you gave right well it should be because it's like this like amazing outcome um okay so now what is the the Bad Case the worst case scenarios I think it's basically like there's this um super cycle like going downwards like a downward cycle so a lot of what's happening in crypto right now one thing in crypto blew up and then people who had taken loans to invest in that thing now their loans they're defaulted on their loans so the people who lent the money they're out of money they blow up then the people who had stored their money with that bank or exchange now they lose their deposits it's just like daisy chain of bad news uh all stemming from a lot of Leverage in the system and some a few people being Reckless or fraudulent and so let's say in this case what it would be is like Tesla stock I think is down 50 from last year or more uh he's personally lost 100 billion dollars of personal net worth um Tesla stock is not the more attention he puts on Twitter people feel like he's taking his eye off the ball so basically overall economy is going down we had enter a recession people slow down buying these like really expensive Teslas um stock is crashing um he still has this interest payment he owes he owes a billion dollars a year in just Debt Service on Twitter and I think Twitter's net profit was less than that so he can't even currently the profits from Twitter can't even just pay the debt let alone any profits above debt and so let's say advertisers keep pulling out on the Twitter side uh the initial Spike from elon's watching elon's chaos goes away um maybe he even makes some mistakes maybe the info maybe they they fired too many of the infrastructure people there's the fail whale maybe it gets hacked because the security system is now more vulnerable as they make all these quick impulsive code changes and they fired a bunch of long time engineers and so you get maybe hacks maybe leaks DMS get leaked maybe um uh if maybe the site's just going down meanwhile Tesla Stock's going down meanwhile he owes all this debt um if all this starts to happen basically like a financial sort of like cave-in occurs and you know Elon ends up and he's getting sued by ex-employees he's getting sued by advertisers who said hey our brand got damaged because you verified some fake account for eight dollars that then said you know we don't like Jewish people or whatever right like you know that's so he's getting sued on all ends and Elon ends up you know fat and broke right so that's the like worst case scenario on that side react to that one so you know you and I both watch UFC and boxing and stuff like that and there's this like famous sentiment that says like basically all nearly all Champions they leave the career on their back meaning uh if you don't get out on top which only a few people have khabib May weather George Saint Pierre only a few people have these guys if you don't follow that these those are like the best people and they all quit when they were uh winning if you don't leave at the top which very few people do you get knocked out and with the injury that devastates your life and you end up like Muhammad Ali and you can't talk and I think that that is the same what what's true in boxing and UFC is also true for business and if we look at history that tends to be the case of people who keep pushing and pushing and pushing inevitably you're going to lose at one point but the bigger you get if you keep taking these really big like bet the farm type of risks you're just gonna you're you're gonna lose more and more and more and I think that there's some examples of like a um Jeff Bezos saying like all right this is this this [ __ ] worked you know I gotta pass on the torch I don't think a guy like Elon has the ego control in order to do it and I think that what you are saying for this final scenario is more likely to happen than the other two I don't think he's going to be able to hand over the reins and I think that potentially this will be a I don't the the phrase isn't career ending but like a uh maybe like a power ending move or or something like that right a fall from grace yeah Fall From Grace I think that could definitely could happen I I think that even you know you think about a guy who's worth 100 billion or whatever he was worth and you think like well there's no way a person like that can blow that and I actually think that regardless of the fortune size you can blow it and buying a 50 billion dollar asset that isn't quite working wonderfully is a really good way to blow it and I think that I think that that could be the case here but I don't think he'll admit because he's just like he's he's he's crazy I don't think he can admit admit a lot of like weakness or fault yeah his core assets Tesla and SpaceX are like high risk like assets they're not like um these you know it's not whatever the railroad company that's just like steadily a steady utility company that's just gonna you know print you know cash and growth two percent a year uh you know these are these are these are themselves pretty volatile assets that the market has really pumped up and as the market has turned like those are going downwards for sure now how fast and how hardcore and you know if he keeps selling Tesla stock in order to keep Twitter alive it's gonna be like elon's distracted his priority is Twitter he's selling the stock and what else is he supposed to do where else he's supposed to get money in order to like fund a money burning business like Twitter and so um so I think you know there are some downside scenarios do I do I think he ends up broke no I think the guy will never be broke uh do I think that he goes from where he was richest man in the world and probably considered the greatest entrepreneur in the world to two years from now Twitter ends up as a disaster maybe bankrupt or sold takes a you know 20 billion dollar loss there plus Tesla stock in the meantime has has lost him maybe another 100 billion dollars or more and he's no longer the richest man in the world he's no longer seen as this you know Iron Man Invincible type of dude he's been a hit with lawsuits and me too's and uh you know news leaks constantly is what I predict is going to happen in the next two years for sure it's going to be he went from Golden Boy to now he's going to be a guy who can't do anything right it's just going to be constant leaks and hit pieces I think for the next two years for him I think the Elon case study is not necessarily how smart a human being is you know I think of Elon before and I was like this guy's a genius he's amazing I actually think it's more a case study it is he is intelligent I think that there are prop there's definitely other people as smart as him I think what this is more so a case study of the capacity to suffer and what I am continually shocked by is his ability to suffer for longer periods of time and to add more suffering just you know just like they're just people are just dumping suffering into his it is in his truck and they're just tossing it on there and it's like when is this truck gonna break and I'm shocked it hasn't so far but I believe in like there are everyone has a limit and I'm just shocked we haven't hit it yet maybe this is it but it's pretty amazing like if you talk to people about him I do and he'll even say he he at one point he said death would be a relief to me someone was like are you afraid of dying he goes no it'll be a relief and I think that he just has done a decent job of being funny and laughing in in spite of suffering but I think that he's lonely and I think that his life sucks I think he I had I think he lived a generally unpleasant unhappy suffering life and um that's what he's chosen to do and there's going to be a limit to it and I think that this could be that limit I think that is true of all the greats that were most of the greats right they're sort of Two Souls uh you know uh so I think that's that's true for a lot of people um one other signal that I think is kind of in his favor or kind of bullish do you know this guy George hautes or Hots love him we got to get this guy in the Pod this guy is one of those freaks that I love he is a total freaking Weirdo And and just he's a punk rocker tell people his background and then and then I don't know if you've been following what he's doing with Twitter but uh so years ago when Sean and I both lived in San Francisco I think he started out of like a hacker house didn't he where like it was like just a hacker house with a bunch of like computer guys and he starts building a self-driving uh not a self-driving car but technology that you can add to most cars and it's called comma dot AI I believe and he starts a self-driving car and he makes these crazy predictions and like there's one story of like a journalist coming to see his self-driving car technology and he's driving throughout San Francisco and they're like this is amazing when did you get this to work he's like oh just this morning like he's just like a cow he's like a cowboy that builds the stuff that is incredibly illegal uh unregulated and he just plows through and he does it anyway raises all this money it ends up flaring out and not working out and he quits and leaves but he's very outspoken very opinionated clearly a smart guy and a kind of a punk rocker in terms of like self-driving cars he makes fun of all his competitors including like GE and Ford and all this stuff and so he's kind of a a loose cannon but it kind of in a good way in my opinion so two things one I don't think Kama has has flamed out like I think it's still going I don't think it has not become the winner but he did resign as CEO president or whatever uh so the company's still alive but before that you know his backstory I think he was the first guy to jailbreak an iPhone um so I think jail broke like a Tesla too I think he jailbroken iPhone then he hacked the PlayStation so he hacked Sony um which was pretty huge and then um and then he was doing something with a Tesla and I remember at the time there was some story I sorry I don't have this in front of me but there was some story where Elon basically offered him a job or something like that yeah so Elon offered him it is what he claims Elon offered him 12 million dollars minus so basically he said I'll give you 12 million um all right let me explain differently he did a demo that showed he had the self-driving car technology and it wasn't using at the time what was the kind of the core technology for the vision system which I think was mobile I mobile I was the hot company that's what Tesla was using George Holtz made a version of that without using mobileye and mobile I was kind of limiting it kind of sucked and kind of expensive so Tesla wanted to get off it so he says that Elon made him an offer which was I'll give you 12 million dollars for this technology minus 1 million for every month that it takes you to do the task so it's like if it takes you nine months just a a pissing match between two uh uh people ready to take that play that game exactly exactly and uh he's like if you can create a driving system that replaces mobile eye uh that Tesla's using at the time and then uh they kind of walked that back and whatever and say and they they basically discussed you know do you want to come work whatever no so then he creates comma.ai which was the idea was like yo you don't need to buy a Tesla that has like self-driving like what about all these other millions and millions of cars that exist what are they gonna do just be left in the dust he's like no I'm going to build a retrofit system so you could put this on a Honda Civic and install this thing on the top and this thing in the dash and then it it will be able to be self-driving right like we'll install the cameras and the in the technology so that your car can be retrofitted to be self-driving that was the dream of that system so he's this hacker guy brilliant brilliant uh programmer also very very entertaining guy like he's sort of like um we've talked about Martin shkreli's lives streams where he like looks at stocks and finance and things like that and then this guy George does the same thing he'll live stream himself figure things out so the other day he's the real deal I think I mean I think that example's like that you're the re he's I I don't think he's full of it I think he I think he's a loose cannon but I think he's the real deal yeah I agree so the other day he goes live on um on Twitter live streaming video and he's like let's see how Twitter works all right I'm just gonna like I've never looked at the Twitter source code but like let's and I I don't work there so I don't have access but like just right click inspect and let's see what they're doing okay so what is this okay this is the login prompt what if I remove this and he starts messing with it he's like so how does this work and he's like trying to play with it he's just talking live all these what platform is this on uh so he was doing it on Twitter at least he streamed it live on Twitter as the video then he goes he does twitch a lot and things like that so then he tweets out to Elon he he tweets out about the hardcore he tweets out elon's like hardcore email and he's like this is great this is like exactly what it takes to win and like you know people should be jumping on this and immediately he starts getting backlash people are like oh yeah you know so this guy's asking you to work twice as hard for less money and you know or you know without giving you extra pay like oh yeah we should all just be slaves to this billionaire and people are like ragging on him in the comments and he goes dude can you imagine the excitement of getting to work on this right now like this is amazing screw it I'll put my money where my mouth is hey Elon I'll do a 12-week internship uh I'll work for free and um I want to come help you fix Twitter and he took it Elon goes sure let's talk and then George goes back you know here comes the pissing match he goes my number hasn't changed which is just a hilarious thing to be like you know you call me and let's let it be known you have my number that's what he said he goes my that's what his reply was he goes great my number hasn't changed oh my God and then so so he agreed to so he's there now so he joined Twitter he agreed to Elon gave him the problem he goes you're gonna fix Twitter search you have 12 weeks to do it and um so he's publicly trying to fix Twitter search right now and he's tweeting out every day the [ __ ] he's doing and he agreed to work on this for just the cost of living stipend I said I think he said he makes uh he's gonna make uh two two grand a week I think is what he said the cost of living San Francisco so eight grand a month and this is a guy that like is a multi-millionaire basically cannot be hired for a job he's a he's like a you know an entrepreneur that could snap his fingers and get funding again well and he's tweeting as he goes I just saw him tweet something and the first line was I don't know if I have the authority to do this but and then he like said what he wanted to do and I was like I'm in you got me that's a beautiful first sentence I'm following your journey and one of the things he did he goes all right I'm trying to fix a search thing but I need somebody to he wanted somebody to do like just a front-end design task which like most programmers most real programmers aren't good at that stuff and so he's like I wanted to just auto complete like you know when I open search he goes for some reason it shows me like just this random follower of my name he's like no it should prompt me on the ways that I can search like search people search for hashtag search for my search within my likes like show me what the things I could do he goes don't send me a resume don't tell me it can't be done uh just send me a code snippet that I can plug in and it works if you do that you're hired that's the interview so it's wildly entertaining to watch this guy do it and I think this is part of the bull case of well if Elon can get like real hackers and real people who are like ready it's kind of like a movie when it's like oh the old Gunslinger they go to his house he's retired but he agrees to dust off the old boots and get back out there like okay we have a final mission for you yeah exactly like if he could have told you I'm retired yo this is Ocean's 11. we're gonna go do this [ __ ] it's like a three month gig just get off your ass and come do this it's also the bear case though because that sounds great and all when you're just getting something going it doesn't sound good when I have all types of private stuff in my DMs that I would not want to be public uh you know I share like intimate things like you know like I'll complain about other people or I'll like say like hey how are you solving this problem I can't figure it out I don't like the fact that people are are doing things this way when there's already 300 million users and there's a lot of like payment information and like intimate information on this platform so I would say it's also a bear case yeah by the way on that he so Elon goes all the messaging should be encrypted I should if a gun was to my head I should not be able to reveal what's in somebody's DMS so we need to go end-to-end encryption and he told the employees that then he goes and then I have same thing I reached out to the original founder of signal he's willing to help us you know like think through how to do this you know like like help us implement this end encryption quickly and um same thing he's like you know basically like oh that guy that the guy from who started signal he sold he was the guy from WhatsApp right sold it to Facebook um then regretted it and was like F this these guys are like basically screwing with my baby they're they're reducing the encryption they're adding in ads they're mining the data whatever quits out of principle and starts signal a like completely encrypted messaging tool because he like really believes in this um I forget if he's the one who founded it or he was the funder he was maybe the main main funding so yeah whatever he was involved he was involved he put like 50 million in um but yeah that's the uh that's another example of people you know getting getting kind of like world-class people involved but do you realize Somebody's gotta go do the work every day for like the next five years who who's that who's that person gonna be the last eight weeks or so have been kind of a gift gift from God in terms of just like drama and I'm just chopping at the bit every morning to go and look at my Twitter app or like to go and look at the news I'm I'm loving this man this is a soap opera and I'm on board I said I was on board originally when uh Elon was doing Twitter and now like with FTX and all this other drama back they got me back like this has just been awesome it's been a dopamine hit like every single day you know and I'm feening I'm waiting for that next hit every morning I check it and so this has been just the opposite dude I'm going the other way I uh I can't resist sometimes what's that the the is it the R Kelly thing where he's like my mind's telling me no he's like yes sir that's how it feels like my mind is like this is all a distraction unrelated to you go read a book go outside go build something no this is the opposite of what you stand for go read a book have you ever read a book in your life I had your the other day you told me about a book you were reading and I was like oh that's great you're like yeah I'm only five pages in though you literally were telling me about a book that you were reading and how impactful it's been and then the next sentence was you said that you were five pages in do you remember that it was like about like yoga or some [ __ ] it was like quicker the better and now you're telling me to get off Twitter and read a book I didn't know you read books when was the last time you read a book from beginning to end from beginning to end okay that is that is a bit of a challenge I read probably one book a year from beginning to end and I read probably 10 books from beginning to 35 pages in a year that's so funny yeah by the way I think that's the optimal way to read books like most books you can get the general principle and if if it doesn't compel you to finish it you should have no problem putting it down saying I took what I I took what I needed from that and I'm ready for the next you know interesting Little Nugget or principle because these books are a lot of filler tell me about this this jet thing that you've had on here twice now by the way our and so we have this document is called MDB Master it just stands for million dollar brainstorm I don't know if you saw this it's across 200 pages so we've I'm Sean I have this document that every day in the morning we like write our topics it's it's it's 50 000 words now and 200 Pages for reading we've deleted I've deleted a bunch of topics off this like once we're done with that I just delete them it's pretty wild uh how long this documented is but you've had this thing in here about Jets what what about it okay so um I forgot who was saying this maybe Andrew Wilkinson somebody else Andrew he was saying this about um empty legs so basically private jets are obviously really expensive really awesome have you ever flown private on your own dime no have you ever flown private on anyone else's diabeter I flew private a couple times one time Andrew paid for it how was it it was sick like yeah like you know like there's things that like maybe like um fancy socks and like that's basically it that's like things that like it doesn't matter just buy the cheap ones they're just as good as the fancy ones and then there's things where you spend money and it actually makes a difference and unfortunately for all the plebs out there flying private's one of them uh I'm a plebe too by the way I don't fly private it costs too much but flying private it is game changing yeah when I did it I was like okay this is awesome I kind of imagine it should be similar to the strip club experience where I would constantly feel like I need to be doing something to like maximize the opportunity like I can just imagine myself standing up and just stretching repeatedly like I don't know am I is there caviar I don't even like this dude I read I read a newspaper when I flew when he flew me I read the Wall Street Journal I've never read the newspaper in my life but I picked up the newspaper and I opened it up I opened it up and just had it and I and I like flopped it and like smacked it to like get the crease out of there that's what I did when I flew private and it was an amazing experience yeah I feel like I would need to like pick up some new hobbies and like wear leather if I was gonna be a flying private so you're gonna get into Sudoku so he tweeted this thing about empty legs so basically private jets I think some really high percentage maybe 25 or 30 of all private jet flights are completely empty it's just a jet relocating from one place to another in order to be ready for the next flight and so there's this Arbitrage then of empty empty legs uh with basically like hey this was gonna fly anyways it's just gonna cost you know 40 Grand to do this flight and it's getting it's you know there's no value it's just a burn could you basically give people the opportunity to hop into these empty legs and so I found there's a website uh or there's several but like there are websites that will let you fly private you don't need to own the plane you don't need to sign up for some membership it's literally just like hey if this is going from here to there if you want to go 20 grand and it's like it's this is yours you know you you and six people can go on this thing um that's kind of interesting have you seen have you heard about this no but one time I I I have a little bit heard of it and and one time I was like you know what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna call the airport so there's one time that I needed a flight from Nashville to New York and I just called if you just Google like your city the city you're in plus Executive Airport and I remember I called them I go hey can you put me in touch with like a like a broker like a flight broker and they did and I talked to the I go hey I need to go to New York in like a few hours tonight is there any Pilots that need work and can fly me from Nashville to New York and there was a guy willing to do it for sixty five hundred dollars he's like that's you know that's the cheapest we could do for 6 500 and it was like a like a crazy hack that I didn't think actually worked and it did right so like right now uh in four days from yeah I'm on uh jetly.com right now but yeah there's a place in Texas going to Fort Wayne International in Indiana it's going there anyways and it's just as negotiable right you could just like uh you can go do this or right now like uh let's see when is this one this is in two days so in two days if you're in Poland or you want to go to Italy um you know fifteen thousand dollars and you can have this private jet flight uh if you happen to be going there and you get the whole plane yeah I think you get the whole plane because it's it's empty how many does it see uh let's see so you can click I mean is it like if it's a small one you can see you know seven people all right so this is okay this one is going from Turner burrow where is that Turtle burrow to Westport New York New York to Miami basically okay so New York to Miami um Teterboro Teterboro okay uh let's see this one seats eight eight and how much this uh so the one to Miami's seat six it's 15 grand so you know basically that's a price of a first class ticket right like for for a lot of things yeah and it'd be a fun ass experience with a bunch of friends so everyone ponies up two grand I mean that'd be that's a pretty cool experience yeah yeah so I thought this was kind of cool and another like kind of this is what Airbnb did was like they took something that was excess capacity and found a way to turn it into like a uh to fill more of that excess Demand right so do you know um do you know Dennis Dennis heck said so he's my good buddy here in Austin and he once a week he goes hey I just got a notification Austin to and he'll just say like somewhere in Utah like it's a it's a Gulf Stream like you know it's normally a hundred thousand dollars they have it for 20 grand and they could see 10 of us you and a bunch of friends want to go do this thing he does that all the time and he actually like actually like pounces on him um okay so what else we got you got a couple others um life after selling you want to do that all right let's let's this is just an interesting thing so I always read this subreddit called fat fire and it's interesting because you don't know if anything that fire means uh people who financially independent retired early so people who want to uh do that but fats meaning they want to retire with a lot of money and not work again and that's an interesting sentiment like most everyone wants to do that they go oh I would love to retire and and be rich and not have to work at the age of 30. that sounds cool right there's this common theme of people doing that and they get depressed and that sounds like oh boohoo like why you know [ __ ] those guys who cares but it's interesting nonetheless and there's this really interesting thread that I found so click where it says follow up yeah but the reason why this is interesting is like you are seeing such a such a clear Journey that someone is experiencing and so this person wrote a post where basically about a year ago they wrote a post saying hey I sold my company I made 20 million dollars until that day I hadn't sold a single share I wasn't living paycheck to paycheck but I was living a normal life uh after the sale I basically had nothing to do with the company um my wife kept working and she would just basically tell her friends that I was working from home but in reality I was just playing video games all day while our kids were at school and six months later uh doing this I am so depressed I hate my life I have nothing going on I'm sad I need to go see a therapist yada yada he writes another Post 10 months later and he goes hey this is just a short follow-up to the post that I previously wrote but the Crux of it is uh for this uh this moment in my life is so good I love waking up I love doing uh what I'm doing all day and uh it just I feel like I've got camaraderie and basically what this guy did was he sold this company made enough money was depressed for a little while and did the exact same thing again where he went and started another company and he has 10 employees it's cash flow positive it's not huge yet but it's enough to pay for the 10 employees and I think it could be big but what I realized was I loved the hunt doing it and another person said my number the amount of money that I made it wasn't anywhere near yours but I pulled the trigger and I sold the company I made a little bit of money and I basically retired and I float around in my pool all day I played video games I read and after about three to four months I was miserable I was so sad and now since then I started a small business it's never going to be that big but I basically took one of my hobbies and I turned it into a small business and it has a lot of challenging problems and I've never been happier and I thought this topic and this these this the red who knows if it's real everyone could be exaggerating but it's incredibly interesting because you get to be a voyeur and see other people's lives where they anonymously say their true feelings and I thought that this was a really interesting Insight that is rarely not uncovered or discussed in such a clear straightforward way where you see like a very like post one I'm sad post two I'm not sad and I thought it was like a really interesting insight and I went through this not as much with my company I I was happy I took I got some chill time but I went to the same thing I'm like what do you do what am I supposed to do all the time um and it's actually quite depressing and it's it's not a topic discussed because you know who the [ __ ] wants to talk about a guy who sold this company doesn't have to work and now he's sad but interesting nonetheless and interesting because a lot of people want to do this and it's cool to see that it's maybe not all that fulfilling and basically particularly type A's who have the ability to do this you have to have like a way to contribute you know like I've talked to I have a few stay-at-home moms in my life who like after their kids went to school they're like my life is pointless you know like I don't contribute to anything previously I I was contributing to my children's lives now they're in school they don't need me what the hell am I supposed to do I'm so sad and now this is like a really good example of that but in the business world so I don't know what do you think about this so I literally had a conversation like this yesterday with the guys who were helping set up the studio they go uh you know I heard they were saying I heard this and they said Alex tremozzi said this too like he he's never been as sad as after he sold his company he was depressed kind of like uh either sad or depressed I I don't know the exact phrase but basically the same gist of it sold his company and then that was supposed to feel the best right but actually I felt the worst thinking what do you think about that do you feel that and I go no I feel excited like I feel super excited I'm like oh are you joking like the anything is possible now right like uh sure I have you know a bunch of free time and if if it was always going to be doing nothing that would be that would feel a little bit that would feel bad for sure but for me I'm very very excited about this period of oh I get to figure out what's next and everything is possible and everything seems interesting and the background is is you had a project that you recently sold we'll do a whole pod on it at another point now you've got some free time yeah and I've had that before when we sold uh bibo the first time and the same thing like you know I've never felt that but I have heard this now from a bunch of different people and um I remember Michael Birch who's been on the Pod and was was kind of a mentor an investor in in my company he he basically said the same thing uh you know when he sold bibo for 850 million dollars you know next six months we're not not very fun like you know uh it was like a huge come down and he's like you can't even really talk about it because poor billionaire like what nobody wants to hear it um and I think people take the wrong take away from this I think what people take away is oh it's not all that it's cracked up to be to sell uh you know maybe maybe that's not a good thing I don't think that's the right takeaway because I agree with you I was happy that I did it and I don't regret it at all and it was everything plus more that it was cracked up to be exactly I think the real takeaway is that humans need you know a purpose and a direction where they're going to direct their talents and their energy and their focus without that uh you will be sad and so the question is and and sometimes in between things you won't know exactly what that purpose needs to be and that figure it out period can feel uncomfortable some people get sad of that for that period because they they are so used to having that purpose but that isn't like it's not just sad equals bad sometimes it's feeling bad equals discomfort equals being out of your comfort zone equals growth and so I think the the better signal or the better takeaway is yeah when you when you do realize that hey man I've been filling my time and focus and energy with one thing for so long I take that away and now I'm going to fill it with something else something new something something that can be exciting but the period where I don't know what that is that's a little that's a little uncomfortable and I'm gonna have to go through that until I could find that thing again and that's okay that's part of the process to figure out the right thing rather than just filling it right same way that when you break up with let's say you're in a bad relationship or even an okay relationship but you break up because you know it's not the one you want uh you break up yeah it kind of sucks to be alone and single there is a period of time where that does suck but that suck is required for you to work on yourself figure out what you want make space for the next person and then when you meet that next person you it's even better than it was before but it was you couldn't skip that single step if you just never did that you would never have the better relationship in the second time so that's kind of my the way I think about it at least so I I'll try to be really tactical here so I I've got a a handful of friends who made enough money that you know they're they're they're pretty much set and they built these like great companies and they came from nothing and then they sell and then they want to start something again and after six months they're like oh this can't ever be big or it's not growing fast enough or it's just too hard and I'm like man like had you thought that about the thing that got you to where you are you never would have gotten to where you are like you're kind of being a little punk and you're being soft and you need to like get past that and I think that that is like a really big challenge that people go through and the way that I combated that challenge or I I think I've done a good job over overcoming that challenges first of all dude getting that first sale regardless of what you have I think is awesome like it's addicting and if it gives you that dope that uh dopamine high but second what I did is I took my lump sum and I invested it uh just like boring 80 20 you know stocks and bonds and then I well not entirely 80 20 because I do have like some just in like a you know just cash sitting there but that account I haven't logged into in like a year and a half like I just don't log into it and I keep a certain amount of money in my checking account tens of thousands of dollars and then I have my credit card and I just assume that my net worth is tens of thousands of dollars and so if I want something I've got to go earn or I'm like well you know I would love to go and buy x y and z i better make my company work a little bit better or uh you know I think about it like that and that has been a nice little hack that has helped me kind of like like that a little silly though right because it's like um then the money is serving you no purpose no utility well it it why do you want the money so bad if it wasn't going to benefit you well because first the the cash flow that I make on a monthly basis covers my life and more so pretty much I know that you don't even look at that account no so the way I have it set up is a certain amount of my cash flow goes to my checking account and that's my spending money that's the account with tens of thousands of dollars and then one but once it hits a threshold it automatically goes to my other account which is my investment account that I don't log into right one thing is the investment account then is serving you no purpose is it not improving the quality of your life at all well yes and no yes and the fact that like when I got my deal done I wanted a car and I wanted a house I bought those things and I didn't really and then I wanted to buy some clothes I think I bought like two or three thousand dollars or maybe more worth of clothing and I was like all right like that that's like pretty much all I I don't really want much else and oh and I took a trip it was a ten thousand dollar trip to Hawaii and so collectively that sum my car was a hundred and ten thousand dollars it wasn't like crazy expensive but it was kind of expensive collectively like I spent that amount of money like buying the initial things that I wanted and then after that I was like you know I don't really want more stuff I don't want more things and so it served me but now I don't want more stuff and if I would if I do want something extra in the back of my head I know look I could go and get the money to spend it but I'd rather just go and earn that because that keeps me hungry and it's kind of more exciting and more fun and I appreciate it more so in my brain on one on one hand I think I only have I'm only worth sixty thousand dollars or 79 thousand dollars because that's what's in my checking account but in reality I'm like yeah when emergencies happen with my family it's all covered but I try to just look at that sixty thousand or seventy thousand and that's all I have okay I like that that makes sense but you don't like that um no I like it I think it's good I like using I do this a lot I use my own psychology for me rather than against me it's much easier to just understand how your brain works and then use it to your benefit then try to fight the way your brain works and say no brain think differently and react differently to situations you know what I mean it's like the same way that if I publicly go on here and say I'm gonna do something then I know that my brain is going to not want to fail at that because the social pressure is going to make me want to do it so I just use that to my advantage I'll go and I'll say I'm gonna do the X and I call my shot because now I know I'm going to use that feeling of social pressure to help me do the thing I want rather than try to talk myself out of caring what other people think no I I think that's a good way to live I'm I'm we're gonna do it this is the second time we said it so we actually have to do it but we're gonna have to do a total pod about like what you're going to do next but I think that I think the best thing that people like you uh and me and people who sell stuff the best part of the situation is okay I have a I have a little while to breathe and think no one very rarely do people get that sometimes they'll get it if they get fired and they get severance but most people the average American doesn't get it until they retire if if they can retire and even then it's like dude I'm now I'm old and like I don't right I don't have a lot of income coming in so it's like what you know what's the point but uh so I think the best part of selling is you have time to reflect and think the worst part is if it if you do that for too long you get stale and you're gonna I think you have a highly likelihood of being depressed and sad yeah the uh we we've used that phrase before work like a lion I think I think Naval was the one who came up with this but like you know a lot it's worth repeating because I think that this is this is what you're describing a lion will find what it wants right it finds its prey it Sprints it catches it then it feasts and it toasts and it celebrates you know the that that feast then it relaxes it sits and it waits you know there's a rest period and then there's a observing period where it lurks and it waits for the next prey and so his business is the same right you had a period And I had a period where we were sprinting to catch the the other win we both caught the win then we feasted we celebrated we did the you know got that out of our system it's important to enjoy it's important to learn how to enjoy everything then you rest and you reassess and you go and you're looking for the next prey and then for you you just found your next one and you started sprinting and I'm still in the I'm in the uh the rest and and reassess period and that's what I told you was enjoy that rest though you you have to you do have to enjoy it I think you truly do need like a period to rest and like embrace it which I know is very hard for you and most people no that's easy for me that's what I'm saying uh I get when other people say that's difficult for them but like it sounds to me like a snow flaky thing to be sad about like not to like minimize your feelings like I kind of get it but no what I mean is like it's like what's your it's like what's your perspective it's like my perspective is like dude I can't like I'm so happy with how that turned out um that was awesome the next thing is going to be awesome and a this period is a new it's a different type of season in the same way that oh it's nice in the winter because you kind of bundle up and you wear your your fuzzy socks and you you sip on your hot cocoa or whatever it's a different season and that's to be enjoyed for its own purposes and like you know I don't feel bad for myself and then and therefore I don't want anybody else to feel bad in the same way like I think people too easily are willing to feel bad about themselves or feel bad for themselves or to themselves or whatever like it's like a form of victimhood right like um I understand how it would be easy to think that way but I do not think that way I choose not no I I guess what I mean is you have a pattern sometimes of jumping into projects and going all in and I'm like you know like maybe just like if you have an idea just wait like three weeks and then and then and then do it you know yeah like you know like I you started the milk Road over a weekend you're like well you're you're all in on one or two other things and then over the weekend we're like I'm doing this and you went all in on it and thankfully it worked but you could see how that could be both an advantage and a disadvantage but that that's kind of the point that I think is is very very Sage advice for me uh because it's super easy to start something you can start something in an hour but once you start something and if it's going to do anything it's going to take weeks or months to make it work to get it started and then once it's working now it's years to like you know pay it off particularly a daily email that requires you to do something every single day daily emails are hard aren't they I mean they're not that hard but they're they're challenging they're unlike other businesses but even if it wasn't the daily email I guess either way starting is so much easier than finishing that like you got to be careful that like just because it would be easy to get it to try uh it's like the test is if I'm gonna do something it's a it's a it's a multi-year Arc for if this is going to be a good in a good scenario so Choose Wisely you know that those are very very valuable years of uh of prime prime and same thing with people taking jobs or anything else it's like are you sure you sure you're gonna give up like 20 of your Prime to that or like people who want to wait I'm gonna wait a year before I go do the thing I want are you sure a year right you know valuable that year is to you like this year in your 20s you know what that's worth like that's not just like uh that's not that's not nothing right like a year in your 20s is I kind of think like you're sort of like 20 20 to kind of like your 50s basically that 30-year window is you know worth like 80 percent of the time of the total time in your life and so like you know each of those years is uh is very very valuable do not do not uh do not throw it away doing something you don't want to do I'm I'm eager to hear if people like this type of content but uh I think they will right what do you think yeah again if we like it they'll like it who are our customers the people that love what we do all right we should uh we should wrap it up [Music]

there's five ways to um like make money and assist in any system there's like five roles and you can decide which one you're gonna be in so like uh one is the logistics and labor so like let's take a house uh you're building a house the guy who's actually literally laying the bricks and out there sweating in the Heat and building the actual home sort of gets like paid the least but does the worst does the most work right does the hardest work and does the most work in the process right he's the logistics and labor he's actually moving the bricks around and you could choose to do that you could choose to be kind of a worker bee who's moving the bricks but you're going to work the hardest and you're going to capture the least and life feels kind of unfair it's unfair that you know the real estate developer sitting in his second vacation home is going to make more off that house than the guy sweating outside every day but that's the reality that's how it goes yeah so there's Logistics and labor that's the lowest level of the pyramid Next Level optimization [Music] foreign Happy Thanksgiving everybody we got an episode for you you know a little break from the family never hurts uh this is a dope episode I really like this one we talked about a bunch of things so we talked about the uh the lurking giant of an industry that is fan fiction that's right fan fiction uh we talked about Vice businesses and a billion dollar company that's serving marijuana businesses and um a Arbitrage around the new Kia car logo which is pretty funny and then Sam what else we got we talked about a very uh famous billionaire who recently said that 50 million dollars is about the cut off to where any more money won't make you happy we talk about our opinions of that and then we also reference a few of the people who said their opinion on what their number is we talked about a billionaire who's only 39 years old who you've probably not heard of he's built a payments company which is kind of interesting but even more interesting he's built the world's largest uh training company to train Pilots incredibly fascinating guy it's a good episode I think you're gonna dig it check it out let's jump in we have some topics uh Sam you have a topic and then I got a I got a bunch I've got a bunch too if you store down you'll see the rest okay but first a lighthearted topic I tweeted this thing up the other day chamath uh was on Lex Friedman's podcast and there was one three-minute topic that didn't really get enough Justice that was very interesting Lex goes hey so you're this billionaire now can you explain how life has changed being rich and he said basically there's if it's zero to a hundred of different levels I've tried it all I've gone from zero to a hundred and back I've done all the stuff and money doesn't change stuff after a certain point and I think that point is 50 million dollars and I thought that that was uh and he referenced the study he I actually can't find the study that he referenced but he said like you know I read this ivy league thing and I don't know if it's true but they said that after 50 million nothing changes because that's plenty of uh plenty of money to have homes all your loved ones are handled you don't have to work you could think about what's really important and I actually thought that that was a really interesting answer because without having any evidence other than just friends and family I think that number is about right uh but no one ever discusses this they always say that stupid 70 000 a year study which is just absolutely nonsense I don't believe that to be true at all uh but I thought it was a really interesting thing and I tweeted it that like you know that's what he said and Jason calcanus who's chamat's buddy and also uh I imagine quite wealthy he says uh I don't think he's totally off but I think a couple million in America in 2022 and you're good 10 million that's Fu 25 plus you're dangerous anything above that who cares and so I want to know what do you think do you have levels like that my biggest takeaway is that I should just be referencing studies that don't exist all the time dude like the thing you just said that is you know there was a Harvard study can't remember what year but totally backs up the point I want to make so I'm gonna make this up now dude I could not find a study and none of my Twitter followers could I tweeted this out too almost 200 000 people not one person said they could find it that's why he's a black belt in [ __ ] and I'm trying to get my black belted bullshitting and now I I learned a move that I didn't didn't have in my bag uh the the fake fake study reference um you know there's these two scientists out of Penn who um it's really interesting what they did so okay that was my first takeaway my second takeaway is um I don't know if the number's 50 I think it's like complete like um it's completely context dependent somebody said this uh somebody tweeted this out in the crypto World they go would you rather have just uh had a hundred thousand dollars and still have a hundred thousand dollars or have gotten really lucky during the crypto Bull Run turned 100 000 into 100 million and now it's all come crashing back down with FTX and all this other stuff and you're back at a hundred thousand would you rather like have the emotional stability of of the of one year of just staying where you're at or would you rather have tasted the highest highs and now crash back down to earth of course not the second one no that that second one was horrible that you know lost aversion I I care more about losing than I do gaining that's crazy so you would rather just stay at the 100k well so like objectively you're at the same level right and so you'd rather have never never flown so high and then crashed I think it would it would I would I would have a life of regret that's insane Ben what about you what do you think um I I think there's some street cred that comes with having been Rich that makes it easier to make the money back so I would rather have been rich and and now not be so I did this in poker I used to play online poker pretty uh like aggressively back in the day and generally yeah pretty generally like you know it's like why pay for college when you can go lose money in online poker instead of going to class like you know those seem to be my strategy and so but I did have some runs and sometimes I would go from the 10 cent 25 cent table which is like you know the very low blinds up to Dollar two dollar up to two four up to three six five ten ten twenty and if you're at the 10 20 basically like on any given hand you know twenty thirty thousand dollars could be swinging you know left and right so you were going on these massive swings for like a 19 year old at the time um but then inevitably because I would not manage my bankroll properly I would go crashing right back down and I'd be like well I can't afford those tables anymore I have to go back and play the you know 10 25 or the you know two four Cent or whatever like the lowest Stakes that were offered on Full Tilt at the time with PokerStars and um and it was the worst feeling when you had to go back it was because it wasn't the worst feeling like there wasn't the regret like the regret is obviously a part of it but the worst feeling is that it's just really hard to get excited about winning 20 bucks when you that same thing could have been 20 000 and you've tasted 20 000 at that point and so just rewiring your brain to like go back be humbled and be humble enough to play low stakes again was really really tough but really important and um but I did learn one thing which is that once you taste higher Stakes it does like break your frame and so the only reason I would say I would rather have gone up and down even though emotionally and mentally it's harder is the value in having your frame broken and thinking bigger and thinking differently and not limiting yourself in some way that you previously thought was a some limit for you is actually incredibly valuable so even though yes you're back at a hundred thousand you have one new valuable asset which is you think of yourself differently and you think of the world differently and you think of what's possible differently than you did it had that never happened I don't know man I think that that is pretty convincing I I think that I think the argument of like you frame breaking is good I well what you're saying is that there's a lesson to be learned and that you're going to be left off better than you then you arrive it's not just the money yeah I think that that is that that is almost a fair argument but I would say that you're going to be broken from the journey down more than you are happy baby we got therapy on one side and then we got things I'll repeat the same thing I've said all the time which is I don't think that your opinion is relevant here because you are this rare thing called being emotionally healthy for most individuals I do not think that this would help them I think it would hurt them more than it would help them maybe maybe I don't know um maybe so so but you did ask a question about the number so you said 50. and I think 50 Probably sounds appealing to you sounds appealing to anybody who's got less than 50 um but then there's a whole bunch of people who are there and they you know they continue on and I don't know what they would say you know I'm not at 50 million and like kind of net worth so I don't know uh if that's the right number or not what my experience tells me is that it's about triple what you got whatever you got triple what you got feels like the number where ah I could finally it'll finally be good and then again I think it's always double actually you know this is actually two and three x this actually is a real thing I don't know if the study is legitimate but I did read like a thing where they sampled like 10 000 people and consistently the number was actually double people said I want double what I have uh you know if you're worth a million they're like you know if I had like two I would feel better it was almost always double so I'm so you're on to something I'm thinking about what project I'm going to do next year so 2023 I'm I'm plotting I'm scheming it's like pinky in the brain but I'm both Pinky and the Brain and every night I think to myself what am I going to do next year and that's I actually don't say the same thing we do every year try to take over the world that's not actually what I'm trying to do this year has a different frame and it comes from a quote I heard I think uh I think maybe Naval had said it somewhere and he said um he goes you are retired when you stop sacrificing today for some future tomorrow um basically when the day in and of itself is complete at that point you have retired and it's not about to me it's not about retirement but that's also like just replace the word retirement with winning uh like the ultimate form of winning to me is when the thing you do in and of itself is the reward you're not doing it for some maybe future speculative hopefully reward that will come right like what most people do is they take some they do something that's a sacrifice in order to have the thing they want later and they think the sacrifice leads to the thing I want and then there's a but what are like the pillars for you you know I I or the columns you know if you're in Excel like you like content creation you may be like investing like where what are your what are your columns labeled well I'll give at first when I heard this quote I was like was that even possible or is everything just feel like you know hard work and sacrifice until it pays off I was like no actually the podcast is the only thing in my life that feels this way the podcast is the only you know it's not even a business but I guess it is technically a business now but it's the only project I've ever worked on where the act of doing it is the reward like I am you know like um when it's a normal startup I'm like what are the growth numbers what are the what are we trending week over week what's the revenue how can we grow this growth let's grow the scripts all I would think about with a normal business and with this I don't and it's not because I don't want this to grow no of course I want it to grow it's because um like the reward for me Isn't if this grows then a good thing will happen the reward is I love sitting down here shooting the [ __ ] with you having a bunch of topics and then like you know the the sort of reaction to the Pod that comes like immediately after it gets dropped and other people get to listen to it and so like doing the Pod is the reward not if the Pod gets big then there's all these rewards to be had and that's why when I look back I say man it's always been really hard for me to stick with projects you know this you've told me this like a thousand times like stop pivoting do whatever you know like the average lifespan of my projects is like one year or less um or I have to hire somebody to take my role and I basically check out the podcast is I've been doing we've been doing this what three years now and like I feel like we just got started I could do this another 30 years I feel zero fatigue in this whereas anything else three years in I'd be looking for the uh the exit path and so that to me was a really strong signal that hey projects like that do exist and then it's a frame breaker right oh if that exists then I want that out of my next project now to answer your question about the pillars I think the most important one for me is I like uh High creativity things not I like create I like creativity not optimization meaning I'm not a good operator who likes to optimize the the engine every day come tweak it make it one percent better every single day I love when people do that but I personally don't get a lot of Joy doing that I love creativity um like basically making stuff whether it's content or it's a product or it's a business idea whatever it is so I'm like how do I make it where it's creativity based um and I kind of had this like big Epiphany during that process uh that like I haven't really fleshed out but I'm gonna I'll share it with you I wanna hear what you think about this so I realized there's like there's five ways to um like make money and assist in any system there's like five roles and you can decide which one you're gonna be in so like uh one is the logistics and labor so like let's take a house uh you're building a house the guy who's actually literally laying the bricks and out there sweating in the Heat and building the actual home sort of gets like paid the least but does the worst it does the most work right does the hardest work and does the most work in the process right he's the logistics and labor he's actually moving the bricks around and you could choose to do that you could choose to be kind of a worker bee who's moving the bricks but you're going to work the hardest and you're going to capture the least and life feels kind of unfair it's unfair that you know the real estate developer sitting in his second vacation home is gonna make more off that house than the guy sweating outside every day but that's the reality that's how it goes yeah so there's Logistics and labor that's the lowest level of the pyramid Next Level optimization that's the person that goes into any business and is trying to make it incrementally better increase sales increase decrease costs this is usually a manager of some kind and so optimization make things more efficient make things grow a little more you could choose to be a great manager you'll capture more value than the laborer but not by much then comes performance that's kind of what this podcast is we get on we push record and we perform and we get paid more than you know whoever does our podcast editing gets paid because we have to perform and it's like the the result of our performance is going to be it'll be a complete flop or a complete hit based on how well we perform you are a performer okay so that's like the third level then there's creativity that's coming up with the concept you know creating original things creating whether it's content whether it's code whether it's the original idea um creativity is like that that next layer and then the highest layer is like one who makes the most and does the least amount of like you know laborious work is Warren Buffett who sits in a room plays bridge for you know four hours a day reads and it will go sometimes years without making an investment but when he does make an investment he's getting paid all paid only on his judgment and so he doesn't get paid on creativity performance optimization or labor and Logistics he gets paid purely on judgment did he make the right call or not and that that person you know captures the most value in any value chain and so I think that's the way that that like kind of like any Enterprise works on the ecosystem works for money and I'm trying to decide which layer I want to play at do I want to try to play a judgment because I think logistic is the best but it's not the most fun to me I think creativity is the one that's the most fun for me or performance one of those two do you think that you'll build a company or do you think that you'll build like uh you'll just get more famous and make money off that somehow probably not either of them uh right now neither feel Appia feeling so I don't think I'll create a company because I've done that like for the last I don't know feels like almost 15 years and um and I'm like okay what if my brainstorm was limited right a brainstorm is pretty helpful when you have a creative constraint so my creative constraint is what if I can't operate a company so I got to do something and I want it to be awesome but I'm not going to be an operator of a company so that could mean for example you could buy a business and place an operator you could be an investor you could do other things but I'm not going to create a company that and operates that's right do you like investing what's that do you like investing I do like investing yeah I don't know if I love investing but I do like investing and um so so that's one and then the second one you said which is getting more famous that also feels really lame to me even though I kind of know it's a good thing like it's clearly worked it's clearly paid off for me like getting big on Twitter or getting big on the podcast or whatever like this has clearly helped my life in a bunch of different ways but it feels kind of lame now and I was kind of saying this during the saw Hill thing I was saying to him but I was really kind of just projecting I guess which is like it's like is that it I'm just gonna be a guy who tweets and a guy who like goes on YouTube is like here's three hacks that you gotta know if you want to get big 2020 series like oh man I can't bring myself to do that so I'm like maybe I just also say no to that path because feels like a lot of people play that game and it's not one I would have a ton of self-respect for if I won so then that would be a big loss if I if I achieved it and didn't even feel great about it we should do an entire episode uh next week or the week after on like the decisions that you're gonna make yeah yeah I'm starting the process now we'll see how it goes uh do you uh no I mean no rush do you all right let you do one of your topics and then I'll do another one after that all right so check this out um have you ever read fan fiction like do you read any fan fiction like with with like is that like a thing you do what it what is that okay that answers my question well I I I maybe maybe I do it but I don't know what it is fan fiction is basically like um imagine okay you read like it for me I read Harry Potter Harry Potter's great I'm done with the books but I want more Harry Potter I love that world I love the characters all that stuff so then there's people who are super fans who will just go write their own as if they're JK Rowling website and then you can go right I I don't I play sports yeah exercise my tendons and ligaments work so no I don't do that um Ben I'm curious just quick yes or no do you uh do you know anything about this world or not a very very little amount okay so that's kind of what I expected and I in my mind I'm like well that's the case for everybody like you know it seems like a really really Niche thing but Sam I know you know about this business Wattpad and um tell you some things about fan fiction it's insane so so there's probably all women though right what's that it's probably almost all women I would imagine it's 80 women I don't know it's it's majority I don't know if it's 80 might be 70 or 60 something like that but it's somewhere in that range I think 70 80 is is about right on the writer's side for sure I don't know on the reader side but I think it's also there so okay let me just tell you some interesting things two of the biggest books in the last like 25 years started as fan fiction so uh Twilight started as fan fiction and then the whole Vampire series and then 50 Shades of Gray started as a fan fiction of Twilight and 50 Shades of Gray became that right so like these were best-selling books became billion dollar box office movies on top of that for the Twilight series and um that's insane okay so then now you go to Wattpad and you you look up the traffic for Wattpad and you're gonna see that Wattpad gets almost 200 million visitors a month has almost 100 million registered users you should explain what Wattpad is Wattpad is basically a website where you can go and you can write fan fiction and upload it or you can read it right so it's the same way like YouTube you can go and upload a video or you can watch videos Wattpad is that for people writing kind of like fiction basically um and they sold uh about a year ago for about 600 million dollars in cash yeah they sold to a Korean company called Naver for for 600 million and you I remember you told me something about them way back in the day I think you knew the founders or our friends I remember you and everybody uh so we were talking you guys both had met these Founders you had something interesting to say I don't know if you're feel free to say whatever your Christians were then no I don't know what you're talking about okay or maybe it was you maybe it was our friend um but they were like yeah I've met the founders and like this business is actually crazy it gets a crazy amount of traffic it's super like under monetized right now and um yeah just like I met them and they're super cool like they love their Community but like they're never gonna make it like in terms of like building it into a business like it could be a juggernaut giving them of traffic it has and I found this to be true for for them and as I was looking at the traffic I saw they were ranked number two in the books and literature categories I was like what's number one what could be bigger 200 million visits a month that's more than like Wall Street Journal New York Times Like that's more than like for sure huge websites and so um I'm like what's number one and it's this website called Archive of Our Own you ever even heard of this no this one I'm looking all this up as you talk 300 to 400 million visitors a month Archive of Our Own and it looks like like a Craigslist D type of website it's like basically like a Wiki um like it's like a website with no images you know what I mean it's like a [ __ ] if a library was like a website it would look like this and that was the intention so basically I was like this is really big and it got me thinking about fan fiction it's not gonna be thinking about this whole the all these genres right like um and I started connecting all these dots it's like I remember when I moved to San Francisco there's a street in San Francisco that they call billionaires row and on Billionaire's row you got you know a bunch of tech tycoons who you know are billionaires at the biggest and baddest House of them all belongs to Danielle Steele Danielle Steel and then I was like wrote like hundreds and hundreds of basically is it like erotic or romance related not just romance novels yeah one of the best-selling authors of all time out you know has a bigger house than you know founders of of you know what's his name David sacks yeah like all these huge companies and so then you and I'm like Daniel Steele that sounds really I remember when I was growing up my mom probably read like 50 of these books like my mom loved Danielle Steel she used to read all these books like maybe this John maybe this little niche is like bigger than I thought so I was thinking a little more about it so there's some crazy stuff so so one of the backstory of this Archive of Our Own because where the hell did this come from and basically what happened was there was this in 2007 there's a website that get started called fan limb and they're like we're gonna fan Fiction's a great Niche we're gonna build like an awesome website make a bunch of money it's gonna be great and a bunch of dudes building this company and all the users were women and they were like at some point the women were like it's kind of annoying the way this business is running and that all these men are like trying to like monetize our work our hard work of like our attention on the reader side and our writing on the writer side so in 2009 one of the writers is called Naomi woman named Naomi she writes a blog post that says we need an archive of of One's Own and that was playing off this thing a room of one Zone by Virginia Woolf it's basically this idea that writers need space time resources to create and she's like we just need our own not this fan lifting and so a bunch of volunteers create Archive of Our Own and that's this thing that now does 300 to 400 million visits a month it's a non-profit and they run entirely off donations like Wikipedia so they've raised basically 350 000 in donations there's 700 volunteers that run this thing and it just covers the burn rate of the actual like bandwidth to run the site basically and yeah you could look up the nonprofits called organization of transformative works and they're you could look up all non-profit sales it's only like eight hundred thousand dollars a year and what's interesting is this their logo says Archive of Our Own launched in 2007 but it says Archive of Our Own beta it's still in the beta and so and so this uh and like the top fandoms like so what what it what is it what do you do so it's like you're a fandom of some world or characters or whatever and then people write their own remix of that story they'll take the Liberty to like write their own and so you have the top ones are Marvel Sherlock Harry Potter Supernatural those are the top ones and um it's it's just kind of crazy and so um like for example the original Lord of the Rings is like the trilogy plus the next two books was like a total of 750 000 words 750k a fan has written uh like a fan fiction version of Lord of the Rings like the extension and it's over five million words it's like seven times longer that somebody's just written for free right there's like extreme passion and you know better than anyone like these are like red hot signals for where you're like oh my God like you can make so much money if you're a greedy Pig like us you're like oh there's a bunch of energy and passion and enthusiasm but probably some broken tools or like under invested in infrastructure can I go in and build something right that's like a general question and um I just got fascinated by the space and it's pretty cool what they're doing so like Wattpad basically after Twilight Fifty Shades of Gray became big hits they um two things started happening one the publisher started scouting Wattpad like crazy so like you know Anna Todd was on Wattpad she's like a scout for for Simon and Schuster or whatever and offered like a six-figure deal to uh you know a writer on there to basically like option their their like blog posts basically into a book and a potential movie and they created their own Studios division um and they're making millions of dollars adapting these fan fiction Works into into you know uh actual actual movies from here and they say oh we got this data like the the guy from neighbor he's like we have this data like not only can we see what's popular let's turn that into a movie but we can say we know exactly where they're reading and where they're skipping where they're dropping off we can say chapter one and two are great chapter three after paragraph two they you know people are falling off and five six and seven you know are good but you know need to trim them and um you know they have like hundreds of thousands of comments and they could basically take all that data and try to do a good job with it that's the that's the pitch at least I found fascinating what do you think I'll give you two data points that I I think show you're you're on to something the first one which I brought up is the website lit lit erotica have I told you about that uh this was your home page right what is what is this yeah right uh lit how do you spell it it's uh it's like literature and erotic yeah so lit around.com okay I'm there okay so it's the same thing it's this like ugly looking website that looks like it's you know uh built in in the the 90s basically uh what's the traffic for similar web say that it has so this tells me 60 million visits a month you know website it's a plain text website and so it's another example of just these like uh basically lit erotica I think that's how you say it literotica.com oh there's some lit erotica man yeah it's it's similar but it's basically like User submitted stories most of them sex based it gets crazy amounts of traffic and it's I think it's only run by one or two people but now that's another example of one of these like low-key websites that crushes it which is like a nice proof of concept but the second uh proof of concept that actually is a wonderful company is have you heard of fandom yeah fandom's like a like a Wikipedia basically for all the different stories right yes uh so basically any TV show that you care about particularly if it's like animated or a cartoon or something but even if it's not like you go there and it'll like give you a list of episodes a list of characters and things like that and I think they have a fan fiction section but what I didn't realize was uh it was started by Jimmy Wales the founder of Wikipedia right and he's actually I think uh as of recently was still the president of the company he sold it the the company was sold and it now does over 200 million dollars a year in revenue and is incredibly profitable it's owned by uh the churning group I believe uh is that tpg tpg so this is a different one um so that's just the PE firm yeah one of the things yeah so it's owned by like like one of the biggest PE firms in the world and they kill it so I believe that you are absolutely like on onto something spotting like an interesting Trend yeah and so I don't know where the opportunity is yet I haven't like sort of done the kind of full exercise of like okay what what's the play here are you um taking it to mobile are you doing some sort of subscription thing and we've talked to in the past about the idea you had prototyped I don't know if you want to should we tell that again or or you think that's covered enough wait wait I'll I'll in 30 seconds which is basically uh my friend and I uh had this idea where we could create like an audible but for erotic stories and we created this really simple website what was it called it was called short but romantic and we drove like uh 500 of the Facebook traffic to it we got someone to write a story on Fiverr we got someone to narrate it on Fiverr and we got like 500 in subscription Revenue overnight or over a weekend and I don't think what happened did we we we told we talked about in the Pod and then a person went and started a newsletter that was this but only specifically for black women and he ended up selling that business I think after six or seven months for like six figures right yeah I think that's what he said uh I I don't know we don't know too much about it so I can't say if it's if it was for real or not but yeah definitely uh definitely a super interesting Niche that's like underserved I think not most I think it's under most entrepreneurs and most kind of like programmers are not really thinking about this stuff uh but there's a lot of attention I mean fandom gets 700 million visits a month like is it kind of insane right like it's insane these are kind of mind-boggling numbers so um yeah I think that's kind of crazy can I tell you another um slightly like kind of Niche almost like um like Vice type business have you ever heard of a company called duchy no so if you just Google duchy's try duchy.com does that is that like a weed thing yeah it's a weed thing so they're basically what they did was they created a like a point of sale system for um for dispensaries and so what duchy does they I they basically they took like the same model of like square or um you know stripe in a way but mostly I think Square because they have like sort of the in-person like card reader type thing and they're like look these guys like dispensaries are underserved it's getting legalized in more places and the big companies are never really gonna go here because it's like too much you know hair on the on it for them they have too much to lose and so wow these guys are huge though they're huge they they're basically a multi-billion dollar company I think they were valued at one or two billion dollars I think three three billion dollars and they they say they have like 30 or 40 market share which is like kind of in a crazy saturation 800 or 600 million dollars yeah so really really impressive uh and a fairly short amount of time I don't know when it was launched exactly but it is uh it's not like you know yeah 2017. so like you know five years and uh three billion dollars later and um and we've talked about this before like you know we one of the early ideas I got a lot of traction on the Pod was stripe for vice which is basically like taking payments is a pain in the ass if you're doing anything that is that gets blocked by banks by Visa by you know MasterCard whatever and um the companies that end up serving you know marijuana porn uh these different Industries those companies uh you know end up picking up a lot of adoption very very quickly and can become very very valuable in a very short amount of time dude this is yeah this is fascinating I hadn't heard of this company they're quite big I can't find this clown across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better here I'll tell you about another one that is kinda Niche but incredibly fascinating and then I actually have a payment story for you as well so Google uh group black have you heard of group black no all right so their URL is groupblack.co and this company what these guys are doing is incredibly fascinating in how they've inserted themselves so I believe they call themselves a media Collective an accelerator but here's the opportunity so in 2020 and 2021 I feel like you hate these sorts of things media accelerator and Collective I feel like if I just told you hey hey man I got a medium Collective and accelera I want to tell you about you'd be like oh God yeah I I don't like the language because it does sound fluffy but what these guys are doing is way more fascinating uh than that so basically 2020 2021 black lives matters becomes a thing and a lot of companies advertising companies they publicly State basically it happened with Byron Allen is one of the guys he's one of the most powerful men in Hollywood he's a black guy who owns a uh a really successful uh production company and he's like look it's just crazy that uh we we black owned media companies aren't getting ad dollars we think it's wrong that McDonald as an advertising with black owned companies and so uh that plus the BLM thing a lot of the largest ad agencies in the world like wpp and all these other companies they collectively said all right look we now commit and I actually don't know the exact percentage that uh wpp said but they basically said we're going to give around four five six percent of our budget to Black owned media companies but there's a huge with that which is there's actually not a lot of black owned media companies or at least there's not a lot of black owned media companies at scale and when I say like you know they they actually group and one of the world's largest ad firms they call them their clients that they said we're going to spend at least two percent of our ad budgets on diverse owned media and you're like two percent what's that you know who cares two percent that's nothing Well it comes out to be like across all the other media companies something like 600 million dollars a year and then McDonald's is like Hey we're gonna increase our ad spend from two percent to Black owned media companies to five percent it's like well you know who cares that's just a few points that's again another like 75 million dollars a year it's like quite substantial but again there's this problem of there's not a lot of group uh a lot of black owned media companies so this company called group black they went and talked to Procter Gamble wpp in Republic all these huge media companies and they go hey commit to spending money with us and we're going to help you deploy it and they say uh yeah okay you know that's like a crazy conversation I don't know how they got that conversation now they have 500 million dollars a year in ad commitments from these companies but they have a problem they don't own any media assets and so at this point they're out there trying to buy bustle you know bustle the it's a it's a women's focused media company that I think does like 200 million dollars a year in sales it's like one of the bigger like new age digital companies out there it I think they um you know they're the size of Vice we're finding 29 things like that group m is now making a bid to buy bustle and and then they're also like I've heard rumors that they're in talks to buy Vice and so these guys have just totally pulled off this like amazing it's basically a caper if you ask me but like these up these like they're like well we spot an opportunity a caper like you know like a like a like it's just like such a bold plan to be like oh you see this opportunity you know of course like like I'm making it sound like they're just like these evil scheming guys I don't think that's actually the truth but like it is like an interesting it's basically like a coup it feels like where it's like oh we see this opportunity we're going super big and we're gonna pounce on it and so now they're out trying to buy media companies that could support them spending 500 million dollars of AD budget a year which is huge that's substantial I don't know how much money BuzzFeed makes but I bet you it's in it's probably in that ballpark and so let me know what you're saying is they saw the demand to advertise on black owned media companies there's like there's not enough inventory there's not enough Supply so let's just go buy media companies and then turn them black by buying them well right I don't know I don't know right that's what you're psycho now yeah they're they're black owned now and so it's like well that's what I mean that's what's fascinating about it you know and there's like there's Nuance to this and I don't entirely understand everything they're doing obviously but that's exactly what it sounds like they did and so they're saying well let's go get some blackout companies but before we do let's go talk to wpp and all these other companies and make sure that they're really in and so oh hey look uh and so they go to Blackstone or some other private Equity Firm they go hey look we have 500 million dollars of commitments partner with us to go and buy these five media companies and it's like a guarantee that we're gonna have increased Revenue okay okay I know I understand why you love this so much how fascinating is that if they could pull this off so they're in deep talks this is according to axios they're in deep talks to buy bustle which was going to go public they're in talks to buy a few other media companies and it's just like crazy is up for grabs fella I'm already Brown I'm halfway there how fascinating is this like is this this is this is a caper that's why now you understand why I called it that they're they're they're seeing opportunity and and I applaud I I they're pouncing on it I think it's incredibly fascinating I don't know a whole lot about this but I have heard that there's a version of this which is like um a certain percentage of like government contracts and Consulting gigs have to go to minority owned businesses and so there's a whole industry of basically like uh middlemen so they go and they win the bid and then they just subcontracted out to the company there's no they themselves don't have like the um company that goes and does the thing they just go win the bids and they're like yep because they fit like a demographic yeah they're like oh like and I think Magic Johnson does this the basketball player I think I think I had heard this is like part of like kind of one of his like business uh strategies or like you know something that's helped his business do well which is that like he wins all these bids because they're one of the few you know minority uh LED businesses and then he doesn't actually it's like wow I didn't know he has a construction company he's like no he doesn't he just then Farms out the construction to a subcontractor who does the construction and they keep their their Vig and I was like oh that's also really you know smart but you know a cynical person would would look at differently dude it's fascinating and I read about this and a friend who had talked to them told me about it and I was like oh that sounds pretty skeezy and then I started thinking about it and I'm like no that's not skeezy at all like they're just trying to get theirs and they are playing by the rules of the game and like if you do believe there's injustices they're out there making it right you know they're getting theirs so I I applaud them uh and so I think it's really interesting it's just if they're able to pull this off it will be very fascinating to me all right I gave you a dutchie now let me give you a quickie so here's the here's a quick one have you seen the Kia car Rebrand it looks like KW it's supposed to be KN but it looks like KW or something k-i-a but it looks like k n uh oh it's it's supposed it's not supposed to be KN no that's the problem it looks like km and it's supposed to just be k-i-a but the I and the a are like joined and kind of like slanted whatever yeah it's horrible put the picture on screen so uh uh this guy um Ashwin we've talked about it before schwinnebago his his his handle on Twitter he tweets out he goes the Keel logo is so unreadable that at least 30 000 people a month are now searching for KN car ever since it debuted and you could go see search volume go from like flat for KN car to like pretty significant now and um and so I have a friend who uh I met recently that is I'm gonna get him on the podcast we're gonna do an episode with him but he is a master of these like internet arbitrages and he previously had done one like this and somebody and we were slacking about it and they go oh my God this is exactly the type of Arbitrage you would do he goes That's right up my alley and he and I go so what would you actually do with this information because most people are just going to make fun of oh the logo sucks haha move on and he's like so he's done this before so when I when I was talking to him I was like oh you're super successful now how did you get like wealthy for the first time in the first place like what is the first successful thing you did he goes it's kind of embarrassing but like you know back in the day I tried a bunch of stuff that wasn't working and then I just like I went to um paradisepoker.com I wanted to play poker and I misspelled Paradise I didn't know how I was supposed to a pair of dice as a pair of dice or the ass like what is it he's like I realized that I went to the wrong one I just went to like a dead page and he's like that's crazy I bet a lot of people misspelled this so he's like I just bought Paradise poker instead of paradise poker and he's like yeah that's all I did and he's like so then I had this website that was getting a bunch of free traffic from Google uh how much traffic Google before Google would autocorrect and um he's like so I got a bunch of and so he's like I became one of the number one Affiliates for Paradise poker uh because he's like so that's how I made my first start I was like a kid and I was making you know like tens of thousands of dollars a month just off this like typo basically and then he did this many many times I'm gonna have him come on and tell the full story but he did one where Tesla was doing a um uh referral program where like if like five people bought a a Tesla you from your code you would get a free Tesla Roadster which is like their hundred thousand hundred twenty thousand dollar car and he's like challenge accepted and he like built a site that would immediately became like the top ranking like Tesla like whatever like blog or I don't even know what he did I think what he did yeah I think he did one with like that he ended up getting he's like I gotta Tesla Roadster then I you know every day I would like earn a new Tesla Roadster it's like hey Dad you want to test the Roadster okay you get the next one I got my brother one and I got another one then my friend got one he's like Tesla shut down the whole program I had to stop the entire marketing program that they had been pushing because like within a month I had like pillaged it and it was like winning too many free Tesla roadsters he goes no way uh he's like I was like what else give me more he just has like this endless supply he's like yeah like haven't paid for Uber in like years I was like what you know like back when Uber had their like you know referral program I um I just built a website that was like comparing Lyft versus Uber like like fare estimator it's like I built a fair estimator that would estimate what does it cost to take an Uber versus Lyft right now and um from your destination he's like so then and then I would just get Lyft credits or Uber credits he's like so you know I have like millions in Uber credits from this site we have to get this guy on just to talk about all these stories he's amazing um so so then I asked him I go what would you like what would you actually do with this KN thing because I don't really understand how these work and like I only understand the high level and as he said he goes well I would go to someone in Fleet Sales at Kia at a Kia dealership and I would make them a deal that if I send them leads I want to cut of the sales he's like then I would just then I would start ranking for all their newest cars like KN tell you ride like instead of Kia Telluride KN tell your ride 2023 KN this k n that and I would just spring for each of the cars individually and um and then I would basically be capturing their intent that you know this person wants is interested in buying a car and I would sell that lead uh to one of the the Fleet Sales people he goes the only problem is that Google's autocorrect now is um is much better and so you would need to find the like terms where it's not being autocorrected which like you know whittles down the opportunity here but I was like awesome whose brains are wired like this and uh it's kind of incredible to me it's not a skill set I've ever had am I friends with this guy no damn yeah we gotta have them on I'm interested to hear all these things all these schemes yeah it's one of those things though that I'm like uh you know we've had these situations where we have a dinner with somebody and the conversation is amazing you're like God I wish I could have just pushed record this would have been a top five podcast episode ever where'd you meet them and then we invite them on and uh and then they're like they like forget all their stories they're like they like you know very very Bland and you're like dude come on like you know say the good things that you told me before and like that's my only fear is it was so good that I want the Pod to be equal to that I don't want any slippage from that company how'd you meet him uh well that's part of the story that I'll tell when he comes on I can't tell that part right now um so that's part of the story yeah I've got one for you have you heard of this guy named uh Jared isaacman does that ring a bell never all right it's my belly of the week [Music] a million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars all right so he's 39 years old have you heard of shift four payments no all right so shift for four payments it's basically like square but less known uh so this guy he started it when he was 16 he dropped out of high school and he worked at a payment processor Processing Company and it took like a month for someone to get a new credit card he said getting a new credit card back then was like getting a mortgage to apply through all this paperwork and he's like that's kind of nonsense so at 16 years old he convinced his grandpa to give him ten thousand dollars and he goes and he starts a credit card processing to get the reader or to get a card to uh sorry if you are if you own a restaurant right or if you don't own a a sandwich shop and you say oh I want to be able to like collect credit card payments it was like getting a mortgage it was it was it was very challenging and they didn't really help you set it up and it just was cumbersome but he said oh I can make this way better so at 16 he got ten thousand dollar loan and he starts building this business where he gives people their credit card processing with just one or two pages of an application and one or two days wait and then he gives you the the hardware for free and so it's just he just takes a small cut of all the dollars that go through it and he builds this company doing that bootstraps it up to like the point where he they're creating uh they're processing like a billion dollars plus of Revenue uh and so he builds this big thing it's called shift four payments originally it was called United Bank card he started it in Pennsylvania he was pretty low-key but he bootstrapped it for 15 years and sold 53 of the company where he was able to make like 250 million dollars at a very young age and uh eventually he takes the company public it's public now and now he's worth like 1.5 billion dollars at the age of 39. very few people talk about him so that in itself is amazing but here's where things get really interesting when he was around 26 the company's like 10 years old he's making some money he's trying to blow off steam so he gets really into taking flying lessons and so he takes flying lessons for like two years and after two years he gets so into it that he says I want to try and set the world record for the fastest around the world flight in a light jet so basically from New Jersey to Alaska in 61 hours he does it and that's like a really big deal and he raises a hundred thousand dollars in charity for it and it's like this really big amazing thing and so clearly this guy Isaac he's got this like personality of like I go all in on stuff so he gets into a hobby and he like makes it into like a real thing but at the age of 28 he starts or sorry at the age of 26 he steps it up a notch and so he actually forms a crew of people who start doing um uh like shows so you know like uh Fourth of July you see like an aircraft or like a like a like a flying I don't know what they call it what do they call those things yeah like an air show like an air show like he forms a group of people that are doing like uh acrobatic stuff for at like the Indy 500 NFL games and he does things like that and he turns it into like a small company and he calls it the Black Diamond jet team and it has a few other retired pilots and so he starts getting embedded in this world and so at the age of 28 he starts this thing called wait where what's it called it's called um draken so it's called draken International he's only 28 years old great and he starts so strong draken International is the name and basically the premises he starts hanging out with these retired pilots who are part of his like a little flight show side business and he realized that the air uh the military at you know post 2008 they're like hurting for money there's a financial crash and they are basically have the way that they would train Pilots is they would get people who should be out in the field like doing whatever the Air Force does they would pull them out to go and train other pilots and that's incredibly inefficient and they lose money on it and they say this isn't sustainable and he goes I see an opportunity and so he starts Drake and international which is a flight instructor school for the Air Force and so the Air Force goes to dracon and they go hey help us train our pilots and he goes out and he hires tons of retired Pilots uh retired Air Force people gives them a job and they now are getting contracts but it takes like four or five years to get their first contract but they get their first ever contract and it's 280 million dollars a year or I don't know if it's actually a year it's a 280 million dollar contract sorry over five years and that's the Air Force paying draken in order to go and train all these uh pilots and at this point this guy he owns this company called Drake and Isaac does and they have the world's largest private League sorry Jared whatever tomato tomato Jared you're awesome regardless of your name at this point now they own the world's largest privately owned military uh tactical jet aircraft so they have the largest collection in the world and this guy he's only 39 years old people never talk about them and now he's doing all this other crazy [ __ ] like going to space and stuff like this just one of these guys who goes all in on things on totally separate Industries totally unknown incredibly fascinating guy wow uh that is amazing how did you find out about this guy uh well Michael the guy who does uh our Tick Tock told me about him and I thought it was crazy fascinating and I just wrote a Forbes article about him and I thought he was crazy interesting I think he's based out of like PA like and so [ __ ] four they basically do like the credit card processing I think for like Little Caesars and like Arby's so it's not like right they're not like the sexiest thing but they kind of kill it it was bootstrapped and he's just incredibly fascinating guy so when I read about this person I was like how is this how is this guy not more well known yeah that's amazing there's a lot of people that are like this like for every Elon there's like you know we had Brian Johnson on that episode I think will have come out by the time this comes out Brian Johnson is very Elon muskie a lot of musk in them right like that guy that guy's got a lot of musk in him and you you find this where like the number one person is like you know super well known but then there are like 10 other people that are very very similar that are completely under the radar and my favorite move is I go buddy up to those guys because I'm like oh wow you're amazing but also you're not inundated with people trying to get your time and attention and um and I find you fascinating so you know I wanna I wanna hang with you oh and and it's way easier to network with that person than continuing to just email Mark Cuban you know on Loop or email Elon Musk or whoever trying to get their attention and tweet at them and you know be like notice me you know notice me please dude and I've met a few of these people there's this other guy uh Greg Mercer who I'm friends with in in Austin he started a jungle Scout there's a few of these guys that I've met and they have this energy that is another one is um Brett Adcock who started Archer it's like the flying car company before that he started uh veteri which is like a job board basically that he sold for 100 million dollars his next company that they're making robots and I've met some of these people and there's a few commonalities that they have one they're incredibly logical but two they're very emotional in the sense of like why are you doing this and they'll say because it's awesome because this is so cool like they just like although they're logical of like well I'm just going to call this person they're gonna tell me X Y and Z then I'm gonna go and like deploy this much money and like maybe by year four I think we'll figure it out but if it doesn't work that's okay because then we'll do this this and this so like they're pretty logical but they also balance this incredible amount of contagious enthusiasm whenever I'm around them I just feel like good about myself I'm like oh you just make this sound so easy and they're like well it is pretty straightforward you just do this this and I just I'm going to take a lot of risk but these people like are incredibly you leave them feeling hyped and uh I don't think if I hung out with Elon I don't think I would feel hyped when I left him but there's these other guys that are arguably as smart maybe slightly less successful but still Uber successful but I leave them and I feel like oh you're you're quite relatable and I've like caught your content your your enthusiasm and so I love these types of people yeah that's a I think that's a good good description of it you know like that um they call it the midwit meme uh what's that it's that Meme where there's a curve and there's like the it's hard to describe a meme that's like a visual but like okay it's like a bell curve and on one side is like the ogre and on the other side is like the Jedi genius and in the middle is the stressed out anxious guy with like a vein bursting through his forehead oh yeah and basically it's like you know there's a few you know and then it's almost like what's that what is the thought process and so like you know for in this case it would be like the idiots like rockets are cool or like you know jets are awesome and the other guy the Jedi's like jets are awesome and then the middle guy is like you know but giving getting government contracts is really hard and this is like you know like a thousand word spiel about why it's a good idea and a bad idea and it's like all the pros and cons jumbled up together it's over analysis right and I've actually come to believe I was gonna make this kind of a bigger video but I'll say it here and I'll flesh it out later I think most like most of Life comes down to that midwit Meme that midwitme might be the most insightful meme I've ever seen in my life uh so much you know that's like for example let's say let's just break it down into something non-business let's let's pretend you're in a fight with your wife and a fight with your wife um you could you know the middle guy the stressor vein busting out the forehead type of dude is basically like you know but she said this and she always does this and yeah I I did say that but what I really meant was right it's like this whole thing trying to be right about a situation and then the Jedi and the idiot which will just be like yeah but you know I love her it's okay right like and they they move on and they don't they don't fuss with any of the BS that the guy in the mid the Midway in the middle does and um and I think that all everything is like that everywhere I walk in life I'm just seeing the midwit meme I'm like you know you know I just see it in business I see it in relationships I see it in like parenting I see it in my kids like my kids are like this so I'm like oh yeah they figured it out like dogs and kids have it figured out they understand they're like more like the Jedi and the or the ogre in either case like yeah they don't have it fully formed but they understand like this is fun I'm gonna do this and have I'm gonna be playful and smile and laugh and it's not that serious right like and that's how I think most adults end up converging on that middle of the Bell the bell curve where they're over analyzing everything and thinking through all this [ __ ] and you really just want to be the Jedi you just want to be like he's like this is awesome or um you know we need to like we need to do this right or um you know like I'll figure it out right like there are certain like three word kill shots you have when you're when you're operating like the Jedi and um and that's what that's more how you want to be do you remember boosted skateboards ever tell you about when I hung out with him no so years ago do you remember boosted skateboard it's like a skateboard that was motorized it was like before all the scooters and stuff so it was like a pretty big deal and uh I remember I met the guy who founded it one time so boosted skateboard it's a skateboard that goes like 30 miles an hour and I met the guy who started it and I was asking about his background and I believe he like worked in NASA and like these like really big hard problems and he was like telling me all about his background then he was telling me all about the boosted skateboards and like the science behind it and the mechanics behind it and how it's so uh interesting and it's actually way more Technical and then I remember saying like yeah but like do you skateboard he goes no I didn't until I got into this and I was like so you know like why'd you leave like NASA to do this and he's like because like a fast skateboard is [ __ ] awesome like he just said like because it's because it's badass or something like that I was like oh yeah yeah you got a good point yeah yeah you're correct it is it is in fact awesome and I remember he said that to me and I was like that is just the best answer that is the best answer of like having a guy like telling me all the technical aspects of something and and like how it actually means this this and this and but then just his reason for why he's even started out in the first place wasn't passion it wasn't anything else or was it to make money it was just because it's dope and I remember thinking you're my hero yeah if you look at what like the stuff that Elon does I think it's very similar right it's like um you know whether it's like the need-based one where it's like yeah we're gonna need another planet right like yeah we'll use this one this one will be done we're gonna need another one right that's like the the just for like you know a SpaceX type of company or it's like um yo because it'd be awesome to like go to Mars so I'm gonna like I'm gonna try to do that period it's just the best end of end of reasoning end of justification end of analysis right like you could just start with that or it's like same thing with electric cars it's like um yeah like because your car should be electric it's better for the environment period not like oh do you know no no car company's been started in 100 years and Manufacturing is totally different than software it's a completely different ball game and you know financing is gonna be tough and then you know the batteries are it's like yeah you could analyze everything but like at the end of the day and same thing with like you know as much as I find Elon obnoxious I think he truly does do the midwit meme where he's like um you know Twitter it's like Twitter should be awesome and it's not like that's basically his thing it's like Twitter's awesome in spite of everything being bad about it right like they're doing dumb things but like Twitter's kind of awesome even still Twitter should be really awesome dude the best example of this is like when he was talking about like uh I don't remember exactly but it was like the his SpaceX and like the rockets and like wait a minute so you're telling me that it's not gonna like fall from a parachute it's literally gonna go up and just right back down he's like you know it's almost like why he's like oh it's cheaper yeah we need to be able to reuse them yeah he's like we you know we can't just like have this land in the ocean like we gotta like go and reuse it so we're just gonna have it go up and then just come right back down to where it is and we'll we'll figure out how to do it it can be done right okay yeah if it can be done then then we'll do it yeah right like I remember he says that like if it's not against the laws of physics then we go for it if it's against a lot of physics we don't do it I thought that was great but uh anyway uh this guy uh the booster guide was interesting but yeah this what's his name Jared Isaacs and we call him Isaac my boy Isaac this guy's awesome I love Jared Isaac man not Isaac's son so I'm dude Jared if this gets to you I hope it does I'm sorry I I you know a rose biting another name is that like the phrase it doesn't matter what I'll call you sir whatever you want to be called You're a great in my book uh we have we got to get this guy in the Pod right he's awesome but Ben's back Ben can you say why you were gone I had twins or I did not my wife had twins we are pregnant you um you you I remember the day after we finished recording you're like you could just see it on your face like what happens like we just had the ultrasound found out it's Twins and like the implications of it being two not one I mean that is that's a pretty big uh uh fun but also crazy Blind Side and uh I remember you were wearing it on your face that day how does it feel now good yeah I felt like I just seen a ghost uh that day um but it had and you know it's funny I was at a conference that Sam was also at and uh Steph Smith comes up to me and it's like hey you're having twins I just met this other guy who at this conference who's having twins and you should go talk to him so I wouldn't talk to him and I was like Yeah man so what's it like having twins and when I had my first kid anytime you'd ask someone what's it like you know having a kid they'd be like oh it's a lot of work but it's great so Steph introduces me to this guy and I'm like hey man what's it like having twins and he goes it's horrible like you're gonna die it's so much work like I don't know how you're gonna make it through I was like oh this guy's kind of crazy I found it's a theme I've talked to multiple people and they've all been like buckle up it's not good uh you you should dread it it's gonna be awful and uh my review after uh like a week and a half of having twins is uh not that bad all right for anyone out there who's got my twins there you go at least the first few weeks not that bad Sam what does your thing say only money what does that say oh It's Only Money all right what's that tell me the story I got nothing I bought it you know that's just I think that's a good life's motto when you lose a bunch of money it's only money and also when we think about it all the time it's not that important but let me ask you guys a quick question would you ever consider not naming your child right away like getting to know the baby over six or 12 months and then naming them you know it's like if um if I was the California government and then somebody commits a crime here but then they leave and they go to you know um China it's like would you consider going and getting them it's like it's not my jurisdiction that's what's like with with important kids decisions it's not my jurisdiction if I went to my wife and I was like yo we're gonna do something crazy she's like uh no thank you uh next you know you noted uh we will be moving on now dude I had a friend who didn't name his he named his child legally baby and on the child's one year birthday they named her and I at first I was like man I think that's crazy just be normal you know just do somehow how did they how did they eventually name her so they basically had three envelopes with names that they liked and they laid them out and they let her crawl to one and that's what they named her the one that she crawled to and I was like that's when they explained to me what they're gonna do I was like that's just crazy why would you ever do that uh and after a while I realized that's actually fantastic that's that's the way to go uh you know it's kind of weird to name something and I've met another parent that renamed the child after six months and they're like he just didn't feel like a George we're gonna call him bill or something like that and I actually think that's 100 the right way to do things yeah I think it's pretty common I think my mom was named something else and then changed it uh after like whatever they changed after a little bit of time my wife's sister same thing after six months they changed her name she was like having dreams and being like her name's not that that's not what it's supposed to be she wouldn't change her name yeah it's kind of crazy I think it's cool my naming philosophy I have come around to a new naming philosophy which is this it's it's a hack uh for my we we had a boy and a girl for the girl we gave her my mom's middle name and when we told my mom within like five minutes her reaction was well I'm flying out next week like if you need me to stay up past midnight multiple days I'm willing to do it like you could tell there's like a little extra investment of course she's already invested in her grandkids right but like when it was named after her there's like a little extra investment that like clicked on in her brain and when you name them things that are not your parents or grandparents names you're just like leaving money on the table so that's it it's hilarious just name them after parents and grandparents and get that extra help that's right I think that's that's what happens when you read How to Win Friends and Influence People while you're uh you know you're at the hospital baller all right that's the episode see ya [Music]

there's a great Buffett story Sam let's say you own a farm and it makes you a million dollars a year of profit and some Yokel walks up and goes hey Sam I'll give you fifty thousand dollars for that farm you just go go away like no I'm not gonna sell and then someone else one day comes along and says okay I'll give you 20 million dollars maybe you consider that but the idea is that at the end of the day these yokels will yell numbers at you and you don't have to sell unless you sell that's when it matters right if you sold for 50 Grand because you're panicked because you're going all the economy is in a recession maybe my farm will crumble and you sell for 50 Grand yeah that sucks but if you ignore the yokels it's irrelevant

you said earlier you said I wanted to make a certain amount of money by age 30. what was your number what was your target on the lower end it was seven million dollars I had built out my spreadsheet model and assumed a certain rate of interest and basically said if I make a certain amount of money this is an annuity that would be good enough for my entire life assuming I don't need Capital to do anything in fact just if it's time like if I'm writing or something then if I do something in the world I have mapped out something like 150 300 million as a a basis that would get me started on that path [Music] we're officially live so uh Brian I've been messaging you for like six or eight months now but basically I'll give like a very brief background and and you can kind of like tell us a little bit more because inevitably I'll miss something but you've started a bunch of stuff the most probably the the biggest thing is Braintree I think you bootstrapped that right I did so you bootstrap that sold it for like something like 800 million dollars to PayPal you guys also bought venmo which I think is like the greatest acquisition one of the best Acquisitions of all time because you bought it for kind of nothing compared to what it is now and then you're you've done a bunch of other things you've done kernel which is interesting but you and you have this a fun that's kind of interesting but the thing that I started reading is your new thing called blueprint which the the kind of the I'm kind of an idiot and so the stupid way of describing it is like you have your biological age and then you have your chronological age a chronological chronological age is just how many years old you are uh and then you have your biological which is it measures a bunch of different things like your organs your blood and you're basically trying to reverse your biological age faster than the chronological age goes up which inevitably means you live forever I mean is that is that basically it and you're blogging and like sharing everything along the way is that right great job what is your chronological age and what is your current biological age I left my mother's womb 45 years ago and biologically I'm a few hundred different agents and so you for example if you're looking at the age of your heart you can characterize the age of the heart from a few dozen markers you can do the same thing with other parts of the body so you're actually a collection of some very large number of markers because different parts of the body age at different speeds and then your life choices and environment also affects that so I want to ask you all about this blueprint thing because I think it's amazing uh but can I ask you a few questions about Braintree first please so Braintree I mean like you know you guys are owned by PayPal now another uh another competitor to yours I think is is stripe which is you know these are like high-tech companies you know pretty complicated things how on Earth do you bootstrap a business like that I mean I think by like year three or year four you're doing like eight or nine million in Revenue I mean you kind of you guys kind of took off so I understand like how you were able to bootstrap it bootstrap it once you got to maybe 10 million in Revenue but how on Earth do you make something like that from scratch I was I guess it started when I was 21. I decided that I I wanted to try to do something meaningful for Humanity I grew up reading a whole bunch of biographies about people who had done things their time and place and I admired people who tried to identify the thing on the horizon that was barely reachable during their lifetimes and they went after it and at the age of 21 I didn't know what that was and I didn't know how I could do it and so I thought you know give it my options that I might as well I'll become an entrepreneur I'll make a whole bunch of money by the age 30 and then at that point I'll try to go after something and so it was a naive contemplation of how to go about doing things I'd grown up in a small town like basically you know with my grandpa on a farm I didn't meet um my I didn't meet an engineer until I was 21 or 22 years old so it was very much a a farm boy like uh race in a deeply religious community and so I did a bunch of startups and I just accidentally fell into payments uh because I I was building a startup I was struggling to pay my bills I had a child at the time and I would do anything for money I applied for 60 jobs nobody even contemplate hiring me and so I found this job to sell credit card processing services door-to-door and so I agreed to do it and it was 100 commission and I became the company's number one salesperson uh in a matter of months doing it part time while building my startup and so I just accidentally stumbled into payments and learned there was this big opportunity PayPal had grown up doing the internet but they had stopped uh really innovating for a couple years and so developers didn't have the tools they liked and so I started Braintree and we landed a big deal early on with OpenTable they were accepting credit cards as a a form of to increase the likely that the person would show up for the reservation but they didn't want to store the critical data because they had compliance issues and so we built out a custom solution for them that allowed us to store critical data on our side instead of them so they didn't have the compliance but still accept credit cards and so from scratch we built this payment system uh first for them and we expanded out to more General merchants and we got a few customers like Airbnb GitHub Uber we helped Uber do their uh hey uh no uh the payment experience where you get in the car you arrive at your destination you leave the car no exchange of payment information no signing of receipts no printing down receipts if you start doing a few things like that and we um really made our Headway into high-tech companies going very quickly they prefer to use our software you just said a bunch of things that were all super interesting first of all you're kind of like Elon Musk without the fame you're like you had your kind of payments he had x.com and PayPal you you had your payments thing now you're doing like a brain interface and stuff like that you you do these moonshot projects trying to live forever that sort of stuff so I think you're you're fasting dude you said something about door-to-door sales and on the Pod we've talked about this before which is uh that uh you know our producer who's not here today because having a baby um you know he's Mormon and he did his mission and we talked about you know what that's like uh we've talked about you know Cutco and some of these like you know door-to-door textbook companies where it really breeds this like amazing entrepreneur because you have to learn sales you have to be able to work hard face rejection all the time you know that sort of thing and it's like this um rite of passage I think if you come out the other side of that you were successful at daughter of sales I would bet on you with any role in my company if you're successful Jordan or sales uh but I've never done it so I'm just talking out my ass here is that accurate in your view and how you know I guess how do you think about door-to-door sales and how did you become the number one when you don't seem like the most uh you know charismatic you know Science Guy I mean I don't know if you had the kind of the same haircut back then but like I don't know I don't know foreign 1917 and 13. and they're currently going through these important life decisions on what they study in school and what they tried to do I'm doing everything I can to help them focus on CS math and physics like these are the tools that you these are the languages you want to be fluent in to be architects of the future and in many ways my choice of doing the door-to-door sales was just a it was my hacker attempt at paying the bills with the child while I buy time before I start something new and it was out of desperation it was like I was seeking it out and so it was just a and that's also the case just dealing with the reality of my skills that had grown up and disarmed like Community deeply religious didn't have any engineering background and so the the thing that I enjoyed the most about the sales was it's not doing high pressure sales tactics and it's not trying to manipulate somebody it's not trying to perfect the skill it's about getting in and figuring out this system like what is really going on and if you if you jump into the world of payments in the Year 2007 when I started this it was defined by Deep distrust that it was a game where credit card payments is really expensive and when a business owner gets their credit card monthly invoice it's so complicated they have no idea what's going on and the providers make it even more complicated in how they report things and so it creates this opportunity for people to be extremely deceptive and create high commissions and so and look at that system opportunity number one be honest be transparent be honest and be trustworthy and then number two is because there was so much skepticism on this businesses didn't know how to differentiate why should I do this work with this company versus that company when in reality most companies were mostly the same there was it's very hard to differentiate in payments so two is making that known so again the customer has a very clear understanding and then three is just being reliable and and competent like that you know that when the customer interacts with you and your team they say what an amazing experience and so it was once you figure out how the system worked it was very easy to solve and so I would just walk in and like the moment you walk into store they can tell you're not a customer by the way you're dressed then maybe the way you're walking whatever and they immediately hate you and so you have to overcome this animosity from the get-go and so I would take out a hundred dollar bill I'd say I will I will give you this uh for one minute of your time and if you say no to me you can keep it and I they'd be like all right whatever this sounds fun what do you got and now we just walk them through these basic principles like here's what's going on here's what they're doing I'm really no different than anyone else you're just gonna find something clean and transparent and reliable with me and most people be like okay I just I just want it to be done like I don't want to deal with any more deception I don't have to change again I don't want these machine leases and so it was it was really just again it's system uh deconstruction and reconfiguration and it was the skill set that I tried to build again and again through every business I built walking into a a new world and trying to figure out what is really going on and then how to deconstruct it and then maneuver within it was the early product just like an agency where you were getting your friends to help install these credit card processors or you know what was that early V1 or Braintree because you said you're not an engineer what did that look like because this is pretty complicated stuff it seems the first product was for OpenTable it was just allowing someone to make a reservation put in their credit card number and have it stored so to the user it appeared as if I was entering my credit card information in the Open Table system when in fact they're entering it into our system behind the scenes and so who built it I had a team of Engineers of software Engineers do it and how did you find that um I had made enough money from selling the stuff door-to-door that I could bootstrap it and hire them how much did you make roughly did you do it for like a year or something like that to cover the bills and all that say create a stash 11 months and I remember at the 11 month mark my my portfolio of customers were uh were generating I think it was like 59 000 a month of Revenue and I thought that's that's interesting right like I mean I'm coming from this world where my family we would decide whether to spend our five dollar family date Budget on going through a car wash or you know going to go and get something to the restaurant like I we grew up in so in such a Frugal uh environment and then seeing that it was like 59 000 a month now I'd always been wanting to build I was I was not willing to trade my time for money you know if someone's going to say I'll pay you 15 an hour to do blank I didn't want to make that exchange I wanted to say I am willing to take zero for an indefinite period of time in exchange the opportunity to make a whole lot more and that was true like I didn't make any money until I was really 34 years old I was the entire time was working for basically zero but uh that's when I started seeing that what kind of money you could make in payments on those residual Revenue basis the 59 000 that was what you were getting as your residual so that's what the company was the company was and they were giving me a cut yeah and so you're getting a cut of that and So you you're saying these things where you're like I knew I didn't want to trade time for money or like I wanted to like do the biggest like technological breakthrough and I didn't know what that was so I first decided to make some money and buy 30 I'll have that figured out um you're saying these things as a 21 year old most people don't know or have the perspective or wisdom wisdom to to think that way yeah it's pretty profound and you're also saying you grew up kind of like on a small farm in a deeply religious community so it's not like you were surrounded by these other like you know by other technologists or you know uh you know business sort of like mentors so where is this coming from did you three and even this like hundred dollar bill trick like you know uh did you read like how do you know Think and Grow Rich or like what did you do you read any biographies or books that like change your way or how the heck did you do this as a small farm boy to like get this type of thinking in your brain yeah I could probably make up an answer uh it seems to me right now I have no idea what biographies you said you read a lot of biographies what were you reading that changed uh your life and I've probably read over a hundred maybe even 200 biographies at this point and uh like for example I would go on deep Dives of trying to understand certain world history events like World War II and so one entry biography I read is a gentleman Dietrich Bonhoeffer he was trying to assassinate Hitler and so you understand World War II and he was deeply religious you understand World War II and Germany and Nazism through the frame of this individual and his plans to go about and his observations about what other people were doing in the community and so I found like these these biographies provided this back door on how to understand events as they were told to me in school in school you have this highly compressed version of History like all right everybody let's get on the same page if we understand these big things that happened but you really miss out on the nuance and we all know how flawed historical accounts are uh because of just the nature of of humans and the way people write history and so these biographies helped me start to piece together an understanding of reality that was much more nuanced and sometimes contrary to to primary narratives and so it it um it invites me to always reject the first narrative that's offered and understand it not for a factual statement but for a Wishful attempt to be understood to be accepted you said earlier you said I wanted to make a certain amount of money by age 30. what was your number what was your target but on the on the lower end it was seven million dollars I had built out my spreadsheet model and assumed a certain rate of interest and basically said if I make a certain amount of money this is an annuity that will be good enough for my entire life assuming I don't need Capital to do anything in fact just if it's time like I'm writing or something then if I do something in the world I have mapped out something like 150 300 million as a a basis that would get me started on that path when you sold when you were 34 right yes and what did you uh what were you able to walk away with were you able to hit your your your the north end of your target yeah I hit 300 million what is that you know you're you're up religious Farm kid who doesn't know much in and then in a matter of 11 or 12 years you're able to walk away with you know north of 300 million dollars what does that feel like and what do you do with that money once it hits your account you don't seem like a victory dance kind of guy wait a second but true that's true it's very true it's sobering because you know it's bigger than what you realize but you don't know in what ways and so it wasn't the case that I had a long list of things I wanted to buy that were just waiting for this cash to come in I don't think I've spent any money for a long time and I think you're now looking back now even my most uh aggressive expectations on how life would change weren't even close to how significantly my reality would change over the years with that event well what do you mean what changed I mean your your relationship with the world fundamentally changes I mean uh in any relationship uh there's power dynamics of wealth and power and status and you know age there's all sorts of things that shape human interactions and it creates a different entry point for everything because now we all know this from our experiences when you engage with people of different powers of different levels it changes the Dynamics of your relationship with them expectations interests rationale justifications it just Alters everything about I mean I remember one of the one of the first stories that I heard um someone shared with me is is Larry Bird uh I don't know if it's true the second or third hand but Larry had a group of good friends that he went back to saw and he had just made money I think signing it for the NBA he sat down to have dinner with his friends and Larry was like you know I got it don't worry about it and his friends are great great Larry it's amazing thank you so much second time happens and everyone's quiet assuming Larry's gonna pick up the bill he does third time it's just like of course Larry's gonna pick this up and probably take it somewhere else and so Larry from his perspective just like it you know the fun was removed because now instead of me being able to do something be generous with someone I'm now in this expectation and so it deterred him from wanting to interact with people because there was this expectation on him that anything he did there would be this expectation and so it just it is a um I think anyone who's experienced fame or anything of the sort uh there are these underlying dynamics of human attractions which are just a reality for everybody and uh yeah it would have been helpful I think thinking back uh if I could have spoken to somebody and if they said hey like let me just share five really important things with you on what it means to have money and how you can best navigate this because it's taken me some time to learn well there's probably going to be like 150 000 people that listen to this you could be that Mentor for them so what would you say what are those five things or give us three at least one is uh transparency of intent you know when when you're with somebody it's very important that you establish why you're doing what you're doing and um the roles you're going to play with each other if it's ambiguous then it creates complications in your relationship and so um it's uh it's unpleasant for anyone to be surprised in a relationship of what somebody really wants in the relationship so just transparency like uh we're doing this on these conditions um foreign money is not a resource that is viable for necessarily for the things that allows you to acquire is most valuable for the time it creates that you can solve problems with money and uh so utilize it wisely not on acquiring frivolous things but on solving fundamental problems of time and and then three is um there's a weird psychological relationship with it where uh you're not that and it is not you and to have an identity independent of that because it can get very confusing if you don't maintain those clear boundaries what did you so I know that I read that you invested 100 million dollars into your fund which you guys have invested in all types of cool stuff and it seems like you've had some really good outcomes um and then you started a company called kernel that we could talk about a little bit what did you do with the rest did you this is a good question that Sean always asks he goes what do you do with your money you know like if you had a pie chart like where would it be like just boring index funds and bonds uh it was Sean for a long time he was like heavy into crypto and and having cash what about you it depends on what your objectives are I mean I think good advice for me at that point would have been you are an entrepreneur you're always going to be an entrepreneur cash is King like don't put your money anything that's going to be a liquid uh so there's been times the past couple years where I desperately needed cash and it was not I didn't have liquid levels that I wanted and so uh liquidity for entrepreneurs is really important number two is that um like the the movement Intel West fund was like okay wait I did range of venmo primarily a software engineering objective within an established industry of payments I was moving into science and the question I was trying to solve for example could we build a global biological immune system so we all know that if a problem in the world arises and that problem can be addressed by software Engineers coding in their computers to solve the problem we're pretty good at that as a species if a problem arises in the world that requires the engineering of biology of atoms and molecules and organisms we're not there yet we don't have the ability to deploy millions of people who can just engineer biology at a moment's notice and solve problems like is the coral reef dying because the water is too acidic uh we need carbon capture blank we need you know whatever the problem is I wanted to invest in companies that would basically serve as the foundational building blocks for Humanity of building this infrastructure so we could actually engineer with the reliability atoms molecules and organisms so if I wrote this in this blog post like if for example a pandemic happened it would be amazing if we had these capabilities to build up the biological infrastructure of detection vaccine creation you know remediation whatnot and that actually that actually was true uh Ginkgo bio worked one of my first Investments I ended up working on the MRNA vaccine and but it was just this idea of like if we've done very well mastering programming bits we are emerging now powerfully in the engineering of biology and so some of the companies like we are doing synthetic biology engineering one company is doing they're storing information on using DNA so instead of a hard drive made of the material we're accustomed to they store it on DNA because that's Nature's hard drive another company is doing nanotech building these structures atom by atom like literally assembling them like Legos and so the companies and they've been successful like some of these are Break Even some of these are are profitable and so uh I wanted to do this because Braintree vendor was was really nice to teach about software engineering I wanted to understand uh science and engineering of science and so it was really a great educational experience for me of getting deep in the trenches with a bunch of PhD entrepreneurs across the range of all these different scientific disciplines how much do you think uh I want to talk about the health stuff in a second but how much do you think venmo alone is worth right now you guys have bought that for 28 million I think like only five only like five or six or seven years into Braintree like pretty early into braintree's exist and did you pay mostly cash for that I mean how did you finance that deal and what do you think that that's worth now because you keep saying Braintree venmo as if like venmo is as powerful or as valuable as Braintree I don't know the current value is I mean I stole the company several years ago I know it's very valuable and so is Braintree and so this was a decision I made when when I did sell range driven memo for 800 million it was a decision of okay so I'm now 34 years old I want to move on to this next stage of life uh accumulation of money was not my objective and I could have stuck with the company and we could have made more a bit more valuable but it was like okay so if I do this it's 300 million that's a good enough starting base to go off into these other things and because they were going to be in the areas of you know deep Tech I knew they would take a decade or so to start it was just going to be a long startup process and so and looking at the you know Prime of my ears I thought I'll take this I'll have a go at this and try to do something meaningful there but it was just a calculation of time and and reconfiguring my life towards that and so you've now let's say that's 10 years ago 10 11 years ago um we're basically 11 years and 100 million dollars in and you probably at the beginning had a bunch of things that were bets that you thought were interesting might pan out predictions maybe of what what the world might look like in 2022 um can you as best as you can give us the summary of like you know what were you right about what were you wrong about and where do you think the uh the big sort of like um promise is now uh the Venture fund has been remarkably successful especially a as a newbie into this to this world uh the number of good Investments relative to bad Investments is extremely high so I'd say we've done a remarkably well on the Deep Tech side with synthetic biology genomics nanotech on kernel I think we nailed the technology selection initially there was the the idea was could we make brain measurement ubiquitous Society so we could pretty we can measure almost everything about ourselves in a fairly routine way except for our brains we don't have good technology explain what Colonel is people listeners probably don't have a current list so I mean I've just seen it as like a helmet that you put on and like you think something and you could change like something on a computer because of your brain waves and so if you think about uh like so wearables are a familiar concept we put this thing on our fingers or our wrists and it gives us data like uh sleep stats respiration rate heart rate cardiovascular expenditure and exercise like we get these this set of data and it's pretty easy to acquire and then we can use this information to help us understand our health and wellness we currently can't do that for our brain so if I have a question um am I in the early stages of cognitive decline do I have anxiety if so what kind of anxiety do I have depression what kind of depression uh is is my lifestyle conducive just takes a focus or not what is my emotional reaction to things and just really basic questions and the most people think that their self-awareness is basically the center system that captures their brain like because I'm conscious and because I can feel when I have a headache it basically is a robust enough sensor system to do it and that's not correct uh so much happens in our brain that we are unaware of and there's so much data in our brain that is informative to what we want to do and so this what we at kernel we've done is we've built a neural Imaging helmet like you said Sam you just put it on your head it takes one minute to set up it uses light to measure the brain activity and these creativity patterns are extremely informative so for example I did I was a pilot participant for a ketamine study you know ketamine is has been used for the treatment of depression we use it as an off-label study with healthy people but the question is what does ketamine do to your brain and you know you of course someone can do ketamine they can think hey Sam how was kind of be like I don't know they get a different dimension and I think I feel better but I'm not sure but it's kind of like you know how was your sleep for the past week it's an extremely imprecise answer and you're going on the subjective self-assessment your memory space you don't really know and it's like it's a disaster and so this this measurement system is basically meant to standardize the measurement of the brain and so it the part of the challenge was building the device of identifying is there a technology in existence that can be built that makes brain measurement mainstream so everyone does it for everything and then second is can we find applications for early markets and so we've built the tech we have a few papers coming out and now we're in the product Market fit uh finding the first application for the technology when you so for the listeners if you just Google Brian Johnson blueprint you'll see I don't what's the URL is it just for the blueprint what is it blueprint.b Brian johnson.code what uh sorry time one one final comment on this just uh for to make this maybe an attempt to make this intuitive when people begin experiencing cognitive decline and this may be true what happens with alcohol with intoxication with alcohol too we just did an alcohol study when your brain is impaired like we just always with alcohol uh with moderate alcohol your brain uh compensates for the deficiency and so you you can't pick up the impairment but you can you can record it and identify it but at a certain level of intoxication your brain can no longer make up for that impairment and so then it reveals itself in impairment and behavior and so that is true with somebody who may be experiencing coffee decline you may be along the path of cognitive decline and you may say I feel great I seem great I'm moving great everything's great but you just can't pick it up and so it's the value of like oh wouldn't it be amazing if I had the ability to measure my brain on a routine basis that informs me of these things that I myself cannot identify now wouldn't it be neat if everyone did it and it was just incorporated into standard of care across all things and how we dealt with our Mental Health and Wellness you know all the above is is there anything people can do if they're in cognitive decline or is it just sort of like well I've measured this sad news all right you know well I don't don't have anything sober up have you guys ever seen on 23andMe or something like that that you they used to have like an all so I guess uh Alzheimer's is genetic and like there's like a particular type of Gene that you could have that increases the likelihood that you're going to have it in 23andMe used to do this thing where they said uh all right you have it but before we can even tell you if you have it you have to sign this paperwork saying you're not going to assume this is a diagnosis and you can't flip out well I had it and then like I did flip out and then they eventually removed that I believe I don't think they have it anymore because they said people were just flipping out too much and one of the reasons They removed it is they tell you that they you have this and they're like good luck like maybe put like frames like they're like there's all these like I don't know if they said this but like people were like if you like have frames of pictures upside down and so you have to like work harder to like figure out who's in the picture that's gonna like help you like get a stronger brain but in general when I was researching I was like oh [ __ ] I have this Gene what I have to do it people were like uh good luck you know just like I guess hopefully you'll be all right but there wasn't like that many things so yeah what okay can you actually fix any of these things uh we think about it uh all right so uh we are a customer idea of society having engineering standards so we know that when we buy an appliance it's going to fit through our front door we don't have to go measure our front door look at the dimensions of the website and be like is this going to fit or not because we know that the door size is standard the appliance size is standard it can be moved into my house that's true for everything we you know so many things we do in life we just know these standards when we agree we build Society so we have millions of invisible standards we have very few standards about our brains because we can't measure it we know that the timing that's appropriate for green light red yellow light and red light on lights because we know the reaction time of humans to lights we know breaking power we know people stop times so we do have data we can actually determine that we do not have engineering standards around the brain depression anxiety problem decline because we have no measurement and so the fundamentally the way to how could we actually create a step change function change in the world and how we deal with our minds you begin with measurement and once you have numbers science begins with numbers and counting and then ecosystems form around that so genetics I think is is kind of like that it's not as numerical uh as what the brain measurement could be but that was a fundamental thing is if you give everyone the numbers you get an opportunity to build um Solutions around those problems this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better so this blueprint your your blog I don't know what you're calling it your experiment it's pretty wild because you know I saw what you used to look like you weren't bad looking but you were definitely were thicker than you are now like your jawline is like crazy cut right now and like you just look way different than you used to do I mean it's pretty fascinating and you know Braintree is amazing you've built something amazing this blueprint thing is like way crazier and unique and odd and it's awesome and like I've read it and you're basically if I remember correctly like I've been following it uh for a bunch of months and you you do regular updates and at first um you were I think you got down to like six percent body fat and you're like okay I think six percent is a little bit too low let's go to seven and a half percent uh and then you're also like eating this like nutty pudding I think you called it uh so you have a vegan diet and you're like just eating like nuts and like tons of vitamins and like what appears to be not tasty boring food like you've gone all in and the the premise behind this is I think you had this blog post that said like late night Brian no longer gets to make decisions or something like that like you know you're you're you're at home at night and you're hungry and you would go snack and eat bad food and you're like I'm no longer letting that guy make any decisions he no longer has a say we're letting experimental Brian uh make the decisions from now on um this thing's crazy man what why are you doing this and what have you found to be actually meaningful versus not meaningful and by the way you're doing you're doing the knees over toes guy uh thing I noticed you're like walking backwards you're doing the tibialis raises this guy was onto something you're doing it it looked like I am yeah I mean so blueprint I had for me uh this goes back to the age of 21. and to me this is the best answer I've ever come up with in my life if you bait if you pose a question how can we imagine the human race and intelligence generally surviving itself and thriving like what is our plan as a species to thrive blueprint to me is the best idea I've ever come come up with and the most practical idea I've ever come up with to address that and so from the outside perspective it appears to be health and wellness and anti-aging and whatnot that's all true but really it's a philosophical Endeavor for the future of intelligence and so the way this I would abridge this is this began in uh from a pro basically I had a problem of overeating every day every night at 7 pm I would overeat I'd rather have a second serving for dinner or third serving or have desserts or do something that I would consider to be self-harm like eating too much food the wrong food it was just causing bad things to me I couldn't sleep well it was I was overweight like all the above and so I tried everything to fix it and I couldn't and so I playfully said I'm going to fire evening Brian because the Brian who wakes up in the morning he exercises he does really well eating same with lunch Brian at this 5 p.m 10 p.m Brian like boy is he a rascal he's always making the wrong choice like I could absolutely rely upon him to make the wrong choice and he always had an infinite number of reasons on why today was okay to do the thing and so I was like you know what I've had it like he's done he's absolutely out and so I play throughout this blog post of like all Brian's got together we had a discussion where like Brian even Brian you're making this thing awful and so I just I revoked his authority from 5 PM to 10 P.M to eat and so what started off as like this playful thing now turned into what I'm trying what I basically have done to my my entire system is I now only eat what my body asks for according to data and science have you not done that at all have you had any splurges since you've started this and do you ever intend to do that uh I have had infractions yes although this is I think this is I think this is the most interesting part of the entire thing so um just to be clear the starting point this is a big deviation from how Society is structured right now uh right now our minds have unquestioned authority in deciding what we eat so if you think about your daily life you go to the store and you walk down aisles you're like ah maybe this maybe that you decide how much you put on your plate you decide if you go to a restaurant you're presented with a menu you decide if you're going to have a pizza party you decide if you're going to eat Doritos like you're making these decisions all the time and it's a combination of how you feel what you want like you know if you're trying to be good or whatever but you're basically giving your mind unquestioned authority to do it blueprint flips that and it says my mind has zero Authority my body has a 100 Authority so it the measurement of my heart and liver and lungs and DNA methylation patterns it directly asks for what it wants via data and I can never override it and so in this idea so the thought experiment is if you could achieve perfect health and maintain perfect health but it but it required you to accept basically what an algorithm is doing to deliver what you eat and when you eat would you do it and then in that thought experiment Sam and I've had this conversation hundreds of times now the reaction people have is almost this fear response and their conscious mind panics and it's like I I see it like a computer screen scrolling of like infinite number of questions but like what if Cheetos pizza parties having to play like whatever and then it like the mind is panicking for the contemplation of loss of control that it can't do the things that it thinks that the mind says the only way I can be happy in existence is if I still get to choose what I do when I do it and the mind cannot get over it it cannot just say hold tight like is it poly let me just contemplate is it possible that I am a self-harm machine I cannot stop myself from committing self-harm I probably will never be able to do it and if I keep on doing this it's probably going to lead to a predictable outcome and so it's such an interesting interaction of rolling through this thing of and I think it's really on par if we say like what are the major things that have impacted Humanity of is the earth the center of the universe or you know it did is there an evolutionary uh Force creating all things on earth I think this one could be on that scale of a societal uh understanding that our unquestioned uh granting of authority to our conscious Minds is it the root of all of our problems in society and so the contemplation here is if I imagine this um could I stop self-harm from happening inside of Brian because just like there's Wars going on and there's all these tribal factions the world the same thing is going inside of me with uh my own body and my cravings and whatever else I've achieved goal alignment Within Myself on this program and so that's that's really what this whole thing is about is it's trying to think through how could I achieve goal line and we hear a lot about AI Gold Line with humans and the acting an existential threat that I think the more interesting starting point is not for me to look on the other side of my eyeballs and say let me find everyone else who's got a problem in the world let me look at myself and say what is my own internal chaos in war and can I even try to resolve conflict Within Myself there's a there's a part of me that's like wow this is um this is incredible I'm going through the blueprint site of looking at the the routine of looking at the photo I mean you're completely shredded this is amazing um so there's probably that's like wow this is incredible and then there's a part of me that's like you're doing the thing a little bit where it's like is this Mayo no he's calling it aioli where it's like oh wow this is not only just great for your health this is Transcendence for the race and the society and I'm like okay maybe I could see how that's true but it I mean it does seem like you're not actually it's not that your body's deciding your brain has just decided I'm going to use data about what my body wants instead of impulse you know whatever my impulse driven you know brain was trying to do before um but like I guess regardless what I look at this I'm like this is amazing but man uh you know this looks like a full-time pH full-time effort plus PhD level intelligence uh plus a bunch of money to be able to do this I think he says by the way his costs I think say like three grand a month like it's not like crazy well I think it's regardless but it's also like the mental energy that you would have to put towards doing this is like you know the real cost so but but you did it in service of of other people too so like you know what is the 80 20 what have you discovered or been the the highest Leverage yeah you know changes I know it's in this but say it out loud because not everyone's gonna go read the whole thing so like what are the the highest leverage changes that you were able to make um during this experiment the first shot on this um maybe just a reflection why is it in society do we accept This ferocious system to invite everyone to commit self-harm like when you walk into the grocery store I mean it is violence I'll outright violence through the representation of advertising and ingredients and sugar and you're in there and you're supposed to be on on equal footing with that like no way we're outmatched and the same thing when we're sized up against algorithms it's a totally unfair match in society we just gleefully allow this self-harm and so the individual is pitted against algorithms and capitalism like good luck individual on trying to keep your [ __ ] together and so it's just it's an unfair thing and I think it's a uh it's just bad for everyone to be in this game but then in terms of like uh the basics for people um it's really understanding that um trying to win this game with willpower is a losing game if you put yourself in a situation where you have option A and option b you're probably going to lose 50 of time or more and that's the whole thing I've been trying through a blueprint is yes it's expensive right now yes like it's difficult this always happens with Innovation it's always expensive and it's inaccessible and then a time it gets better and that's why I openly blog about all the things I'm doing is I'm trying to get this out so others can improve upon it the um I think the most important thing that someone could do to win here would be to accept the basic principle that it's a system that drives what you eat it's not your decision making but but what about the the like the specific true are there any like truths or any like hypotheses that you believe to be true like for uh you know you're like well I even though you said you did a great analogy with the door frame how it's standard and how bodies aren't necessarily like that but like has going vegan like made a huge difference to you is there anything about like for example a lot of us sit at chairs you know 80 hours a week uh staring at screens and we work really hard is there any like we're like oh you know he's in a piston squat right now doing this whole interview yeah are you like well you know like 30 hours is I I think in the what's the Israeli guy he wrote the book Homo sapiens in one of his books he was like you know like Hunter and gathers worked only 30 hours a week and that kind of seems like an ideal number is there anything like just sapience no homo okay not bad not bad I'm inclusive uh so yeah is there any like is there any truths that that you've discovered for you that you know it maybe is not right for everyone else I started I got my pilot's license several years ago and in doing so I was assessing the risk of death and one of the stats that uh stood out to me was that over 70 percent of incidents in aviation were attributable to amateur Pilots and so while I went through the certification of every plane I flew I was type rated in every plane and you know why not um I refused to fly alone because I knew the risk of error was just uh the math was there the stats were there the same is true with health and wellness I tried to do this on my own you know almost like going around this little bag listening to podcasts reading books Reading literature and trying to put Little Gems of insight into my bag and try to piece together my own protocol it's the same as trying to fly an airplane by myself you know I study it I get typed in it my error rates just can be very high and so and then three is that um the value here in this conversation would not be somebody feeling motivated in this moment of doing something good because tomorrow they're going to fail and it's also the value here is not debating is a vegan diet better than a carnivore diet to me the real essence of this conversation the only way this conversation can be of value besides of all the chatter going around the world of every no everyone else talking about this is one is there a engineered solution that actually solves this from a system perspective and two uh can you do so with data it doesn't do anyone any good to debate is carnivore better than vegan it's a meaningless conversation data is the only thing that matters and so that's why I publish all my data is like I mean I'm vegan for ethical and moral reasons but I'm not vegan uh because I think it's it's um you know I didn't at the at layer of abstraction we just put the data we're agnostic to these inputs and so that's really what I'm trying to say this is not a health and wellness gig this is not a diet a trend this is really trying to get the structural formation of what it means to be human our relationship with food our relationship with happiness and and you know like how we structure our lives and it's also trying to say let's get past these silly tribal debates at these layers of abstraction which are meaningless and they just confuse everyone because then people immediately say first they say eggs are bad for you then if they're good for you no one knows and they just stop at that point when in reality there are more right answers than wrong in terms of doing this in a methodical way you know before we started uh recording Sean was just like gushing about how like jacked and ripped you are and how he thought you looked great is it mostly uh are you getting any more uh attention from women or is it all just guys like Sean who are just like eyeballed you know because whenever I have whatever I can shape I'm like oh yeah my wife's gonna love this and she's like ah I guess you look alright uh it's always dudes it's only men I I think Sam I would say the the person most happiest is me you know like I I had terribly complicated emotions looking at myself in my work years it just was so I felt so much shame and guilt and lack of respect because I just felt out of control and Powerless and now when I look at myself I have such positive emotions that I'm stable that things are reliable that I trust myself you know I trust the systems that are built is transformed my relationship with myself it transforms what I think about what I can become as a person uh the relationships I have so it's just it's hard to articulate how significant of a psychological shift has been for me and my own understanding my own identity wow you just gave a really great answer to a really dope question uh that was amazing I'm glad you did that because we set you up with sort of a goofy question and I think he said something really profound there um I wanted to ask you you said you said something like there's a bit of a cliffhanger you were like you know uh willpower is not the answer you said you know the the good thing that could come of this is not oh you listen to this podcast or and you're motivated to go you know go eat two pounds of veggies tomorrow because you know you'll revert and you're up against this you know the grocery stores this sugar Casino basically and then you know you're all your all your social media is just this like algorithm designed to hook you and you know you are sort of yeah David fris Goliath here uh or I guess bad at algae Dave one but like you know you were powerless compared to the the onslaught that's coming at you try trying to get you to make a certain decision and um you know do you but you didn't quite say you're like you know there's a system but okay if I take that I'm like tomorrow I wake up Brian's gone I'm like got it today is about a system and I'm gonna be like what the [ __ ] was he talking about what's the system uh what am I supposed to do and that's where I would stop so I want to make sure we don't leave it at that what would you say is is the approach that you advocate for because you say it's the data is it oh I should begin tracking certain markers and that's the step to take and then let my own intuition right is it is that I gotta Fire evening evening Sean because I had the same problem I have the same problem now that you you described you had then what do you what would you say is the actionable way forward that that sort of is the sustainable successful path yep I'd say three things uh one uh fire the worst version of yourself so whatever you do whatever it is like whatever time however where the circumstances are identify that person and fire him so be successful without one act uh step number two is make a firm commitment on uh one step towards the system so for example for me that's calories I eat 1977 calories per day that's it not anymore and that is my absolute budget and I can't go over it and so set a firm boundary uh that that's what you're going to do and you're going to stick with it and then three is you can start refining the details of what those calories are and when you eat it you know you want to pack more nutrition in over time but just acknowledge that you yourself are powerless to win in a in a moment by moment willpower game and structurally set up the path to win fire the worst version of yourself to get that muscle to build it's that very clear boundaries and then you can you can refine don't worry about taking on the whole thing all at once but just this baby step and then you'll build this muscle like my 17 year old is he he does The Identical things I do and you know Sam you came back you're like how many times have you made infractions and like you know so he went through this whole thing of how many times did he have to make the error of eating too much or making an exception or breaking the protocol or whatever and it was something like I don't know I I forget what we talked about it was like something in the 30s range you know where I in the morning he's like Dad I failed like fine fine right like but he finally got to the same point what I did where you can get to that moment and you're tempted to do something and you can model out exactly how it's going to fail to do that thing and you can model out exactly what it's going to feel like after you've done that thing you can model out your sleep and you can model out your next morning how you feel about yourself and pretty soon the simulation becomes so clear in your mind you're like yeah no like there's nothing in that series of events where I win like literally nowhere why am I going to do it and then it just becomes a point where it's you know people ask me like do you have cheat days and like no like I a cheat day sounds awful to me it sounds like the worst feeling in the world to be full and to be regretful like no I said last in the world I want to do these baby steps and you build up your muscles and then it soon just becomes a way of being you uh you're you're clearly incredibly unique you have you're very insightful you're very wise you're a person who like you talk to me and I'm like oh man this guy has a lot of things figured out but you're also um you're like very precise and you're like I follow the data were you a good manager you think did people or did people like working with you and for you or did they find you to be just like too challenging because you're so uh I mean I I joke my team at Braintree but I didn't care what they thought I only cared to learn what their significant others thought because it's very hard to get someone's real opinion of you because it's difficult for someone to be honest but what we all know when we go home from work and we're talking to our significant others like that's the truth serum in action you know like where we really say something and so I do have some data where people said I'm the best boss they've ever had in their life I'm sure other people dislike the way I do certain things but I certainly um I care deeply about being a high value person in these people's lives and so not only you know a good Steward of the business but a um creating an environment where they become their best elves was that a learned behavior but was that like a learned behavior like were you like well if I treat people right I'm going to get my outcome and or was it just like you was this like is this how you were raised uh like what what motivated that yeah it just feels like the right way to do things I mean like if you think about like more structurally in society we accept this Exchange of spending our life points for a system of Rewards that includes status and wealth and something else and I suppose why I bring this up is I think um we all know how much money is in our bank account we know how much we weigh we know how many followers social media followers we have but we don't know for example our speed of Aging like how fast are you Aging in this moment and if you had aging points like your bank account would you spend them a certain way and so what I'm saying is we have fundamentally accepted that we are on this decline in life we're going to spend our life points we're going to the Grave and the things that may live on may include our reputation or like our contributions or whatever and I'd suggest now that may be the opportunity for us to flip it so if you say in the year 2022 if you're looking at the Horizon of possibilities for Humanity like what is the thing you can barely see which is barely imaginable you would say um basically um don't spend your life points recklessly if you can live long enough this there may be a new wave here it's like blueprint I'm trying to do two things I'm trying to maximally slow my rate of Aging because entropy is very strong you're not going to beat it so I'm right I'm currently aging at 0.76 so I for every 365 days a year I aged 277. so I basically get like October November December for free and then for the months I do age then the progress is to reverse that aging that has happened so that I can be the same biological age and so if we have aging points we have an agent bank account then Society could shift instead of us saying we're going to be a martyr for wealth or status or whatever um would it change in that balance and would it more be about humans so we become an obsessed about what we can become the species not what our technology can become right and let me ask you you uh like a lot of people who listen to this are entrepreneurs and I think one of the cool things when we have somebody like you come on versus like you know our buddy who's doing like a vending machine Arbitrage and like you know is he tells a different story which is like oh this is great I got this income stream coming in and I was able to quit my job and do this thing right that's one sort of inspiring story this is a different one which is like you know spend your creative and entrepreneurial energies on things that really matter both to you and your lifespan as well as like you know just the human civilization um what do you wish people were working on what opportunities do you see where you're like man we need more talent and brains going and trying to solve x or this breakthrough just happened and really nobody's doing why or if I had more time I would be doing it you know this other thing I'll give you an example we had Palmer lucky on and we're like cool you did Oculus now you're doing Andrew and he was like yeah but before that I was playing with this idea of like performing the prison system this way or creating this like oil-based food that's like zero calorie food that would just run straight through you like he had these like crazy ideas he's like I think somebody could go do these things do you have any ideas like that that are like you know I think somebody could go do X I do a lot of them but I would say I'm really obsessed with one uh that's uh goal alignment or cooperation and at the basis of everything that exists on planet Earth there's a singular question at play cannot cooperate and so this blueprint thing this question is can I bring world peace to Brian in my body the answer is yes I did now my mind is is a whole other thing right the negative self-talk like all the stuff that goes on in my brain that's an entirely different project but blueprint is applicable to climate change it's the same thing if we were to measure the world with millions of data points and let the Earth speak and then we work within those constraints that's the solution for how we can coexist with a healthy Planet versus right now our minds overrun the planet we do what we want when we want and how we want and it comes at the expense of our planet so just like we're committing self-harm to ourselves we're committing harm to the Earth collectively it's the same problem and so if you think about goal alignment within ourselves between each other with planet Earth and with AI it's a gigantic computational goal alignment problem and so the idea like this AI alignment problem we have to talk about now like between Ai and humans like what like we don't have goal alignment within ourselves let alone between humans and then humans and AI it's a it's kind of a crazy notion then you know like if you look at the number of disconnects on that entire stream and the starting point in most people's assumptions is let me start with what I can see and how I can change other people's behavior versus looking in and so I'd say yes I have ideas but none of them matter Because unless we can solve cooperation what is it that we have to look forward to as a species so what's an example of that so like you uh you talked about basically like goal alignment first with your body right and you were able to solve that and blueprint is a good example what's another example of how you would take this idea of cooperation or goal alignment and what would be like a more specific like point of attack or or like product or service or whatever that would be created along those lines I mean the brain like so I would love to tackle my brain deck so that's what kernel is if I have this device and I can measure my brain if you think about it in like what we eat today as a dietary input to our bodies you think about what is my diet for my brain like the new sources the social media sources my friends my environment we have no idea what's happening we don't we haven't we haven't measured and so is it possible that we basically eat 90 junk food in a given day to our brains because that's just the way Society is structured and so I'd love to address that of getting a baseline of where my brain and then uh more broadly I've been talking to several people uh who uh specialist in math and computational methodologies to try to figure out are there mathematical approaches in the same way that John Nash came up with um you know a game theory are there mathematical approaches to think about how we might solve this uh between humans between humans and AI between the human Ai and the planet and so like you know I can do this with my body it's a it's a pretty straightforward thing to do now but it's just gonna get more complicated uh than more agents you have in the game so I've like worked with Tim Ferriss in the past and like I remember I would ask like we were just an example is uh he we'd be walking our dogs together and I'd be like oh Tim that's a cool dog leash and he'd be like oh this dog leash you know the reason it's interesting is made of horses hair which is good for the dog for this reason that reason I found it Japan and uh then we had like biology on the uh podcast you know and he was like he would go through these like we would just ask him like what he had for breakfast and he would just give us this like complex answer and it was actually pretty profound Palmer lucky was kind of like that too and you are 100 in that same ballpark where I make a stupid joke and I ask a dumb question or we ask something that seems straightforward and simple and you give like a pretty profound answer and what's interesting is you actually do this thing that Elon does where you ask him a question and most people don't do this they pause they don't they'll actually not talk for like 10 seconds and they just think and I actually I try not to interrupt because most people are uncomfortable with that one time I interrupted you where I where you got silent by the way the keto good interviews you don't interrupt that so I kind of screwed that up but you uh you like are really thoughtful and like in one way it's exhausting because like everything you say is like profound and I'm like thinking about it and I'm like well I want to ask you all these questions about that too now and this and this on the other hand it's uh it's refreshing I mean it's just enlightening you're just you're you're just an interesting human and you you your your intensity is I can see it being off-putting for some people but for me like I'm I'm I'm into it uh you're just a very unique person I think it's like really interesting to hear uh your perspective even I don't think you've said anything that I agree or uh that I disagree with but maybe you have and it's like well that's okay but you're just like an original thinker I dig it thank you Sam appreciate that what's uh give us before we go what's one of these Contraptions behind you uh give us what is one of these interests that's just a Keurig machine isn't it yeah one of them looks like a soda stream or something that'd be funny like got me like you know Coke and Pepsi and yeah is that a [ __ ] Red Bull yeah uh yeah so we I last week a couple weeks ago I we bought a medical grade hospital grade ultrasound machine and so part of this has just been buying a the kind of equipment that allows us to do the stuff we're trying to do and so for example ultrasound so if you look at the the Pyramid of measurement wearables are like part of the first category and then you get to biofluids like blood draws and and you know urine and whatever else uh Imaging is an entirely different quality class and so if you want to get really good data on on yourself it's an ultrasound and MRI and uh you know a lot of stuff we're doing a kernel and so um we really had to build up this infrastructure so one of the reasons why this is so expensive is we've basically built out like a mini Clinic hospital here with all the stuff we have and such where a lot and are there like four Dudes just kind of like that are your Physicians that monitoring you at all times or what's going on what's your team what's your stack for for people with yeah the body stuff uh for the ultrasound we have five sonographers so one sonographer specializes in uh the heart one does lungs pancreas liver uh kidney another one does uh musculoskeletal another one does uh Doppler for the brain and so for example we just did um one of the ways to quantify working out is we're using ultrasound to measure tendons ligaments like all the component parts of my joints ankles knees hips elbows shoulders and then we implement this these exercise regimes and then we look at the changes so like are they working if so what degree so everything we do is Quantified and so it's not like oh this thing makes me feel better feeling to rarely matter with anything we do and so yeah this the hardware and the specific team and so just like we have five sonographers to run the ultrasound machine we have specialists in lungs specialists in the heart specialists in other areas so the team is like 25 or so maybe now uh all together that have different specialties man this is crazy Sean's answer that question is like I just got like a poster of dogs playing poker one two three airpods and a couple empty Diet Coke cans like we ask you it's like oh you read that ultrasound actually I don't need all this measurement like if you just export my doordash history it'll tell you yeah like a greyhound right now yeah does Chick-fil-A make you older or younger what are your thoughts on Ranch dude Brian this has been awesome thanks for thanks for coming on we've been we talked about you way back as like this awesome guy and it's amazing to get to meet you and hear some of the stories and ask ask our questions firsthand so appreciate you coming on yeah thanks for having me foreign [Music]

foreign [Music] this is uh framework Friday special guest Andrew Wilkinson joining Andrew I wanted to hear from you because I think you like Frameworks just as much as I do is there a framework that you've been using or uh has like stood out to you as particularly useful lately it's actually a quote um and it's easy choices hard life hard choices Easy Life by this guy Jersey Greg Rick I think Tim Ferriss uh famously shared this quote years ago and it always sticks with me and it most recently uh has been on my mind and it's it's one of those things where um you will often find a situation where you know what the right thing to do is so let's say an employee is you know just not working out or there's a difficult decision that needs to be made and naturally the thing to do is to delay it or to try and make it work and I have really shifted over the last two years of really trying to make the hard choice and I found that it always results in an easier life um that the road that the road to hell is paved with good intentions and that when I try and make it work with someone or I try and make a business work it just never does so for me you know the and the other piece of that framework is if if I ever think should I fire this person that means I absolutely should because you never think about a superstar and go should I fire them you go oh my God I'd be lost without them so if you have that thought you got to immediately fire that person make a hard decision and that applies to so many different parts of business I like that I'll give one one uh personal experience caveat with that recently in the past two years there's been a couple people that we were like should we fire this person and I had the same mentality as you like once the question comes up you know it's obvious right this sort of like if it's not a hell yes it's a no type of approach to people on your team especially on a small team but the one caveat was have I given this person Clarity on what their role is and what's expected what winning looks like and what I found was that in a couple circumstances I didn't give them a clear role and I didn't give them Clarity on what I needed what was winning in this role and once we did that we said okay before we just you know cut the cord I'm going to do this one thing and I'll know within two weeks three weeks from that from this point on if that was correct and that actually turned somebody who was we were about to fire them into basically like a star driver in in like that function of the company and so that's my only caveat with that one but I'll also add um one of the like takeaways from the easy choices hard life hard choices Easy Life thing is when you think two options when you're trying to weigh a decision should I do a or b and you're trying to weigh A or B A or B you can't just you just literally you can't decide you should just simply say which one is harder because your brain is naturally discounting the uh the hard one and and making it seem like oh these are about equal because the difficulty is something that you're taking into consideration um and your brain wants to avoid difficulty it wants to avoid the short-term pain or struggle that might come so what looks to be equal to equal choices are not actually equal at all the um the one that's that's harder is actually a much better choice and your brain is just trying to sandbag it weigh it down because it wants to avoid that that struggle so that's another useful one because I had a situation recently Where I Was A or B A or B I just couldn't decide for the life of me and then um I went down this Rabbit Hole of like how do you make a tough decision because I was like normally I'm very very decisive normally it's pretty easy this one was so difficult and when I went down this Rabbit Hole like okay what is the world's philosophy on this that was one that really helped me which was your brain is not accurately pricing the two decisions decisions correctly it puts a huge tax on the one that's difficult and that's why it seems equal but that tax is not real it's just the brain trying to like you know punish you for short-term pain I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out-of-sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better I love that and that exactly it's pushing through and doing the hard thing and there's been so many times where Chris and I you know let's say that we're doing a hire and we've been doing the hiring process for six months and we haven't found the candidate and we have someone that we think is like a b or a c but we're exhausted at the end of it the right thing to do is to actually continue the process and do the hard thing and do more phone calls and stuff but it's so easy to get fatigued and choose the wrong person and every time I do that it's always a colossal failure um so I'm really trying to lean into that um the other one that I've been finding really interesting lately um so there's this great quote by Upton Sinclair never expect a man to understand something that is paycheck depends on him not understanding so effectively um let's say you go to someone and you say hey um you know this business model is terrible uh you shouldn't do it it's doomed in five years but if they're making a ton of money doing it and it rewards them it will be very difficult cognitively for them to face that painful truth and this can apply to anything effectively it's people will not do things that are that don't benefit them or they're not incentivized to do in some way so here's an example so we own a whole bunch of different agencies and the logical thing when you own all these agencies is to say hey big agency you should refer your smaller leads to the smaller agency and so um you know we kind of introduced everyone and we're not going to force them to but we figured you know they would get it they're like oh they're part of the family we'll refer the leads over here and I just did a call with one of the smaller agency guys and he's like man I'm not getting any leads what's going on and I realize that for these guys there's no reason to do it right they might get a little referral healthy or something that we've structured but it actually will not make a difference their bonus and on the downside if they refer the work they could lose the person that might come back to them for future work or if it goes badly that person might email them and say hey I can't believe you referred that me to this agency they sucked or whatever it is and so I've just realized time and time again people will not do what they're incentivized to not do yeah the the thing you said uh at the beginning is sort of like the innovator's Dilemma too right it's like um a company that's success depends on the world being a certain way is going to have a huge blind spot to the change in that that scenario and this is like why for the innovators dilemma it's like you would assume that the big company whose domain expertise is in this area they'll be the ones to invent that future and it's almost never them that invents that future it's some upstart who sees the world a little differently and says oh yeah all that stuff that's the old way yeah screw that we're gonna do it this new way and the you know the big companies like sort of like screw that what do you mean how how could you screw that that's that's the way the world is and so you can sort of and then you can can you use that to your benefit so like for you for example what would be your blind spots like basically what would you not see because your paycheck depends on it won't be a certain way and I I've been thinking about this a lot right you look at Dolly and you go okay in five years will you be able to type into Dolly build me away website that looks like this and then it comes back and you say oh more creative or make the logo bigger or do this will Design still be a thing right and I've always been rewarded by not overestimating these things in the near term and just Trucking on but I've been thinking about that I think about some of our other businesses now that can be disrupted and I don't want to over index on that but I always try and remember that I have this crazy perverse cognitive bias where you know what is the great quote it's like all forecasts are based on the past right or all all your knowledge is based on the past you don't know what's coming and I don't think that someone who owned I'm reading like a great book about um news the newspaper industry right now and all the guys that own newspapers in 1998 like they all thought oh we're good Forever This is the the best possible business we have a monopoly it's okay to pay 20 times earnings to buy a paper and you know look how that turned out you could not have predicted Craigslist classified disruption Etc and so yeah people are just incapable of seeing these things in themselves yeah that's a great Point uh that's a great point I think it's also true with Investments if you um like if you're invested in something you know when new information comes to light you sort of have to recalculate from scratch do would I if I didn't have this investment today would I invest the same amount of money in the thing and people would be surprised how often the answer is no um that you would not put that same amount of investment in this thing and it happens even at a small scale with like employee stock options or whatever it's like you get stock options or rsus in a company you you earn them and not like you know 50 of your stock portfolio is in this one company and I'm like you probably wouldn't have if you just I just gave you that amount of money you wouldn't put 50 of this company but you'll leave it there right because inertia right like you know it's it is it is that way so let's let it continue to be that way and so I think one of the best things you could do is train your brain like train yourself to get rid of some of these biases and blind spots and just know that by default they're there you're not special you're not going to just not have them you're going to have them unless you proactively fight against the gravity to um to like sort of rid yourself of them so you don't make the same mistakes everybody else does so um there's two really amazing things that people should go and study if you want to I spent a couple years actually just reading and rereading books on psychology to try and Hammer this stuff into my brain my favorite book on it is influenced by Robert cialdini it's amazing it just kind of goes through all of the kind of thinking traps we get into um and you know it's anchor bias um and you know comparison and you know all these all these kind of ways that you trick yourself and then the other great one is the psychology of human misjudgment by Charlie Munger which is a speech he gave at Harvard if you just Google it on YouTube um you'll find it there and just I listened to that in the car over and over and over again and now I see it everywhere totally all right this is great uh thanks for joining the framework Fridays and uh yeah if you if you like this tweet at uh Andrew and uh tweet at me Andrew your handle is what a Wilkinson on Twitter yeah a Wilkinson cool and I'm Sean VP on Twitter all right see ya [Music]

what are easy businesses that you've you started where you're like because I for me milk Road was a way easier business than any business I had ever started um what what's been an easy business for you and where does where does the where does agencies rank on the easy to hard scale I'd say it's medium I mean the hardest let's just say the hardest possible businesses are brick and mortar or where you have to move physical goods and you have a lot of employees [Music] all right Andrew Wilkinson you're back what's going on not too much good to be here uh Sean did you know that that sahil one that we did we had sahil Bloom on the other day two things were interesting to me one people thought when we were making fun of them that we disliked him they thought I disliked him which is not true and two it was shockingly popular did you see that well that part's not that surprising the first part surprising I mean we were all making fun of each other I thought I thought it was a fairly even give and take but maybe not maybe it was a bit of a roast battle but you don't you only do that with people you like yeah exactly if you actually don't like somebody you don't just come out and start busting their balls that's not to be like to be fair the guy is like stupidly handsome I met him uh when I was in New York very very handsome guy so we got a [ __ ] on him yeah the worst part is you want to hate those guys but if they're nice it's almost worse he was very nice yeah the one thing that was really good is he's pretty prone to like taking a pretty like a cookie cutter response to things because he's like he's got like a good image he wants people to generally like him like he's you know he's on TV sometimes he's got his like book deal so he's like doing things where you know public perception kind of matters whereas if you're just an entrepreneur who owns some business like you don't need everybody to like you but for his things you know it's good when people like him it's good for business but he came on and he was like super honest super open about everything and was not giving us politician answers even though I do think he's a future president he wasn't doing that though so I thought you know mad props to him for uh for just being normal like like if we were normally hanging out that's how he was on the Pod it was perfect what do you want to start you want to start with some postmortem stuff you want to where do you want to go with this Andrew Andrew always sends us the best Topics in advance where we could just we could just pick and choose like what's this word mean and we could riff off that but Andrew I bet you have a sense of what you think the most interesting topic is so let's not bury the lead what do you think is the most interesting topic that you have when I started my business um I was like Mr business Builder like I'd say yes to absolutely everything I'd be in the shower and have the idea of like oh you know why doesn't this exist and then that day I would start it and I would just constantly be starting new businesses like every single month and I think it was really good because it was like throwing spaghetti against the wall right so it was like seeing what a good business model is via pain so it was just constant pain and then also running an agency you get to see all these startups make mistakes and learn from them and I had this really painful experience of starting an agency getting really really lucky that my first business was actually profitable because I think one of the things that happens is people start their first business and fail and then they just say I I don't like this entrepreneurship thing I'm out and so I was able to keep going and started another five to ten other businesses um and almost all of them felt like it was incredibly incredibly painful and after that I kind of swore off starting businesses and I've only just come back to it over the last three years so I can talk a little bit about my experience and some of those businesses Sam was texting me before and he's like well you start all these businesses you've like tweeted out all these businesses what actually happens to them so I was going to go through a couple of those and by the way for the for the listener this is Andrew Wilkinson you you're on he's on the Pod all the time owns this thing called tiny although are you guys do you want to go by tiny Capital now or just tiny just tiny I hate tiny Capital yeah I know you I I know you hated it but everyone was like using it but oh it's tiny which is I think one person called you online the Warren Buffett or Berkshire Hathaway of internet companies so you basically buy uh and hold a bunch of internet companies that collectively are now doing 100 North or hundreds of millions of dollars in Revenue whatever the number is that you say publicly how much did you pay your friend to say that about you I actually it it's really funny because there's been all these uh uh like on the cover of Newsweek or whatever it'll be like the next Warren Buffett and Sam bankman freed was one of those people and so everyone's sharing all these covers from all these things so being called the next Warren Buffett is not good uh I and I'm I'm different from Warren Buffett but I've copied a lot of his ideas well the next Steve Jobs that was Elizabeth Holmes from theranosa that was a another another one you didn't want to get tagged with I think chamoth was calling himself the the the new Warren Buffett or like the brown worn Buffett or something like that he called himself that he called himself uh or I don't know if you call I don't know I don't want to put Like the quote on it but he definitely insinuated it and he definitely said we're trying to build you know the next Berkshire Hathaway blah blah blah and so you know he he was given that or he named himself by the way my favorite thing about tremoth um was that in his annual shareholder letters he would uh he would compare himself to Berkshire Hathaway so he would track social capitals results versus Berkshire and then one year he just stopped and I think it was the one year that he didn't actually beat them I think I don't recall that might be unfair characterization but that's my recollection so where are you going with this you wanna do the post-mortem thing sure is that is that where you're going I don't know yeah let's do it we can go through a couple of those I think it's kind of interesting can you start with pixel Union I think that's incredibly interesting yeah so um was running metallab and I uh was like an early Tumblr user and I met David carp just via Tumblr like he was he was the CEO of Tumblr and he kind of knew all the early users and stuff and I ended up making a Tumblr theme that I wanted to use myself and he was like hey this is really really cool I would love it if you could create some more of these and we're going to make a premium marketplace where other people can pay to buy Tumblr themes and so I'm kind of thinking like oh this is a favor for a friend and this is a really small platform I'm not thinking of it as a business but I ended up going to a bunch of my designers and saying hey look you know over the weekend would you be able to whip up some themes and so I go to one of my interns like like literally a guy who was like my brother's friend who had like just finished like doing a I think a Philosophy degree and I was like Hey like turn this into whatever you you want and so we ended up calling it pixel Union and it started doing like ten thousand dollars a month of Revenue and it was my first taste of automatic Revenue like I would go to sleep and I'd wake up in the morning and we would have sold you know 500 bucks worth the worth of these Tumblr themes and uh Shopify noticed what we were doing for Tumblr and they said and at the time they were a tiny company there were about 15 people and they said hey can you guys also do the same thing for us and so we got into the theme World um for Shopify and Tumblr Tumblr obviously died post Yahoo acquisition and the business still exists today um it's a really interesting story actually so we so I I started incubated the business didn't raise any outside Capital spun it out of metal lab became its own independent company um we ended up selling it in 2014 and then I stayed on the board I kept 20 of it and then a couple years ago I bought it back and then we ended up taking it public and that became we Commerce what did you sell it for like 10 or 15 million dollars I think I read about it publicly I sold it for 7 million seven million dollars why would you sell that well at the time I was doing I think 500k of net profit and I didn't to be honest it was one of those things where I didn't know how good the business was and I hadn't read anything about investing yet and so I didn't know how to value a business and so it was a double-edged sword because I sold this incredible business for um you know a good amount of money it allowed me to kind of have a sense of comfort and retirement and all that kind of stuff but doing so I suddenly had this pile of cash and I had to learn how to invest it and so I started reading about Warren Buffett and reading all the investing books and going oh my God I can't believe I just sold that incredible business you know it was growing at 50 a year and you know I thought it was great to get a 14x multiple but not when it's growing that fast so I regretted it and then what did you guys pay for it when you bought it back so we bought it back for 26 million and then we um did a bunch of Acquisitions and then we took it public when you bought it how big was it when you bought it back uh I think it was doing about four million dollars of annual profit so it grown a lot um and we paid 26 and then we bought 460 and a couple other businesses and then we took it public at a 260 million dollar valuation and when you uh you said I didn't know anything about investing and blah blah at that time I think today people look at you as somebody who knows a lot about investing and they want to be like you when it comes to investing or buying businesses um what year was that when you said that state when you felt that way because I I'm guessing it wasn't like that long ago is that 10 years is that 12 it was eight years ago 2014. so that's basically eight years so less than a decade going from I feel like I know nothing about any of this to you know I don't know what you're like in the top percentile uh you know in our in our industry and have had phenomenal success I think that's just sort of a a nice thing it's like if you were willing to put in a decade um you can go from literally the bottom to the top and that's pretty cool yeah I think it was you know getting obsessed right I think that um when you there's no better feeling than you know picking up a book about something and just desperately reading it like you can't stop going through it and I spend probably two full years just reading every single book I could get on I could get about value investing um so yeah I think with intensive time you can do it and the nice thing is there's that great Buffett quote where he says I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor and I'm a best better investor because I'm a businessman and Chris and I we were natural investors within our own business we knew how to allocate Capital within the business to drive growth and profits and margins and all that kind of stuff so when we became investors we were much better at it I think because we did operational lens we could look at a business and say oh that's really hard or hey they're not doing these three easy things that we did at our company and I think one of the big problems with investors these days is they're often what I call spreadsheet investors they look at a business like a spreadsheet and they go oh it's easy we'll just increase margin by 20 percent not realizing that in order to do that you have to convince a hundred people to change um what uh let me back off that real quick so have you did Sam did we talk about this Warren Buffett Sees Candy letter I know I had it on our list I don't know if we ever did it on the Pod did we did we talk about this you it's been on your list you've never you've never brought it up so Andrew you're like a you know Warren Buffett PhD so you you probably know this but maybe not I had never seen this before so there was a letter in 1972 that Warren Buffett wrote to the CEO of C's candy after they had bought Sea's candies and um have you read this before if not I just put it in the in the chat because it's kind of amazing I want to talk about it this was this was very surprising to me so I put in the chat here in Riverside but um okay so I think of Warren Buffett as this like kind of like what I see today there's this guy who's super smart really like you know likable Storyteller he's an investor he's you know he doesn't look like an operator he's like a geezer right he's just sitting there and his at his table and he reads all day and you know he makes investment decisions he's a capital allocator but when you read this letter you realize like how detailed and in the weeds he was and how business savvy was so I actually want to read out parts of this real quick so that you know people who aren't reading it can dude this is this is terribly I mean sorry this is incredibly well written he's he's got such a good voice he goes dear Chuck uh I was at Brandy's a couple days ago and I have a few strong Impressions to pass along so he visited the store and here's here's his Impressions he goes uh people are going to be affected not only by how our candy tastes but obviously what they hear about it from others as well as the retailing environment in which it appears this means like the class of the store the method of packaging the condition it appears the surrounding merchandise just like the New Yorker creates a different editorial environment for Lord and Taylor ad than it does for Village Voice so do the surroundings of our candy affect the way that our potential customers mental and gastronomical impression of our quality you know of course you know of course you of course know this better than I right so that that was the first piece which he's basically talking about like you know the the store environment you know like the way that Apple you know sort of recreated the retail store he's already thinking about this and sending this like more like an operational and almost like it's like a design note right he's not talking about margin he's not talking about like you know debt he's talking about the the merchandising of the store and how it feels and how that's going to affect how people taste uh taste and stuff um then he goes and he talks about um uh let's see what's the next uh good bit so he's like number three yeah he goes that Brandy's our product suffers in comparative way against Stovers he goes they have extremely well organized well-displayed attractive area put uh featuring nothing but their candy um we've taken a number of our boxes put them on the counter with 25 other offerings offering cheap bulk candy and other run-of-the-mill products and they you know so he's talking he's basically comparing this the store design and then if you go down he goes um so he's talking about the merchandising for a while and then he goes um he's like we may well want to have a have descriptive material maybe our own little booklet called the most famous Kitchen in the world or something of that sort Coors gets a lot of mileage out of the fact that all their beer comes from One Brewery and I do think there's certain there's a certain Mystique attached to products from with a geographical uniqueness maybe grapes from a little part of Italy or France um are really the best in the world but I've always had a suspicion that 99 of it is just in the telling about it and one percent is in the drinking right so he's talking about like you know like sort of this marketing psychology about that you know giving them like ideas for catchphrases and slogans this is way more active and sort of like the brain switched on in terms of operating than I had thought uh what is this was a surprise for you too Andrew or is this something you knew about that's one of the things I found really inspiring about Buffett is everybody like to be honest my impression was always like okay entrepreneurs are the people that do the work the investors are people that shuffle paper around on Wall Street and what I realized with Buffett is that he actually was someone who yes he owned the businesses but he influenced the businesses massively and he made them grow and you know brought them together and did Acquisitions there's so many ways where he built value right which you can't say about a lot of people like BlackRock doesn't build value they just index they own a bunch of pieces of paper Warren Buffett actually grow stuff what's fascinating though and I'd be curious to know whether he would still write a letter like this is Chris and I had dinner with Charlie Munger a couple years ago and we asked him how involved do you get with the CEOs and he really said um I'll never forget this he goes I've never been able to change someone's mind if someone has an idea about something they want to do I've never been able to talk them out of it and so you know he said there's always opportunities within their businesses to tweak them and make changes and all that kind of stuff but it's just very hard to actually get CEOs to do stuff CEOs are not puppets they have their own brains and they want to do their own thing and you know two men with a hammer everything looks like a nail do you ever get bored just being an investor yeah very that's why he starts all those businesses yeah exactly dude it's so boring that's why I don't really do it it's so boring I told you it's like um it's like yeah it's like imagine if you know someone came along and was like Hey look you don't have to work and you can have all this free time and just read all day and it sounds like a luxury when you're a stressed out entrepreneur but actually doing it in practice you have to find new things to fill your time with and you don't get your hands on the tools right so you don't get the sense so like for example you know we bought Aeropress and when we first bought it I helped Drive the redesign of the website which you know I was proud of but I very quickly had to let go of it I knew I couldn't keep you know holding on to the business and so I you know we hired a CEO and I had to pass in the Baton and let go and yes I get a sense of like pride of ownership but as the business progresses I don't feel the lifts I don't feel the gains can we talk about that acquisition sure so the background here is Aeropress for like it's almost like a coffee snob product uh I I owned it I loved it it was basically like a more convenient French press that you could travel with I love it on their own I still own I own two of them I have one that I have one that I travel with and I have one that just stays in the cabin I use it every morning uh I love it but it was only sold I'm almost positive I would only see them in mom and pop coffee shops and maybe Amazon I don't even know if they were on Amazon but I like so the retail wasn't that great uh but like it was clearly like a good product it's one of those products that like consumers can buy for 20 bucks but even the coffee snobs are like this is the best way to do it uh and and you guys purchased it recently which it's not exactly an internet business but you're trying to make it a little bit more internet related but uh are you happy with this deal I know you guys paid it seemed like a lot of money you paid a premium for it absolutely I mean I think um when I look across all the businesses that we own and I think about what business could exist in 50 years there's a very very small number I mean most businesses die and I think that Aeropress is something that has um potential lasting impact and can be around for decades and it was just an incredibly unique business I mean when do you get the opportunity to buy a way of making coffee it's like how do you value buying Kleenex right the word for the way of making coffee that's written on Grinders and is a verb almost no I think it's sick man Sean did you see he bought this yeah I'm not a coffee guy like I literally don't drink coffee so even though I had heard of the brand it didn't I didn't know enough about it or didn't sort of didn't have too much of a you know opinion on it uh because it's not my thing but it does remind me of like I was looking at SodaStream and I was like I really love this type of this category of product I think it's a fantastic category where it's a thing that another device that gets in that can get into every kitchen and has like this sort of consumable you know refillable component to it so that's great and then if you become the de facto device like you said I think you just said like the verb basically like if you could become a verb I just read this recently with someone who's like you know I learned 25 years ago if something becomes a verb just invest and uh you know it's pretty true right Google it we'll Uber there you know like you you realize that these verbs tend to become like de facto winners of uh of their category and so I've definitely definitely uh think it's a good idea I just don't gonna drink coffee myself so it's the only business that I own that people like when I tell people and you know I you know if I'm in Tech and you say oh yeah we own dribble and they're a designer like they know what that is they think it's cool they might like give me a little nod or something like that but if you tell like I'll talk to you know uh the carpenter working in my house and say oh yeah I own Aeropress and if they know what it is they are passionate about it and they're excited about it and that is very rare so um it's a really good amazing business I remember reading uh about this in priceonomics the guy who created it he was like this you know now now he's quite quite old I think I think he's in his 80s and he was like an inventor he was like a wacky scientist inventor like stereotype guy where he also cre created like uh the Frisbee or like uh what was the Frisbee there you remember those commercials there was like we could throw this frisbee over a football field or something like that and he created all this amazing stuff and he just had owned Aeropress that he created but it he wasn't like a business guy wasn't he just wasn't this kind of just sitting uh kind of just like on autopilot I wouldn't say it was on autopilot he had a really great president who is running the business side but they were both older guys and they were really focused on the retail Channel which you can see there's a reason why if you walk into 95 percent of gourmet coffee shops anywhere in the world they sell Aeropress but when we looked at it just a very very small percentage of sales were online it just wasn't a focus for them so we came in and there's just a ton of best practices and Sean it's funny you mentioned SodaStream we actually hired the president of Sodastream us who grew the business to 200 million in the United States that's the new CEO of Aeropress so yeah I read about that person because I was researching SodaStream and I was like oh damn this person was like you know they they were I don't know the driver or the trigger of a lot of a lot of growth that happened for SodaStream because so didn't SodaStream sell a couple times um like it's owned by Pepsi now something like that I think it's owned by um what is it um oh my God I think it's it's an Israeli company I don't know if they've sold they might have sold to jab Holdings or someone like that yeah I think they have so yeah no no it's a Sodastream was acquired for 3 billion in 2018 by Pepsi but maybe now it's owned by somebody else I don't know there was some story like that where it kind of like flipped hands I thought um and I I was thinking that there should be like more competition for this like there's uh there's so many d2c Brands and I feel like the d2c so to stream competitor um should win I know there's a few of them out there but uh I'm surprised I don't hear about these more I'm surprised there's not 100 million you know a d2c SodaStream competitor that's doing you know north of 100 million in sales I feel like that's a like that should be a thing because SodaStream is very not D to C totally should we talk about some of the terrible businesses yes those are more fun so and then I want to talk about a new business I'm starting actually because I got yet another one because I'm a glutton for punishment um okay so some of the early stuff that I did so um I had the idea that um I had cats and I was like okay all cat furniture is hideous like it just ruins your house it looks horrible and so I went out and I found a couple like kind of mom and pop brands that were doing this and I said hey I'm going to start an online store for cat furniture called h.j Muse spent a whole bunch of money designing an e-commerce website and I um you know poured probably 300 Grand into it which at the time was a lot of money for me you know my whole business was maybe making 800 Grand of profit a year and I just learned how brutal a business e-commerce was that you know I was basically eking out these razor thin margins whereas in my agency or in pixel Union I was making 30 to 50 ebitda margins I was making like two or three percent and the amount of work required to move physical Goods around by inventory I realized that while on paper I was profitable I was constantly taking my profits and putting them into buying more inventory and so I ended up shutting that business down and losing I think I lost all the money I put into it but it was a great lesson in just hard businesses I didn't realize that different businesses were um harder than others right like you kind of just when you when you when you're inexperienced in business you stumble into these things and I always go like God I'm so lucky I didn't start a restaurant as my primary first business right because it's so brutal right it teaches you so much but it would be so easy to tap out and just think you don't like entrepreneurship a restaurant was my first business um and then he went into Ecom and then however you come you know The Road Less Traveled maybe uh so so what uh what are easy businesses that you've you started where you're like because I for me milk Road was a way easier business than any business I had ever started um what what's been an easy business for you and where does where does the where does agencies rank on the easy to hard scale I'd say it's medium I mean the hardest let's just say the hardest possible businesses are brick and mortar or where you have to move physical goods and you have a lot of employees so one of the hardest businesses I own is I own a bakery in Delhi in Victoria a BC where I live and I bought it because I my my brother had grown up working there it was a Neighborhood Place the owner wanted to sell and I've owned it for about five or six years and I mean they have to have about 40 or 50 employees someone has to wake up at two in the morning and go into the basement of the bakery and bake croissants and the amount of coordination that has to go right where if a couple people are sick how messed up the business can be is just night and day compared to any internet business dude if the if the if the manager of that Bakery bails are you gonna who's gonna go out and find a new manager I have I have a restaurant group like a food and Hospitality Group so I have a guy who runs that now before I was me I mean they would text me and say Andrew the deep fryer is broken I need an approval to buy a new one or whatever it is um so I've put people in place between there um in the medium Camp of challenge I would say agencies so agencies are beautiful in that they are asset light so really you don't even need an office these days but you really just need an office and internet connection and a keyboard and um you can hire generally the people as you need them and so you don't really need any investment um they're they're scalable um but they're hard in that you're constantly balancing supply and demand so metalab for example if metalab was to do all the work that came to it at any given time it could probably be five times bigger but in order for us to get five times bigger we would have to grow the company too fast and we would ruin the culture and so I would would say that agencies are a little bit like a law firm or an accounting firm or our consulting firm where you've got this kind of flat linear growth that happens over time so I think they're great businesses but there's feast or famine right and you really have to be prepared for a downturn and you need to be unfortunately ready to make radical changes in the business at the drop of a hat if your pipeline's not looking good and that kind of stuff so it's just very um very difficult in that way of course every agency owner I know wants to own a SAS software company and every SAS software company owner I want or that I know wants to own like a Consulting business or something that grows really fast so grass Always Greener the easiest business that I own is a company called wework remoli This is a job board that we bought from Jason freed and David heinemeyer Hansen at base camp they had started it and it was like the remote job board they had written a book about remote and they had great SEO they ended up ranking number one for remote jobs and as you know remote work has taken off over the last five years and so we bought that business from them and it really it was just kind of sitting idle and so with some very simple best practices and a very very small team we were able to build it into a very large business what about SAS where would you put you know SAS businesses that you've run uh well I've lost a lot of money doing SAS I mean I think a lot of people know the story of flow the project management software that I built where I basically poured 10 million dollars into it because I was competing with Asana and didn't understand the dynamic of when you're competing against uh you know you're fighting an army that has unlimited budget it's like Fiji fighting the United States right and I'm going like I'm gonna win this it's ridiculous and so I lost 10 million dollars uh doing that and that was a great lesson but um incredibly painful and I wish someone like me had tweeted and I could have read it instead of losing all that money how many agencies do you own right now um or partially owned probably own 10 10 or 12. there was um there was uh what's the guy's name who's the richest black guy in America Robert Smith I think his name uh Beast is it Vista Equity Vista Equity so basically Vista Equity is a PE firm that owns they're they're mainly SAS and I think if I remember correctly the article said that they own 200 million or sorry was it a hundred billion I whatever it was it was it was north of 100 billion of of SAS Revenue I think it was second only to Salesforce in terms of their reach and he had this uh thing where he was saying look on our companies we're actually only seeing a 20 decrease from where we thought we would be this year meaning like only a 20 um he's like we're growing at 20 a year we thought we were going to grow at 25 so we're seeing a small decrease in the growth that we expected therefore we actually are pretty bullish on the economy with your agency since you mostly sell to big companies like slack and whoever else you sell to are you seeing a Slowdown from American companies buying services yeah absolutely I think we're seeing softness over the next six months and things are definitely slowing down or if they're not slowing down people want to achieve the same things but for less money uh and so there's these pressures you know like I said is this supplier demand problem and you've got the labor market where people are demanding more and more pay and then you've got your clients crunching you down right so right now um you know I think that it's unclear so the other problem is it's really hazy and so you get into these situations like when covid hit we had a brutal three-month period where the pipeline dried up and then everything was fine it really depends on what the market sentiment is whereas if you own a SAS business what are the odds that someone's going to take especially a sticky one what are the odds they're going to rip it out of their company and retrain everyone on that and plus they're only being reminded they pay for it once a year right it's I always think it's better to have 10 000 people paying you a small amount of money than 100 people paying you a lot of money and what uh what's famous original so um I would say the theme for me is that I will often do the wrong business before I find the right business so for example um I started a I I always I'm a designer and I always fetishize the idea of having brick and mortar businesses I was so sick of doing all these internet things I wanted to sing in my own City and so I came up with this restaurant concept of like a bar and Pizzeria called famous original and me and some friends did it together and we basically learned the hard way that restaurants are brutal you know we were like super egotistical we're like oh we're great entrepreneurs we're gonna be able to nail it in restaurants and Sean is I I've definitely heard you talk about your experiences here uh and nodded along we just learned it was the most brutal business in the entire world and we're shocked by how much money we could lose and so we you know hired the wrong management we got the incentives wrong uh we overspent on the build out to the point where we could never get our money back you know labor shortages we had slippage there was there's tons of issues but what I learned from that was what is a badly run garbage restaurant look like and then when the deli and bakery came up I was like oh oh this is a good one like this has been around for 25 years stable earnings great general manager what type of food we just let it run uh Pizza you could screw up a pizza place I would have thought that had been one of the easier places to easier of the heart yeah because like you don't need it's like pretty simple ingredients uh I I wouldn't have thought you were going to ruin that one now we managed to do it [Music] first cut HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better you have a couple on this list you got things you did in the past you have things new businesses you're doing now but I'm curious do you have I guess like we haven't talked to you in a while have you have you had any ideas for businesses that you're not starting currently but you're like someone could do that or someone should do that or I wish someone is you know gonna capitalize on this opportunity or trend is there anything that that comes to mind uh for ideas that you're not currently acting on so I might have talked about this idea in the past but I've had this idea for a long time um I like the idea of a service that allows you to get on one person's radar right so I choose let's say that I let's say I want to sell my company in the next two years and I think the right buyer is this you know this x let's say HubSpot right I want to Target darmesh so everywhere darmesh goes on the internet I want him to see stuff about my company and I want him to think we're huge there's I forget where the quote comes from but there's this idea that if someone sees you five times they think you're everywhere so if you're on five podcasts they listen to they deem you a huge celebrity and a success or whatever it is right so I think I want that but hyper targeted and I think it's worth a lot of money so I would pay ten thousand dollars a month to be on darmesh's radar everywhere he goes and so I don't know how it gets done it's like a advertising sniper rifle essentially but I really like the idea of something like that so I have a story about this so my best friend his name is Jack Smith he sold his company called vungle for 800 million dollars right before the pandemic when he was like 29 years old the way that he started it was he uh was in England living in England as a college student and he had this idea and he wanted to go to a accelerator called what was it called Sean do you remember Angel pad Angel pad and the guy who run it run ran it was his name Thomas and Jack missed the deadline to join the incubator and so what he noticed on LinkedIn he goes let's advertise just to Thomas and he said uh on LinkedIn the way it worked is you could advertise to like it said like only show this to people uh like 100 people a day and he's like wow you can go to 100 people a day what if I just moved it to like 10 people a day and they allowed in him to and it says all right only show this to 10 people a day but make it so they have to work in San Francisco and they have to work at Angel pad and the ad said hi we're trying to reach Thomas please tell us to contact us and he did that and it worked and they led him into the incubator and six or seven years later the company sold for 800 million dollars and we at the hustle wrote an article about this it went viral and Linkedin changed how they did it you can't actually advertise they won't tell you how many people you're going to reach per day or something like that totally something like that would be amazing or even just figuring out like okay what let's let's just do this so so I get darmesh's email and I run it through some sort of database and I go what email newsletters does he subscribe to or what podcast like how do you I don't know if it's possible but what is his information diet and then how do I appear and all those things that's crazy yes I think that would work wonderfully yeah I would love it if someone wants to start that business please email me because I think it's a great idea um but yeah there's I'm mean again like I come up with tons of ideas but that one has stuck with me for three years so I feel like it's something good yeah what could go wrong just uh targeting somebody wherever they go everywhere they look what can go wrong here um okay she's buying a billboard by his house so that's one uh what about some other ones I know you got more Let me let me talk about the new thing that we're doing so and this has been something that's been driving me crazy forever so you guys know what investment bankers are yeah I know a lot of people call themselves that yeah right but a lot of people kind of go like oh that's like a stock broker or you know they work at a bit confusing investment bankers are realtors for businesses they go and they represent you and they sell your business for you or they raise capital for you and I didn't really understand that world at all um so like I like I said earlier I have only understood Finance for eight years and I would say really only over the last two or three years have I actually tapped the world of Finance like gotten proper banking credit learned how to sell businesses learned how to use the investment bankers but I think those that stuff is not really accessible to Founders and frankly they don't speak the language of investment bankers the investment bankers are the spreadsheet business people right they look at your business as a spreadsheet and they want something that's simple and easy to understand and frankly like I was kind of allergic to them because I didn't speak their language they would come and talk to me and they would use terms like ebitda and you know gross margin and all these things I didn't really think about as a founder and so I have been looking for a firm for years um that I can use to either sell small businesses when I say small I mean like kind of one to five million dollars of ebitda or help Founders do secondaries or all these sorts of things or even just Finance M A and I'm yet to find someone everyone seems to specialize in larger businesses or they're too small and so um last year Chris and I met this young investment banker and he was just a normal person like we had him out for lunch and he was not wearing a suit and he was saying how miserable he was and how much he hated you know his his old job doing it and we we kept saying like look like you should quit your job and come work with us and we'll start a modern Investment Bank for Founders really focused on bootstrap Founders because they don't know how to access capital and so we we're starting this business called Tenzing we started like a month ago and the idea is Tenzing Norgay is the most famous Sherpa of all time so he helped Edmund Hillary climb Mount Everest um and so basically the idea is um you can go to him and say look what are all my options right I you know can I get credit from the bank uh can I raise debt to do M A can I do a secondary can I sell my business and they can basically walk you through all of that stuff in a way that's aligned and not fee driven and more long-term Focus so we're basically starting our own little Investment Bank is that going to work dude because if you are if you're if you're a startup and you're in the if you use the word bake right now I hate you no it's not I mean it's not they're not taking any money I I mean I could just call it business we're starting a business realtor firm but the term is Investment Bank there's no banking we're not holding anyone's money uh there's no tokens I'm not going to Argentina yeah do you like billions of dollars or not I think like I don't know if you guys have experienced this but like even here in Canada so um for like five years I wasn't aware of this but the government will actually pay 30 of your r d when you're a small company and I just didn't know about that and so I literally lit a million dollars on fire I could have gotten a million dollars of these tax credits and I didn't right I could have used a credit line to buy ads for my SAS business but I didn't know how to do that um I could have sold businesses that were working but I didn't really want that just kind of died like I let them die right so I think it's about like how do you get how do you get the most out of what you have um and giving people tools to do that and it's just I wish this had existed when I was starting out yeah I I totally agree you know most uh investment bankers don't work with startups um because they're too small or the deals are too small or whatever so how are you going to get it to how do you get how are you going to get the numbers to work because I don't think they're doing it because they discriminate I think they're doing it because the money's not there for them so how do you make that work well it's not small businesses right I mean like we're really focused on bootstrap businesses because that's where we come from and these are companies that are doing you know two three million dollars maybe 500k of profit some of them are actually bigger so we've talked to Founders that are like hey I've got like a you know 10 million ARR business I'm doing three million dollars of profit I was thinking I want to sell 30 of my business and we kind of go okay well we have the network we've gone and you know raised all these funds and met all the people in finance let's connect the dots between these people and be the financial translators once I just linked you guys to the website it's tenzing.com but you can kind of see what we're doing what's been the biggest oh dude I thought you said you hated these Graphics you have the graphics of like the people with like the funny arms and funny fingers uh if I remember correctly you tweet it out if you see another page like this you're gonna kill yourself or something like that no no it was the um the like weird Russian looking ones that Dropbox was using for a while they were like so weird and depressing what uh what oh dude I know you I know these folks I've met Rob before Rob is in our world I don't that's funny it's such a circle jerk world that we live in do you just like you just collect people on Twitter is what you do Rob actually lives in Victoria so I've known him for a long time he runs uh outweigh the sock business that's right I just launched a custom they just launched a custom sock business you guys should get some MFM socks made we did we're I've gotten them for this other thing but what uh what's been the biggest business that you've sold so far was it the uh Fitness thing or the meal plan thing yeah yeah we bought a business called me lime um and we sold it to Albertsons I thought you started it no we bought it so um there was a guy um up in Nanaimo who's a developer and um he uh started this business with two co-founders and his two co-founders after the first year didn't want to be in the business anymore and so we they owned 70 we came in we bought them out and Mitch the founder was basically like look guys like I'm already growing this business I know exactly what I want to do just leave me alone like we tried to write the Warren Buffett letter and say like oh you should do this on growth or whatever any bisc you just said leave me alone and so he said okay fine we'll leave you completely alone and a couple years later uh Albertsons came and they bought it for tens of millions of dollars and it was a great deal for everyone and uh yeah it worked out really well do you think that in the future you're gonna sell anything are you just gonna keep on buying and keep on holding you don't want to sell do you no I don't like selling and I think that um it's really hard to predict what's going to end up being large and how large it can be and then um also if you think about it like if you have a business and it's dying it's hard to predict how quickly it will die and how much profit will come out of it and usually when a business is dying you can't sell it for much right let's say the business is on a major downslope you might get like one times profit and so you're basically making a bet that it's gonna die before a year which very few businesses die that quickly and so usually it's better off just to hold forever I've found um you know you will see like Warren Buffett sold off his newspapers I think that was partly because the writing was on the wall but also because it's like unions and a lot of complexity and they wanted to get out of that um but no I mean I I don't ever want to sell businesses that's something the only reason we sold me lime was because Mitch wanted to sell the business he came to us and said I want this exit and we weren't gonna hold him back because he was the founder we um we just did this thing on the FTX Saga and I know that you like have historically been I don't know if you call yourself anti-crypto but you're definitely not pro crypto and you're for sure not pro nfts and all that other [ __ ] of which I agree with you what what's been your take so far in watching all this drama um I think it's really really bad for crypto I think that you know Sam bankman freed is somebody who I certainly had thought oh maybe this is one of the good guys and I'd seen him uh do the podcast circuit um and he seemed like a smart guy and I think that when the number two you know if you think about these like Banks it's like that's the equivalent of like JP Morgan going out of business just suddenly and everyone losing their money um so I think it probably has a lasting negative effect on crypto and Trust um and it's been fascinating watching the price of crypto not react the way you would think where you know inflation you'd think would drive the price of Bitcoin up it doesn't appear to have done that um to be honest I'm not I was saying this to a friend of mine I think I've probably said it on the show before but if you came to me and you said hey I think British pound sterling I'm super bullish on them because XYZ macro event was happening I would just say why are you currency trading you're a tech entrepreneur and I think that Bitcoin is currency trading right like just buy great businesses do the thing you know and I think everyone is just speculating on this stuff and there's a ton of fascinating Arguments for it and I follow it but I have just fully steered clear and I'm sure that we'll invest in a crypto business at some point but for now I'm just waiting for it to play out more um one important reminder is if you if you missed Amazon you had until 2010 to invest in it there's a lot of time to wait and sit and watch to find these great businesses uh two things one uh that thing you just said reminds me of something Kevin Trump told us once he goes um we go what you know you've been trading for 20 plus years uh you know what are the biggest lessons or something like that and I asked him some some stupid question like that and he goes well well you know there's no less of blah blah then he goes one thing there's always a second chance on the train it goes even when it's a winner even when it's a good thing you'll always get a second chance on the train and um you know so so that sort of takes away a lot of the fomo when you realize that that you know there you do get these second opportunities you know it happened with Amazon it happened with Facebook it happened with many many businesses where even if you weren't early and correct um these things go up and down now the hard part is uh it's when they go down that you have the least conviction so it could be that that right now is the right time you know now might be the second time to get on that train because prices are down but now is when people are the most scared and the most hesitant to act on if you were hesitant before you probably triple hesitant now and so I think that's the hard part for to try to get back on the train when uh when there is a dip uh the second thing is we talked about red flags and fraud I think on the last time you're on here we talked about people who were lying or our partners who had screwed you uh with the FTX thing did you hear of anything or was there anything red flaggy that you had heard either along the way or once it started to come out that you're like oh that sounds pretty bad actually that's that was a bit of a tell now either in hindsight no I mean I like you guys um I I am I just haven't fall I I guess I hadn't followed it super closely and I hadn't really spent a lot of time on that particular business um I was quite shocked that he was known for risk management and he had been talking you know was very assertive about talking about the security of the balance sheet and it seems like there's a lot of uh loans going on between related party businesses where he's bailing out his own business and stuff so very sketchy what I find fascinating is is this a bad actor right is he a psychopath who's building a Ponzi scheme or is he just somebody who got in over his head and used Too Much leverage uh and messed up and I I don't really have an assessment of that yet and to be honest I'm not following it super closely I'm kind of waiting to read the book I find like waiting for this stuff to all blow up and wait four months for like you know the Atlantic or New Yorker or someone to write like an amazing piece on it is always more interesting than following the day-to-day my favorite uh Twitter feed autism Capital who's been covering this whole story has said that Michael Lewis the guy who wrote The Big Short has been like embedded with him for the past six months writing a book and that he's still involved and so I have a feeling good it was meant to be like The Blind Side it was meant to be this like you know uh this like rag you know sort of like this was you know Wonder blind side style story what's that you said it's supposed to be like The Blind Side yeah like a positive story right big short was basically like here's you know this thing that was you know destined to fail I think he was following him not thinking FTX is destined to fail but thinking you know these are the challengers you know and look at look at the crazy craziness that's going on but like not I don't think he was following him and I don't think SBF let him in because Michael Lewis was thinking it's just a matter of time until this blows up and this will be the big fraud in the big Scandal like just like the big short part two um you know so so I think that that's the interesting part it's like well here's your here's your surprise twist ending uh that you got here I will say there's this one guy Jason Choi that wrote a Twitter thread that is the best Andrew if you want to read the equivalent of the book or the the New Yorker piece like I wouldn't wait for them because a the New York Times put out a piece on on SBF That was supposed to be the um you know the sort of like the recap and it was like incredibly soft on him it was sort of just made him out to seem like a good guy and um you know oh some bad things have happened to happen and this guy Jason Troy wrote out this Twitter thread that's very clear and it has all of the evidence in a timeline that we know so far and it is uh it's pretty compelling you should check that one out have you guys pulled it up have you guys ever come have you guys ever had contact with someone who's now famous fraud I've I've never I've like never met someone who like was a blatant liar uh about things that like kind of became well known I've told the story about the guy I worked with the king of coal in Indonesia who ended up in jail and passed away in jail and but he wasn't a fraud was he he was just a criminal I mean he did better like he he like like well no no no it's way different it's like uh uh someone you know who's like like what do you do for a living well I [ __ ] rob people versus Like Bernie Madoff who's like why I run a bank you know people who still tend to lie um and and you know so I think that yeah this guy was bribing people but it wasn't just let's say bribery you know there was obviously gonna be other things in an organization in an organization like that where you're if your primary agenda is to make as much money as possible as quickly as possible and you have great success doing it um but you're not doing a ton of the value creation yourself you know there's there's often a um you know both there's often both going on and you know I I was able to see a little bit of it what I what I saw mostly was just the sort of like the the fact that okay I guess that's the way you do business in these countries you kind of got to grease the the the guy in the middle and that's how you get the thing uh you know the sort of bribery corruption is very common in India and Indonesia in a bunch of different places and so that part was known it was an Open Secret um but I'm you know it's not like if you had if you'd ask me at that point in time is there anything else going on I wouldn't have been able to tell you anything specific but I would have bet a lot of money that there was something else going on and it's part of the reason why I wanted to leave eventually so so I am most of the frauds that I've met have always been small time so it'll be like I meet someone and I ask around about them and someone's like hey like you know they've gone through the city and got like ten thousand dollars from all these investors and like defrauded them but it's small time enough that they get away with it um Charlie Munger calls them the rats and The Granary you can't really do anything about them because they're too small they're always going to be there and if you uh you know you Hammer them once they're just gonna come back in some other form um I met a guy um this is a bigger one so um in in the Canadian stock market there's tons of Fraud and there's very little enforcement and um often what you'll see is something will get hot so like you know oh uh vertical farming is hot so they'll find some you know guy with like five employees who has a vertical farming business and some investment banker in the public market will say hey let's dress this up as the next great thing and then what they do is they dump it to retail investors so they go to Mom and Pop and the investment banker calls them and says hey I've got this amazing deal we're going to IPO it it's going to pop whatever and they hand the candy out and often what ends up happening is you know as the trend goes so you know as marijuana stocks or fake meat or cubic farming or whatever it is it pops and then it drops and what happens is the investment bankers often make a killing because they get paid in warrants and they get paid a percentage of the money they raise so if they raise 100 million dollars they might get paid five million dollars plus warrants and if it pops maybe those warrants end up being worth 10 million dollars and this is all legal this is totally legal and so it's basically legal stealing right so they go out they raise all the money from a bunch of you know grandmas and doctors and normal people stock pops they sell and then it goes to zero and all the employees get laid off and the company goes bankrupt or it's kind of a shell of its former self um and I met a guy at a party um you know last uh last summer and he was bragging to me about this IPO that he had done and how much money he made and I started digging into it and it was literally a the equivalent of taking a corner store public this was like a two location business and he dressed it up to match a trend how much did they make probably made I don't know I could probably do the math but it's I would argue probably five to five to twenty million dollars doing this and you know he's bragging about it and the stock is down I think to like 10 cents or something right it just it turned into nothing and so it's crazy because it's literally legal it's legal stealing right like everything he did is technically legal they do all the right documents when they take it public they disclose all the details they just write it in the right way and it doesn't hurt his reputation because he's behind the scenes and like you know no one knows and lots of people flip the stock too right so many of his early investors probably just sold when it peaked out to oh you know what are called bag holders in in the industry and then those people lost all their money and so it's they hurt let's say 10 000 people in a very small way and so it's just not the sort of thing that gets a lot of attention from Regulators so I find that kind of gross and crazy and there's a ton of that up here in Canada so I uh tweeted this out let's see when was this this was basically last year February 2021 and I said esport Investments are a joke there's so much dumb money in the space look at this billion dollar publicly traded company in Canada and Esports is another one of those like kind of hot industries that that you're talking about and the ticker is eglx so I showed this graph and I was basically like look at this thing it's trading at 8.59 so I said um you know it's basically it's a whole Co of random assets it's got like a website for The Sims they own a minority stake and the OverWatch team of Vancouver um it's not necessarily a bad company but it's definitely not a billion dollar company and so it's like here's some of the things that they bought they bought Luminosity the team uh the Esports team they bought it for 1.5 million in cash 7 million in stock what's the company called again I want to look it up I'll tell you in a second because the the prediction came true here's the spoiler so uh eglx is the ticker so it was 8.59 when I wrote this it is now trading at what 83.84 oh my gosh so yeah what's the market cap so it's down 90 uh since I wrote this thing uh 126 million how does it even have 126 million it's not worth 100 spoiler it's gonna go down another 90 from here it's my guess uh not to pick on these guys but just like there's a lot of this happening I met uh other people you know who are doing the same thing and it seems to happen on these small exchanges in Canada and stuff like that um so they bought Luminosity for a million million and a half in cash seven and a half million stock they bought some agencies for 13 million in stats cash some more stock and uh they started trading on the TSX and then they were up for 4X in a year and it's basically an ad agency and then they own you know a couple Niche websites um and like you know if you add in all of the things that they bought you know they did 30 million in Revenue with 50 million expenses you know they lost 20 million dollars this year and they called themselves a uh you know billion dollar company and so you know like I said people want to invest in a rocket ship this is a sparkler they have 8 million of cash left in the bank it looks like they're gonna need to raise more money if they want to keep this going and so uh you know I didn't even remember that until you just said this thing you said I was like I think I saw some [ __ ] esport thing in Canada and sure enough this was it yeah there's endless numbers of these I mean it happens in the states too you guys saw Nikola where you know even the name you're like okay Tesla Nikola Tesla like you're just trying to grab onto this trend and they you know basically faked that they had this um uh what is it I forget hydrogen powered um electric semi truck and it turned out they were just rolling it down the hill and turning the camera so it looked like it was driving on a flat surface um complete fraud complete fraud like commercial yes I'll link you guys to um so there's this amazing guy named Nate Anderson he has a short selling uh hedge fund called Hindenburg research and he writes these amazing research reports where he takes down these companies and it's just facts right it's like all he does is just basic diligence and he'll find like oh like it turns out Trevor Milton the guy who is the CEO of Nicola was accused of all these crimes and if you just do basic research on this guy AI obviously this guy is a fraud and he'll write these amazing research reports um here I'll send you guys one no this guy his his stuff was good he's he uh I mean he's a short seller so obviously he's gonna be a hater but his stuff is usually well researched and fun to read yeah I mean I think there's I there's crappy short sellers who are gonna you know make stuff up or you know hint at stuff and then there's short sellers that are basically journalists that just share what's going on do you guys do you guys remember bird Sean do you remember bird in San Francisco scooter company okay so scooter company that I don't remember how much they raised but I believe it was a 2.5 billion dollar evaluation and I bet they've raised north of four or five hundred yeah I think I think they've raised over a billion dollars let me see they've they raised over a billion dollars yeah they're they've raised more than it's currently worth and I think it's currently so listen to this listen to this Google what it's worth right now so they took it public at a three billion dollar valuation I think it's currently trading right now at 70 million dollars 70. okay they raised 883 million is that crazy this company is is the market cap is 73 I think million bucks wait which company bird bird scooters do you guys think they have to have at least 70 million of scooters well and how much secondary how much secondary did the founders see which I I don't I can't blame them to be honest I don't blame them it was so hot but still but I but I don't know how much he took but I always like stick with like the best way to figure out uh you know how wealthy someone is is by looking at how expensive their home is because it's kind of hard to like get a fake mortgage that way uh and Travis the guy who founded it if you Google his name and like house you'll see like you know uh Tech entrepreneurs selling 10 million dollar home in Santa Monica or Tech entrepreneur buying 20 million dollar home in Miami so he's he bought he's I think he's bought two houses that are worth tens of millions of dollars so he's definitely they're selling I've got a really quick thing if we have time yeah so um do you guys remember I did this thing called a non-binary term sheet a couple years ago yeah so you're you're on that non-binary train before everyone else was dude exactly exactly so so I've always found I've always found Venture really tricky right because someone will come to you and they'll say um you know I am going to revolutionize XYZ industry and I'm going to create a billion dollar business and I always say okay well if you don't create the billion dollar business then I lose all my money right and to me that a it sucks for the founder because if they um you know get a bunch of money at a valuation that's too high they can never make their investors happy and it sucks for the investor because it's binary either they lose all their money or uh or it goes and so when I was raising money for supercast a couple years ago I wanted to get what the market rate was for valuation but I also wanted it to be fair because for me I didn't want to feel like [ __ ] if the business didn't pan out I knew that if the business didn't pan out to be a huge business it could actually be a good smaller business and so we raised it a 10 million dollar valuation which at the time was kind of a good um you know angel angel round valuation but it was structured so that within two years if the business doesn't do a million dollars of Revenue that turns into a five million valuation and so it ended up we we did uh close to a million dollars but we didn't hit it and so I crammed myself down by 50 to make it fair now I know a lot of Founders wouldn't want to do this because why would you do this um you know other than to be a Boy Scout and you know have a sense of fairness if no one else is doing it and if VCS expect this but I think it's a really interesting structure and we've been offering it to more and more Founders as the environment changes where we say look we'll invest but it has to be structured so that if you don't deliver on what you say you're gonna do we can still get our money back what do you guys think about that I I don't love it for two reasons one is what you just said which is like why would a Founder do it uh like if I think about it from the Founder's perspective if I don't have to do that I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do that right like traditional Venture would just be a better deal for me as a as a Founder in that case um and the other thing is I think it creates weird incentives like um I like the concept behind it like I like the spirit of it but then I'm like okay who's gonna set these benchmarks and then what happens when the thousand different things can happen in a business and like you you said it yourself like we got close but we didn't get there and then there's like this crazy urge to like do something to nudge it over the top and now you're doing something that may not be long term um you know right for the business and so you create some weird Dynamics I wouldn't say it's worse Dynamics than it currently exist um it's just more like if I'm the founder I would rather um already and I also think I'd rather take the Venture path where I'm getting a higher valuation and selling less of my business I would also say there is a sort of like we're going for it or we're not like you would if you're running a pro like my eCommerce business we run to maximize ebitda like yes we want to grow it but it's like this thing needs to make profits every year whereas one of you did Venture things it was like we don't think about that we think about you know how are we going to grow users let alone Revenue let forget about profits altogether and so there is like sort of like a there is a benefit in knowing which path which blueprint of business you're trying to build and then being able to go all in on a strategy that's aligned with that versus a strategy where you're hedging but you're like maybe we should yeah sorry go ahead but Andrew the my whole like I see all these I think there's this like I've seen this like this thing called the like hustle fun and all a few other funds and they're like we're trying to do things differently in my opinion on that is why like the game isn't broken the game works as it should the the thing that's broken is people who are joining and playing the game and they maybe shouldn't be playing the game but it works perfectly fine like we are getting our desired example Sam of where that's not true necessarily there are certain businesses that are good businesses but they're not good Venture businesses um and then they have they have a lack of access to Capital so I forgot the guy's name I feel bad now he's kind of like it's kind of like an ndvc thing they're doing they created Tyler is it Tyler that what's it called the seal agreement or this something like that they have like some new type of dock that's like the nine not non-binary term but that's not but that's not VC right I mean you would consider that's almost like PE that's a different category yeah but I guess what I'm saying is it's a funding it's a funding option it's a it's an alternative funding option for a technology business right right that's what I'm saying it's alternative to VC what I'm saying is Venture Capital as we know it I think it works perfectly fine like it's the the way it's supposed to work is uh some get it uh most don't the and the some that do get it most fail and very few become huge life-changing things and don't but don't you think like okay so Sean let's say that you got really bullish about your e-commerce concept and you'd raise 10 million dollars like let's say like in the age of Casper when e-commerce is super hot and d2c is crazy and the valuations are high and you go out and you raise 10 million dollars and now you're stuck where you're going you know what I really want is to Pivot this into a lifestyle business because that's what's logical for what you want and imagine if there's a structure where you didn't have to feel like a piece of [ __ ] because you can never get your investors money back right and what I've seen is the incentive creates this situation where the founder is sitting on a business that could make them happy and give them a great lifestyle but they have a gun to their head and so they continue down the Venture path even when it's actually futile and won't work and they drive the business into the ground so it's worse for the employees it's worse for the founders it's worse for the investors as well because the investors just go to zero instead of at least making a reasonable return so and it is kind of like private Equity but you gotta remember private Equity doesn't take risk on what could be right private equity invests in what is they will say your business does 10 million dollars ebitda I'm going to assume it's going to be 11 12 13 14 not Venture which is your business does 200k revenue you're assuming you're going to get to 2 and then 20 over the next three years right right so it's a different form of capital in my opinion but isn't the problem like let's say I take that 10 million and I take it where I sell let's just say 10 of the company in that round and what you're saying is that in the event that things don't grow as fast two years now from now um that 10 becomes thirty percent for the same 10 million dollars it becomes whatever it just yeah numbers like that totally so um but isn't the problem that they probably have burned the 10 million along the way trying to get the thing to grow hiring people marketing whatever else they're going to do and now they still need money now they have all these people so you're gonna have basically like a combination of things it's like we're gonna have to lay off a bunch of people probably as we shift strategies to more of the lifestyle type of business to be more profitable we're gonna ratchet up those investors who go from 10 to 30 percent the 10 million is gone so I still need money to run the thing most likely I need to maybe raise additional Capital so I'm going to raise more money but on those lower terms dilute everybody it just becomes kind of like I have this like it's a sad rainy day now or am I thinking about it I think I just fundamentally have a problem with Founders who raise money at a very very high valuation with the knowledge especially from people who are not VCS right so you know you've seen a lot of this um there's lots of people in our world who have raised very like on businesses that you know we've looked at and would value it like maybe five or ten million dollars and they've gone on crowdfunding platforms or something can you give an example tons of money no but there's lots of people and there's I'm not singling anyone out literally there's like 10 or 20 examples I can think of and frankly it's like it's opportunistic I get it you know you want to raise on great terms but I have a fundamental problem with taking money from someone when I know I can't give them a return or there's like a five percent chance and positioning it as you know you're investing in this super solid awesome thing that's going to be huge or as cash flowing or whatever and you're basically just taking someone from it's like going to someone in real estate and selling them on your Tech startup that we would all know as a bag of garbage but because they're in real estate they go oh this looks great yeah I actually I I agree with you 100 and I I really really dislike that I tweeted something out that I want to get you guys this is a reaction to so I tweeted something that kind of uh I don't know Ruffles some feathers I guess so I go like a one lesson uh let me pull it up exactly yeah I like this one I don't say it wrong but um I don't understand how this ruffled feathers but go ahead I go this year I learned there is no quote smart money Andreessen Sequoia tiger tribe kotu SoftBank Paradigm Alameda FTX they all made terrible financial decisions at huge size and yet most will get richer they play a rigged game uh chamoth made money off of a bunch of his shitty spacks because he's the promoter and these funds manage billions of dollars and they'll make hundreds of millions in fees along the way as a reward even if they lose their investors money um they don't invest they didn't these aren't just companies that they invest in that start to underperform these are huge bets on fundamentally flawed assets it's crazy but the lesson for me remember to think for myself don't use the justification that the big name is investing as any sort of signal and remember that the smart money is just as dumb as me so I tweeted this out I did it really fast I probably should have worded it differently but a bunch of people from these firms didn't really like what I was saying I think do they DM you or comment DM uh come on the courage to comment and get into a tiff about this no way there's no way they're gonna they're gonna take that chance um you know what and I think the the I think part of it is I worded it poorly I think they thought I was saying these people who are supposed to be smart are dumb and evil and I think it's because I said like you know they play a rigged game I stole that from christaka who was a VC he goes venture capital is a rig game you make money on the fees regardless of whether you get returns or not and then you get their carry on the returns to uh down the road seven to ten years later before you know before anyone figures out if you're any good at this or not um but you know I think they people thought I was calling them dumb and evil and actually no I think they're very smart my point was actually that even the very smart people are doing some really dumb things because it's a really hard game and um and I gotta remember to like you know not use their conviction in something to override my own either cluelessness or lack of conviction in something and be like yeah this is a good this is I guess it's a good idea these guys are doing it I guess I should put money in these guys are doing like the fomo investing uh style you know I got burned on it I think this is one of the dirtiest things in our industry so um you know if you're in private Equity or you run a hedge fund you know if you're an idiot or a genius in months or years right when you're playing Venture you can take 10 to 15 years to see what a fund really does and yeah there's markups and all this other stuff but at the end of the day to see realized gains takes a very very long time and so what you'll see is you know someone raises 100 million and then 500 million and then a billion and on a billion they're getting a two percent management fee so they're getting 20 million dollars a year and let's think about what are the costs to run a venture capital firm you've got someone as a custodian managing your fund you could if you wanted probably have three or four employees I know benchmark manages three billion plus with like 12 or 15 people so these are not expensive businesses to operate and I think that um they make money guaranteed every year and by the time that investors realize that over a 10 in your period they've underperformed they've already made hundreds of millions of dollars it's just absurd for taking very limited risk themselves and they win no matter what and so I think this is something that will go away in the long term and I'm frankly shocked that when you raise a venture fund you don't have to say this is my budget I'm going to hire three Associates and my salary is this that's all I'm charging you in fees instead they get this thing where it's like you get 20 million dollars of fees and if you spend two million dollars a year on the office you make 18 million dollars a year it's total hustle um and this is why like our ruling fund and our private fund we don't cover we don't do any management fees whatsoever because I'm allergic to this I find it really gross yeah that is crazy two years of my fund I took zero management fees and then as I hired people then I added the fund but also my font is so small that two percent management fee of my fund is 200 000 a year it's less than what I'm paying people to doing it I am I am taking a loss on my on the salaries uh you know with that manager fee but two percent of a billion dollars every single year is 200 million dollars over the life of that fund that you got as risk-free reward which is insane and so and then you know the other point I was trying to make was that like there are times when you bet on something that's a business that's doing really well a really healthy business that hey you know it didn't achieve the maybe it didn't get as far as we thought it would so it was a 2X instead of a 20x or the something in the market dynamics changed a competitor or regulation or the economy slow down and then they slow down and they they didn't end up you know achieving the dream that they had versus like the investors invest in FTX if you're putting like like Paradigm Paradigm is the number one like you know crypto VC crypto focused VC and they put 290 million dollars into FTX right 300 million dollar bet um and they came out the other day they go we are writing our investment down to zero um we want to assure you that this was a small portion of our overall funds and we had no idea what was going on uh like we didn't know about this and you you think about it you're like first of all the fact that a 300 million dollar bet is a small portion of your overall thing like that's true I'm not saying that that's not true because you have a three billion or whatever fund but man when people when when an outsider reads that ft uh that Paradigm puts 300 million to FDX they assume a couple things FTX is probably a good business and that Paradigm the smartest guys in the room are probably doing diligence to say hey is this guy literally funneling customer money into his like his own trade hedge fund and like going and gambling with that money or not right like you would hope that somebody's doing the diligence and so um you know I think that that's that's the case not to pick on Paradigm I still think these guys are really smart um it just sort of shows in general that the amount of diligence you would assume happens on large bet sizes like that is actually uh you know nowhere near what it what it could or probably should be and secondly like you have people like um like chamoth when he was doing his back for Metro Mile right like you know we've named basically a couple businesses that all in pod I think these guys are super awesome I love the podcast uh they're super smart and successful that's there's no no doubt about that but you talked about bird you know David Sachs was the lead investor I think it bird for like multiple rounds uh if I'm not mistaken and um you know bird now is a 70 million dollar company but you know these guys cashed out at the IPO probably you know over a billion dollars and you know you know there you go you're done uh these guys were months ago laughing about Solana and how they you know just received all the Solana at the super low price they can't wait to dump it and um and you know now they're you know finger pointing at other people in crypto for doing the same that for doing the same thing but not acknowledging it or you know chamat took uh friedberg's company Metro mile public through Speck and said Buffett had Geico I have Metro mile A Better Business in all these ways and like I don't know less than a year later Metro mile sells for a third of what it went public for um you know it's a lemonade and so you you know you see the stuff you think are these people lying though I don't think that they're lying it's just that investing in business is a really really hard game and even the smartest people in the room are making really dumb things really making really dumb decisions or dumb bets um and in some cases they have unfair advantages that you don't have so it was a reminder to myself and to many other people out there who don't have those unfair advantages that um you cannot take their backing or their involvement in a project as a signal that this is a winner or a good thing that's my rant when you just think about how much more powerful it would be if chimath like I would have a lot of respect if he had said look you know we took Metro mile public I thought it was my Geico I put 200 million dollars 20 of my net worth into this business and I lost it alongside of you um or I invested my warrants into equity and I I locked it up and I held it for three years or something like that but no there's nothing like that there's no alignment and I think so often this comes down to alignment of incentives um you know they're they're incentivized to do the bad thing what was the General sentiment of the DM Sean like semantics will stuff first like we wait we weren't an FTX it's like dude I'm not talking about FTX I'm talking about these other three shitty bets if you need me to name the names I'll I'll do it that you know this thing you invested that made zero sense you know blah blah so it's like some was we didn't make this mistake and then the other one is look this is just the nature of the game it's Venture you should know this but you have a venture fund like you know you're gonna have a bunch of zeros and I said I totally agree you know I invest in seed you know startup ideas that are you know summer routine a pitch deck a prototype or you know early stage product I know a lot of these aren't going to work out it's very different than I put 50 or 100 or 300 million dollars into a business that was fundamentally like you know fraudulent or was like doing something that was uh um you know sort of self-dealing that's that's very very different than um you know we bet on this technology and it turned out the costs weren't and it cost didn't work out or that traction wasn't it didn't grow as fast as we had hoped or whatever there's different way ways to lose in the same way I always say in our business like there's errors of action and errors of inaction if you're trying really hard and you make mistakes totally acceptable if your error is that you didn't think about it or you didn't do anything you forgot you just dropped the ball on it that's where I have trouble and the same thing in investing well in here you can you can misjudge a business and think it was going to grow faster or you know it got sideswiped by something else versus um if you put something into you put money into something that you should have diligence and you did to me this is like yeah if a16z on average delivers value right so as a portfolio they've created all this Innovation they've invested all these great companies and yes there's going to be some colossal mess-ups where they're going to lose a ton of money I think that's great what makes me sad is when you take the holistic result of an entire firm and you go wow over a 10-year period they made tons of money and all their investors lost a bunch of money or all these businesses were zeros that I think is the hard part and again this is a decades game right chamoth we won't know if chamath has actually built value for another 10 or 20 years and frankly like his it's all very like secret because I think a lot of this stuff is private so we really have no clue how much money he has how much money he made what's been successful what hasn't there's a bit of a smoke screen there um and I you know I've talked to chamoth before I think he's like a super nice Charming smart guy and I like you I listen all in and I I like those guys and at the same time I go you know wow there's some there's some games yeah and again I'm not saying that they do a bad job or that they did anything bad I'm just saying the reminder to myself was just because this really smart person who you respect and is generally successful and has made money and probably will continue to make money is in something like you can't Outsource your conviction like you can Outsource a lot of [ __ ] you can't Outsource your conviction so that was really what I was trying to say I think I got a little too heated up and made it sound like they were dumb or evil but that really wasn't what I was trying to say it was actually they are smart but even even though they're smart they're gonna make some colossal mistakes along the way they will probably end up fine but you got to make sure that you know that you go in Eyes Wide Open that smart person can do dumb things and it sounds so simple but it's like a reality is we all do this we all take mental shortcuts oh if these guys are in we're in if this if they say it's good it probably is good right and you have to do that to some extent or you can't function I can't sit here in diligence every business on Earth but uh you know you have to be you have to at the end of the day you have to the reminder was to myself make sure if I bet on anything and I wasn't an investor in FTX for example but like let's say I let's say I was or an investor in crypto or you know promoted Sam as a smart guy like you have to try to um try to not lean on other big names as your source of conviction totally I I remember I read um Howard Mark's book so he's like a famous billionaire uh investor value investor and specializes in distressed debt and I read his book and I went wow this guy's amazing what a great investor and I realize there's ways to see what they were buying so you can find out what all your favorite investors Buy in the stock market and so I went well I totally trust this guy I read his book it's incredible um I'm gonna buy into this weird Greek shipping company that he just bought you know 50 million dollars of equity in and so I put like 100 Grand into it and it goes out of business and what I didn't understand was two things one he has thousands of positions right or hundreds at least and for him it's just a tiny little roulette chip that he's put down and two he's a distressed debt investor so he might buy the equity but he's buying all mostly focused on the debt and expecting it to go out of business so I actually screwed myself by not understanding and just blindly going along with it and I've made that same mistake you know hundreds of times [Music]

he predicts that Sam bankman freed is going to get life in prison and I thought that that was an incredibly interesting prediction uh you know birdie Madoff got you know hundreds of years um there's this other uh Ponzi scheme guy that I was reading about based out of Texas who also got like 150 years and so it's not crazy that that could happen you know people who commit these hundreds of millions and billions of dollars Ponzi schemes they get life in prison [Music] [ __ ] all right we are live Sean I'm in my uh my official crypto hoodie what is that this is fine oh yeah that's wonderful perfect hoodie for today this is all I've been wanting to talk about I purposely haven't texted you about this because this is all I want to talk about but like maybe just give like a three to five minute background on what's going on I think you're the guy that should be doing that and then I want to tell you some of the more interesting points that I think maybe haven't been covered or are less covered that I think are either hilarious or interesting okay great and by the way should we check if my uh I have a 25 000 withdrawal that's uh that we will see we'll see if FTX has any money left I'm gonna check right now and see if it's come through what do you think yes or no did I get my 25 grand out I think he I think you probably got it I did it on November 9th it's now November 14th it said it would happen by today and it is not in the bank account all right there we go just another disappointment okay so why don't I have my deposit uh actually it's not even a deposit they they advertise with us and so they paid me inside fjx and I was just lazy and never went through it um okay so basically what's happened here's the what happened for those who aren't following it that closely FTX which is a big crypto exchange it's a place to go to buy sell different cryptocurrencies it was I think the number two or three largest Exchange in the world used mostly uh internationally um because it was kind of like uh you know people all around the world want to buy I think 90 plus percent of people buying crypto are international um coinbase but bigger than coinbase bigger than coinbase binance is number one I think there's technically something number two but really it's like binance number one ftx2 and sort of like coinbase and the others you know come after that okay so FCX which was this blue chip thing and it was seen as this like you know Mega success story you would see top investors um in the world that were investing in this so Sequoia uh which is like you know a preeminent VC firm plus like you know 50 others um we're investing in this he's on the cover of Fortune Magazine and it says you know the next JP Morgan um because he's you know this this this young guy who becomes one of the wealthiest men in crypto they say FTX at its peak was worth about 32 billion dollars and this company is only like four years old right so it was had this like crazy explosive growth and valuation Sam was said to be worth 16 billion dollars himself he's this genius traitor and um now entrepreneur he's this crazy eccentric guy the guy looks goofy as hell he's a uh he's a vegan who doesn't wear shoes and gives away all of his money if they're effective altruism whatever you know he's got this sort of character that everybody wants to talk about which uh I bought into it very easy to buy into you know this like you crazy person who sleeps on the floor of his desk and doesn't sleep on the bean bag believe in normal stuff and he's at 29 or 30 worth north of 10 billion dollars and he previously made a billion plus by doing Arbitrage with like Korean crypto so just some crazy [ __ ] I bought into it so that's the background we all go on this this uh most people are on that train of like okay I guess that's what it is and then suddenly last week there's a series of events we can go into however much detail we want but there's a series of events that basically causes a bank run on FTX so users lose confidence that FTX is solvent which means they say I got to get my money off 50x just as I did uh you go you hit the withdrawal button just in case there's any weird stuff going on we've seen many things crashed in 2022 in crypto uh Luna was one uh Voyager Celsius there was a handful of these things that crashed so people said better safe than sorry let's start withdrawing our money that creates a solvent a liquidity crisis for FTX they don't have the money to give and everyone's like where the hell's the money why don't you have the money uh that's my deposit that's my funds you know you go to the bank you expect them to have your money and so FTX does not have their money he comes out he says everything is fine all the assets are fine guys this is just you know a hoax from a competitor there's a competitor trying to F with us blah blah blah binance is that competitor that he's talking about um so he's basically saying oh the big the big the number one guys coming after after us but we're fine guys don't don't panic people still panic and in fact he was lying turns out there's basically this guy was a giant fraud uh you know if you believe all the things that have been coming out so allegedly we'll say the word allegedly uh this guy was lying deceiving everybody um misusing customer funds et cetera et cetera FTX goes under it goes from a 20 to 30 billion dollar company to a company that is now declaring bankruptcy billions of dollars there's like a 10 billion there's like 10 billion dollars worth of customer funds that are gone vaporized unaccounted for this guy's fully in the country and you know all kinds of crazy stuff so I'll just set that as the background then now we can go into whatever Parts you want to go into all right so there's been a lot of interesting things that have happened and I want to name a few uh you know there's the story's a week old now so a lot of the the stuff has been covered on the facts we can talk about the facts if we want but I want to talk about like some things that I think haven't been covered first the things happening on Twitter are amazing this is all unraveling in real time on Twitter one of the more interesting and funny ones there's a Twitter handle called autism Capital the most based civil citizen journalism in crypto we are currently following the FTS Saga but please be patient we have autism that's their that's their uh that's our source of Truth by the way that is who we are reviewing on at times of trouble right now but listen it's hilarious and I think a lot of it's right it's sort of like TMZ TMZ is like considered trash because they sit they're fast paced and they say a lot of stuff that eventually every once in a while they have to recant and say oh no you know we got this wrong but you know what they [ __ ] nail it they called Prince being dead or about to die they called all this other stuff and that is exactly what's happening there's so there's all these interesting things that autism capital is tweeting like SBF that's this guy Sam uh the founder SBF did a master class you know the company masterclass on trading and it was set to release in December and it's already been filmed that's like an interesting thing they tweeted another interesting thing they tweeted is basically spf's right-hand woman was this woman named Caroline who rumors are that they also were like sleeping together she ran the hedge fund so the SPF owns all this weird collusion she has a tumbler that autism Capital found and uh it says she had a post called the world optimization where her Kink is men who control most major world government it's like people say always say oh I want this but what I want is like a man who's like control societies governments things like that it's like what the hell are you talking about um yeah dude so I've I've followed them like we I mean if you're in crypto you follow these people you you know these are con Sam was considered one of the like you know more Blue Chip of course there's always some people that are like this guy's full of [ __ ] or I don't trust this guy or whatever but they're like the the small small minority the majority of people believed that FTX was this fast growing company and that Sam was this like really interesting really smart founder and then you knew the one part that was always Shady so for example when they advertise with us they asked us to write a story on FTX and we were like okay great we'll write the story about how you guys grew so fast what tactics you used why you know why Grace have asked and we write the story and then me and Ben were talking we were like you know stories all like you know perfectly Rosy and that makes sense this is like a sponsor like you know deep dive basically um but like you know we should put in what are some of the concerns even if nothing else just to like balance out the story so that it's like not literally just a Fluff piece so we were like well what are some of the criticisms and one was like there well before he started FTX he started this company called Alameda research and that limited research not a research company it was a trading company that just called it research so it sounded a little more serious but basically and the rumors are like in autism capital I think also shared this they're like well Sam said he wanted to call it Alameda research because that just had an official sounding name and he also didn't want people to know that they were trading yeah and in the entrepreneurial circles it was like oh great little growth hack right you know it's like when you said uh when we wanted to get advertised for the hustle I would first just write a fake ad for some other company that I'd go to their competitor and be like hey you're you want this spot and like you know there's a fake it till you make it that's acceptable and then there's a fake it till you're a fraud which is where this guy like went totally wrong so so he had this Trading Company hit the legend is basically that um at the time Bitcoin was trading at let's say 10 grand in America but in other countries where it was harder to access Bitcoin there was a slight premium people were willing to pay more for a Bitcoin because it was so hard to access because the government was you know maybe not allowing exchanges to run there properly or whatever so in Japan and Korea everybody saw this Bitcoin would be ten thousand here it'd be eleven thousand or twelve thousand there and so um the legend of the origin story for FTX is that Sam saw this he was one of the people that exploited this Arbitrage opportunity you know he basically hustled went to Korea and um set up this like Logistics chain where they could buy a million dollars of Bitcoin here sell it for a slight premium there wire the money back and do it again the next day just keep recycling the money and that they made tons of money and nobody really understood exactly how like there was some plot holes in this but it was like uh I don't know I guess these guys are just smarter than us but like it's like wait you made a billion dollars doing this no that sounds a little unreasonable so you might have made what hundreds of millions but where did you get the seed capital for this like you weren't Rich so like how much initial money went into this and there was never like some clarity there so that was a little bit strange but nobody really what's the answer to that what's the answer to that they well now it appears the answer might have been that that just never even happened that might have been a complete fabrication or they might have done it at a much smaller scale um nobody nobody still knows the answer because this guy's like you know on the run or you know hiding you know uh right now so so nobody knows the answer that but the the bigger part the part that we wrote about was like well Alameda research um when FTX launched as an exchange every exchange needs liquidity when buyers and sellers come to the site they need to be able to quickly get their order filled so you usually have a market maker or liquidity provider basically who sits there and says I'll I'll be the one who buys and sells things and I'll take a small um a small fee for providing that liquidity to The Exchange so it runs better so Alameda was the liquidity Fighters the market maker for FTX and um so everybody knew that and I was like okay cool but it's like wait but Sam owns both he owns The Exchange and he owns the market maker isn't there some conflict of interest so you know like couldn't you know if this is a hedge fund basically that can go buy things but then FTX can list those coins they'll know what they're gonna list right so there's a little bit weird it's a conflict of interest it's a little bit of you know cousins kissing there and so we had wrote about that we go you know they have this kissing cousins thing that people don't really like or nobody knows the true extent to this relationship between the two and they were like hey we need you to take that out and we were like well we don't really think we should take it out we think we're going to keep it in and they were like okay cool like but just pause this whole story The crypto markets prices are going down we don't want to be bragging about how well we're doing right now so we were like okay you paid us you don't want us to run the story we'll never run the story so we never ran it um but I remember at that time a little it was a small red flag of like I'm surprised that instead of clarifying the relationship they're like don't talk about that so that was a little bit of a red flag but you know like most things when you have when you're reading nine out of ten things are are just saying how this is the Wonder kid and this is the best best company and then you just have this one little red flag you sort of brush it aside at least that's what I did which is a mistake by the way the the person that you worked with there are they still there nobody's there dude the company's done yeah but the person that you worked with what do they list on their LinkedIn now uh I I wasn't working directly with Mike I don't know the guy's name um I they saw you know Ben kind of was running the milk Road really so I I was just kind of like I would do the writing and then he would talk to the guy or whatever so I don't know the guy's name but um anyways that was just like one small thing and so what ended up happening whether the sort of cause of this was essentially that FTX was illegally and um it was lying to customers and was illegally taking customer money giving it to Alameda through either a loan or just like straight up funneling the money there um and then Alameda was going and trading using the customer money trying to turn a profit and was actually just like kind of bad at trading it was losing money and so then they didn't have the money to return when all the customers wanted their money out and um when they you know quote unquote lent them the money the collateral that they put up to take the loan right like let's say users put in a more like solid currency let's say like Bitcoin um Alameda borrows that Bitcoin to go trade and they put up in return as collateral ftt token which is ftx's own internal token that doesn't have like real that much real value so when they lost all the Bitcoin for it just for like to make things simple here when they lost all the Bitcoin all FTX had was the shitty ftt token that wasn't that was worthless so now there's no there's a huge hole they lent basically 10 billion dollars out and then couldn't return it and so they went they went under and basically now every day there's more leaks about how crazy this situation was how these guys were Liars how they were doing this intentionally how they were doing drugs how they were you know 15 people sleeping together in this like Mega Mansion while he pretended to be this like big philanthropist and um maybe he's an actor for the Chinese State who know there's like crazy theories all around and um you know nobody knows the truth and this guy's coming out and yesterday he tweets for the first time and everyone's like oh my God here it comes and he tweets out like a thread and you know like you start a thread with one and they used to say the first point then you're gonna say two and then the second point he treats out two one and all he says is what and then you see and then he does nothing and then he tweets out two and then the letter H what does that mean and then just now an hour ago he tweeted out a and then 11 minutes ago p ants maybe he's spelling he's like what happened I don't know what he's trying to do I don't know what's going on I don't know maybe he's having a break or something uh like I mean he might be having a breakdown he might have been dude I knew a guy who like was having a breakdown uh and you know he had to be institutionalized and he was tweeting crazy [ __ ] you know like and this is how it started uh maybe the guy's going through something like that there's this there's another interesting thing that happened with uh chamoth on the all-in Pod he's and this is another thing that I saw uh I think also autism Capital they like clipped this clip and on the all-in Pod shamath who has a whole bunch of other questionable things happening but he said something interesting where he was uh looking at investing in FTX and he was like you know it's kind of weird how you guys are kind of self-dealing I think you need a board and I think you need rules around what you can and can't not do with this and he said the person working at FTX called them back and literally said hey go [ __ ] yourself and just hung up and that was the end of of the call yeah by the way I think there's 70 chance that entire story is [ __ ] uh I think Shabbat is generally full of [ __ ] and uh you know so so I do not believe this story for for what it's worth but dude have you seen the videos so the woman name and I guess my point would be if you knew that something effed up was going on with this company the most popular company in the in the world at that time in crypto and that if you knew that this was messed up like that there was fraud going on or deception or any of this stuff you would have said something right like so maybe what he said is I don't know I don't feel comfortable with this uh but I feel like he's trying to take some Victory lap of being like no a new video in the clip I believe chamat said he he I believe he he put emphasis on this he goes he literally said go [ __ ] yourself no no that part I believe I believe that they would say that uh it's tomorrow's part where he goes I called them they pitched me I said this doesn't make much sense but okay I'll have my guys look into it and my guys looked into it we gave them a recommendation you need government you need to do this you need to do that you and like they said go [ __ ] yourself uh I don't know something about that picture being so white knighty uh uh you know more red flags to be as well but a few other interesting things uh basically another Twitter thing these guys have been doing these like Marathon Twitter spaces uh one of the guys name is Mario uh and he hosted this Twitter space where Elon popped in and someone was like Hey Elon what did you think when you first met this guy SPF he goes well people were telling me when I was buying Twitter that he had lots of monies lots of money but my [ __ ] meter was redlining and even all these major investment Banks were like yeah this guy's walking on water he's the best he's got he has money and I just didn't think that he had the money and I actually believe this story to be true and it just like it was interesting because from an outside you think well these billionaires all know each other they know what's up and you know like uh they they know if someone does or doesn't have money they know does they do or do not know if someone's legit and elon's like I had no idea if he was legit but he didn't seem legit to me but everyone else said he was and I thought that was like really interesting I was like oh I thought this was like a club where you had to like show financials to get in inside of and turns out that's not true and also the balls of SPF to be buying stadiums uh to be hiring Tom Brady and all these other like you know Larry David these huge celebrities this guy took this guy took a scam to the next level you know so much hubris to be tweeting or dming Elon and being like hey I'm I'm down to put up 3 billion for buying Twitter it's crazy so did you see the text messages that leaked of that yeah and uh what did Elon say he goes they were talking directly so basically the the text message that leaked it's on uh this awesome Twitter handle called internal Tech email so you can go check it out there um it's Michael Grime so I think is like the head of it's like a banker I think yeah yeah I think he's like one of the top guys at Morgan Stanley so uh what's his this is actually he's the managing director at Morgan Stanley so he texts Elon he goes hey do you have five minutes for a meeting that I think you'll want to take you know it's like I'll call you in half an hour Minecraft perfect he goes sandbankment freed is why I'm calling he links to a a link of fan Baker feed which is basically a link to a story that like Sam Baker freed is uh he was an effective altruist meaning his goal was to make as much money as possible so that he could give it away that was the best way that he could help and cause like positive change for society was by maximizing how much money you can make and then giving it away which is like why there's all the memes of like you did it you took all her money and you gave it away you know like wow um and so then Elon just replies two question marks like what and he goes I'm backlogged with a mountain of critical work matters is this urgent he goes he wants one to five billion serious about partnering with you same security you own not urgent unless you wanted him to fly out tomorrow um he goes he could do 5 billion if everything is Vision lock uh he would do engineering for the social media blockchain integration founded he founded FTX he believes in your mission major Democratic donor he was the number two largest Democratic donor 40 50 million something like that um because so I thought it was worth an hour tomorrow he said he could shake hands on five five billion if you like him and I think you will um can you talk with you know whatever but it you know it could get us five billion in equity in an hour he's like trying to sell him like take this meeting Elon replies blockchain Twitter isn't possible as the bandwidth and latency requirements you know basically a blockchain Twitter won't work so this doesn't make any sense and then it says Elon disliked could do 5 billion if ever if if uh if Vision lock would do so engineering for social media blockchain integration and then the maker goes got it afford the equity interest to this other guy instead but even if there's not the blockchain piece he's interested investing uh in Twitter and your mission but we can we can put him on the sideline for now 81 goes as long as I don't have to have a laborious blockchain debate honestly one of the cooler things that Elon has done or said in this entire thing which is like all right I'll meet the crypto bro just don't make me [ __ ] I don't want to get into an hour-long talk about blockchains please and um that I thought was hilarious then he goes does Sam actually have three billion liquid and then the guy goes like yes I think Sam hasn't he actually said up to 10 at one point but in right he said up to five he's into you and he said the blockchain's only if you're interested is not going to push it blah blah this other super rich guy Orlando referred him and then he's like uh we can push him to next week but I believe you'll like him Ultra genius and doer Builder like your formula built FTX from scratch after MIT physics second to Bloomberg and donations to Biden campaign and so that's you know the the Grimes what's this guy's name Mark Grimes dude he's on the grind right now you're fire bro you are fired we're calling him Mark crimes instead of Michael crash for whatever reason the um we did this in the milk road we were like you know it's just it's hard to report bad news every day but it's like hey bad news f-tex the biggest exchange insolvent bad news wasn't even just a miscalculation you know in good faith it was actually fraud and deception we think and that's what it looks like oh bad news the money that they would have otherwise had to pay out the remaining customer deposits oh somebody just hacked it last night and took six took the last 600 million there's actually zero in the bank accounts now so there is nothing left for anybody uh because a guy literally just did this and oh by the way there's a plane going flying his private jet is flying to Argentina tonight uh we're tracking it here and it's like dude this is horrible and we're like What are we gonna do we're like we're no longer calling this guy SBF nicknames are for winners this guy is now Samuel we're calling him his government name and like Mr bankman no not even no not he's Samuel uh from now on [Music] where's the worst heavy HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better we uh I want to ask you about milk roads engagement but first um you tweeted something and I agree with basically you're talking about like it just like I lose trust in so many things I'm losing so SPF or not FTX owned I think 10 of Robin Hood which I have money in uh not a huge sum I think he personally uh him and Alameda owned the the dude I'm gonna sell I'm gonna I'm getting all my money out of Robin Hood I don't I don't trust anything I don't trust any new startup that is in banking I by default don't believe you whereas before I would be like oh this is kind of cool I guess like you have MasterCards logo on there I guess you're okay yeah I'm not team Innovation anymore yeah no [ __ ] that I'm going to e-trades I'm getting my money off of uh uh Robin Hood I to all the people who I said oh you don't you know you just don't get the disruptors I'm sorry you are right I was wrong I'm sorry Daddy uh you are you are absolutely right I do not I I think I trust coinbase for some reason because uh the guy Brian seemed a little bit legitimate and they are publicly traded so they do report quarterly but uh I guess you gotta trust somebody right like you gotta trust something so for example I was like dude I'm getting all my crypto off Robin Hood At the minimum because I had way back I had bought crypto on Robinhood and I was like wait I can't just send it to another wallet it's like no because Robin Hood actually wasn't buying crypto you're buying a crypto derivative I was like what the [ __ ] why did they say buy Bitcoin like this is not Bitcoin this is a Bitcoin tracking derivative it's not even you don't even own the coins then it was like okay now you could after years it's like you could transfer it off so I was like okay I'll get to that when I get to it and um I bought a bunch of eth on there and I was like uh I was like me too I'm getting it all out of there I go hit send it to eth wallet it's like oh you've exceeded your five thousand dollar maximum I was like five thousand dollar Max every day you can only do five thousand first of all why um second of all that's [ __ ] this will take forever to get all my money off this thing it's just like you had another you know you had another strike against you know Innovation I'm the old guy on the lawn now shaking my fist saying you know uh all you Rascals you know stop playing with my money it's like and it's not like it's not crypto it's not like Bitcoin did anything it's like the people building the companies around this that are literally like committing fraud or taking so much Reckless risk that they're that their their whole exchange goes insolvent overnight or gets hacked that's insane so I was like you know what I'm gonna self-custody or you know take this portion move it over here do this over here you know I have this kind of strategy I was like I'm gonna move more into self-custody and um our buddy Greg was like uh I was like what do you think man should I should I do this or he's like well I was like what do I trust more myself or one of these exchanges and he's like he's like uh you know and I was like no I said what would feel worse if I just lose my crypto or if these guys lose my crypto he's like well let me ask you a different question how many airpods do you own and like how many airpods have you lost he's like if you can't keep your airpods you'll really think for 10 years you're gonna like not lose your crypto and I was like Fair Point it sounds like you know okay cycling through options of how to hold this stuff so that hey I don't lose up a b you know I'm not trusting anybody luckily I wasn't really that affected by FTX but like you know a lot of people were and that's extremely you know sad and disappointing and like those people are you know they're traumatized right that's like they got daddy issues now they got trust issues they're they're not coming back to the game and just being like yeah I understand even if you intellectually understand that okay this guy was literally a criminal right or like you know somebody who was uh you know doing something that was that was uh wrong misappropriating user funds even if you acknowledge that that was one bad actor it's like dude there's a lot of Bad actors in crypto and um how the hell am I supposed to know it's not like you get to go sit and audit the books of these companies it's not like you get they say they say one thing they do another like 24 hours before it went in solvent the CEO comes out and says all assets are fine we do not lend out customer deposits 24 hours later gone and turns out this guy was lying well dude an interesting thing about San Francisco and Silicon Valley where we both kind of started our careers is it's all based on trust so there's like a lot of times where you uh give people money you just wire the money without contracts you you pump people up and make intros even though you don't entirely you look at a slide deck and you say okay this is what they're saying the numbers are you don't say okay I need your you know I need to go into your database and I need to go check to see this oh I need to check like I need to check that this database number is also not fudged by you know Bots or you know faked downloads or whatever oh I also need to check that your pixel is not firing twice or you're not like hiding costs over here with your shell companies you don't know all that stuff and it's a tremendous time to do that this whole thing or our little world is based on this type of trust and you and I have both kind of got started right when uh a great economy was was kicking off and uh I basically didn't ever think people were lying and that was incredibly naive and now I feel even though I haven't really been burnt by this but I do feel I'm like oh I don't I don't really try trust anyone anymore and I think that everyone might be lying just a little bit and it has changed my perspective on that 100 and so I used to see Robin Hood as like oh you're the underdog like you're you know you're on my side it's like Oh no you're you you definitely can lose my money I I don't I don't I don't believe you um what about milk road so for the new listeners milk Sean uh started this thing called milk Road it's a daily email for crypto with hundreds of thousands of people is your engagement skyrocketing or are people just telling you to [ __ ] off because they they hate the whole industry um no it's Abby this engagement's very high because during a crisis a lot of people want to read I think what we will see though is over the coming months that's not going to bode well for us right like even if engagement's high right now during you know the play-by-play craziness of what's going on right we're getting you know record open rates and [ __ ] like that you know what happens three months from now as people are just sort of disillusioned the news is over the crisis is over it's like you know dude nobody's talking about Ukraine right now the in my world like day to day people aren't talking about Ukraine every day I remember when that [ __ ] broke out it was like my mom my sister everybody I knew was like glued to their phone watching these videos [ __ ] getting zelinski tattoos and being like Oh my God I can't believe this my heart goes out thoughts and prayers blah blah and then you're in day 98 and you're like your thoughts and prayers go back to like you know I I wish this whatever you know just whatever your daily life was you're like sort of revert you stopped caring as much in the same way like I think what's gonna happen for us with the milk road is that engagement spikes during this time but actually it's not good for anybody in the industry when somebody breaks like customer and customer trust gets shaken this badly that sets it back like potentially years um oh yeah I mean it's not a question is is it set back by years it's is this going to ruin it I mean like that's how big this is in my in my mind yeah and I think that one's probably not if it was good like if crypto is gonna fail I don't think it's going to fail because of this like we've seen actually before the number one exchange go down before it's just like as the industry grows disasters cost a lot more money and they affect a lot more people but like we've actually seen literally This Disaster before with Mount Cox and there's a Netflix documentary I've talked about on the Pod about a Canadian exchange that was literally doing this you would go in it was like same thing guys bully genius everybody loves them media loves him starts this exchange becomes the biggest one in Canada turns out there was literally never anything in the deposits like you would click buy big one you'd send them the money you would never buy Bitcoin he would just show the number in your on your computer screen you yeah you got ten and uh he would just take the money go do whatever he wanted with it and it was literally just like a criminal he was lying and like anything his own death then he mysteriously died or Faked his own death and you know Sam bakeries tweeting out one letter at a time here is you know who knows what's what's going on with this guy too so like we've literally seen this exact disaster before but it's higher profile it's louder it affects more people and now instead of losing Millions tens of millions hundreds of millions now it's billions that we're playing with that that got lost here so I think it's definitely bad but I don't think this is like the death blow to crypto I think if it's like same thing with startups like startups don't usually die due to competition that you don't get you don't die because you got hunted you died because you starved and I think if it happens if crypto dies it's gonna be for the same reason it's gonna die not because FTX blew up and then people just all gave up and you know decided I don't trust this thing ever again forever and ever and ever and everybody decided that it's that really the the use case and the utility wasn't strong enough to draw people in continually over time um and like maybe you know the use case just wasn't big enough or it wasn't strong enough there wasn't product Market fit so I think startups and and in this case crypto it'll die if it dies of starvation not of competition you know who's one of the big winners here is Martin scorelli so basically Martin shkreli Pharma Bro went to jail for a couple years for scamming his farm Pharmacy company or something like that pharmaceutical company or something like that you know Finance guy but very smart I think a very smart guy and he has a sub stack now that is incredibly interesting and he's been doing Twitter spaces where he's been like commenting on this and he's like well you know Jail's not that bad like you know like he's saying all this funny stuff and he wrote in his sub stack this morning that he predicts that Sam bankman freed is going to get life in prison and I thought that that was an incredibly interesting prediction uh you know birdie Madoff got you know hundreds of years um there's this other uh Ponzi scheme guy that I was reading about based out of Texas who also got like 150 years and so it's not crazy that that could happen you know people who commit these hundreds of millions and billions of dollars Ponzi schemes they get life in prison which is kind of crazy that you can get life in prison for a non-violent crime but uh his prediction is that he's gonna go to prison forever so the Enron guy Enron got 24 years as his sentence uh let's see Bernie Madoff well he Bernie died in prison you know he got sentenced when he was in his 70s but I think he got hundreds of 150 years was like the you know the the headline number uh and then I think the one another big Ponte scene guy I think I believe his last name was Samford Mark Sanford I believe he uh at age 60 something got 150 years so he it's you know regardless of when you get that 150 years it's a life sentence and so like it doesn't believe it doesn't appear that this is literally a Ponzi scheme a Ponzi scheme Works in a specific way like I think Madoff basically would like he like had all the money in like one checking account did you know this he had like a million dollars in a Chase account it was just like whenever somebody requested he would pay him out out of that and and you know show these great returns or whatever but um in this case basically the the effects the same here you know like someone he defrauded people into the tune of billions and billions of dollars exactly and not only that but uh the interest you know Bernie Madoff I don't know if you notice know this but do you know that he was the head of the SEC for a minute of the security exchange yeah he was that or it was either that or NASDAQ I think I think he was the head of the SEC and he had and so he was like a big deal you know and so uh so that was like you know bold on his part but SPF did this in an even Bolder way because he was mainstream you know he owned or they they had the naming rights to the Miami Heat and they had commercials with Tom Brady and so to me it's if I'm a judge I'm like dude you're even you're rubbing it in all of our faces this is more egregious than Bernie Madoff who was a little bit more quiet about it so you're just like taunting me while you're stealing so of course I'm gonna like get you as hard as I possibly can right yeah yeah it's it's bad I mean it's very very visible very very painful very like all day I mean just the the gall of people I mean this guy is a real [ __ ] for what he did that's like a crazy crazy thing to do and you know there's like I could see one version of it which is basically there's one version of it which is he believed that this would like he wasn't trying to steal people's money he was like you know what like Alameda like basically what people think is that Alameda when Luna blew up uh Alameda lost a bunch of money and in order to save Alameda from having to like liquidate everywhere he's like okay let me just loan you this money you will make it back because you're good and then I'll like make it all good in the end nobody no harm no foul um I know that I shouldn't do this he didn't tell anybody about this that's like one version of reality that could exist there is some evidence against that but like it's hard to know you know we're talking about like autism Capital as a source right I don't know if this evidence is like anybody just like making a screenshot or whatever you know like it's hard to know at this point so um you know so so basically there's one version of reality that's that uh which is he got stuck in a in a in a spot where he was going to lose a bunch of money and his thing was going to go under and it was going to be very public and bad and he tried to cover it up and he kind of panicked and made a terrible decision and he did something that was wrong and illegal and um against terms of service at least for for FTX and but he he intended to like make it all right and then there's another version which was as of now that does not seem like a very likely scenario and what part makes you what what evidence makes you say that uh like it was like you you know that people were saying that like he was he's allegedly none of this has been proven that he's been wiring himself for 500 million dollars uh and that coincidentally the FTX has been hacked uh things like that like I I I don't I don't feel as though that's that is going to be the outcome yeah so let's say whatever there's some probability that that that's what happened and there's another probability the more egregious possibility is like basically he's like screw everybody we're going to take the money we're going to funnel it over here I'm going to grease you know he lives in the Bahamas he's like I'm gonna grease all the politicians here I'm going to grease the politicians of the United States be the second biggest donor to buy it in and I'm gonna you know go to there's like this crazy stuff for like his the girl who was running Alameda her dad was like work with Gary Gensler and who's like the SEC chair and like that's why SPF and kensler kept meeting and like we're about to pass this bill that was gonna be very bad for D5 but very good for FTX and it was like all this like you know game to basically like lock in this like money machine that he was gonna you know continue to use for his own benefit and Alameda was like abusing the information that they had front running the trades it's like the like everything was evil and then there's like the slippery slope type of thing like if you watch the theranos documentary for example um I shouldn't say documentary like you know the theranos yeah the [ __ ] movie yeah whatever the show um they make it look in that like what actually happens is she's wants to do something great she's sort of delusional about her own abilities thinks that I'm an entrepreneur I could prove everybody wrong thinks that the technology will work things that she's buying time to fake it till you make it to get it to work and then at some point gets so trapped in the lie that she just goes all in on the lie because at that point like her entire Image Ego company Fortune is based on this working and she's like you know eventually starts just you know actually lying and committing crimes and so like that that became like but that wasn't the intention day one I was like I'm gonna do this scam I'm gonna scam everybody and so I think that's the the only question here but if regardless the result is the same scam happened whether he intended to do the scam from day one or halfway through got into in a spot panicked and it started to lie and started to to commit these uh um you know sort of I don't know if I should call them crimes but you know do what he did to add to the story do you know who this kid's parents are yeah they're like ethics teachers at Stanford dude they teach of course they are they're perfect they're both professors of law at Stanford law school I I think they also like taught at Yale I mean so they're supposed to be like no but they also literally teach ethics yeah in relation to to law from a legal perspective I believe and they uh the dad I think Joseph is the same he is involved in FTX where he like helped them raise some money so if this guy is full-on lying Criminal crazy man screw the I mean screwing people out of money is is is bad also screwing your family and your parents is the worst right uh so like this whole entire story you know it hurts a lot of people but in terms of just like story arc and soap opera it is just the best it is the best are you not entertained yeah if nothing else is entertaining dude I don't even like crypto you know I've I've been like the crypto what is your prediction saying let's put it on the record here what is your prediction uh for crypto not not FTX I mean it's pretty clear what kind of we don't know the details exactly what happened we know the result for crypto what do you think is the uh do you think this all just goes to zero do you think this sort of Peters out for a long time do you think this rises again what is your prediction I think and keep in mind my perspective here is only emotional so and and basically I learned from crypto just from talking about you so everything that I've learned about crypto it's been live on this podcast so I would say I'm not incredibly educated I think that it's gonna Peter out for the next five to ten years I think that nfts are gonna go to zero I think that all the all coins basically ethereum and Bitcoin are the only ones that are gonna ever have the chance of being interesting virtually all of them go out of business I think that um coinbase stays in business and actually might grow because people are like okay fine you're the only place that I can trust uh I think that uh like Luna and all this other stuff and that one's already dead but like all these other like other 100 go to zero and never work and I think that this guy gets sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison all right there's the prediction what do you think um I predict uh Bad News Bears for the next um couple years is my guess I don't know the time scale there but I'm just going to guess a couple years crypto winter I mean I think that's probably true for the entire economy right now but I think particularly worse for crypto um but I do think that in the end crypto is real and is going to work um and you know I know that's kind of so but maybe now unpopular maybe it was always unpopular I'm not sure I don't really pay too much attention to that but um yeah I do think Bitcoin ethereum and then Replacements to some of the other use cases that that were built are going to rise and I think some of the things that are totally true I think this guy goes down I think coinbase does well I think that most of the current coins that are completely overvalued go to zero but I do think that Bitcoin and ethereum are here to stay and I think that they won't be the only two forever I think there will be new ones that come and do well um in the future but I think it's uh I also think it's another down cycle anyone who raised money and they had the word web3 in their deck I think virtually 100 of them are gonna fail and not work uh not necessarily because they are bad entrepreneurs or because their products are stupid although I do think that is the case in the vast majority of them uh I think that they're just gonna be laughed out of like existence and just like dude we're never working with you like this is like consumers because they're ugly which they are not because they're dumb certainly so but because you're gonna get laughed out the room is that because they're ugly it's not because they're dumb it's just because they're pathetic laughs I think that's gonna happen not all but but close to all yeah well that's true I think for most startups all right uh I gotta go visit my door to keep knocking all right that's the pod [Music]

mobile podcast and video Studio buy like a few Vans get them out with like a pretty fire setup just in the back of like a normal size van doesn't even have to be an RV for like two to three people could fit deck it out with like a few good DSLR cameras that can do the recording like dual camera setups that you have like a few mics hanging off the sides and basically go and post it up in a couple of major cities like one band in each major city and rent it out for like 500 bucks for two hours to do podcast recordings or like you know a couple hundred bucks to do like people going in and filming Instagram shorts tick tocks [ __ ] like that like if you put one in LA and you put one in New York City I bet you could kill it [Music] foreign the man who answers the question what would happen if Sean was better looking smarter harder working so Bloom is smarter [Laughter] with you so what's up guys happy to be here how often do you get your hair cut let's start with the most important question uh you know like every other week at this point now my wife is making fun of me for this because like it used to be that I'd go once a month wasn't a big deal and now I'm going like every other week because I like to keep it tight and she keeps giving me [ __ ] because we have a little newborn at home and I'm like oh I gotta go Gotta Go um so yeah it's becoming an issue you don't call it a hair appointment that's the only thing you can't do if you say I got a hair appointment then you're out as a guy the police just can't be called a salon that's always been my rule it's an easy Barber Shop you seem like you seem like a salon guy though man you're wearing like a you got like a Werther sweater on you look like you're getting ready for Christmas it's like it's 85 degrees in Austin Texas today yeah so are we at your like book reading for your for your book right now Sam what are you doing it actually does look like you should have a fireplace in the background and you're gonna be like reading us nice stories and a soothing voice I'm definitely drinking tea right now uh so basically like your bio is pretty easy you were a nobody private Equity guy the pandemic hit the pandemic hit and you're like I'm gonna be somebody in a matter of two years you've got famous on Twitter what do we what do we have nine or eight hundred thousand followers so you got famous on Twitter and basically transformed your life all because of Twitter and covid is that right I mean the nobody private Equity guide designation is not unreasonable I mean that's like I think that's totally fair I mean there's a lot of nobody like Finance guys that are making bank out there though right like that was uh that would have stung but now you're like famous and stuff so now it's okay to laugh at it I mean I don't know like do you think it's things like the if you're making pretty good money doing something like that I mean VPS and private Equity at this point if you're doing well like you're making seven figures as a BP in private equity name four of them yeah what about dude I hung out with some PE guys the other day and I didn't know them well enough but obviously I just in the back of my head how rich are you and that's like just what I wanted to keep asking are if you own a PE shop is it safe to assume that you're just wealthy and how much do they actually earn yeah I mean if you are if you are a GP so like one of the principal owners of a private Equity Fund and you've been doing it like across multiple funds that have performed well over a period of time it's pretty safe to assume that you've got a net worth north of 50 million dollars because I mean you just like simple math on it right most of those funds are taking like one and a half to two percent management fees on you know if you're running a big fund 500 million plus a billion plus if it's like a real substantial fund so there's you know 20 million plus coming in a year on a billion dollar fund uh and realistically most of them don't have that many employees so they're not having to actually pay out a ton of that in terms of like you know operating costs and then you have Carrie and they're taking you know 15 20 25 percent uh of profits above their hurdle rate whatever that is eight percent so you're like you know you're talking about if they double the funds there's 200 million dollars plus of carry to go around and so the principal owners of those are taking the Lion's Share of that which is I mean if there's 200 million in their principal owner owns 20 30 of that it's a [ __ ] ton of money and the I think that I've always I can't decide if it's jealousy because I'm like you guys are making a lot of money for what feels like not a lot of work or if it's actually I dislike them because I feel as though they're just like Excel sheet monkeys and they're like not actually creating value what where's the reality no I mean they work crazy hard man I I don't um I don't know anyone that is a long time GP uh in private Equity that doesn't work you know 70 plus hours a week of like stressful work I mean it's the type of thing Sean would absolutely hate like you think about like people that care about leverage on their time it's like pretty piss-poor leverage and it's high stress work because you're putting much a debt on these companies typically and you know during a downturn like right now right it's hugely stressful because you're constantly dealing with like breaking covenants on the debt and having to restructure and you know like basically what ends up happening is you spend 80 of your time on the like couple of losers in the portfolio and the winners you just like kind of get to set and forget it because they're growing they're you know you're getting like a levered upside on them because you put you know 70 leverage to buy the company 60 leverage to buy the company and you're just like eating off those couple of winners but you're dealing constantly with the ones that are losers so Sean and I have our hand in this world where like we've definitely sell and have sold courses and information stuff we also have a podcast and so that that's like this like personality world but then we also have built uh nice size companies and we will continue to build very likely much bigger companies and so we have our foot in that world for you you have your foot in like the PE world as well as the thing that we're in this information thing where do you think do you think that one do you think that the information world or whatever we call this thing is actually a uh is it an equal uh revenue or net worth driver as like some of the traditional company building or PE stuff yeah I mean like I think you have to think about it in terms of like your uh you know profit potential multiplied by like the freedom and time Freedom that comes with it right to like get to like kind of an adjusted profit that you can generate from something doing it in PE and like making 50 million dollars in PE from a time adjusted standpoint is a is a pretty grindy way to go do it it's like high certainty if you're just on if you're at a good fund and you're rolling with a good fund and you're like gonna be a partner there and you're going to get more and more carry across you know bigger and bigger funds it's a pretty low beta way to go and generate that type of you know that type of net worth but you're going to be working your ass off until you're like 60 years old doing it versus you know you go on the information side uh into the information economy and you're like doing newsletter doing podcast courses stuff that you guys are doing where you're like you know Sean might do his course and in a week make 300K uh and then be able to chill for you know two three months if he wants to because who cares right it's like it's just a totally different time leverage um so I don't know it's sort of depends on like what you want to do in that regard dude what's your what's your job now I mean I kind of do like 10 different things um I've got the fund you know like so I ended up raising the fun I didn't do the rolling fundex Sean but I've got a 10 million dollar Venture fund that I raised from you know a handful of Institutions and then a bunch of like the GPS at Big funds invested in it and basically like kind of share deal flow um I've got the newsletter which you know monetizes it's like but we could talk about it but like you know with newsletter sponsors now it's 125-ish thousand subs and you know it makes anywhere from like three and a half to six thousand dollars per cent right now and I send it you know eight to ten times a month so um you know pretty nice just like business that scales to your point on like time leverage I write the same two newsletters a week and it's pretty nice business and then I had this agency business that frankly like started just because it was like something that I saw you know as an Arbitrage opportunity early in like 2021 and it ended up scaling into like you know order magnitude probably like close to six figures a month um gross revenue business with super high margins and so I kind of just like kept doing it and kept walking into different areas with it and I don't know if you guys talked about this already but you had come to us or you were kind of talking on our group chat about like the fork in the road moment you had you were like we said before no name private Equity guy uh making good money and you had started tweeting out stuff like pretty regularly I would say I don't know six months or a year before that um and you it was clear you had momentum it was clear you were good at that uh you were getting followers maybe had 100 000 or 200 000 followers maybe at that time I'm just rounding around and uh but it wasn't you didn't have all these other things like this clear like I have a fund I have a newsletter that makes money I have an agency that makes money so you didn't know exactly what was on the other side of that Hill as you were debating what should I do should I you know the forking through a lot of people have should I stay in my job that's a good cushy job or should I uh take this leap of faith into the unknown give us like the two-minute story of like you know how did you think about that and how did you decide and was that the right way to think about it yeah I mean I um like a lot of people had the like covid moment of what the [ __ ] am I doing with my life um and you know am I happy doing it like you know all of a sudden for the first time in my life after I guess it had been six years working in in private equity which at the time you know it was like 80 to 100 hour weeks right so you don't really have time to look up you don't think about [ __ ] because you're just working and you're you know you're making more and more money and so you're like patting yourself on the back things are good you're you know you're Indian Child like Indian mother thinks it sounds impressive you know things are good she probably wants you to go get an MD but it sounds pretty good uh is that what your mother wanted you to do Sean uh my mom yeah she was yeah yeah that all those things she she definitely was like don't leave a good paying job that was just like a general rule uh or general rule of thumb I mean my mom to this day still asks me why I didn't go to medical school or why I didn't get a PhD in all seriousness like the Indian mother thing is sort of a meme but it's also very real the like you know you should go work for McKinsey if you're gonna work in uh in Professional Services that's the only place that is uh that's respectable um but yeah man I mean I was doing that covid hit all of a sudden I was like ah what am I doing with my life um had time on my hands to actually like think about other stuff for the first time in my professional life and so I started I mean the Twitter thing I just like I started writing and I didn't ever think of it as a potential way to like go make money or get another job or do something else but as it started to grow and as it started to spiral you know we were in this like group chat together right and I started seeing friends from the tech world how they were leveraging uh you know platforms Twitter Etc to make money I was like huh I wonder whether there's a way that I can actually uh you know build like a little side hustle with this you know like whether it was courses or whether it was an agency business or like whatever it was I never really thought about the fund or investing side at the time um and then candidly like I had a conversation with you Sean that I remember being really impactful where I was like at a real Crossroads and I thought I was gonna I thought I was going to kind of just like go join another type of investing firm and we were going to move back to the east coast to be closer family I was going to do that and I remember you saying to me like it sounds like you're just gonna go do the thing that kind of sounds like it sucks instead of doing the thing that you actually get a lot of energy from which is all this new stuff and that feels scalable and that you're you know you're fired up about so why are you making that decision and until someone just reframed it for me like that I had never thought about it I was just gonna type inside continue down the path that felt safe um it was like a stupid conversation frankly but had a pretty big impact you had described it you were like I'm thinking about path a or path B but the way you described it like Pate sounded like [ __ ] like sounded super hard and not that much fun and path B sounded like a lot of fun with just like you know some unknowns but like definitely good was gonna come of it and I was like how is this even a decision like it sounds like you're saying I'm choosing between a bad option and a good option go with the good one funny story about path a so at the time that path a this is real was to join like a crossover hedge fund like a hedge fund one that also does investments in private tech companies and my final interview my final interview I had to pitch a stock and the stock they gave me to pitch was Stitch fix and I had to decide like I had a week and I had to decide whether it was a buy you know or a short like if it was a long or a short and I did like a week of research like made this long deck like did all this work I mean it was miserable did all this thing it was trading at the time at like 46 dollars and it had come off um you know it had gone up to like 100 in the whole like arcados you know Bill Huang was like pumping up stocks but dude like buying the swaps pumped all the way up and then it came down to 46 and I pitched it as a buy uh got rejected because my pitch was shitty and now that stock is trading at 3.56 so I would have taken path a and I would have gotten fired within six months for sure dude so something that's interesting is like I get and I know Sean does too I get asked maybe five times a week if someone can like write tweets for me or like cut videos for me and all this stuff and it's pretty crazy I don't know if it only happens like what the popularity level is where you have to where you start getting those inbounds but I get it's so often that I get this and you like it's go there's like this weird I get people asking me all the time to go are you in sahil or are you in this person are you in that person is sahil friends with this person because there's this like weird circle jerk of a Twitter world and it feels feel as though that like you are connected to like many many many tens of millions of followers and reach and like there's this like weird behind the scenes thing going on with your agency it's the dark underground cabal that runs Twitter now uh no I mean Sean you actually remember this right didn't like some kid hit you up and say that he ghost wrote tweets for me and then you you just texted me and we're like does this dude ghost right for you and I was like no I've never heard of this kid in my life he was just lying and then I hit him up saying like yo why are you lying to this person and he completely panicked um but yeah man I mean the like the world of of Ghost writing tweets has now become again like it's become a meme because what was it like Business Insider wrote an article about VCS getting um getting ghost writers to write tweets for them that wasn't at all how my agency thing started it started um in like late 2020 because I had started to figure out that threads were the way that people were growing on Twitter and keep in mind like you know Sean you were around the group chat at the time but that was like before threads had become the like thread boy meme that they are today and so there was like legitimate Arbitrage in writing quality threads and I had all these startups that I had invested in the founders of which were like wow we see a ton of value in having a platform and a brand can you help us think through how to do this because you've done it like I had at that point got into 75 000 followers or so and so I was like yeah let me me you know I basically like started an LLC like an advisory business basically and I started giving like strategic support to these startups on how to think about content and then like how much would you charge them I was charging five grand a month um to a startup for basically like you know it was like texting and then maybe like one call every other week and it was like so low because um it was so low on time from what they needed for me because it was mostly like the founders didn't want to actually spend a ton of time on it they just wanted to be able to like kind of understand it and then they would have people on their end that just like went off and did things what was the high level like one two three bullet points that you would tell these Founders so that they could just be better at this it was basically like you need your two or three pillars of content that you're going to be able to talk about consistently that are like valuable for you as a startup or as a Founder so if you're a Founder I mean at the time it was like if you're a Founder talk about you know building companies and the things you're learning along the way which now is like Ultra saturated on Twitter right there's like a million people that aren't necessarily credible writing about that at the time there weren't that many Founders doing it like I don't know if you guys have seen the like copy AI founder I forget his name Paul um it might be an investor Sean you know that business um yeah and he was like the first one sort of that was like really building in public quote unquote like sharing about their journey and the things they were learning so I was basically telling Founders you have to establish like what are your two or three pillars that you're gonna be writing about maybe it's you know building in public maybe it's the industry you're in um you know maybe it's like sharing else along the way and like vulnerability because people find that endearing it's like uh it's called the Pratt fall effect have you ever heard of that it's like uh when when people who you perceive to be perfect show like chinks in their armor we find it as humans very endearing and we it actually makes us like them more and so you're like you know playing on that you're like sharing your elves along the way um but I was basically telling them you know versions of that on a regular basis and like helping you know kind of craft and advise them on the content they were putting out and it was like five grand a month probably had like five or so clients I think they were all like startups I either like the founders I knew or I'd invested in the companies and so I was kind of around and it was you know beneficial to me to like see them continue to grow and do that you like invest in the companies and they give you that money right back I like that yeah it was a good way to hedge them I mean this was personal Investments at the time so this was like you know I might invest like 25k in a company if I was making that back in five months that was a pretty good uh cash on cash return on the original investment but then like you know like after um you know the ghost writing thing was interesting because basically like early mid-2021 I had a few of those clients come and say like uh you know the biggest struggle for us is that we don't have people that can write this content like we don't want to build out a Content team when we're focused on product and engineering and all that stuff like do you have people that can write and right at that time I had done the course with Julian Shapiro our friend um we did a maven course on like how to build your audience and it was mainly how to build your audience on Twitter and so half that course was about like how to write good threads and how to write for Twitter and so I had this pool of like 400 students who had gone through the course learned the principles of it knew how to do it that then I was just able to sort of be a connector between like freelance you know writing talent to then support these startups and you know the the kind of fundamental of any agency business for anyone that's starting one is effectively that you're like creating price Arbitrage where you're like charging a client 10 grand for some or five grand for something that maybe cost you two and like you know the reality for most these people is you can pay a thousand to 2500 bucks a month maybe depending on the output and you can easily charge you know a startup or a brand five for that or you can charge like a you know a founder or an entrepreneur who's doing really well and just made a bunch of money five for just like the fact that you're the connector between the two points so that was when it like I would say like really started to scale but it was never for VCS for me like I've never I mean I've never had a client that was a VC it's it's all been Founders and it's all been like like half Tech Founders and half just like nuts and bolts like meat and potato type Founders like Sam's guys [Laughter] no you're a mean potato guy Sean's my tech guy you're my meat and potatoes you know if something's like cool or interesting then it's kind of more my thing and if something's like really boring and like you know generally correlated with like obesity it's your thing so I want to ask you a bunch about like kind of your your big Vision because you're going to be president someday I don't know if people know this there's a future president sitting with us but before we do that people always tell us they're like yo you got to do ideas with the guests meaning they want to hear okay you're so hell you see a bunch of different things you see a bunch of different worlds what opportunities do you see that you think some people somebody should be doing or a cool startup idea cool business idea a niche opportunity something maybe you're not doing or whatever do you have any kind of ideas on your cheat sheet yeah I've got three for you guys okay uh let's go through them so so first on the agency side just because I think there are two really obvious ones that like honestly anyone that's listening could probably go action on this if they wanted one is um like LinkedIn growth agency stuff um massive opportunity here I mean like you you guys know a couple of our friends me and a couple of friends are starting like a spin-off agency that's just going to focus on LinkedIn because it's a massive Arbitrage opportunity right now in audience growth Twitter has become a lot more saturated because of the like red boy thing and how many people are going and doing it LinkedIn like you I mean you can go post a few things and immediately be like getting the 10K plus and for Founders and like business Builders there's so much business on those platforms it's huge for recruiting so basically if you were to go start this the way I would do it I would go like go to someone who has a Twitter presence and you can go create like Tweet pic uh Pik is the like web service that I use for it and you can basically just turn tweets that are like proven with social proof into these like carousels on LinkedIn that are the big growth hack on LinkedIn and if you go do that for them and just say like look I'll take over your entire LinkedIn presence you never have to open LinkedIn because people hate opening LinkedIn and you just go and create carousels for them off of proven tweets and then go post it for them like two three times a week off their tweets yeah off their tweets um off their tweets or off of like other writing that exists that they've put out like say they've written blogs like I don't know I mean if you went and found uh you know say it's like Ryan holiday and he's written a ton of blogs that are all over the place but doesn't have a massive LinkedIn presence you can go like turn his blogs into just shorter form writing that you put into posts on LinkedIn and say hey I'll post for you three times a week you never have to log in don't even worry about it and we'll grow you to like 50K by the end of this year either pay as like you know charge us like a success fee like if you get to this level you pay me this or you just say like pay me five grand a month and I'll do this for you two and a half Grand a month and I'll do this for you and the amount of time it would take you is literally like I mean you could probably do like an hour a week to cover a single person to like you know call it four hours a month and make five grand it's like an awesome awesome Arbitrage opportunity so that's one like any thoughts on that Sam I I think it's awesome yeah I've been doing a similar thing so I hired this guy as a content remixer for me and um basically it was take content from the pod or or Twitter and remix it into content on other platforms and I focused on link I focused him on LinkedIn because I thought thought the thing you just said I had kind of a hypothesis that that's true and uh I'm now at 38 000 followers on LinkedIn and I haven't opened LinkedIn once so if you see something on LinkedIn stop me writing it it's me I mean the same thing happened to me but it's not me writing that but hold on Sean so you got 38 000 let's say that you post by the way this is like in two months or something like that let's say you post a product that cost or your power writing thing let's say it's a thousand dollars and you sell a thousand dollar thing to your 38 000 followers how much revenue will you make from that I don't know haven't tested it uh sahil you might know better but I also haven't been doing it for long enough I wouldn't expect to be able to get value because I don't think I've given enough yet like with Twitter same thing you know like people see oh man you guys just you can sell a course you can just like say you're doing this new thing you get a bunch of sign ups like yeah but I've been doing this podcast for three years do you know 300 episodes you know hundreds of hours of content that somebody's listened to so yeah they trust you and they know they've come to a decision whether you're smart and interesting or whether you're full of [ __ ] and they've you've done they've made that that they've done all that work and I've done all that work beforehand so then would you make an offer it's just a simple yes or no um it doesn't fit their life does it does do they think it'll drive value they already trust that you could do it on LinkedIn I wouldn't bet that that would happen yet because it's just been so uh recent yeah I think you have to get I mean there's like a there's like a low there's a bar that I think you have to get over from a follower account standpoint if you use that as a proxy before you can like conceivably Harvest value you gotta like you know plant enough seeds over a period of time to Sean's point I think like 100k is probably the point at which you can start harvesting value from LinkedIn Justin Welsh is this guy that you might have seen on Twitter or LinkedIn he was like kind of like Godfather LinkedIn influencer and I think that dude now is making like 100k Plus on not even cohort based courses just like Auto courses that he generally just promotes through Linkedin he like he has a newsletter now that he's built through Linkedin like built on the back of LinkedIn and now he's bigger on Twitter because he's managed to like cross across all of those but he's doing over 100k a month in uh in sales revenue on his uh on his courses which are just like you know they're just they're they're not cohort based so he's like putting in no no time now dude got them stood up this is interesting Sean have you seen what sahil's been doing on Instagram on Instagram now so basically your boy's blowing up so listen to this so uh around the same just Dad content no listen it was just hair it's just mostly hair and shirts and uh ABS traps but uh around the same time so saho and I uh both around the same time we're like all right let's take Instagram seriously so I started doing it and I was beating him nicely adding a thousand people today I think I started with 5 000 people and I got to like 48 or 50 000 in a very short amount of time and he was doing his thing I was like you need to post twice a day I think and he starts doing that and then he just kind of like has rocketed past me now he's got to 62 000 followers in a very short amount of time adding one or two thousand people a day and he's doing this exact same thing where he's taking his tweets that do well and just posting them on his Instagram and like so two points here one there's a world where this is just total vanity nonsense and a complete distraction from people who have like their main thing on the other hand what I'm curious about is how much revenue can this drive to people if their goal is not to be a famous person their goal is just to sell more [ __ ] of whatever their own they own already and so I'm curious sahil is have you if kids well this does this actually drive revenue for things other than yeah I mean right now right now it's generating about a so Instagram this past month I think generated a thousand newsletter subs for me just through the link in my bio um and that's like you know on average I probably had 35 000 followers um during the month and it generated that many so conceivably as it continues to scale it'll drive you know well north of that as it uh as it moves and if you think a newsletter subscriber form is worth you know just off of my sponsor Revenue probably like three to four dollars per sub and then if you take into account my book that's gonna come where it's like extremely valuable to me if they buy a book um I mean it's a bunch of money a month that's coming off this that scales over time right and that's just Instagram and you think about LinkedIn that's another Big Driver um you know all these platforms so and like I mean they're ghost writing agencies there are people selling products mostly on Instagram without ever posting like their face these guys are literally like making carousels of images and stuff and they're doing 50 to 100K of Revenue through it what's an example of that there's this guy uh Dakota Robertson like wrongs to write I think it says like Twitter handle and maybe that's his Instagram handle too um and he's got like I don't know 250 000 followers now on on Instagram and like blew up real fast they're just from posting his viral tweets over to over to Instagram like almost never shows his face um and dude has a thriving ghost riding business through this gotcha I'm torn because on one hand uh you are like perfect execution of a strategy that I now hate and so I'm like respect to you but I'm like I don't even want to talk about this because I know what's gonna happen is there's now gonna be 9 000 new people who go this podcast gonna breed nine thousand new people that are gonna go be like this is my thing I'm gonna do this he said I can make you know x amount of money per month and their execution is going to be nowhere near yours um and in general this is like a it's like a pathway that definitely works but it's like um like the soul sucking yeah it's like it's like getting closing and it provides activity is closing that's an important Point yeah I do think like look I mean when I started writing the threads I mean Sean you were the same way right like any thread you wrote would blow the hell up early on because there just weren't that many of them and so it was like it's a market it wasn't saturated now it's pretty hard to get a thread to like really take off unless you're doing the like 10 YouTube channels that will change your life for free which is the things that it's like getting fit through Power walking is power walking gonna burn calories yeah yeah for sure are you probably not going to get injuries yeah but like you have to look like a doofus doing it in the process everyone in the neighborhood's gonna know you is that weirdo power walking like you know what I mean and I'm guilty of this too right like I did this strategy as well of being like Oh I'm gonna create content for for you know for fun initially this podcast Twitter that sort of thing and then oh [ __ ] okay if I kind of sell five percent of my soul or ten percent of my soul to the algorithm I think I can get this bigger okay I started doing that and then it's like oh I can make good money doing this and I you know make some money doing that and that feels fun but like I just want to say as a public service announcer there's some people who are going to go do this but let's say you're somebody who's awesome I'm just gonna say this now this was awesome to do when it wasn't figured out now that it's figured out this is a certified official small boy stuff and I do not recommend this to anybody else uh and I myself have stopped doing this too I haven't posted a threat and but if you are interested in this laid-back [ __ ] style is perfect execute that's the difference though anything like I I've I'm sitting in this house because of it I I tweeted this as a lovely house I got a lovely house I go I write no I mean look you do you you have to figure out what the what the area is where you're gonna do it that's not crazy saturated and cringe and and to your point like you got to figure out what percent cringe are you willing to be like if writing a thread is 10 cringe like what level above that just natural Baseline when are you gonna figure that out are you talking me what I'm willing to accept that um already like 10 of people just immediately see it and they're like oh this is super cringe and then you just have to decide like what level you're willing to go above that if 100 is like 10 Chrome extensions that'll change your life and 50 is like uh you know here like the TED Talks that change my life what's like 20 is it some of the stuff I post probably and like if that helps a few people out there and like a bunch of people get pissed and think that it's not for them I don't really give a [ __ ] personally like if I help one person and you know someone hits me up and says like hey that changed my perspective on X Y or Z that's what garyvee's been doing for decades man that guy's a legend of putting out content that's like listicles and like you know like motivational stuff Tony Robbins like Grant Cardone these guys like they get hate because it freaking works and it helps people right so I don't know the thing I would say like have you ever been to a Tony Robbins event yeah and uh I'm sure if you went to like you went to what like at least the power within or something yeah great I went to loved it thought it was amazing I don't know if you liked it you could give it a quick reaction but I have a different point yeah um I love it I mean I love Tony Robbins stuff me too and he gets on stage and he's doing all the things that you could Chris besides somebody for he's he's clapping he's saying get up and jump he's saying when I say uh you know he's going to ask a very basic question and the only answer is yes but the whole crowd says yes like a cult and you're like oh he's doing all the things but he's doing it at like an A plus plus level he totally probably in my opinion the best public speaker I've ever seen uh and I've seen a lot I'm still like Obama yeah yeah he he is he I think he's even more powerful than Obama because Obama is smooth but Obama doesn't get people Tony Robbins to get you to walk across coals and like shout your greatest fear out loud I've never seen Obama control a crowd for 12 straight hours like Tony Robbins will do in an event but here's what happens you look around in the crowd and you're like there's a whole spectrum of people at the one I was in it was like there were celebrities there you know the the guy from 300 what's his name Gerald Butler he was there he was like right two rows down from me I was like wow this is interesting there's some interesting people here and then in the hallways I would meet a bunch of people that thought they were the next Tony Robbins and they were life coaches and motivational speakers and and they were you know change consultants and every cringed name you could think of and then you go look at their stuff and it's the same concept but not executed at that level because they didn't have the hard one life experiences that that guy had to actually like create this content they didn't have 40 Years of sharpening their craft and becoming the best they didn't have the natural talents and Charisma and you know Larger than Life presence and so you can you can look at the best you can look at the garyvee's in the Tony Robbins you can look at you on Twitter and say that's dope you know I could do that and some people a very small amount of people can do that but for most people they will fall into the pit of cringe because they're not going to execute it at that same level they didn't have those hard-won lessons of actually knowing what they're talking about and uh and they're going to end up in this like weird middle ground and uh I think that's the scary part I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling database HubSpot grow better I mean that's kind of like um that's like any Market though right like you know someone starts a company and it's the a plus version of some like a restaurant chain someone starts a restaurant chain it's like the a plus of that thing and then a bunch of people come in to try to mimic it and it's like the b-plus version and you know like whatever like say in and out is the A Plus Burger version and someone tries to come in and start the like five guys or whatever next I'm probably gonna get hate for saying in and outs better than five guys but you know whatever like you kind of have the diluted versions and the question is like hey do you care that you're the deluded version of Tony Robbins if you're making money doing it and taking care of your family because like I know a lot of people that are just like I don't give a [ __ ] like you know I grew my audience super cringe stuff and I'm making 25 Grand a month I was making five doing my prior job or ten doing my prior job I'm making this sitting at home and I get spend time with my kids what do I give a [ __ ] if a bunch of tech people think that I'm cringe like I'm making money it is what it is and so I kind of I appreciate that too the other thing I would say is like what game are you playing like what is the long-term game you're playing and for me I was always thinking about like what is the thing I'm trying to build long term like I wasn't trying to be you know a Twitter thread like a thread guy like that's not my long-term vision of what it was it vaulted me from being a nobody private Equity guy as you said to like I signed a book deal last month like a big book deal last month you know like I raised a fund I never would have been able to raise a fund as like this nobody VP in private equity and so to me it's like what are you actually parlaying that [ __ ] into as you continue to go if you're able to find the thing that you think you're a plus at even if it's for a short period of time like how are you using that to Vault yourself into that next level where you're like I'm not even in the same class as these other guys that are doing the thing I was doing previously because I moved into whatever that next you know that like upper echelon is dude are you worried about uh Elon screwing it up for you not really you know what's funny well did you see what he really quick he he like said something and then Steph my old co-worker said like does this mean that like the thread boys are gonna go away and actually forget his reply what did he say but it sounded like he was saying you did like a crying Emoji I mean yeah like I think it was something about he said um you know you could basically like put a long form text onto a tweet so you don't have to like people were used to take a screenshot of like their Notes app on their phone to post a long form thing I think all that stuff is good I mean like look I've already benefited from being early to a market like I grew to a big level I built a brand that now extended into things that I own like the newsletter you know that's gotten quite large and it's growing faster like the funder like the book whatever it is um I would be more worried if I was like just starting out in any one of these things and like had dedicated all this time you know if you've rewound me a year and I was like just starting to get all these things going I'd probably be a little more worried um but the reality is it's like eat or be eaten man if you're if you're not like figuring out the new way to to uh you know be on the front of something and be building in these other areas um you're in for a tough time no matter what let's talk about this newsletter thing um so this is the second idea um biggest issue I have with my newsletter is I want to write it like I love writing that's my number one thing that gives me a lot of energy I freaking hate thinking about and dealing with any of the like business or growth side of the newsletter the business side is very easy to Outsource there's like I mean you know there's there's ad agencies now convertkit has an ad Network where they'll manage the whole back end of your newsletter they'll bring in sponsors for it they'll send you the money it's like super super easy it's amazing Nathan crushed it getting that thing out there but the like growth side of newsletters is completely untouched there's no one out there that I've been able to find that is like a full sweet growth service for your newsletter and when I say growth Suite I literally mean like I want someone thinking about my landing pages and optimizing that I want someone thinking about referral networks newsletter swaps I want someone thinking about paid ads you know SEO for my website to drive Subs how to optimize it across my different social channels literally just someone that's sitting around thinking about growth for the newsletter so that I can just focus on writing and I'd literally be willing to pay I mean my willingness to pay at the size of newsletter that I'm at now and given what newsletter Subs are worth to me is very high like I would easily pay 10 grand a month to someone that could figure that out and do it in one place on top of whatever I would spend on paid ads Etc do you think that that thing work week is going to do that uh no dude I mean like uh I don't know how much you guys know about where I don't know a whole ton about work week but from what I can tell it's mostly the like back-end Services of news letters and there's another one called Smooth Ops that I think spun out from morning Brew didn't work week spun out of the hustle didn't it not spun out they uh they worked for the guy was there yeah same thing with the morning Brew um smooth Ops like my understanding of all those is that they're much more focused on like helping you monetize and um you know managing your like business that you can focus on writing I literally just want someone that just all they think about all day like a an absolute killer that's just all they think about is growth I mean Sean did you have someone I mean or was Ben like that at milk Road my guy was right Sean no Ben Ben was the guy he woke up every day and just said how do we get more subscribers and like you know that's that was his mission and that's what he did so uh you know that's the but you know we needed it's like if you don't have a that was like more of a company uh whereas like you know most people's personal things are not like you're at a size where there's just not that many newsletters that are at your size um that can afford to pay for something like that um you know how many people how many people could afford to pay 10K per month to try to drive growth so I think a lot so my hypothesis is so I tweeted this um and a bunch of people were like replying saying they would pay for it in different ways my hypothesis is that there's a ton of like successful Founders and entrepreneurs that want to build a newsletter an owned list or like an essay type thing like what Sam Altman or Paul Graham have where they have you know SEO and newsletter you know like emails that are coming to them and they're willing to pay a lot because they actually have been successful and just have a bunch of money they don't need it to be Revenue generating out at the outset um and I think you I mean I bet if you developed some sort of core competency and basically like partner say someone partnered with me and proved it out over like two three months hey it drove this and then were able to use me as a case study maybe I own a percentage of it you know on the upside and so I'm incented to like bring them new referrals I bet you could grow a pretty big business there quickly yeah you only need like 20 clients basically to make this like you know worth your while yeah I mean if it's a personal business you don't even need 20 clients I mean you can get 10 at five a month or 10 at 10 a month and you have like you know it's 80 80 plus percent margin probably business if you just find it simple but are you having the headache of having a service business yeah I mean yeah it's definitely not products like I've thought about starting an agency like maybe 20 times my life and then literally five minutes later every single time I'm like don't go in the service business don't go in the service business now I we have several friends that have done it right like you know Andrew Wilkinson did it with meta lab our buddy Greg has done a great job with it with late checkout you're doing it now with your thing so you know maybe I have the wrong bias here what do you think I mean what you have to do is hire a great operator if you want to be the like owner of some percentage of it and not have the headaches you got to just recruit a killer operator who's gonna run all of it I mean that's what we're doing with the spin out agency that we're doing now around LinkedIn stuff is like just gonna hire someone exceptional and give them like 15 of the ups and just say like you're a hustler you're a killer you can get a whole ton man that's my finance teams man really that's the that's the uh that's the no-name PE guy coming out of me right there um I thought earlier guy was a guy who likes you know dodgeball and recess like that's what PE is to me earlier he was talking about Beta And I was like you're talking about nerds I don't understand what the [ __ ] what the hell is beta it is a good thing yeah it's like a good thing I was like I don't understand what that means you're kind of a low beta guy actually Sam if I think about it like you kind of you're kind of like even key like I feel like I know within a band what I'm gonna get out of you any any given day I I think you're complimenting me but I don't understand I I you know you like you show up you tweeted about that recently you hate when people say they're gonna do something and then not do it like you so you take pride in being low beta like people know what they can expect from you on a given day by the way what a what a stupid thing to tweet yeah like I like long walks in the beach and movies like who who likes somebody who says they're gonna do something and doesn't do it what an obvious tweet yeah first of all give me the clout that I deserve like don't hate when it's Silo say don't hate number two I'm not saying it's like people who say they're afraid of heights like yeah everyone's afraid of heights but like you just like some people that just like I you know it's like what's high on your list I don't think that uh I don't know like like there's a lot of things that annoy you Sean that that don't annoy me and vice versa like what's one thing that annoys you Sean that you don't make a noise Sam I don't think anything annoys him nothing annoys me that's the beauty of it wait really you don't think anything bothers you no I think yeah now I want to dig it bothers you I uh I guess what bothers me is only usually things with myself so like if I find myself in a bad mood or like getting annoyed with something or getting bothered by something or getting impatient with something that's actually the thing that bothers me I'm like oh man I let this get to me like for like that second that's the thing that gets to me right so usually it's not something that frustrates me or annoys me it's usually either impatient or boredom or um feeling cranky or tired or something like that you know like and I'm like oh no I I don't want to be that way that that bothers me so for years I used to say that Sean I was like I was like I think I'm gonna have a pretty steady path to wealth creation and Sean you either gonna like it's not gonna be as extreme I think we joked around with Minister B's for like you know six out of ten times if you were reborn you would be a degenerate like Gambler or drug addict and like four four out of ten times you'd be successful with Sean it's not that bad but it's like you know you're gonna you're the type of guy who can rolls the dice and like you might actually hit it big there's a good chance or you might like just be only okay for a long time and now uh so I was basically saying yeah your likelihood I think of being a billionaire is actually higher than mine um but your likelihood of being like a degenerate is probably also higher yeah High beta yeah but here's the problem with Sean I've just realized over the past handful of months he is too emotionally healthy to probably be incredibly successful he has this problem that few people have which is he's just happy you know what I mean he's got this it's just this it depends on your definition of success man I would argue that Sean is the most successful then man if he's like super happy yeah you need to find sex by success by these superficial things like happiness and well-being and all that [ __ ] stupid stuff yeah I do I will say that Sean has had more like high highs and low lows this year at least for my like perceived view but it's not our group text and like and he's totally unfazed like Sean I mean look flashback to like you know a like crypto crash right I'm like yo Sean's down bad I'm texting Sam I'm like is Shawn okay like Sean's texting the group chat totally fine I'm like yo Sean broke like is Sean doing margin called right now like I have no idea what's going on and then Sean's like yo I sold all my stock and I was like holy [ __ ] Sean sold the bottom Sean sold the bottom like Mark it's roaring in June and then the market crashes again and Sean's a genius traitor that like sold the top of the market or something this dude is just like does that stuff bother you at all Sean like first of all what person uh prior to selling a business recently but what uh was your Network down just a significant amount yeah probably I mean it's hard to calculate that sort of thing so but let's say liquid of the liquid stuff so I'm not counting equity in companies uh you know it's probably down 50 or something like that I mean most of the Investments I I didn't keep much cash this is my investment strategy pre-2022 right so my best value is pre-22 was Cash is trash and you know fist bumps all around to my boys who thought the cash was trash then um oh dude is there a safer investment than Amazon this blue chipper right like that's my version of of safety is yeah I'm gonna put in some boring tech companies you know the Amazons Googles Facebooks of the world what could go wrong and um and then lastly you know then you know a huge amount of startups that were uh that were you know getting marked up like crazy fist bumps all around getting my UPS because my UPS was going ups and then the last thing was crypto and I was like oh well see your boy's a genius and moved a huge percentage of his net net worth into you know Bitcoin and ethereum and um oh and then this Luna [ __ ] that's popping I'm doing great so you know that's that was me before so basically every single thing I had invested in has gone you know what's my you know that was that thing like my terrible horrible no good very bad day like I was basically having that for this year in terms of Investments but you know whatever did it bother you well I mean I like losing money but like you know did I let it bother me no like you know I basically steps no I took steps I was like okay well what matters here like okay let me just first get perspective uh you know am I in any kind of hardship is my family doing poor no they're they're fine right secondly what should I actually do do I need to make some adjustments was I wrong about certain things or should I do some things to give myself more comfort so why did I sell I sold I basically margin called myself I was like you know what I think things are gonna go lower and I don't want to sweat this all the time so I'm gonna sell this amount here so that I don't have to worry about anything I'm gonna move more into cash and I'm gonna book this loss because I think that'll that'll offset against some gains that I have this year and um you know then I won't have to think about this stuff for a little while I'll focus on these other things that I want to be focusing on because I'm not a Trader I'm not a like investment genius so that's not going to be my goal and then um yeah it'll just I don't know that I I never got my happiness from when it was going up so why would I get my sadness from when it's going down didn't make sense to me you must have felt good when Luna like I think you you originally plugged Luna in milk Road at like 40. and I like I bought some I was like yo Sean's pretty smart he knows this crypto [ __ ] hands down and so I like I bought a bag like I you know I'm not like I'm not really a degenerate crypto guy but I like bought a bag of Luna and that [ __ ] went up to like 118 and I was like yo Sean is my God like uh Sean what other what other ideas do you have and then I we were supposed to interview on our old pod we were supposed to interview dokon like I had hit him up on Twitter he's supposed to come on the pod on like a Thursday and on that Sunday like Luna had been wavering like it had come down to like 80 or something and I get an email from his assistant that just says uh unfortunately uh doe will have to reschedule the interview for this Thursday and I'm sitting in bed and I'm like I got a little bit of the heebie-jeebies like I don't know what this is so I go downstairs and I sell my entire bag at like I don't know a small gain like not not good I sell the whole thing next morning I wake up and that shit's at like five like the whole the whole thing unraveled overnight and then I get an email from his assistant saying like he's going to have to cancel the interview and I'm like yeah well this dude has a red notice out for him no [ __ ] he's not coming on our podcast at this point yeah that was that was a bad day I was on vacation I was in Hawaii with my family and I'm watching my time and I'm like I don't even have I'm not even at my computer like I can't even get to my crypto like it's not like on my laptop or whatever so I'm like well couldn't couldn't make a move if I wanted to uh so I guess I'll just like you know lose all this money here and uh you know just enjoy this vacation there's nothing else I could do at this point you were remarkably cool about it I remember texting with you that day the um the framework you've talked about in the past that I love around this stuff is your um local versus tourist thing I think that's so good of like you know uh tourists like freak out when the seasons change and Just Bounce yeah and locals are aware that there are seasons and that you know it comes in swings and they're aware of the environment so they can stick it out and be fine through it I've always just thought there's a third one which is the like stubborn and local like the dude that lives in the Coastal Village and is like ah Global warming's not real and then he's [ __ ] underwater and like drowning and he's like ah Global warming's not real as he drowns and so I'm always just like how do you make sure that you don't go from being the like the local and you're proud of being a local to the stubborn local that just sits there until you die yeah that's the hardest thing and I remember with startups this was always the question because you'll hear a story like Pinterest had no traction for over a year and then finally started to work because he walked into an Apple store and like started putting Pinterest as a default homepage on these you know he hustled he was determined and it's like oh okay got it so determination just keep going even when all the data's telling you that this ain't working and then there's like the exact other advice which is like yo you got to be super data driven feedback oriented you got to listen to the market all that matters is are you making something people want and if you have no users you got to like you know make adjustments you got to Pivot and so the hardest question as a Founder is to know am I being the right kind of stubborn right so am I being stubborn because I'm right and I need to you know just tweak just make small adjustments and just stay at it be determined and be persistent or am I banging my head against the wall and I need to listen to the to the signals and I need to be changing my mind and nobody can give the generic advice about when to do what it's super it's like super context dependent super circumstance dependent same thing with investing right like you know am I should I should I should I still believe in something even you know do I believe in Facebook stock now that it's getting crushed right and for me I went and bought more recently because I was like uh you know what do I believe about this company and has that changed so the tourist first local right is you got to ask yourself like does the thing I believed about this has that changed do I have new information that makes me update my thinking here um do I am I you know am I holding on to this position just so that I don't feel like I'm wrong right like you know am I am I willing to upset except being wrong you gotta ask yourself all these questions and be able to be honest with yourself and that changed uh with crypto has what sorry has your opinion of crypto changed and your conviction um no my my opinions my conviction has stayed the same but that's about crypto as a whole right then on each specific maybe project or coin you might have like a slightly different opinion you know well what's what's one thing that you think is [ __ ] now that you didn't think was [ __ ] a year and a half ago so I'll give you an example where that's not true then I'll give an example where that's true so the not true one is like let's take Luda for example the the bet on Luna was always knowing that there's this the way it was architect it was this thing is gonna rock it up because the sort of the what they call the ponza economics right like the game theory incentive uh yeah but people don't understand like basically it's just like economic a series of economic incentives and so the incentives were were aligned such that this thing should go up during the during you know when as certain participants behave a certain way and from the beginning there was always these blog posts out there about what does the death cycle look like so what if this reversed course would this not because Luna's the collateral would it not cause it to you know collapse really fast and the question was like will that happen won't that happen so even when you invested at the beginning we wrote Our Little investment memo to ourselves about like here's our one pager why we think this is a good idea and why we think this could go horribly wrong when it crashed it wasn't like something we never had never thought of it was oh yeah that downside scenario we talked about that's exactly what happened right like basically there was a giant you know cell pressure that CR that caused that cascading down cycle yep that we always thought that could happen we had hoped it wouldn't happen we had thought that maybe there was a you know there would be a way to to put by pressure back against it but nope it wasn't going to work and so this is very fast example of basically just because it turned out bad doesn't mean that the um doesn't mean I changed my position because actually at the beginning we said well here's why I'm not putting my entire net worth into this right I put 250k into it that's not like a a massive bet for me uh it's a solid-sized bet right so it's like you know I put an appropriately sized bet because I thought it had upside and I thought there was some some key risks with it the thing that I would say I've changed my opinion most on is I thought man if people start to worry about inflation and they look at man you know I have the same 100K in my bank but it just doesn't buy me the same amount it used to right they'll realize like people will become more aware that the money they have is diminishing the cash they have the US dollars they have is diminishing in value that they will probably look to go to a monetary system that doesn't have that problem and so the idea that Bitcoin will do well if people start to if if inflation becomes something that people are more and more worried about with the US dollar and that hasn't happened inflation got as bad as it's ever been but people's response was more conservative than aggressive people did not make a change to the Bitcoin monetary system which would not have that problem um they sort of you know sort of stuck with it and actually the US Dollars gained strength because other currencies got crushed even worse and so the dollars gained strength so that was one that I had thought that this was this is what would happen it makes me reassess was my logic incorrect or um or something else you know what what did I get wrong about this idea that in a high inflation environment Bitcoin should be something that people start moving more into I mean the Bitcoin one is actually pretty interesting Sean because I've thought about that a lot too of is there is there something just like in the segmentation of how the price went up that is impacting that because I still think basically my assumption of why that didn't happen like why that you know scenario of high inflation and people flood into this is that most of the price increase was actually just driven by this like number go up you know crazy uh you know loose monetary policy people just pump into speculative you know high risk assets and that it wasn't really driven by like Believers like you who underlying were like oh there's really good fundamentals the technology really makes sense driving it up it was mostly just like my random friends who were like haha Bitcoin number go up this is great and then they freaked out when it went the other direction and pulled out you know interest rates rise and you pull out I wonder whether like if you segmented it somehow of like the true underlying technology Believers my guess would be that the picture would look different like people that really are like thinking about the technology and thinking about the underlying um you know kind of like monetary policy that exists on the network my guess would be those people think that this is a great time to be accumulating and buying yeah I think you're right um I think you're right but basically it's just in my mind it was like a very simple picture it was like you're playing one game and the rules of this game are that the bank gives you some money it's my game of Monopoly where the bank gives you some money but every year your money becomes worth a little bit less by Design they're trying to make a two or three percent worse per year but sometimes if it gets 10 worse per year right or nine percent worse per year right that's the the game is is set up that way and hey oh yo there's this other new edition of Monopoly that came out or that doesn't happen to your money my assumption was like oh people will just start to move to the new edition because they're not gonna like when their money becomes less valuable over time uh but I I don't think that's the message that's gone across it was basically bitcoin's how you get rich or Bitcoins how you lose your money and that's the narrative that actually like played out uh because it was more it was more aggressive but uh Bitcoin will make you rich was it easier sell to people yeah and it was also the reason why they'll start to sell their Bitcoin when they real when they feel like oh bitcoin's crashing by the way I've got one more non-agency business idea for you what is non-services maybe it's slightly certain not that much Services more product uh mobile podcast and video Studio yeah man dude it's such a pain in the butt dude huge pain in the ass buy like a few vans get them out with like a pretty fire setup just in the back of like a normal sized band doesn't even have to be an RV for like two to three people could fit deck it out with like a few good DSLR cameras that can do the recording like dual camera setups that you have like a few mics hanging off the sides and basically go and post it up in a couple of major cities like one band in each major city it has like dope backgrounds cool lighting like you know whatever do the neon signs and [ __ ] in there and rent it out for like 500 bucks for two hours to do podcast recordings or like you know a couple hundred bucks to do like people going in and filming Instagram shorts tick tocks [ __ ] like that like if you put one in LA and you put one in New York City I bet you could kill it on a cash on cash return on one of those I just joined this gym called the collective in Austin and it's like this like fancy whatever like and everyone there looks like an Instagram model and they have uh like co-working there as well but they also have three Studios for podcast and picture taking like they just they just really don't know their audience and I went there and everyone looks like they're the type of person who is like if you follow a shirtless rip guy on uh Instagram and they live in Austin they're probably a member here and I mean if you catch them on bad lighting they don't even look that good but like somehow in that lighting you'd look unreal I I I I think you're making fun of me uh I don't know I think makes a huge difference with uh with these like Instagram models right so like you just get good Lighting on one of those things I bet you could wait I do think these like mobile Studio though you could crush it let me ask you I'm looking at these uh U-Haul box trucks so how much do these cost to buy so it looks like you could buy a used one of these for like 25 Grand right so 25 Grand and let's say and you only have to put five down yeah you put five down you're probably gonna need to put another five into the kit like to make the the thing work uh and you probably need to do operating the thing but maybe maybe you could get rid of that probably not you probably have to have an operator on site so I think that's the that's the tricky part where you got to sell it as a membership basically it's got to be a gym membership uh so it's like you could use this studio you could just book it when it's free um but you got to be like a monthly member if you're you know if you're doing 500 a month or whatever and you have a studio on demand that's a genius idea to do it as a membership actually because dude the thing that made me think of this is like in New York now there's these couple of Studios where people are doing all like in-person podcasts like there's this like what the [ __ ] media is one of them yeah I go to a stream and they're like they're solid they're not great but they're having to pay New York City rent to like to do this and so I can't imagine the economics are that great if you got a truck and you just bought it you could go post this thing up in a parking lot and every two two hours just moved to a different parking lot and like you never have to pay rent you're paying the you know like carrying cost of the of the truck and you're paying the whatever five to ten Grand it takes you to actually we're gonna get the truck we're gonna call it mudio the mobile Studio mudio the mudio boys we might get a branding agency to work on the name but yeah wait let me ask you something deafening silence as feedback on your name but it's not let me ask you a question so Sean and I are trying to get popular on YouTube right now with this with this thing and one thing that's kind of the elephant in the room when everyone talks to you I mean I know Sean talks about this constantly is that you are just ridiculously good looking do you think that this shtick of yours of having good hair and being good looking is is that image working for you and what aesthetic shtick should Sean and I have first off calling it a shtick is pretty hilarious to me um you know this chick you have it's like oh my face thing yeah yeah like let's talk about it the platforms that are visual it obviously helps to like when people are scrolling through things for like people to stop and say oh the person is like attractive right like it just when you're scrolling can you see an attractive girl you're saying you're hot it helps us you agree was that a Mean Girls I'm a millennial through and through the fact that I knew that it was a Mean Girls reference is just as telling you are a big girl um no look I mean for you guys uh you're both good looking dudes am I gonna sell you short Sam you've got like a little look with the like fake glasses I don't think those have a prescription on them they're definitely fake dude and then and then Sean Sean's got the like you know my favorite line that Sean ever had is uh you know if you're not gonna be good looking be interesting looking and I tell that to like everyone that I give advice to it Sean's not interesting looking man look at this beard he's got the salt dude like he looks like literally every single person who shops at like a generic grocery store in the suburbs what's wrong with us that's a little bit of a Vibe but that's not interesting I don't know man I mean I think you guys can play up the whole like your stick of these two guys that look completely different that are like somehow friends like you guys are like cat dog man you remember that show back in the day we're going for it we're going for like why are these guys famous that's what we need to do if we just get over the hump so it's possible like this these guys that there's nothing special about them but that's our thing though that there's nothing special I don't think you have to be that good looking on YouTube by the way like you guys don't need to be like models on YouTube um if you like look at the people that have crushed on YouTube it's not like hot dudes and hot chicks on YouTube necessarily not that you guys aren't hot I don't want you to come away I don't want Sam to text me later being like hey man what you said because I know I'm gonna get that text later tonight from Sam wait but you're wrong hot dudes do better on YouTube I don't think they do better I don't think that's right I mean I'm not on YouTube yet I'm gonna get on YouTube here soon and I'll let you know whether we think that's true so you're saying you think you're hot yeah you got this real burden you're carrying my friend well like Alex hermosi's got the thing where he wears like those stupid cut off jeans now and and he's just like yoked that nose nose strip and like the No Strings level of of being being muscular that's perfect example of you don't have to be great looking you got to be interesting looking yeah dude he's peacock and hardcore and it's kind of just a look it's a look man and like each of you guys has a look and if you can just stick to a consistent look it's like Chris Saka with his Cowboy shirts like you need your thing yeah I've been actually I've been thinking about this for a long time I've been needing a uniform I tweeted this out I go I'm looking for a uniform I want to look the same every time I'm on this podcast so I need something that from here up like a robe It's gotta be yeah maybe a robe It's gotta be signature and um I'm in the market so I'm taking suggestions I'm gonna put a bounty on this actually I'm gonna give a thousand dollar bounty to anybody who can help me develop my the chest up look that's what I'm looking at I kind of want to see you do like a traditional Indian attire for it like it could be kind of fire if you were wearing like a dope like kurta or like you know some sort of like Indian you know up top I think that'd be kind of fire Sean Puri it could be part of your whole like angle with the name and stuff that's true okay you're eligible for the Bounty right now I might I might throw into it I also might match it just because I think it's gonna be funny to see you heard it here I'll throw in a thousand I'll throw in a thousand on top of it issues before he's on the hook for a thousand yeah no I'm not I don't I don't give it a peer pressure this is the stupidest thing ever I'm not gonna give someone a thousand dollars they can still tell Sean what t-shirt to wear you have a signature look already so it's easier for you to say yeah kind of like no you've got like a little like the pretty boy thing going with the like non-prescription not a grandfather type of thing yeah it's good yeah you are gonna be like you're gonna be a quintessential father you're gonna have a lot of stern talks with your child I already know it's coming uh I don't know what to say to this thank you yeah yeah I want to hear this before you go what is the grand plan what is the Grand Vision for yourself so you went from No Name PE guy that as we established to to Legendary thread boy to uh now CNBC contributor book deal guy author I think you're gonna be president is that I I joke about that a lot but I I genuinely believe you could become the president someday if you wanted to do you have a grand plan for yourself what's the vision I could see that being in the cards long term running for public office I don't know if president is a role that you necessarily want I think it's like probably one of the hardest and worst jobs in the world you guys go in like Obama went in looking young and then he you know leaves all gray like looking you know looking rough it's like the highest stress job in the world running for governor would be I don't know that could be pretty funny to be a governor of a state do you know anything about politics I've never known you to be studied public policy I did I did my Master's in public policy dude oh yeah so that was always like what I wanted to do I mean I took a class on basket weaving like that doesn't like what like you know do you think the people that are serving in public office today know a lot about politics it's like what is it's sort of like the naval thing of like you don't read a business book to no business like there's no such thing as politics it's like you know are you a reasonable thinker do you have the ability to change your mind which right now politicians do not and can you inspire people do you would you get people to move on things which party would you be I don't even know I'm an independent man so I mean I've I've voted Democrat I voted Republican in Prior election so I actually I actually don't know what party I probably I'm hoping that a third party Rises over the next 20 years before I actually go do this because I hate the direction that you know like polar politics has gone um you know it's just like the loudest minority on each side I could see you being a good politician because you pretty much never take a stand on anything kind of like what you just did you're like I I always call it I'm like you're a PC like the rock man you never say anything inappropriate like you you you you you are like like the rock well yes but he never takes a stand on anything he's always he Hedges everything he says you you could be beautiful for a politician all right well I'm counting on your fundraising for support Tim I'll even introduce you as my hot friend Sam when you come up to the speech at my uh at my future thank you you're already doing it for me then you're already lying you're already lying we got good politician uh well thanks for coming on where what do you want to do you want to promote

we talked to this guy Dan ariely he wrote this book predictably irrational Panda Express it paid him a bunch of money we have healthy items on the menu and people tell us the reason they don't eat here is because it's unhealthy but nobody orders the healthy item and he's like oh humans are predictably irrational they'll tell you one thing and then they won't do it the one test he had made was when you walk into a Panda Express instead of putting both items on the menu and just having you choose it was right when you walked through the door we would say there was like a little angel path it's like if you're gonna eat healthy go this way and there was like the devs you're gonna eat indulgently you know like if you want full flavor go this way and when people make that choice upon walking in and then they only see a menu of those items they were happier with their choice and they ordered more of those items that was the only way he could design this restaurant to do that one thing

somebody in our group chat knows this guy who did this and he shared a text message that the guy sent before he did it so he goes um he goes yo bro and the person says what's up he goes are you doing anything in the next hour want to help me pull off a stunt I'm at the gym and I need a box LOL I'm gonna walk out in front of the Twitter office with a box in my hand there's hella TV Crews outside [Laughter] [Music] so Elon takes over Twitter I guess the purchase went through I feel like there was never like confirmation like he actually wired them on he just literally showed up the office and like yeah there there hasn't been like a proper ribber ribbing ribbing ribbon-cutting moment like it's not like a squatter you just like went into the office and they're like you own it now oh you seem to be here yeah it's mine playground rules like wow that's all it took to have Twitter have you ever heard of uh like a coup like a coup d'etat like with governments uh you know I was I I read a lot of yeah they're pretty cool yeah they are I read a lot of history history jokes or history jokes I read a lot of history books about uh whatever and they talk about like a coup and I'm like so you literally just like walked into the White House and you just said like you know this is mine and like the general has promised me that he's going to convince these soldiers to attack you know what I mean it's like an interesting concept you're like so it's all just made up I guess like these rules that we're we we live by this is just this is fiction and that's kind of like what I felt like he did he just walked he's like well I I own this now thank you have you seen uh you know Derek Lewis the UFC fighter have you seen that compilation of his thing where he says just get up no so they're like Derek uh you're big like knockout artist but like you know the the knock on your's always been like what if you get a wrestling thing you know how's your Jiu Jitsu or your training digital ain't real man and they're like what he's like man you don't need Jiu Jitsu just get up and they're like he's like why I don't want to stay on the ground with another man between my legs no I'm not into that like I'm not gonna do so I'm just gonna get up they're like but you you need Jiu Jitsu to get up he's like I'm just gonna get up and so then there's a clip of him saying that and then there's a it's like a six minute compilation of literally somebody takes him down he doesn't he just stands so powerful that's how I feel that's what Elon Musk did he's like nah just just walk in yeah what do you mean he's like well I'm just gonna walk in with a sink and take it so anyway he does this thing where he just he says this is mine and there's all these reporters outside of Twitter's office and something amazing for a story they're waiting for the story about something going wrong Elon comes here oh there's a protest there's a walk and so what happens is the first big story that happens is there's a picture of these two guys and uh kind of like you know kind of like nerdy sort of engineering looking guys and they're holding giant cardboard boxes and it says these two data scientists the data Engineers data scientists were fired today from Twitter here they're seen walking out with their possessions in their boxes and um and I saw it and immediately something looked a little off because I was like this guy just looks so goofy but I was like man that's pretty believable you know there's a bunch of goofy looking people are working Tech but okay oh my God he looks wild man they really found the perfect character he looks pretty goofy and then I read the name and it says but he but he but he had a box in his hand so he each had a brown box like which is just foreign because like if you work at a tech company like you you don't even probably own anything you own enough just to put in a book put your laptop in your backpack and like if you do get fired do they even like is that a thing where you like hand people a box anymore I don't know what I mean they played it perfectly so then it says Rahul ligma and something Johnson uh Daniel Johnson were fired today blah blah and then and I saw that and I was like oh my God this guy executed a ligman like for those who don't know ligma is a is a little joke that people play on the internet where it's like like you say something about ligma and then something's like ligma what's like I'm not familiar link my nuts right so that's the joke and they did this to basically I think CNBC was the first one who like reported it and then it just kept getting the same photo kept getting spread ever because everybody wanted this story about and the leadership she was this CNBC reporter and I I the original tweet said something like uh we're at the scene of Twitter these two Engineers just came out who said they were the first to be laid off and it's just so clear how defeated they are and like there's like an audible or what does she say she's like there's just a visible uh they're just visibly defeated and totally broken and Rahul ligma says now he has no idea how he's going to be able to afford his Tesla payments and then he's sitting there holding a Michelle Obama book and so it's like him with his box just holding this Michelle Obama book I don't know why and he just said it and she tweeted out like you know this is just they say the first of many that's going to happen it was just like a crazy crazy scene so people are um people are are have heard this part of the story but now we got that my first million exclusive juice on top of it so somebody in our group chat knows this guy who did this and he shared a text message that the guy sent before he did it so he goes um he goes yo bro and the person says sup he goes are you doing anything in the next hour want to help me pull off a stunt I'm at the gym and I need a box LOL I'm gonna walk out in front of the Twitter office with a box in my hand there's hella TV Crews outside and then this is literally how he pulled this up and he just goes he gets an empty box and a Michelle Obama book there's nothing else in the box and we watch out in the TV Crews go for it and so so that was I thought amazing and then he so that was like I mean what kind of Genius is this person then he goes all right there's hella TV Crews let's go get him there he goes he goes bro the media is so dumb I literally put five minutes of planning into this even my uncle in India has seen the picture now he goes he goes the first thing is did you just see the cameras and just walk out there he goes yeah basically I got to the gym it's near Twitter's headquarters I saw all these cameras and so I just went and did it amazing that is so funny the better who is this guy he's like a founder of like a tech startup basically he just did this before Oh my God yeah I am ready to invest and his thing says like stealth startups I'm like I'm ready to invest in whatever he's doing anything on TV there's hella TV cameras name your price ligma so so he goes okay so that was him did you see the interview with the other guy Daniel Johnson no he also had a little gym so his was on videos that they're like you know um how do you feel about this today he's like I don't know I just gotta like I gotta go home I gotta talk to my husband and wife and regroup [Laughter] [Laughter] did anyone comment on that the news didn't even like be like they just played the clip and then I saw that I was like wow that is the funniest thing I've ever heard perfect timing and these guys are like you know comedic Geniuses basically so yeah this is pretty gold amazingly well played um yeah do you want to talk about the Elon war room like what he's actually doing in there like do you want to talk about that or not really have your phone not really I mean like I I read that he said like hey guys you have a week to get this one thing done and I think that that's cool that's that's a good way to run things I'm nervous he's gonna screw it all up and because I make money from Twitter so like I don't want it to go away uh but uh of course chill bro yeah yeah I got Consulting calls to take so um I don't really care though like when he talks about this [ __ ] I'm like this doesn't impact me that much I don't I don't care what you're gonna do well I just want I don't care it's not going to impact me but I do find it interesting how he's going about this so basically the report is he goes in and the first report I thought again was another troll but I guess this is real do you see this he's like he told every engineer to print out all the code that they've committed and they've written in the last three or six months and have it ready for review did you see this why print so you can just see the the page link those and then they change their mind like I guess they realize how bad of an idea that was and like you know an hour later they're like uh Shred the papers actually we're gonna review on the computer just be prepared to review and so people are like all these Engineers like I printed out like you know 300 pages of code so I guess I'll just thread this I don't know what's going on here dude and what's crazy is like if you go to businessinsider.com the headline is like you know I think it says like the toil of working at Twitter and it's like painting it like these people here's there yeah this like this is what it's like to toil Elon musk's Twitter the expectation is literally to work 24 7. and is that really I think that that's I swear to God straight clown Behavior I cannot believe they're doing that I can believe it uh and it says this is it one of the people familiar said describing the feeling of the company under musk your job is on the line it's like dude your job's always on the line uh like is it you know like this is it like it's not your right to work at Twitter you dumbass uh but I I uh I I thought it was funny because like come on man like you're you're coding this yeah you're gonna have to work 50 hours maybe for a little while but also I think a lot of employees at Twitter are probably like this is awesome we've been sitting on our ass let's let's do it and that side doesn't seem to be getting covered a lot yeah and so he created I guess a war room so he basically brought in a bunch of people he trust so he brought in people from his other companies like he brought in his chief legal person that guy's now like the general counsel basically he brought in he created a war room and now here's who's reported to be in the war room it's uh Elon his uh his his chief counsel then it's Jason calacanus oh and then I think Jason's Jason's amazing but like what the hell does he know yeah I guess uh sriram from a16z so just venture capitalist who's a former PM who used to work at Twitter is also you know how to run at Twitter um and Clubhouse and uh Snapchat yeah and then also um I guess like some other people some Engineers or people from uh like boring company or neural link or whatever like some people he trust like his cousin is there like and they basically just set up shop and they were like all right what we're gonna do with this thing and they're like change the logged out page it forces you to sign up now you should be able to read tweets before you sign in you know you sign up and then which is like an experiment's been tried many times before and there's like um you know we need to have this verification program you have five days to deliver this I guess and so there's like sort of uh trying to figure this out of you know who stays who goes what are we building how are we going to turn this thing around and um fascinating I wish I could be a fly on the wall in this uh in this war room I think that would be like probably the most interesting thing to do right now I think it would be awesome um I hope they don't screw it up though because I got some [ __ ] courses I gotta sell so don't screw it up my point of view has always been very simple which is all the things he complains about are things that like power users would be annoyed at on Twitter like the Bots problem or um you know verification or the algorithm you know like not serving me the tweets I want like the problem is that just only I don't know whatever like 300 million people use Twitter and it's like you know five times smaller than like the other big social services and it doesn't really grow that much and like it's not like you know my mom doesn't use Twitter because she's like oh there's too many Bots if I tweet about crypto that will tell me to buy crypto that's not her problem she just doesn't see value in it and like you know he just says I don't get it yeah I don't get it I I don't know why I would need this like you know I don't I don't need to check this whereas Instagram and WhatsApp and like Snapchat have all given her a reason that she needs to have it like she needs to have Snapchat if she wants to see more pictures of her kids she needs to have Instagram if she wants to keep up with what's going on with like Bollywood or whatever right like you know everybody finds a need in the service and like that's the core problem with Twitter is that the core needed addresses is only for like people like us and like it doesn't address the need for a whole bunch of other people on the planet and if they wanted it to be more valuable then they would need to do that foreign [Music]

I think you've made something like is this do I have this number right 30 million dollars through like only fans and like your other kind of platforms where people subscribe to you yeah that's just on L.A fans though but yes just on only fans what is the do you have like a total number that's even more impressive oh God I haven't really looked in a while but maybe like 40 million or something something like that [Music] all right what's up we just had um Kate also known as amaranth on the podcast she is I think the number one Creator on only fans she has made over 30 million dollars on only fans into like two years so it's kind of insane what she's done building up a following and then turning that into like I don't know she's probably one of the top earners on social media period and most people don't know about her or ever heard of her so I thought that was pretty pretty cool uh Sam what'd you think did any of the stats that she said surprise you or shock you well I had heard the money part out like before this which is why I was like interested in she reached out to us to be like hey can I come on the Pod and uh and so you know I was down for it for that but that's the most shocking number uh the other part that was shocking was just that she was pretty nonchalant about it I was pretty surprised at how sophisticated her Empire is you know she talks about how she's now offering the serve she basically built this media Empire and now she's offering it as an agency to other women and she kind of dismissed it as like yeah just this small thing and I have a feeling it's significantly bigger than she kind of like the energy that she was giving out and I find that to be incredibly fascinating yeah I think she's kind of a killer in terms of like how she's like how she's done it right how she built her brand I mean she's basically like okay Kim Kardashian built like a mega brand kind of doing this stuff and like you know has turned it into a TV show and all kinds of other things but like in the social media World she's kind of like on that level right she's like pretty A-list in the world of social media in terms of how many social media people can pull in tens of millions of dollars a year the very very few with like a five-person staff with like yeah with like you know a small team behind him and not even in a category where you're getting like you know mainstream brand deals from like whoever you know like Coca-Cola or whatever yeah it was it was really fascinating so hope you guys enjoy it hi Caitlin I was downloading Zoom then I realized it wasn't Zoom so whoops anyways I'm here hello welcome welcome to the show um you are one of the most interesting potential guests that I've wanted on the show we've had people who made money in different ways we've had poker players we've had business people we've had athletes we've had comedians but we've never had somebody who is a sort of like a social media Entertainer slash only fan star and the hook I would say for people who want to be interested in this episode is uh I think you've made something like is this do I have this number right 30 million dollars through like only fans and like your other kind of platforms where people subscribe to you yeah that's just on L.A fans though but yes just on only fast what is the do you have like a total number that's even more impressive oh God I haven't really looked in a while but maybe like 40 million or something something like that um potentially well fine find out the only fans is like way more lucrative than every other platform because even the only fans competitors are either like two new or in patreon's case like driving away the girls so and are you the number one person on only fans um I was for a while I'm not really sure what it is right now I haven't looked since I was I just put it and like oh I'm gonna put that on my link tree that I could just stop looking at it um but maybe it's been growing a lot lately what's customer churn like will they stay for do measure churn by years or months it's people's lives you know some people get girlfriends some people will just like not have a job anymore so it's hard to do like a year because hardly anyone stays on for a year a very small percentage and one of the things that's cool about you is a you're open about uh the business side of things which is cool you don't have to be you chose to be so I'm curious uh why do you why do you why did you decide all right I'm going to be able to I'm going to share this because I think it brings a lot of attention good and bad probably bring some haters out there who are outraged that somebody's making over a million dollars a month on only fans uh why'd you decide to go public with your your income and your earnings well it's gonna sound kind of weird I guess to custom people because I didn't do it for like Pride or anything like that it's it's really because my Instagram that had like five million followers over that a little bit got banned from Mass reports and I needed a way for people to still write about me because that was my biggest reach and so everything else was not nearly as much reach so I just started writing about the business stuff knowing that people would write about it if it comes from a pretty girl talking about business suddenly oh she's a genius but if it's a guy saying the same thing no one would care so that's true okay I like that that's a uh that's I think a fair call out so you basically publish that and then other people started like news outlets and stuff started re-aggregating the story and then that drove new subscribers basically so it was like it was a growth channel for you yeah it was like you know a new form of earned media wow uh okay that's great and so I have a bunch of questions Sam I want you to jump in before I just sort of uh you know go down my my list of like things I've probably wanted to ask you because I've seen you I worked at twitch my company got acquired by twitch I was at twitch and I was like all right so who's who's killing it who's doing great and you were always at the top of the list and nobody inside the company would really like talk about it that much whereas they could give like you know they're really excited about certain things because it's like really good feel good stories or um you know it's a game that they play that they're really excited about and I was like well what about her she's doing great like what is this over here I'm doing great and um how do you like to be dude your name do you like being how do you pronounce it I don't even know I read it I've never heard you say it amaranth and that's how you like in this setting that's how you like to be addressed or dressed as Kate okay much easier uh yeah I didn't know what you preferred so uh when you are going to these like meetings because I imagine like a like at you YouTube and twitch and all these places I imagine they have an account manager or something that like courts you and says hey Kate you uh you know we love what you're doing do you want to come to the office if you happen to be in town and we can like tell you some best practices I mean that's what they do for like a Casey neistat or whoever uh on YouTube when they do things like that for you or first of all do they even do that but if they do and you go to the office is that like a are these like people these corporate people like comfortable having conversations about this type of [ __ ] I mean that's just like because it's just like a it's such a unique I don't know it's just like unique I don't often talk to people who are making a living this way oh man I don't get any of that so nobody gonna wait to the office no really how many you know the owner of only fans is a big fan of the podcast and so he's gonna listen to this and so maybe maybe he can invite you to the office and start giving you the white glove treatment that like probably a twitch or a YouTube or whoever is maybe a little more hesitant to do yeah maybe um wait so how many followers do you have on Twitch like 6 million and they don't like reach out to you and be like hey we just want to say thank you for like being part of our platform like here's a t-shirt or like like you don't get anything like okay please make this uh please make your skirt two inches longer to comply with the latest uh terms and conditions that would be nice really they just ban people and they don't tell you why so you don't know what to change they'll just suspend yes Sam doesn't watch Twitch so let me just describe this you're kind of like an innovator on Twitch and I say that laughingly because like it's twitch and like let's not take it all too seriously but like uh there's this trend where um I think they call it hot tub streaming basically where it's like yeah I saw that it's like what's an excuse to kind of like wear like a bikini and be on stream which is like you know gonna get you a bunch of viewers and like subscriptions on Twitch but also in your case like get you a bunch of people who want to go you know down the funnel and go to your maybe your only fans or whatever and um I don't know if you were the first were you like kind of the first to start doing that or uh did you just like make it more popular uh well it's complicated because I started doing pool streams outside you know like a year or two before that and then um then girls started doing hot to blow up like inflatable hot tubs I think I was the first one to bring it inside my room and I've really popularized that one and then there's like this like outrage and people are like you gotta shut this down and it's usually like people on the platform who feel like oh it's taking away views for me which I think is kind of silly because it's like those people weren't weren't going to watch you uh you know like it's not like right people come to get the type of entertainment they want and they may not want to watch you uh you know in your basement playing like you know Dragon Ball Z or whatever so it's like it's a different it's a different thing but there is this like uh outrage around it what what do you uh I guess like do you respond to that or how do you how do you think about that people being like jealous of others having success and it's just placing blame on them instead of looking in the word and being like what could I improve make my stream more appealing to people and so they just want to point fingers like you're why I'm not successful when really we're if we're not taking away views from Gamers certainly not if anything we're taking away views from PornHub but that's about it how big of a game changer was only fans for you so I'm looking at your only fans I think you started I think you posted you started April 2020 so only two years ago and the first month you did 74 000 in on only fans then you did Thirty one thousand sixteen thousand six thousand something like that so you started off with a big spike because you get a bunch of people to come over and then you know but you did really well right off the bat a were you expecting that and B had you like kind of already made it was that like not that big of a deal compared to what you were already doing at twitch or was that a game changer um I think it was probably somewhere in the middle uh it was kind of what I expected just because like that's you know how platforms happen I already had patreon before which was similar but patreon was kind of pissing people off and changing what they allowed on their platform so only fans was like becoming the patreon replacement for a lot of people so I just kind of like acquired that as well I didn't jump ship because I still have my patreon so I said both now and I even have a fancy um but it wasn't really like that shocking I guess at first because I was already seeing those kinds of numbers on patreon and a pretty decent amount on Twitch at that time what were uh how big's your team or is it just you I mean no how do you I have uh an entire staff of my sort of like personal assistants video editors photographers Etc um so right now in the office I have like five main people and then I also have my extended staff that I kind of bounce back and forth between here in the office because they work also with me on real work my Agency for like of creators and family Etc like different girls and and guys or some guys on there too um so yeah I have like I have extended staff and I have like my immediate at my house is usually four to five people always do you consider yourself like the CEO of the business or do you have like a straight person like a like a by the book person who's like making sure everything's running on time or are you that person um I guess I'm I could technically be called the CEO but I don't manage it as much day to day as like my uh my head staff that I have my managing directors for it and we uh so we got to know Mr Beast recently we went to we like had an event and uh like a kind of like a Basketball Camp or whatever he came and and we had we had him on the Pod and he's a obviously super impressive guy he gets this like kind of amazing coverage in the news everything is like Mr Beast he's a good dude but like the coverage is like pretty much exclusively good obviously there's some haters you know always but like people think he's amazing business people really respect him for his like business Acumen and he's you know seen as one of the biggest content creators but um I would say you're like your franchise is right up there with him if you just took if you just took the the sort of like the face off the business if I just showed you the p l of both businesses I think you would be like well I want her p l right because you're making almost as much money with way less expenses with way less staff and overhead probably with more valuable customers more loyal customers and um and then on top of that you're like the moves you're making off your streams or off your off your platforms where you've got the agency um and then you've got the you know all your Investments and stuff like that it's just like what he's doing with his agency and his Investments and all that but I feel like you don't get that same coverage or if you do it's like could you believe this uh you know she's doing she's doing like you know real business things like how does that I guess like do you agree with my assessment there and how do you feel about that um yeah I guess the main difference is the platform that I'm doing it on because uh you know of is already gonna have like a bias behind it people don't want to admit that they pay attention to it even if they do and then twitch also is a smaller much smaller platform than YouTube so it just doesn't have the same amount of reach even if it's like the same model in the same like type of stuff it just doesn't reach nearly as many people as like his YouTube channel would how big do you think this this gets so like I don't know what you're doing annually now but maybe it's like 15 million or something like that uh how big do you think that this this can get and how big do you want it to get well I don't know because it typically grow real work really girls accounts it can potentially grow like a huge Network and that's kind of like in my extended Empire but um Me by myself I don't know I never even thought I'd get you this far so it kind of just happens really quickly especially once pandemic start and everyone was just online all the time well when you're when you're laying in bed at night and you're like I mean when I go to bed at night I'm like man like that was like I had a good day whatever it's really inspiring I I dream of I think I I think I could do this I think I could like do this one thing that's like crazy and and I just think like well in 10 years maybe this little thing could be this this and this what do you what do you imagine like what's your dream even if it's outlandish to say sometimes or maybe it's not I don't know but like what's your dream on where you want to take your your career well hopefully like year to three years and just kind of stream part time like a few days a week maybe and then just have my Empire for a real work have grown so much maybe we have like 50 to 100 of creators that we just kind of provide virtual assistance for and then I my legacy kind of lives on through that and then I don't feel like I have to grind every day and can just work with animals on stream a few days a week it's really fun and explain what real work is so this is like an agency started it's not from what I understand it's not a talent agency it's like a uh we can like the system you built with your back office with your assistants and those people you offer that as a service basically to others who don't have that back office but like I guess describe it in your words yeah I guess it would be like virtual assistants like like a team put together that other creators can have access to where they'll help like edit your content post your content Market it like write up descriptions and push sales on your platforms and stuff and then occasionally like I do events where I have girls from an agency come over and we stream together we collab Etc so it's kind of like helping others grow and then managing that growth to provide like more efficient sales across their platforms let's say that like I couldn't afford to hire your uh team and I just said but is there like just like a handful of bullet points that you could tell me on how to have a successful uh page like you do like what are the what are the like 1 5 10 bullet points that you would say well do this do this do this do this do this well I think if you want to grow you really do need help whether that's just like your friends maybe if you have like a really cool sibling family someone close enough to you or they can physically come over and help you with shoots help you get your content out there like edited posted Etc because if you want to grow you also have to be putting out um like content on public non-shadow band platforms like Twitter Youtube Tick Tock is huge right now Tech talk is really easy to grow on compared to the other ones right now twitch actually isn't that great for growth unless you have other platforms already I would save twitch for last if you're even contemplating it because it has no Discovery system that makes any sense it's all just recommended and what gets recommended people who already have viewers how do you get viewers you have to have an audience from somewhere so switch is actually like the the least I would say lucrative for new people um time will be better spent on like YouTube shorts Instagram reels tick tocks and you kind of just share that content with all three of them and make it very efficient but just kind of grow your audience from there if that makes sense what do you um for the agency uh what do you charge how do you how do you charge money for it and uh like how many clients do you have right now oh we take a percentage um of the girls earnings yeah we start with like a like a three-month trial period and if they don't like it they don't like we're providing value beyond what they were already doing then then we just we won't continue on it like we don't lock them in for like a year or two that's like really scummy to me what's the Benchmark but what's the Benchmark of what you think they should earn should they be earning 100 Grand a month a million I mean what what do you it really just depends um we don't really have a benchmark right now we kind of just look at their socials look at like how much reach they have relative to how many people have already converted to their platforms to see if like okay well we can work with that there's some potential here um if it's a really bad conversion maybe maybe not you know but if it's like it's relative to how big they are already here's a dangerous question but I am curious what works for conversion like we talk in the startup World about growth hacks all the time it's like oh did you know that when Airbnb started they didn't have any listings so they scraped Craigslist local house listings they made them all on Airbnb and they messaged people on on Craigslist saying hey I saw your listing on Airbnb uh can I book through there and it was just a robot sending it and then that caught people to to put their listing up so startups have these like classic growth hacks things that unlocked new sales or tactics that unlock new sales um on your road to making millions and millions dollars on only fans what are the growth hacks what are the things that work best for for growth for you and for for the girls that you manage gosh that's so tough because things have worked before and then algorithms change and they don't so it's been like an evolution of what's worked like I don't actually like I'm not gonna do it so you don't actually actually give me the original things that work what are the stories that are like oh that's funny that that worked or that's cool that that worked uh I want the more entertaining stories not the boring stuff that actually you know works over time yeah well what used to work um really well before Instagram really cracked down was um you could have long descriptions of being like um spam spam like uh a word if you saw my latest juicy content people would be like spamming a word that was like it's like moist or something in it what did I miss now we go back to the caption and they'd still be confused and they would click on the profile and they would see the link in the bio stuff like that that's hilarious yeah I'm like the kind of like provocative words like letter by letter so people would be like what is happening and other games right they have to like it's not what they're used to seeing so then they had to go investigate to find out yeah yeah or other things I would do would be like um tell me when you see her I would play like I spy in in the pictures and then would be like a swipe image on each different image there would be like a like check the link in the bio for really good content like just like words like on a shirt so the algorithm couldn't detect it like like curved with the with the shape of the shirt and stuff like you'd have to like zoom in and stuff and then the comments would be like right shoulder right shoulder right shoulder so people would like Zoom it and it would be great I really missed that that's that's that's that's a really good one too why do you miss that you can't do that anymore I mean my my main Instagram got banned so now I'm just now I just play things super safe yeah yeah and you um you're wearing this like uh only fans like tube top or whatever right now do they give those to you to like is that their company swag to like promote help promote their site or you make it yeah I think I actually bought it from the website but I probably could have asked I just it was cheaper just to buy it or faster because time is money so I'm just like and what were you doing before this because you're clearly like smart and a hustler and like whatever were you like did you have a good job at like you know Blockbuster back in the day like what what was the career before you became this person who you became I had a really weird one because most people they do like work retail or like uh waitressing or something I actually Blockbuster shot Blockbuster I'm doing her thing where I throw in a random word that's why these YouTube comments are gonna be like Blockbuster Blockbuster it's gonna help I'm learning from it wait but hold on how old are you 28. so no way is she gonna be working on a blockbuster I used to get games when I was a kid but once once I was 16 there was not really a blockbuster anymore wait what was the weird job yeah I actually it's really wholesome I did character parties for kids birthdays and hospital visits and like festivals around town Make-A-Wish Foundation stuff I was like princesses and superheroes so that was my company so you would dress up in Cosplay and basically like I'd go to a kids party or a hospital basically yeah basically yeah and that was my my little startup Entertainment Company what an amazing pivot that's the best pivot I've ever heard uh like you know Instagram used to be this like location app that just happened to have photos and then they were like let's just go all in on the photos and you basically were like I'm gonna go all in on the costume thing but like instead of little kids who do like big kids I still feel like I'm babysitting on Twitch too so yeah exactly that's amazing and you pay like uh you know I have this researcher who helps me with the Pod and um I was like hey she's coming on um and I like to not know everything because if you know everything you come in and you just ask questions you already know the answers to it's kind of boring um and so but he did surface one interesting thing in his uh research which was he's like yeah there's like you know leaked stuff on online where you don't have to pay for the only fans you can just like find something remove it but but he was like he's like I think she has like a like an on like retainer like you know Bloodhound agency or or a lawyer or something that's trying to like just shut all these down how what is there like a cat and mouse game if you're trying to like keep your content behind the paywall and do you like pay how much do you pay per month to like prevent protect yourself yeah we have um a whole like little dmca staff here um it's a it's a combined effort like I I do have uh lawyers yeah why but why are you paying for that only fans doesn't offer that no what yeah I have a I have my own little like um that's a startup opportunity Create A Little Agency that's gonna do that for all only fans creators Insurance yeah um but it's it's funny though because I streamed so much that like I have a very close relationship I guess with like the moderators of my chat on my Discord they will actually actively like find leaks because people do something stupid which is on my twitch Channel they'll try to uh viewers will will start mass dming at people like leaks here leaks here leaks here then my mods are just like boops into my do you see anything then we're gonna delete it so they're just like self-reporting I don't have to go looking for them they ended up just exposing all the leaks to me already and so Mr Beast when when we were hanging out with the Mr Beast so we he we did a power with him and Sean and I flew down and got to talk to him and uh the maybe the most there was a bunch of fascinating things about him but one of the more fascinating things that a lot of people don't know is so he's like this big shot in America and uh has all these followers but YouTube's Global and so he decided to hire a team to start um translating his stuff meeting like they would they would dub his content with voice actors and what he did was really interesting is he would actually over you know a lot of people would be like oh let's just get the cheapest person who kind of sounds interesting and I believe he would overpay where he would get like the guy who voiced a famous character in Brazil would also voice Mr Beast and everyone thought that was pretty cool and it sounds neat and so all creators were like hey do that for us and he goes yeah sure I'll do it for you and I I forget how it works but I believe he takes a percentage of those I'll spin up your you know Portuguese Channel and we'll manage it we'll have a we have a person who speaks Portuguese they'll write the descriptions we'll have the voice actors we'll do all that stuff and we take like I don't know 30 of the revenue of that YouTube channel for them to do that for me in Turkish because I have a huge Turkish audience because porn and ban exactly those repressed Turkish people they they need it so they need my tryouts in Turkish but they they like do you talk much anyways universal language but what's yeah that's a good point but what's interesting is you I don't know if you're doing this because you're trying to be humble but you're kind of downplaying I think like the the [ __ ] that you're doing you're like oh I just have these like personal assistants and you know we just yeah it could be you're just being humble but have you thought about like kind of like scaling this like crazy Beast or Jimmy just raised some like 200 million dollars at like a 1.5 million billion dollar valuation have you thought about being like well no that's like we're not just gonna call it personal assistance we're going hard at this and we're gonna completely operationalize and help this niche of content creators have you ever thought about like kind of from that angle up as opposed to like I don't know maybe you're just being nice but it kind of sounds like you're downplayed I think that's what we're trying to do with real work we just started at the like a few months ago so it was my personal assistance that we're kind of turning into an actual organization you um you're very like uh nonchalant uh about that's what I mean about your I'm trying to figure out where what gets you basically excited about what you've done because I think you're basically like it's it's not new to you right when you tell it when we hear what you're doing it's kind of mind-blowing what do you hear what you're doing you're like yeah I know that's what I do every day right it's not gonna like it's not gonna be mind-blowing to you but there's got to be some part of you that's like holy [ __ ] I can't believe this is what's happening and like oh my God like this could be blah blah blah and there's got to be some part of you that still has that I don't know less laid back and more excited part of you that's like yeah I really want this and I know that's gonna be crazy but like I think I could do it uh is there some part of this that's like really mind-blowing to you or like really exciting for you going forward it's pretty mind-blowing day like this is how it is and then doing more and more over time you kind of just get desensitized because it's such like a slow process over the past six years I feel slow to me anyways I do it so much um but yeah I mean I really want to do animal content on my twitch stream and you know I'm hoping to move towards that soon kind of away from like so much of the e-girl like side like I'm still gonna be an eagle I guess to people who want to Brand it as that but like I feel like content can be so much more than sitting in a hot tub you know when you're saying when you're saying animal content I'm not a twitch person when you're saying animal content is that a phrase for something else or is that literally no no like I have horses and dogs that I want to do like twitch stream teams with and training and trail riding and taking care of them and having a stable in a ranch in the near future hopefully can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot ERM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better do you have like um like a therapist or anybody because like I've seen what like how twitch streamers like what they have to put up with and like there's this crazy like love hate weirdo stalker thing that happens then you get famous on Twitch and like you get a lot of like you know you know you you see comments that are super negative you see comments that are super like like super positive it's just like a lot to take in while you're just sitting at home in your room streaming for like eight hours which is kind of an unnatural thing without saying the light of day during that time right like do you do like mental health do you do anything proactively for mental health so that you're not like going nuts while you do this uh well I do have a therapist now for some other reasons but I probably should have had one this whole time for streaming as well but my kind of mental health I guess outside of therapy would just be horse riding it's kind of like my meditation replacement is that stuff at does that stuff actually get to you like uh I do a decent job of you know it's actually funny I do a decent job of like ignoring haters we're not nearly as big as you but we still get like you know hundreds of comments a a day of like hate or good and bad and uh like I recently got fit and I remember people commenting of like oh you look less fat or um they'll say like um oh you know today you're looking a little chubby and I was like damn these people are mean you must get like thousands I mean you do thousands of people a day commenting on your looks does that actually get to you are you are you pretty good of uh of kind of I don't know ignoring it uh I'd say it used to get to me more but at this point I just kind of immune to it I think um yeah it's not so much comments they get to me what gets to me is comparison to myself because I'll I'll on a photo shoot day say I'm feeling bloated or I'm breaking out or whatever and I'll be referencing like pictures that did well on my social media before just so we know like what to recreate that we have done in a while and it's like man it looks so good there I was like [ __ ] today like things like that because like at the time you know it's like the perfect lighting the perfect angle or whatever and it just doesn't look that way in the mirror you know but then usually it did done with the shoot and you're like oh these are fine like because it looks different on camera so the reality is what [ __ ] me up not really people's comments or maybe it's like a child actor thing and like in 15 years all the like famous twitch streamers are going to be like you know I'll screwed up it's like they were fine at the time but it was all good it's like later when things get weird um you know you you ha you also tweet about like what you do with your money which I think is kind of interesting um we'll talk about the gas station thing in a second but like we always ask you know the guests who come on we say all right cool like money's this weird thing where it's kind of Taboo it's like in entrepreneurship you're supposed to say that's not about the money for me but like they fight like hell to like every point of equity and every dollar earned it's like clearly money does matter to people and they also don't really say what they do with their money and therefore there's a bunch of people who are listening to podcasts like this that don't know like there's like an information wall it's like um you don't get to know what happens on the side it's like only through many years in hard lessons you get to figure it out and we think that's kind of silly we try to like break down that wall a little bit um so if I was going to describe to you like a pie chart like okay here's all your money um where do you what do you do with it uh do you just leave it in a checking account are you putting in the stock market are you buying crypto like can you roughly draw us like a pie chart of like you know how you manage your own money um it's kind of complicated I I didn't really get to manage it as much until recently but um the gas stations yeah those are those are a fun investment though uh my accountant actually brought me to that one and um they help save me on taxes because I can I got to expense the entire cost of the building up front so that reduced my my my yearly income on paper and then I had like a lower tax rate depreciate accelerated depreciation yeah exactly um so that was that kind of thing you have to be like a real estate professional technically right so you're doing like the 500 hour test basically uh no you actually don't don't have to be with this explain that to me I want to do that do you know I thought it's basically if you're passive then it could only offset passive income but your other stuff is active income right so do I have a misunderstanding or does it work differently uh I just don't want my account my accountant team brushed me they said there was this opportunity and they explained to me like okay so I'm just putting money into that and then uh yeah they kind of have all the rest of the details I just throw the money at it is most of your uh is most of your is most of your portfolio just in boring index funds [Music] she bought like a million dollars of Visa stock the other day yeah I mean that's like a really that's a reliable thing it's not going anywhere especially since pandemic is kind of at least the fear of it is dying down people are out there traveling more getting out more it's just only gonna get better it's also like a cash back program for you you've probably paid like nearly a million dollars in credit card shoes uh two visa and now yeah it's a way to sort of what else did you buy I mean I asked some Google I have some Shopify um at Amazon uh yeah I have some crypto but I don't I don't know how I feel about crypto yet why not because I just it's it's so up and down all the time that it's just I I can't tell what it's really gonna do so yeah I have some Bitcoin where do you when you're when you're researching which what do you want to buy where uh where do you learn like what resources do you turn to well I have I have an accounting team and I also have you know YouTube and Google like everyone else yeah on Google and YouTube what do you who do you listen to I don't really have like a certain person I guess it's just kind of like I get linked various things that people send me yeah I used to actually talk to a lot of streamers about it in my DMs um you know I don't know if you guys knew who reckful was maybe you actually worked at twitch um we used to talk about stocks in our DMS so that's kind of where I got started with it and then I was just sent stuff and kind of explored it and then I got like an accountant and it all just kind of compiles from everywhere do you do any other type of investing that's interesting so you you is it one gas station or multiple and then you have stocks is there anything else well I have some businesses I've bought and some private Equity too tell me more tell us something I can't really talk about the private Equity because it's private I legally I can't say anything about much about it but basically they just acquire small businesses throughout the year and um I send them money as needed up to like 5 million or so is what the total will be but on a deal by deal basis basically yeah yeah whatever they need it they call for it there's not like a scheduled payment system with it gotcha and then what about uh businesses you bought what do you what are the what are you buying and who's running these things well usually I buy businesses that can just run themselves like um I guess the the if you guys heard about like the ball pit company or like the ball the plastic ball company I used for my ball pit no no what is that it's just it's it's like a I probably manufacturer they're based in China though they make like playground balls like uh you know like ball pit type yeah it was just like really yeah see it was just really um Chinese manufacturer well the like that they share the facility with other people but um yeah they manufacture balls and I bought that company it was really it's actually a really good profit margins like how did this even come across your desk accountant accountant they just sent me stuff they're like they're saying and I like the gravity towards the ones that I can also use for publicity stunts and uh on Twitch so like I turned my entire room into a ball pit your accountant is like the LeBron James of accountants or the Bernie Madoff of accounts I haven't decided which one yet but he's doing way more than the Call of Duty as an accountant yeah I'm like a team it's it's hard to explain it all I I normally I just throw them the money I'm like yes make it work are you afraid of like being one of those like athletes that goes broke on like you know my my manager my accountant talked me into buying these like this chain of you know Wendy's that was like non-existent and ran away with my money because it sounds like uh yeah you're throwing money into crazy places right now is that a fear for you uh no oh no not really um if you're not afraid I'm not afraid yeah I had bigger fears than that it it uh it almost like we were asking you some of these like super specific money questions and it people are listening now but uh you know you're the look in your face was like why the [ __ ] are these guys asking me all these questions about this money [ __ ] like this makes me uncomfortable isn't that hilarious I only recently got back in control of my finances I don't know if y'all saw that drama but uh what happened I can't say too much about it but um I got out of kind of a uh controlling relationship a bit so yeah yeah yeah we keep the dark stuff over there we just do the money stuff here we we don't we don't worry we we try not to get into the heavy topics what I was saying was you do things that 99.9 of people would find to be incredibly embarrassing for to do like they would be they would be too nervous to do that you know it's too taboo I'm uncomfortable doing that and I think that it's it's wild that we think that all right we're okay with that and but we're also nervous about talking about the money thing and like that's just like an interesting insight and we've talked to so many people and it's very rare that someone's comfortable talking about money it still makes me really uncomfortable but it's just like an interesting thing it's like Oh I thought this woman wasn't afraid of anything but when we talk about money like you know it's it can be a weird topic yeah no I'm pretty comfortable talking about the money so much like some of the more like investment business sites it's not just me so I was like I can feel like I can't talk too much about it because I'm not like the only person driving those types of things so when we were talking to Mr Beast he's been going into like you know uh feastables like his chocolate bar and then he created like a pop-up uh like Cloud Kitchen restaurant thing called Beast burger and he's like talking about different like businesses where he can go into and say okay I could use my fame and my distribution to like give these businesses an unfair advantage um are you doing it sounds like the ball pit is sort of like that where you're like okay if I buy this company and I I make it part of my content then like you know sales could go up but like I can imagine like any of the taboo sort of like or like you know whatever sex related type of products whether it's like you know it could be swimwear it could be lingerie it could be sex toys it could be like who knows I don't know I don't know what else it could be like are you going down that pathway like we should actually like either buy or create a business like in that in those categories and use me and maybe the the other my other you know other girls I know that will be a part of promoting this and like we can blow this company up into a pretty big company are you thinking along those lines yeah I am uh definitely for the future as I'm I'm trying to move towards you know more uh collaborative efforts with other girls with the real work so I I really want to do like lingerie um I think makeup is a good way to go to um beauty industry is huge but uh yeah definitely like those are on my mind right now do you have to do products that guys want or is it products like like how many of your fans are women versus men it's going to be a mixture it's looking like since um I'm blowing up more now where it's like I do have more of a female audience especially like since a lot of the girls kind of look to me as a person to follow as far as like the of side goes e-girl side whatever you want to call it um so it's getting more balanced but yeah I also still have a a project that I've been working on with Ludwig this past year we're making an amaranth Fleshlight so yeah that's kind of what I was thinking about we're doing that too that was the idea that I was thinking about it yeah dude have you uh have you guys ever heard of kink.com have you heard of kink.com all right so kink.com was like I I think that they were a website but also the parent company and they owned all these like fetish websites so you know Kinks and uh I don't know what they all were but like one of them or one of them that was pretty funny was like these people who would like wrestle and then have sex and this guy started it wrestling yeah well they like no but they were like Olympic wrestling like they were wearing like unitards and then like they it warps into sex and whatever and they uh the guy who started it it was just a guy and he started it in the late 90s doing the.com boom so he was an early mover and he built it into a huge business and eventually he bought this old Armory which is basically a huge building in the center of the Mission District in San Francisco which is considered some of the most expensive real estate in the city because it's like a desirable hipster neighborhood and he built this huge thing and it was basically like a palace it was like an airplane imagine an airplane hangar but like in the one of the more desirable neighborhoods of San Francisco and he owned it and they eventually would film all their [ __ ] there so like they had like a wrestling area and then they had like a bar where they would do like people who like to have sex in public they like mimicked a bar and people would have sex in it and film it and they would charge subscribers money whatever and when I first moved to San Francisco I took a Groupon tour of it like you could like you could because it's just like an interesting building that's an old Armory where they like it's like an old historical building and it's also a porn studio and I was hanging out with this girl and she was like hey do you want to go like see this thing it's on Groupon it's a it's a porn Studio we could just go take a tour of a historical building and I was like yeah s and that's how I learned with kink.com was I went and like oh you see the stuff and I'm like this is crazy and then I started thinking about like all these media companies like uh Jimmy and I used to do it too would be like oh we want to become like the Disney of blank and I'm like oh this guy at Kink that's his Disney's Disneyland like he like he had all these people taking tours to come I think we spent 50 bucks and we got a tour where they're like here's where like the Army used to prepare now we use it as a dungeon for sex tapes because like there's a hose here so we could spray people with water like it was all Kink stuff and it was pretty wild that this was like part of their business model and like the people on that tour like I'm a pretty straight laced guy it was like straight laced people who had no idea what this website was and then there was other people that were like totally into it and they're like oh I'm seeing where this I'm seeing the studio where my favorite stuff is filmed it was incredibly fascinating Sean I've never abstract you haven't heard of that it was like right in the middle I remember the building yeah I didn't know the website part but yeah that building is kind of famous it's a beautiful building from the outside and uh when you go by somebody will always tell you you know hey this is what that is but if you look up like kink.com Building San Francisco or something there'll be a Wikipedia page and this building it might be worth north of 100 million dollars at this point maybe more and it uh it's like a huge building in a very desirable neighborhood and it was just like super fascinating this guy did this and so maybe in the future what we're going to see you have is we're gonna see you like be like oh hey creators who work with me do you want to like a come you want a place to come and stay like uh you know I can you could you could host your office in my studio and then eventually it's like hey uh fans of us whoever wants to spend a hundred bucks you can come get like a walking guided tour and then eventually you're just gonna own like all this amazing yeah red light district style you're gonna own all this real estate anyway it was a really interesting play that these folks did and it I think it I think the uh building became worth more than their the porn brand wow I I read something he said that I thought was pretty interesting you go I think you said this it was uh you go there's like the but Warren Buffett has this phrase like you only have to get rich once and you were saying like for social media it's the same thing you got to just build an audience once yeah you only got to get famous once and so what how did you actually get famous what was the what was the were there any big inflection points where it like it went from like you know not that many people watching me or following me to like way more or was it just very steady or were there were there any like big moments um I see the hearts of meta was probably huge that was probably doubled my growth at least um but before that it was kind of just I guess I entered the social media space at a time when it wasn't over saturated like 2016. it wasn't as crazy it is now or everyone wants to be an influencer so I think I got really lucky with the timing and then I just was growing on Twitch and twitch wasn't oversaturated either at that time and I just kind of grew with the platform because I streamed so much you know and what separated me from others was I was also making content on pretty much every other platform at the same time like I had Facebook page I had Instagram I had Twitter I had YouTube and I was just kind of growing it plus patreon also kind of boosted my ability to just make that my full-time thing because I wasn't relying just on Twitch I didn't have to keep like a day job or whatever describe how intense the content like work is because I think some people would say oh man you just post a picture on only fans that's why like you make 100 Grand a month you know you make a million dollars a month uh and all you got to do is like post a pic like you know once a day or whatever like that's it what is the what's the reality like uh right now my content schedule is a little crazy but pretty much every week I'll have like a day or two where I just dedicate to only fans and fansy and patreon like all my uh NSFW platforms and then I also like the next day I'll do all my YouTube Twitter Instagram content as well so pretty much two days out of the week are like 12 hour photo shoot days across all my different types of content and then the rest of the time I'll just stream on Twitch because that's kind of my my billboard that pays me [Laughter] there's no reason it's completely illogical why I feel this way but it is just funny to like hear like you know Sean and I talk about the exact same [ __ ] it's just like in such a uh just with different types of content and it's so funny that it's like it it just not a normal conversation that we typically have where it's with uh not safe for work content and I think that's so cool yeah it's very different for sure but it's all the same mechanics and it's just like what and in my head I'm like why do I think what like she's just doing the exact same [ __ ] we do it's just a different Niche and frankly a significantly bigger significantly more profitable and significantly uh like you just use you just like we're happy with like a million dollar a year maybe if like in the tech World on the Twitter world and it's just like oh yeah that's cool I'm I'm I'm decently happy with a million dollar a month too yeah it's kind of crazy so I'm just trying to get it while you know the getting is good because I feel like it's such a rare opportunity to have I don't waste it do you um like okay so you're like you know doing really well with this stuff now uh do you what's the is there like an end of the road where you're like okay I'm just gonna like I have to retire at certain point and like you know do you sort of see like I have a very small window here for this or do you think it's going to be much longer than that um I do feel like I have a small window compared to honestly based off my appearance and there's always younger people coming into this space um but yeah I don't know how much longer I don't have like a cut off period I would think I would like to be done with the grind within the next year maybe three max um if somebody's confused by the way because like when I first heard about only fans I was like why would I pay like orange free what do you mean uh why would I pay five dollars a month for this uh is there like some psycho psychological benefit that people get out of it like you know what drives somebody to actually pay for something when there's so much of a free alternative available to them um out there on the internet I think part of it is the parasocial aspect where it's like they feel like they kind of like know this person because they'd see them on either YouTube or twitch or whatever it is um some people go overboard with it like they treat it like it's just my girlfriend which is definitely not not your girlfriend bro um but yeah I feel like part of it's just like they they like a certain person's kind of look like they're really into whatever characteristics make of that Creator and they want to see more from that specific look that they've become like attracted to I guess or have some form of attachment just from seeing their face so much Sam have you ever heard this word parasocial you've used that word and then the word about when you were talking about spamming the comments I've never like heard someone call it that was that was an interesting one too um parasocial is basically like a one-sided well air quotes relationship that the viewer has with the content creator like some people get way too invested in a uh Creator's personal life like they want to know who they're dating what they did today where they've been why aren't they online right now that's I would say that's a very parasocial thing it's like they feel like more entitled to a relationship when they don't actually know the person but it's a I mean but that that's good for you no um and some until it gets to like a stalker threatening level the Creator but how many times do you think it crosses the line like how often would that happen to you where it actually is an issue [Music] per day in messages I'm sure there's even more that I don't read but as far as in-person altercations um typically if a few a year will try to physically show up at your house but then you get a horde of people also just trying to swat you and docs you in general who are mad that either you're not dating them or you didn't respond or whatever so it's complicated crazy yeah people are insane we I'm glad we're not famous well we Sean and I get like one percent of that because sometimes people will hear Sean talk and they're like oh you're really good at talking about money and like you're pretty successful therefore like show me the way uh what the hell you didn't reply to me like after all I do for you yeah and like that's like one percent I'm sure of what you get because it's when love and all that shit's involved it's just like way more intense yeah and way more dangerous I think um it's like what would someone do like they just they just think that hey what the hell man I I messaged you and like we were talking and I thought we were together now you're still doing this stuff yeah some people get catfished too but I like people just pretending to be me and so they'll be like okay all this money and you didn't show up and I'm like oh no oh no um but yeah typically it's just crazy people who are just basically talking to themselves a one-sided conversation in the DM's never getting a response and they just keep going they just keep going I feel like uh I feel like I could create an AI only fans Creator and um probably like just crush it because she could do anything and she would talk to anyone any time of day and she would you know be you know the girlfriend you always wanted and so if anyone out there is a uh an engineer who wants to help me with this let's for a stunt let's try to create an AI only fans a girl who's gonna make a million dollars in a month that's the mission and we'll publish how we're doing along the way and we're gonna learn all the growth hacks and we're gonna put it all out there and they can't doctor or sweater because she doesn't exist she doesn't live anywhere and so uh I think it is the uh maybe the future there so so that's mine so listen to that action anybody who wants to help me with that project get in my DMs on Twitter Sean VP have you guys seen uh Avid is it called Avatar dot me yeah have you guys seen it all right so check this out so there's like all this like AI [ __ ] where you it's like all built on the back of one thing and then all these people are creating plugins and layers on tops of top of it and so there's this new thing where you can upload 20 pictures of yourself and it will give you avatars created uh with you in mind and okay I did go to avatarai dot me that's the that's not it's [ __ ] amazing so check this out so I just uploaded a bunch of pictures of my face and there were a few pictures that I posted of my body because I was doing like before and after of like Fitness [ __ ] but it sent me photos back of me looking like a dominatrix but then it gave me this other picture that I have no idea what this is it gave me this other picture where it's supposed to be like I only post gave it pictures of me with like my stomach up and it and it like gave it made me it like made a fake picture of my ass and it was just like a picture of my butt and uh it's [ __ ] disgusting and weird but like but I was looking at this and I'm like oh there definitely should be there's definitely gonna be this type of thing because have you guys seen uh I think it's called replica.ai it's basically a service where you can like you can just spend money and you get like a friend that learns how to interact with you and you also can get like an online girlfriend who just is like it's a text-based conversation that you're having with this fake woman and she gets to know you and figures out your taste and likes it's all built on AI now we just got to add it with some of this um with some of these uh pictures and then eventually deep fake videos and like your job ultimately is going to be completely like you know unnecessary like the use of the world are going to be it's like hey wait you're real why would you do why are you wasting that time being real uh you know uh or like maybe there should be like bots of you that understand your personality and actually do talk to these men and you can like license out your your face to replica.ai there's gonna be a lot of interesting things like that I think in the near in like the next two years probably yeah for sure it's getting kind of crazy the technology uh right on all right well listen this is great I'm glad you came on uh thanks for doing this and uh where should people uh where should we find you if they want to uh you know see more learn more get to know you a little bit better uh you're just for perfect with my link directory and the URL is easy to remember it's downbed.com whatdownbad.com yes downbad.com okay sounds easy uh okay it has all my platforms listed there because sometimes you know stuff gets banned and the link will change so it's always there that's cool all right thanks Kate appreciate it yeah thanks appreciate you [Music] foreign [Music]

when I saw you went and did the watch site hodinki uh first of all Sean have you ever read that like when I when I heard I was like a Blog I like watches I have Rolexes as like a Blog for luxury watches what the hell is this guy thinking did you did you just say that it went from like a million or two in revenue and now it's Sam said it's over 100 million yeah yeah we're over 100 million in Revenue now man that is why it's insane [Music] laughs what's up all right in this episode we are sitting down with Kevin Rose uh a lot of you know Kevin because he's an internet OG he created dig back in the day he was a seed investor in Twitter and a bunch of other cool companies he was been a he's been a VC he's been a Founder he launched it recently launched an nft project that's done hundreds of millions of dollars worth of nft sales and so um Kevin's has been around for a while and the cool part of the interview if you if you listen to it you're going to see very chill guy very um down to earth very humble and um not a kind of like oh my God I'm gonna go take over the world you know bubbling over with ambition and a big chip on his shoulder seemed like a happy dude who was enjoying himself and had a ton of success in the process and I like that I like seeing diff people who play the game with different in different ways and he's definitely somebody who's interested we talked about um a bunch of his projects that you may not know about so for example is creating watchville this Niche project for watches That Grew From one million in Revenue to now over 100 million after it got Acquired and merged with hodinki um then also we talked about how he hires writers we talked about um you know how he got into Twitter as an early investor and what does he do with his money so he's got a bunch of money uh how does he invest it where does he put it and uh the answer is not not what you may have expected the last thing we did at the end is we did the crypto debate so Sam is sort of a uh a crypto skeptic Kevin is obviously a crypto believer and one of the kind of most well-known guys in the crypto scene and we had a little debate 8 where we talked about is it all [ __ ] or are there some use cases so I hope you enjoyed this episode with Kevin Rose I liked it I think he will too we should give like a brief overview overview but like your resume we don't really talk too much about like resumes and stuff but your resume is like crazy long so I've been following you forever uh so I've known about your work so you started dig which was when did you start that in 04 2004 that's right yeah and so you were it was like one of the original like site like link aggregators and it was like a cultural phenomenon and that was crazy and you were like was it Time magazine that you were on the cover of Like Your Business Week business week it was like here's this young kid taking over Silicon Valley what's the internet and who's this kid controlling it type of thing uh and like it had all this hype but like dig didn't turn out maybe as wonderful as like we we all thought maybe it could have done but then you like had your finger on the pulse of all these other things you've done a dig you done is it I read it all the time but is it pronounced hodinki yeah oh dinky a watch blog that also like sells watches you're a partner at Google Ventures you have this app called zero fasting that I use I love partner at trueventures which I still think you're at now you've got the uh you got the uh the oak uh uh meditation app and then I have a feeling there's like five or ten other things that you just have Brewing that like I don't even know like most people probably don't even know about but you're basically my point is is like you're kind of an Internet OG and you are incredibly prolific I mean does that kind of summarize it yeah I mean the most recent thing I started was proof which is our our Venture into the world of nfts and so that's that's the only thing uh missing from from that and that that's about um 10 months old now so that's that's on the newer side so from the outside if I look at this kind of like collection of or like the career path it looks very random it's like you know from you know from venture-backed to Angel vesting to venture investing to kind of like Niche communities uh you know these like kind of apps that are like simple like like meditation or fasting uh you did a podcast you did a show you know you've done a bunch of content you did a bunch of different things was there a method to the madness is this do you just describe it as random or is there kind of like some underlying theme to this whole thing yeah there's I would say that I've always been one yeah ever since I was a little kid to just tinker and just to to play and if there's any method to the madness it is this common thread of exploration and just wanting to if I see something that doesn't exist that should exist I want to go build it and I've done that a handful of times um you know probably at least 10 to 15 businesses of which you know 90 of them go to zero and then there's a few that pop and become you know pretty big so um it's just this idea that uh I don't want to sit on the sidelines if there's something that's exciting that needs to be built I I'd rather just spin up a team and go after it of all those projects and I'm actually going to exclude proof from that because uh I want to talk all about that in a little while but of all those projects that I mentioned which one has been the most financially successful for you personally that's a good question um certainly I would say when I was in the middle of Web 2.0 which was the the when dig was at its its peak which was um about a 2000 early 2006 um you know we were hit around 38 million people a month using the site it was you know of the web 2 properties it was one of the largest um it it led me to sitting down and you know dinners and conversations and hangouts with the You Know Jack dorsey's and Evan Williams and zuckerbergs and all the household names that became these big products and they were just friends and so because of that um it was more like hey well you know do you want to invest in my new thing and and so I would say the investment side has definitely been the the best financial returns I did start a media company um that uh well I would say there's there's two things that that well three that are too unrealized in hodinki um which is is is going to be crazy it'll you know it's over 100 million Revenue a year now which is nuts whoa really um and then we have um you know uh the stuff I'm doing a proof right now which has just been another crazy rocket ship but in terms of like true exits of businesses that I've started um revision three uh where I was the co-founder as a media company that became um Discovery Channel's digital arm and we sold that for 35 million dollars back in uh 2008 or something like that so that was probably the biggest company sale that I've had um but you know they're much larger on the more Angel investment side and maybe that sale gave you the the ammo to do the angel of it to do Angel Investing or would you have been able to do it without it a bit but I was already starting to do small Investments uh prior to that so I I didn't have any money I didn't come from money um but when dig really took off and we were a couple years in to dig investors and this is a very common practice it doesn't get talked about a lot but investors come around and they're like hey you know you're doing this round of financing can we take a little pressure off of you as an entrepreneur and buy some of your stock personally right and so I sold a little bit of my dig stock enough to give me the ammo to go and do small C checks you know and put you know 25k into you know Twitter's seed round and and put you know 25k and or it was more into Facebook but um they're a little bit later stage and and so it was it was those little tiny checks that you know when they turn into multi-billion dollar businesses uh were pretty meaningful how much does 25k into Twitter and Facebook early on actually turned into it at millions of dollars I mean that that math is even hard to comprehend and Twitter's seed round what was evaluation then well it was difficult because they were a podcast company uh doing podcast software and then they they did a new round they they pivoted into Twitter and so oh gosh I'm drawing a blank on the name of the podcast audio that's right they were audio so um yeah I didn't invest in audio they had become Twitter and I asked EV who I was the tightest with at the time because I didn't really know Jack that well at that yet and I asked to have a huge CEO and I was like you know can I can I invest and there was no round available at that point they but he's like I got this engineer that um Blake that was leaving and had some stock and was like do you just want to buy some of the stock and I was like yeah that sounds great I'll just buy something I think Gary vaynerchuk said the same story yes yes so here's the funny thing yeah so I bought in from Blake and then I I told Gary that Blake was selling some and um then Twitter ended up actually they had a preemptive round come along that really like like five or ten extra evaluation and then Blake was like oh whoa well no there's a new valuation now and he charged carry the new price so Gary's still pissed at me because I got this like really cheap price for Twitter stock you know and then uh and then Gary had to pay the more expensive price but that was a funny little what do you think Blake's saying right now I mean Blake probably just he did he held on to like half or more and so you know he probably I don't know he if I had to guess he made 50 plus 75 plus million dollars or something on it he I'm sure he's okay did uh at the time because Twitter kind of had like a well there's like audio kind of failing Twitter who knows uh and then there was like this like small community of people in Silicon Valley that were like using it back when it was like texting the the your updates out um like when you're when you were writing that check did you feel like this is the you know the next big thing or was this kind of like I don't know my friends are smart let's see or where was it like it was the next big thing because there was I I loved so as someone that was building a social graph of sorts at dig you know there was always this idea back prior to um excuse me prior to Twitter that was um bi-directional friendships so you know on MySpace you and Friendster and all the others they did come prior to Twitter you had to actually know the person to see their content so it was like I would you like to send a friend request yes do you accept this friend request yes right and it was like same thing with Facebook and when Twitter came out with that model of just this idea of following and and it allowed like there was no celebrities on the platform it was like me and Lee LaPorte and a couple others that were the top followed people on the platform at the time um but I I thought to myself like wow if this catches on with the celebrity crowd it's just gonna be insane it's gonna be because everyone will just want to see and also the barrier to entry a lot of back then it was it was um it was impossible to get uh you know celebrities to sit down and kind of um do technical things because that we didn't really have smartphones but the fact that you could text to that number that short code just what you were up to anybody can do that it doesn't require any special software it doesn't require you sitting in front of a computer and so it was just so dead simple to use it felt as though as I saw the tech crowd you know um kind of catching on uh it I knew eventually it would spill outside of that that small vertical of users into the mainstream and if that when that would happen that was the bet when that would happen uh if and when that would happen that would it would it would blow up and and it did so that was that was awesome and I remember I've also seen uh you did a video back in the day when Square was like a prototype it was like a YouTube video I remember you you're like hey yeah check this out like you know here's this little square and you could plug it into your phone you could take credit card payments you're like and it was not even released yet and you were like you know promote I think you did you invest in that too because that would have been like yeah so that's a great story because I hit jack up and I was like hey I heard you're doing this new credit card thing I'd like to be an angel investor and he's like oh dude it's over subscribed I'm sorry like we've closed the round like blah blah and I was like damn it I'm like well let me see if I can help you in some way and so he gave me a prototype and um I just went and recorded a video and it got a lot of traction and it got a lot of people excited about this new product and it was like an early glimpse of what was to come and it started getting you know tens of thousands of views on on YouTube and he calls me back and he's like I had an investor drop out I've got some room do you want to do you want to put a check in and so that's what got me into um to their seed round which was which was awesome what was it like uh you know I lived in San Francisco from 2012 up until somewhat recently Sean's still there it's definitely a bit different now because like startups are are quite popular and and Jax and Jack Dorsey is like basically a celebrity Mark Zucker was obviously a celebrity what was it when back then in uh the the you know 040506 uh you know 2010 when these things were just getting going did you actually think that a guy like Jack Dorsey was gonna be like this kind of like Titan of of Industry like he kind of is like what was it like being around some of these folks early on when they were just you know you guys were just messing around well it was you met a lot of entrepreneurs back then and there was it was clear there was a few people that stood out as just being um wildly creative and and just deep thinkers and I was really drawn to those folks I wanted to just like pick their brain more and get to know them better and so you know um one of the things that struck me is just how mature Mark Zuckerberg was when he was younger like it was you know I'm quite a bit older excuse me than he is and um how old is he now he's still only like 38. he's younger than that oh my God yeah so how old is Mark that's oh yeah you're right he's 38. yeah he's still that's still I mean it is 30s that's pretty wild yeah it it's it's it's crazy um he was he was really young um so yeah so when I met him was 2005 I want to say so he was 21. wow so he was 21 years old and I remember just thinking about how put together he was and how well spoken and just what a deep thinker he was about the space and he wasn't winging it he was taking it very seriously and um that was that was a big big shock to me um I remember just those conversations being like I was like Wow for 21 I was definitely not as put together as as he was at 21. what's something he said that made you made you think that well you know one of the things that I was always uh frightened by uh as an entrepreneur in my in my youth was just this idea of would people take me seriously um and could I admit when I didn't know something and it was it was it okay to I tried to hide my vulnerabilities as an entrepreneur and he just came in and was asking so many pointed questions and um you know I asked him about some of his hiring and firing practices and how he would edit his team how he ensured that he made the right hires on the engineering side because it was it was that was a very challenging thing to do back then to scale websites you were like racking your own servers and you know it wasn't the aws's of the world and we were talking a lot about that and um it was just it was one of those things where he just told me that um he just you know it's obvious stuff he's surround yourself with people smarter than you and then you ask a lot of questions and you're not afraid to ask those questions so um you know back then I had some great investors and and board members but at times I was a little hesitant to be like hey I I don't quite understand how this works can you help educate me and I think it was due to my lack of like for some reason I thought because I was a College Dropout that I I had to hide that and and they would be like if I asked a question that I should have learned in college that it would have looked uh had it had egg on my face and so there was a lot of um of of nervousness around that and just to see Mark just be so open and just curious um and there was no it was clear that if he if he didn't know something he was going to get to the bottom of it right away um it was it was inspiring I had a I had an experience just like that when we were selling our last company um I met with all the big companies Facebook Google and Amazon whatever we also met with Discord and I go in I meet Jason who's the CEO of Discord and I'm like pitching him on like you know basically if you bought our thing like it would add this Dimension to Discord it would be awesome and what I was so used to was most Founders if you if you're just kind of saying how awesome they are and how they can take over all these different how there's so much more they can do how this is just the beginning and how there's all these different ways that they can expand normally they're like yes yes yeah yeah totally we can do that too we can do that too it all sounds good and he was just sort of like you know I would acquire you guys because I like you and I like that you came in and you had this like whiteboard and you just like painted a picture for me um but we won't do any of that and he's like um no that's not what Discord should do what we should do and he said no and he was like we should just be this one horizontal utility that does this one thing and um that's our that's that's the right strategy for us and he was the first guy that said no when I was like kind of giving him some ice cream of like you could have this too right right and I just thought oh that's what like this is this is probably what Zuck was like you know this is probably with somebody who was focused was like because back when Zuck was building Facebook it was like Myspace was adding music and then TV shows and doing these like brand deals and like he was just like nope real names simple profiles we're just gonna let you like you know communicate and add photos and do this stuff and like he said no to a bunch of different things which is why Facebook was some such a cleaner sight than Myspace and all the other competitors that were out there yeah I would argue they've lost a lot of that because they say yes to a lot of the cloning of features of other other competitors but yeah you're right that Relentless um focus is is so essential and oftentimes it's it's more what you say no to than what you say yes to on the product side you know I I that totally agrees and Vibes with me for sure do you sort of uh when you're doing all these projects uh back to the project do you have like a set of rules like for example I know a guy who is incredibly successful um I talked to him one time his name is Kevin or a couple times his name is Kevin Ryan he started like mongodb Business Insider Guild group all these like amazing companies and he was like well I just do back of the envelope math and then I give each project six months and me and my partner typically fund it with three hundred thousand dollars and we kind of like feel it out it's a little mathematical but it's also like let's just see what happens in six months and see if this is promising and we'll decide uh and so he's like six months 300K can we make something cool and I talked to Atomic Labs the other day you know Atomic Labs they're like that incubator that's they're not really an incubator they like start companies and they said something like they're like yeah well like sometimes we'll only spend 50 Grand and like two months or something like that do you have uh like something like that when you're starting a bunch of your projects like the fasting app or the meditation app where you're like I think you did another one milk or is that the name of the production yeah that was the name of the the kind of incubator Studio yeah yeah do you like have like rules for what you're looking for yeah I mean it's there is um I guess the question really comes to when you decide to kill something or sell it off or get rid of it or move on to the next thing and and oftentimes it's um because your original kind of thesis around either the market size or just the concept behind it just didn't take hold and so I don't have any like hard set number of months sometimes you're early so you know uh the fasting app for example um you know when I launched xero it's sad at you know tens of thousands of users for the first eight months and then fasting hit and it became more of a household thing and people were talking about intermittent fasting it was all over TV and different you know places were picking it up and so people were just naturally searching for fasting in the app store because that's just what they do and then that's when it exploded to you know hundreds of thousands and you know a million plus monthly active people doing fast um and but it was it had I shut that down after the first six months um you know it would have been too soon so something like that if you if you just believe the market is not quite mature enough I typically put it into a little bit more of a maintenance mode you know I got it to that first version where I felt like this is a useful utility for people that are looking to learn more and get into fasting um now let's just uh let it kind of organically build from here and we were seeing you know nice slow consistent kind of week over week month over month growth but nothing explosive like you you're used to seeing in a in a high growth startup so um if that one that one in particular was just like let's just just wait around and then other times you know you create something and you've just clearly missed the Mark it's it's like we created this app called tiny which was a fun little photo sharing app that was um yeah I liked it oh you did awesome yeah it was these little little size uh looping videos with no audio and we thought it would just be like a little bit more quick a little intimate way to show kind of how you're traversing throughout your days and weeks rather than having to take the time to set up to look all perfect in front of your perfect Instagram there was less pressure literally because it was small right exactly that part was actually kind of true yeah and and that was a crazy one because you know we launched and it just it caught fire immediately and we had you know hundreds of thousands of downloads in the first week and then it just died off completely and everyone was like ah that was a fad that was a that was a fun little fad and that one we shut down pretty quickly after that because it was clear that it was a fun little thing but but there was no depth to it it was a it was a feature not not a real product so um yeah it varies from product to product I guess the best answer I can give you cool um okay so uh you talked a little bit about like you know which one was the most lucrative okay yeah obviously Angel Investing in Twitter and then getting into you know Facebook and others is it works out well which one was the most fun so which chapter uh was the most fun and kind of with that is I'm on this Mission I just you know like after selling companies like I got time and so I was like all right well what's the party now I was like I want to find out who's having the most fun in their career and like because that's what I want to do now I just have the most most fun type of crew who's having the most fun with their life right now so I want to know for you which of your projects the most fun and then who do you see who who's a blueprint I could look at where you're like this I met this person they're having a blast with what they do yeah well I would say that the you know there's the nice thing about starting your own businesses is you're you're doing it because there's a personal Drive behind it like I've never created anything because I thought here's an opportunity to make money it's never been that it's it we were talking about this as we were just you know prior to hitting record or whatever about the little podcast case holder on Amazon right and like there's there's there's sometimes there's these little businesses where you see a broken piece of an industry and you're like well gosh if I went out and created this I could sell X number of units per year and it'd be a great little profitable business and like that's never really interest me it's more about the this the creativity of it all and just the exploration of an idea that I'm drawn to and so I I no startup is fun they're they're all they're all roller coasters loop-de-loops like there's the chaos of all those things right especially as you grow your team and there's HR issues and people getting sick and products not getting shipped on time and customers being upset and you know that there's there's it's never going to be just like this perfect dream but um that said as long as it's something that you're just naturally drawn to I'm always having a good time and and I'd I'd say though that said that's kind of a you know a little bit of a dodging the question but um more recently when I've got it gotten into the art in nft side of things uh that world in the world of cryptocurrency is probably the most fun because it is so blue ocean and there's just so much to be built there it's not building yet another app and competing on on CAC in the App Store it's like it's it's really um there's there's so many different directions you can go um and and very few well there there's there is a decent amount of of high quality entrepreneurs in the space but not as as much as say you know building something for the App Store so I enjoy kind of more the blue ocean aspect of that world man and I remember when so basically I started this company called The Hustle it was like a daily email and we sold it for we bootstrapped and sold it for tens of millions of dollars it kind of It kind of sounds a little bit similar to what you were saying about your story I lived in San Francisco and I started a media company because I was like I'm not capable of starting a tech company but I wish I were and also I'm good at writing when I saw you went and did the watch site uh hodinki uh first of all Sean have you ever read that like when I when I heard I was like a Blog I like watches I have Rolexes as like a Blog for luxury watches what the hell is this guy thinking like he just like he he he like it started as something else right you started it as like watchville or it was like a it was something else you got acquired or merged and you became like the CEO of this I remember looking at that just being like I have no idea what the hell he's doing I don't wear watches so I had no I was completely out of touch with it and it just seemed like you know a hobby project at the time and then I started looking into it and I was like oh wow there's like a huge passionate base around this and this company makes a lot of money then has been around I don't think in time I don't think it did make a lot of money did it like I remember I read that and I was like I like this business because I'm into it but like this guy's frankly way above this what is he thinking like this is he's like this thing's needlessly hard well watch Phil was so I again like just kind of like personal passion stuff so I was into watches mainly because when my father passed away he left me with a single watch and it's something that I wear every once in a while and it was for him it was like to afford a single Rolex in a in a middle class household is a big deal like that's like back in the 80s you know when my dad bought that he was just like I've made it you know I have it and I'm not talking about one of the crazy relaxes I'm talking about just the standard day-date kind of like you know simple relaxing like that was like the one thing he was really proud of you know that is like GMC pickup truck right and so um those that was something I was left with and then I started reading uh some of the content so Ben climber created hodinki the actual blog and I created Watch Phil which was an aggregator in an app that brought together all these different sources so that people could read this stuff on the mobile on their mobile phone because a lot of as silly as it sounds back then most of the excuse me most of the watch sites didn't have mobile versions of their site so they were on just like old old software publishing software that what that was just horrible so I I I made it all very readable push notifications like all the stuff just a kind of a wrapper for like all this great content and it just started growing and growing and growing and I had a lot of eyeballs like some of the the biggest collectors were Now using the product and um you know I I hodinki was the most kind of best prominent source of this content that took it very seriously so it was um you know they had had a couple full-time writers and so I talked to Ben and said hey you don't have the tech team here let's let's merge and combine forces so we um we merged the two companies together um he was three or four people and I was three or four people um I moved to New York became CEO at the time he was doing uh maybe a million and a half to two million dollars a year in Revenue so just enough to kind of do payroll and um we grew it from there and then turned on e-commerce and then started selling uh and creating Partnerships with the big watch brands and now you know as authorized dealers represent you know several dozen of the big watch brands that are out there and that just became a massive um it was still a relatively unknown back then whether or not people would actually spend large sums of money over Apple pay right and so um I remember we had someone from Apple that was um you know helping us on when you get to a certain size they kind of give you a little bit more concierge help on the apps stuff and they said that they had seen their a 250 000 transaction action come through Apple pay on an American Express and that was like the largest known transaction at that time that had been done over Apple pay for a site unseen uh vintage Rolex which was uh which was kind of crazy but anyway yeah so that I mean new new luxury watches or double-digit billions of dollars in a year um in terms of Market size so it's it's a big industry that that many people uh it's not as apparent in the states uh when you go overseas uh it you'll see how in in Europe there you know watches are so much more uh kind of a a type of thing that is is worn versus smart watches or more of the normal no watch at all uh here in the states did you did you just say that it went from like a million or two in revenue and now it's Sam said it's over a hundred million yeah yeah we're over 100 million in Revenue now man that is why that's insane and a lot of it's Commerce I mean you guys like when people talk about content and commerce I think most of the time it's nonsense like BuzzFeed talks about it and I'm like I don't know man I don't think people are going to be buying a lot of branded BuzzFeed pillows and [ __ ] like that or like they had that tasty thing I was like I don't think people are gonna buy a buzzfeed of it I just don't think that's gonna happen and you guys did it and I was like I don't know is this like gonna be a thing it seems so challenging but you guys are a perfect example of that and you know the other good example I bet you go to bring a trailer do you go to bringatrailer.com I've been to bring a trailer many times yeah it's one of his favorite sites actually they are awesome and so they've done the same thing but with cars where basically it's like this perfect tie of like I just I I bought one car from actually uh those websites and um but I read it every single day I'm like let's just see like what they're gonna write about what cool cars out there and then you guys did it with watches and I loved your videos with John Mayer where he talks about his watch collection and all that [ __ ] it's awesome but what um what other verticals or what other like Industries have you thought man maybe I could actually do this model I've always thought software but like that's not nearly as sexy and cool as Watchers in vintage cars but is there any it's like when you were like thinking about this model I I bet you're at night you're like I'm not gonna do it but I bet you I could apply this here here and here yeah I mean in some sense that's kind of what we're doing right now in the world of nfts where they're everyone that's armed with Photoshop can create a digital um piece of art on the blockchain and there's this mad rush into the world of nfts but there is just a ton of clutter right and and just a ton of of of of projects to sort through so what we created with proof was this this idea of you know it's the same thing with hodinki it's the same Playbook it's this curation with a point of view where you can have a strong editorial team come in um that isn't talking about the flipping side of the industry that isn't talking about how to make a quick buck in nfts that is really talking about what would you buy and hold for the next decade plus right and the Playbook that that hodinki nailed so well was that we took editorials so seriously and really hired out just a absolute Stellar team of writers that had a deep understanding of the World of Watches and not just a announcement this is a new watch that was dropped but an understanding of the the mechanics of the internals of the watches so they could tell you about the different movements and escapements and why certain complications were harder to pull off technically than others and so it was a real Geeks blog and with that technical hardcore writing developed trust and so you and once you have the trust of your readers then you're able to extend Commerce in a meaningful way and it's not asking them to buy you know a microwave or some like inexpensive or a throw pillow it's it's it's saying we have your trust this is what we believe to be a very important you know watch or collectible and because of that um you know you're willing to pull the trigger on a on a 20 30 50 000 purchase so um it's trust is so essential do you think that well I at the hustle we're trying to we hired a bunch of riders Sean hired some red as well for his thing is a crypto thing and I I've always debated this in my brain I'm like do I hire good writers and teach them about business or do I hire smart business people and teach them how to write what did you find was the best way to do that for uh watches yeah I mean the best way to do that was to find people that had the natural organic built-in love for uh horology like just this decide for for all things mechanical watches so you know we would have writers that um if you take for example like the speed master though the the watch that made it to the Moon from Omega um you know they could tell you every single variant and movement change and the reasons why and they were just super geeky on this stuff and they may have been just like b-plus writers where you get them but they had the technical knowledge in their brain and that's a lot easier to fix because you get them to put that that technical information out in draft form and then you just apply an editorial layer over the top of it where you have copy editors that come in and help you know stitch together a better more cohesive story before you actually publish it out to the world yeah I love that this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better you're a pretty chill guy when do you get like really fired up like what what gets you excited and or in a good or bad way like um you know I get really enthusiastic about the most random [ __ ] like the most uh it'll be like a creative project that I'm like I bet I could pull this off and I just go like I just get too excited about it Sam has that same thing but he also has it where if he feels these wronged Sims like you know willing to fight to the death about it until he gets really pumped up what gets you really pumped up rage is my fuel I love I love fighting yeah so I for me new ideas and working with creative people is the the most kind of like um strongest source of fuel for me so when I get together with an artist or a fellow entrepreneur and I actually it doesn't have to be someone that has created something big it has it's rather someone that just has wild ideas that that are potentially um uh just new new ways of looking at the world and so you meet a lot of entrepreneurs that are opportunistic iterative entrepreneurs where they'll see something they'll say oh there's some the rough edges on that particular product I'm gonna go sand them down make it easier for consumers and go launch a business and they have great success I like the ones that are just like really thinking about um entire new verticals or just flipping something completely on its head in new and creative ways um so that is what I'm really drawn to from just a straight idea a point of view and so entrepreneur-wise and when I invest in some of these startups those are my favorites are are those those crazy uh more world-changing entrepreneurs um in terms of the the rage side of things um yeah dude you've had you've had a bunch of Rage inducing moments I've followed your career I've seen I've seen you throw the [ __ ] raccoon we saw that one I've seen people protest outside your house I've seen you get in trouble for like I don't know wanting to demolish like a historical building I don't know like the whole story but like you've had you've kind of been a Target yeah I mean those that those all have their own unique story that the historical building thing was definitely not true that that was a that was a pretty funny one in that um but but that was uh that was just people wanting to keep an old house up in the neighborhood and they called it historically even though it really wasn't um uh we wanted to take it down because it was filled with asbestos which we didn't want to live in a house they had asbestos in it but that's a whole other story uh the rage stuff you know the the the the last four to five years of of my life has been spent um trying to to kind of Master my own mind and and I I think that if you can't um come to grips with your own Emperors like personal peace of mind uh it's it's a horrible place to be and so you know I remember as a young entrepreneur just kind of being on this 24 7 hustle to go build build I gotta win I have to win I have to win and it created a level of anxiety that was not good for me and and so I think that's probably why you saw me kind of do things like the meditation app and other other things because I it was just a natural forcing function for my my own self to like take some of that stuff more seriously and so you know um I just want to be able to to be able to sit and not have to have my mind be always on and that that's kind of been my goal and it's something I'm still I'm still working on so that it's not like I remember there was this interview with Elon Musk and I'm not comparing myself to Elon Musk but there's one thing that I I can certainly relate to where he talks about how his mind sometimes just never shuts off and he's always thinking about things problems new ideas like all these things and um and it's it's uh for me it's always been um that that has been not a blessing but something that has just been has weighed on me and and I've always tried to um I guess the the big push in the last few years has been to try and Wrangle that what kind of gets you all hot and bothered now where you're thinking about like the new Industries or the things that excite you what what ideas would you have one caveat that you're that you're not currently pursuing so uh because it's easy to say I'm excited about this project I'm doing I think uh like for example Palmer lucky was on the last episode and he was talking about all right we're like you're doing Andrew you did Oculus what are the ideas that are on your kind of like oh that's interesting but like I only got one me so I can't go do it because I think that's that's the most interesting to the audience um and to into ourselves and that's actually the origin of the podcast me and Sam have more ideas than we have time to do them and so we're like well if we just say them out loud here maybe people will take them and run with them or or find something interesting in it by the way have you ever talked to Palmer Kevin that guy is wild no I've never I've never chatted with them I I have to go back and listen to that episode though I'm really curious to know I've I've seen some written interviews but never never anything on video form it went live yesterday it sounds like you our YouTube and um most of our listener ships on like podcast uh feeds he is he's something man that dude that guy's eclectic he's just like enthusiastic about everything he like knows a lot about a lot he's like biology but more um but almost he's as smart but is more common do you know what I mean like for some reason I can relate to him even though I know that he's just like so much more smarter than I am yeah I I had read some stuff and and I I don't know how much of his true but some of his his company stuff that he was creating around drones for tracking people and and some controversial yeah I just it doesn't it doesn't fit well with my ethos so I I haven't really followed his careers as closely but um I'd be curious to listen to the interview for sure I think it was probably it was probably our best guest episode uh we've done a bunch of them and and the reason why is he's like you know he's like um a he took pretty genuine like he's pretty uh he's high energy but he's like direct so it's like um you know why why do you do this or how did you think about this and he's like for example he's like I thought about you know I'm kind of overweight could I like solve obesity and he's like you know but here's what doesn't work telling me to eat less of foods that I don't like the taste of and blah blah and so he's like he's like my solution was and I started prototyping this in my house was to just instead of beyond meat and stuff where they tried to make like a burger out of chickpeas he's like I wanted to just make fake food out of oil zero calorie food that tastes amazing because oil tastes amazing and we can manipulate oil into anything we could turn oil into candles we could turn it into waxes we could turn it into this into that he's like I created a grilled cheese sandwich that was zero calorie that tasted delicious using and we're like dude that sounds kind of insane and like he's like the pro we're like why didn't you do this crazy idea you sounded pretty passionate you went pretty far he's like well there just simply wasn't going to be enough oil supply to do it and he's like we would have had to take the oil out of the sewage system and centrifuge it to the recycling it he's like I and I realized you know even I couldn't do that and I was like wow this guy's like you know half genius uh half crazy and I you know I don't even know where the line is but I find it fascinating that he a thinks like this and B doesn't just think about it you know literally he's like yeah in my house we converted the dining room into like this lab in order to like do these you know these sorts of projects and like you know out of one of them came Andrew the eight billion dollar company and the other one was gonna be this crazy like you know oil-based fake food that's crazy that is awesome I love yeah see that's the type of Entrepreneurship that I'm I'm really drawn to it's just like people that are hacking on stuff um at night you know for me uh a lot of the stuff that that I think about in that that vein I tend to Outsource and get other people to to work on it um a lot of the stuff around um longevity I've been interested in specifically uh uh a drug uh called Rob mycin where it's been proven now to extend life and in in various animals and now apply to dogs so myself and um Jack Dorsey and Brian from coinbase and a few others all have been putting money into funding studies out of the University of Washington um to to Really prove this out in dogs and canines and then eventually move it into human trials so you know some of that stuff and the biohacking stuff I still put a lot of effort and time and attention in and I I try this stuff out on myself as well you know I'm I'm trying some of these experimental things um not because I I'm not one of these people that wants to put you know young people's blood in them and live forever I I I want to die I just you know I I do like the idea of not since I am an old I am an older dad I didn't have my first kid until my four until I was 40. I I would like to be around a little bit longer for them that's that's all well I've heard of people doing this I know Tim's doing this with the what's it called silosylum uh like mushrooms um yeah and uh how much does it cost to fund a study and what do you get out of it other than like the altruistic of like well we're just contributing to like the grand thing but is there is there like a direct outcome that you can get from it like we can use this to fund a company no no not not in this particular case Yeah Tim was also uh put some money into this one as well and there there was there's nothing you get out of it other than just trying to help further science you know a lot of these um in this particular case the study was funded but be depending on the sample size and how many canines you have involved you can only detect um certain levels of of um of output you need a larger sample base uh it is called like a properly powered study in order to detect smaller little nuances in the data and so we wanted to make sure it was powered enough to detect I believe up to 10 lifespan increase and so to power it was to add another million dollars or so into the study um to make sure that they could bring on the additional canines required to make that happen and you know I put my dog on it as well and and he's um 12 now and he still runs around like a pup and and um I attribute some of that to a cycle of this that he did um but yeah it's it's nothing other than just like you you you're figuring out ways in which you can like there's there's all these different Avenues on the philanthropic side where you're like what what is Meaningful to me personally and um uh this this this particular study you know I think even if it just worked for dogs would be fantastic like forget humans if if I could have my dog live for an additional five years like what a win you know so that it was kind of a win-win study dude I I talked to this guy that was like building I think it was called is it called a ageless RX I forget his the name of his company but he was he's trying to like you know do longevity stuff uh supplements and [ __ ] like that and uh things are going well for him but I was he was kind of explaining his reasoning he was like you know a lot of people are afraid to take these medicines but we've been thinking if we told them it's good for their dog they're actually will give it to their dog and he was he was kind of like hypothesizing to me and like brainstorming with me in real time he was like maybe we should just like do this for dogs and just give it to dogs and if once people see that it makes their dog live longer then they'll be like yeah yeah you know [ __ ] it give me that pill I'll take that thing uh because there's there's so much easier to commence to give it to their dog I'm with Kevin oh for sure dogs live forever well genome-wise there's so much more overlap and and and and connection there between canines and humans and there is a lot of other animals out there so um but you know the back to your question though about um you know out of curiosity what what would I go pursue right now in terms of startups that I'm not doing um I believe and it's very very clear now that AI in the next five years is gonna change everything um we're seeing open Ai and a lot of the projects they put out there recently um whether it be creative writing or I believe Fiverr as a company it will just be non-existent um it's going to destroy the low end of the creative Market initially and then work its way up the chain and you know just the the outputs that you're getting now from prompt based art um you know the future versions of Photoshop are are not going to be about moving uh Mouse and pixels around it's just going to be telling the computer what to do on your behalf you know you'll highlight an area and say you know change this aspect and and it'll all be done via prompt and and meaning you type in what you want to see change and the AOL we'll just make it happen we're seeing that today and I'm seeing you know advancements on the a side in in medicine uh obviously all the creative side there's a probably a half dozen or so tools now that will complete uh you know write complete paragraphs for you if you're writing sci-fi you give it some initial kind of prompts of where you want the story to go and the writing is quite good I I have no doubt in the next five years we'll see a New York Times bestseller that was 90 written by AI so it's it's I I there's just so much interest in with the interest and excitement flows the engineering Talent so I've seen a lot of um friends that are these you know a lot of people I worked with at Google and and other places where you know they're they're very insanely amazing Engineers you know previously working on distribution systems and some of these hard problems that they were trying to solve and now said hey I'm I'm actually going to Pivot into this this new world of AI and anytime you watch that kind of flow of high quality engineering Talent go move into something you you pay attention so I'm looking for at a lot of investments in that particular sector um and I'm very bullish on it and something I don't have time to work on but I believe some great businesses are going to be built there what would be an application you would want to do in that space of all those kind of like threads where it's like creative work medicine um you know writing an AI book is there an application that you can think of that you're like I feel like AI can solve this because I think that's that's it's a hammer in search of nails at this point uh that's when I talk Sean you made a joke you made a joke I I always teased Sean about web3 because I'm not the biggest fan of it and he was and we were joking about how uh he was like coming up with ideas with AI he's like finally a use case we found it and like with AI it seems like there's actually way more obvious use cases right but uh yeah what what application excites you oh I'd love to have that web 3 debate at some point too but um on the AI side you know it we're already seeing this right so so figma was purchased by Adobe you probably all saw that it was crazy acquisition um you know probably that the the the the the standard these days for prototyping and and creating interfaces for everything from mobile apps to websites to to you name it um we're seeing uh already built-in plugins to figma that allow you to prompt based build uh anything in in just a matter of seconds so you can say hey give me an interface for a mobile app that has these five options uh in this color with this futuristic type style and you know you get something back in real time in in in 25 seconds and it's it's rough but it's giving my design team and other designers out there um just a great starting point and it saves them a ton of time and effort but this is like inning one like two three years from now it'll be doing 90 of the work versus you know the first right now with probably 20 of the work so um that is is is super exciting and the assistance and and time to market for new ideas new projects I think is going to be compressed even further it's it's the same thing that we what happened with the kind of like late web 2 when we went from racking our own servers to fully deployed in an automated managed you know AWS instances that in some of these databases that just Auto scaled as you threw traffic at it it really compressed the time to the go to market time you know uh by quite a bit I think we'll see the same thing on on the design side so the speed at which we can develop uh and deploy new ideas is just going to be uh you know probably uh in order to order magnitude better than it is today um so I'm excited for that where do you uh a question that we started asking people and it's actually uh I've always learned so much from this but what message boards or Facebook groups or websites uh what corners of the web are you lurking in right now like for me I I love Facebook groups there's always like a weird Facebook group like a tiny example is over Landing do you guys know what over Landing is it's like no it's like um I don't know the exact definition but it's like you know how you see like Toyota 4Runners or F-150s that have like campers on it and it looks like they can go in the desert for like two weeks so I started like joining over Landing groups like three years ago because I was like oh this is kind of an interesting turn that's picking up or another one that we got really into a couple years ago was Mobility so like all these grown men not caring about yoga but they called it mobility and it was all about like stretching and it's like what's going on with there's like all these weird Instagram guys like doing all this stretching [ __ ] it's kind of intriguing and like a lot of times it's like instead of instead of therapy Executive coaching uh you know yeah yeah that's what happened from uh from yoga to Mobility yeah they just changed like mayo naoli and uh it totally worked it's awesome like I love Mobility now and like for example for the body stuff Tim Ferriss was always pretty good at that like he'd be talking about all this weird stuff like fasting it's like dude what the hell is this fasting thing what are you talking about uh and uh that was like a really cool corner of the web to like look in on and like see like how are the Geeks behaving now so I can learn like how the rest of the normal like Average Joe is going to care about in the next five or ten years yeah where is it Chris Dixon quote are you familiar with it yeah this is what the Geeks Who are playing with on the weekends will become like what we're all using like if several years later it's something some version of that yeah so like what geeky places are you hanging out right now for for Shawna Knights like a lot of Twitter people so we'll find like specific people in Twitter who are like quirky and we're like what the hell is this guy talking he's talking crazy I mean it's really cool yeah I mean I I follow a ton of people in in crypto Twitter so I pay attention to all the on you know the what's happening on web3 via VIA um Twitter and then also you know mostly Discord it's just a lot of private discords it's a lot of private telegrams small groups and Gatherings of peers they get together discuss new ideas new projects um these Dows uh these uh decentralized autonomous organizations where people get together to discuss and collect and purchase things um so it it's a lot of I I've never spent so much time in Discord it's like it's crazy that the conversation has shifted there in in Twitter largely um dude I hate that by the way I love the fact that like I dig or read it or something exists where you can just like if you Googled it and found it like you could participate now I'm like oh what the [ __ ] man Kevin's probably got this crazy ass telegram group that like there's I don't even I can't get in because I don't even know exists no you can join proof it's fifty thousand dollars and you're in bro it's easy no it's I think it's more like it's people realize that um they wanted a little bit more intimate conversation so I have a feeling that like there was a there was a lot of of this move to do smaller private discords and smaller telegram groups because it would lead to just not the masses flooding in and the chaos that you would see on Reddit and so I that's kind of been the move that that I've seen in in the Dr the reason behind a lot of that but um it's not hard to get into you just have to actually show them that you you know what you're doing like you have to you know get in there and embrace web3 which it sounds like Sam you may not be the biggest fan of but you have to you have to get in there and and and and talk the talk and know where to go and people will tell you like this is the place to be hanging out or I'm enjoying this Discord over here and you'll learn about this and this is where the AI discords are or whatever it may be and um that's just kind of the new it's the new Facebook Facebook's uh it's it's it's I'm sure it's good for some things but it's it's dead when it comes to web three you want me to tell you my why I'm not a fan of this and yes please I'm gonna get you I'm gonna try and get you fired up here and then yeah let's try talk about proof I do it sounds like I'm making an easy out which I kind of am but basically like I am I'm I'm decently educated just by hanging out with Sean and so I have to admit that like some of my beliefs are a little bit loosely held uh and and I'm not the most educated on the topic but my opinion on web3 is basically it's a bunch of like it's just this kind of circular economy of a bunch of people making making products to serve an industry that has yet to like truly figure out or I don't know what you call an industry a movement that has yet to truly figure out like what the what the thing is that they're doing and there's so many examples where people I think are fairly like egotistical and elitists about it saying like Web 2.0 is old and like the way this has to be decentralized or this has to be that's why it's like man just because you're putting web 3 in front of something that doesn't mean that there's actually a problem here and I think you're just wasting so much time and energy working on something that is just like a circle jerk that doesn't actually solve a problem better than the web Point Web 2.0 version also I thought it's pretty dogmatic where it's like decentralize everything it's like dude I want some stuff centralized like can you imagine like calling customer service on a decentral like it's like no I like there are some things that I want like to have a to be centralized and I thought that they're a little bit too dogmatic and I thought that they were oftentimes I'm saying like they like you people uh like you guys like didn't always have wonderful Solutions you were just making [ __ ] up in order to like get in the game and I just thought that it it kind of bothered me yeah I mean I I feel your frustration there and that I too am someone that um when I look at what's being built in web 3 if it's it's just for the sake of calling something decentralized and there's nothing behind it or no structural Advantage for that being the case um I think it's it's it's it's silly you know it's like I'll give you a great example um we're we're working on um there's a lot of things that you want to do in web3 some of them are high value and some of them are low value when you were talking about working with the community so we have a community of people that come together to do all different types of things and some of it is what we call token gated content so it's like a membership model where you have to be a member of something or hold a certain nft in order to unlock certain access to videos or content or whatever it may be some of those things can be high value uh items where you receive an nft or something that is um actually has some Financial like you know something behind it that is a case where you want to actually have that Hardware wallet and pull it out and and do it in a way that is secure and that is protected and um but the rest of the time you don't need that you can use a Google login it's okay to use a web 2 login it's okay to use your email and password with two-factor authentication like we don't have to throw away a lot of the Fantastic technology that's been built in web 2. there's other things like for example some decentralized uh maximalists and I think maximalist is really what we're talking about here because anyone that is a maximalist uh on uh this means what you just like extreme it just means that you are so into something that you can't see any other way and it's like it's your way or there's no possible there are people out there that say there is no other cryptocurrency than Bitcoin that's the only one pumps are our Buddy isn't pop like don't they call them online a Bitcoin Maxi I don't think he I think he is a maximum coin and and you know dorsey's in that camp too where he's like trying to extend Bitcoin and says that's that's kind of the only currency and I I think this applies to so many different things like I don't want to get into Political talk but anytime you get to the fringes of anything where it's like this is the only thing that matters you get into Crazy Town in my point of view and so you know I think that is a danger of web 3 where there's a lot of that kind of idea that if if it's not pure web 3 it's not right and I'm with you I 100 agree but that said like I've seen this idea and a lot of the defy tooling when I say defy I mean decentralized finance a lot of the D5 tooling that's being built on the blockchain uh in a performant way in a cost-effective way in a way that when you think about Wells Fargo as an organization with you know 150 000 employees I'm just making that up by maybe it's fifty thousand or seventy five thousand somewhere in between that that range where that is just a lot of bloat and in because of that bloat and because of that in insane monthly not that that company has to cover um you know those dollars are are not not flowing to the right people and so there are examples of more efficient ways of doing Finance on the blockchain that that can be done in a trustless way written into smart contract code that will mean for better outcomes for the consumer now those can be paired with centralized Solutions right like coinbase is a centralized organization you have a email address you can send it if something is wrong with your crypto account but they hold and keep decentralized currency right and they and they do things like decentralized staking where you earn four percent on your ethereum but they're a centralized company that gives you that customer support so I'm not I'm I'm a I think that the the ones that really win here yes there are going to be the people that say self-custody is the only way there's this famous saying that if it's not your keys it's not your crypto like like you have to hold your own private keys I'm not in that camp I do that personally and use safety deposit box and a whole slew of things to safeguard that for some things but there's other Solutions where where a hybrid approach makes more sense so know that your argument is completely valid and that a lot of entrepreneurs that are building a web 3 completely agree with you and that let's not throw away the baby with the bath water here there's a lot of great things but there are also some great advantage is that come with being decentralized or a whole slew of other Technologies that's being built on web3 um that that I could point to that you'd say like oh that yeah actually that that does make more sense than the old way of doing things so let's let's do this real quick so you've probably seen just like anybody else these like uh there's like these permanent uh like just like there's permeables for crypto there's Perma bears and their mission in life is to basically find every stupid use case of crypto and highlight it or every bad investment or every sure clip of a a pro you know some dude at a16z who goes on a podcast and says something dumb about crypto when asked about a use case um and you talked about me because I was just on their podcast two weeks ago so no no they I haven't seen you but Dixon but like you know there's there's people that sort of are are focused on on poking holes and I think there's some value in poking holes but there's also you know it's a little bit embarrassing to spend your whole day poking holes on something you know but let's put it this way I'm on this podcast I'm the the crypto believer I'm the one who puts a significant portion of my net worth I have a crypto Media company I have a bunch of belief in crypto but for this use kit for this exercise here I'm gonna point out two things that I think uh all would be would be you know strong and valid points against crypto to somebody like you who is also a crypto believer so I want you to kind of argue against these and I hope that uh this doesn't get clipped as like you know famous investor X fumbles the ball uh when trying to explain you know crypto thing so let's try to do better than that yeah let's do it okay so the first would be around uh nfts right so you're a big nft guy and there's nft art which I think pretty hard to argue against at this point like digital art cool their ability to own digital art that's one use case for nfts but a lot of people who believe in nfts will also say but that's just the beginning and if Jesus is a file format it's a protocol there's all these different use cases for nfts and um I saw the founder of of openc I think uh talked about this yesterday on a podcast where he's like they're like why he you know he's like oh in other use cases NFC tickets and they're like so why would there why would you want to have an nft ticket he's like well because then you it's you know you could plug it into defy and you could take a loan against your ticket and then people were like why the [ __ ] would I want to take a loan against my 60 like concert ticket like is that right really what the hype is about and it's sort of a silly use case so I would like you to give me the non-silly nft use cases that you're excited about so like yeah and the well let's let's take an example let's take the ticket example and and the art one is easy it's a new canvas but let's actually let's cover that first the art one is easy it's a new canvas you can do things and pull from uh real-time data to display our in very unique fun creative ways right like it's really not that much different than your than Rolexes I mean like there's no reason why a Rolex is 150 000 other than like a lot of people think it's cool so yeah I would say there's a difference there because it's something you may not know about Rolex is they make over a million Rolexes per year and so Rolex it hides that number and the reason they hide that number is because if they didn't have a sense of scarcity around it and they they do this specifically when you go in their stores they'll always be next time you walk by an actual true Rolex boutique notice how there's like some missing spots and and when you go inside and that's all play it's play because they're like oh they're sold out they're not available but we can put you on this list and in in three to four months we might you might get a phone call guess what you always get the phone call and and the watch is coming because there's they're making a million a year the nice thing about you know the the one of the things that I was always so confused by is I was a common comic book collector way back in the day and I bought Wolverine number one because I love Wolverine it was like my childhood like I always wanted to own one right and so I bought Wolverine number one and it always hovered around fifty dollars and I was like why is this not going up it's a very first Wolverine launched in the 80s right it wasn't the first appearance of Wolverine but it was the first Wolverine Comic and I finally got a hold of a really well-known collector and he goes oh he goes you don't know they knew by that point that Wolverine was a hot character and so they printed over 300 000 copies of that first edition I was like oh [ __ ] like that's why there's just a flood of these in the market so you know nfts the beautiful thing about this when you have an artist produce a piece it has proven provenance so you know where it's come from has proven scarcity so you can't like create you know additional add-ons or duplicates because it's all recorded on the blockchain and then you have the unique ability to do very creative things like animation uh oracles work the art can change based on the stock market price or time of day or phase of the moon and there's just so much more extension it's a new vertical for art fine that's great awesome like digital frames are going to be getting better it is going to be a thing like there's no in my mind there is no argument to be had there that this won't be because I don't that against the the future or the inevitable and art is the easy use case for nfts the ticket thing is different right so the ticket thing I I I'm with you like I understand that people are in in web 3 are trying to like create these fancy financial instruments to like Leverage you on anything that you own they're like hey you have a ticket to that upcoming concert that's sold out you know spin into this defy unit and take a loan against it and then you can buy it back and use the money in the short term and it's like that's all [ __ ] man that nobody's gonna do that right it's it's it's don't get me wrong there's there's there are specific use cases where that does make sense like loan against nfts is going to be the same thing that happens when Christie's gives you a loan against your Picasso right like these these happen this happens all the time it's just a parallel for the digital world there are certain types of of assets digital assets that getting loans against them if it's something you want will make sense the tickets thing for me is very confusing but while I will tell you is interesting and I've talked to actual rock stars about this like I had Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park on my show and he's a huge nft fan and he creates them and um you know awesome awesome Flex by the way you know I've I've talked to some rock stars about this that's cool I think it's cool I think it's important because like you you want to get the artist to buy in on this totally too because it just keeps saying it's cool yeah yeah he's a he's an awesome guy very approachable very approachable in the terms of rock star guys but Noah will tell you that like well what we talked about which is an obvious one is like okay imagine the tickets well let me step back one thing I believe to be true 90 plus percent of people that interact with nfts over the long term I believe won't even know it as they're doing it as an nft it'll just be something where they have a digital wallet an app or something like that and they have a ticket there right they're not going to know that behind the scenes that is powered by the blockchain and recorded by the blockchain right so I think what's gonna happen is the nice thing about the blockchain is because it is a ledger in an immutable Ledger that is that is a way to say improve that you have done something that you either attended an event or you've you know you've actually physically done something there's a ton of possibilities that I can unlock right if I go and I see Mike Shinoda play five shows or ten shows maybe he says okay now according to the blockchain in our app and again the consumer doesn't need to know about this anyone that's attended 10 of my shows gets a VIP meet and greet before the show right and there's a thousand different things that you can do that you want to have that security of the blockchain behind the scenes so it's not being forged so there's not being copies of it being made so there's not like a way to fake it and that's the nice thing about the blockchain is it provides you a way to have the security and knowledge that something is not being faked and you can imagine that's broadly applicable to a whole slew of different Industries um I don't think we'll be calling them quote unquote nfts you know it's just going to be a great piece of tech it's just another database that's all it is it's a distributed um immutable database that is decentralized it's that's all this is which unlocks a bunch of fun new use cases let's caveat it all right so let's say because I think I get when I get what you're saying but I also get the uh the eye rolls that people get when it's like cool tell me like how this is going to make my life better and it's like well the cool thing about a blockchain is that it's provable scarce it's like it's like what you're telling me about the Under the Hood part whereas for example if my mom is like if I'm like Mom you should set up an email address and she's like what the heck is email I don't need that and it's like well no check this out like you know you send letters or you you know you send letters to your sister who lives across the country like watch this if you do it this way it's free and it'll be instant and like oh wow that's cool and hey you know it's even better because it's all digital you can just type the word and it'll find that file you don't have to keep it organized somewhere in a folder in your house yeah all right so I can I don't have to tell her how it works at all I can literally just say it made your life better by being by giving you you know more time More Money More whatever and so I think the question is what does nfts give what what does what will an nft give a person that makes their life better without explaining how how the tech works at all sure I'll give you I'll give you a great example of one that hasn't launched yet but something that that I'm personally working on so I I I'm working with um a well-known like very culty kind of wine producer out there and um you know wine at the highest level at the high end it's a tricky it's a tricky business because there's you know forgeries there's fake labels there's they're putting holograms on the side of them they're putting um chips inside of the labels so that they can be scanned to to prove that they're authentic right um that's one piece so the first question is if I'm buying off the secondary market and not directly from the producer am I getting something that's legit excuse me the second piece of that is once I received that bottle you know how do I store it to ensure that if I'm going to keep something and I want this asset to appreciate over time um and I want to drink it a decade from now or two then you know how do I ensure that it is being stored the right way so one thing that is happening in the next four months will be the issuance of nfts to people that is going to be from a major well-known Winery where it will represent one physical bottle of wine there's a couple advantages here one you don't have to take possession of it right away you can let it sit in its proven perfect storage conditions and age for decades to come you can let it appreciate in that in those storage conditions and you can hold on to the proven ownership of it as an nft let's say that bottle of wine for four or five x's over the next decade you don't ever have to then pull the wine in out of the cellar take ownership above it find a third party to sell it and then resell it where that person is questioning the authenticity of that wine instead you can just transfer that nft to a buddy you can gift it to them for a special occasion or an anniversary and then when they decided hey I want to drink this they press two buttons and that bottle of wine that has been stored perfectly for a decade shows up at their door that is efficiency that eliminates fraud there is just so much to love in that equation and that'll be applied to the watch industry to the luxury world to all these different verticals and it just makes sense like what about that I'm just curious as you hear me explain it it doesn't sound like a better world like in in terms of fixing a bunch of problems I think uh if I was gonna if I was going to argue against that like just a steel man the argumentation I think it would be cool uh like maybe it's gonna maybe these are certificates for Collectibles most you know it's not gonna that doesn't impact most people's lives because most people are not collecting high-end bags or wines or this where there's huge problems of forgery like that uh that may be one thing which is it's not going to impact that many people um in that sense oh you're telling me and if he's at this game-changing world changing technology but that's a really Niche specific you know one percenter type problem and then the other is like you know um sounds like an nft is like a digital certificate um you know you could have done that with it with another type of certificate but um or another type of database maybe and but maybe this is better uh like I do agree it's better but like it was possible before it didn't take the impossible make it possible it made the uh the possible made it maybe made it more efficient or a little bit more convenient for the consumer and so I think that would be maybe one argument against it but I don't want to go too far in the weeds yeah the other thing that I think that to add on to that though is that because you have well I'll give you an example like back and you know the back to the rock star example of an artist um you're Reliant upon if you did want to do some type of Rewards program or something for well actually let me step up one more point the point you made about the one percenter problem and is this applicable to those people you're absolutely right like there's only a certain number of people that are going to collect art at the highest level and one at the highest level and all that I mean granted these are double digit billions of dollars of year like big markets to go after but you're right these specific use cases that I'm giving are are very Niche right um I think on the more broadly uh on on the on the idea of just membership and access and prove where you've been what you've done to unlock loyalty and rewards over the long term and think about you know replacing the AmEx points or you know other point type systems or reward systems with blockchain the beautiful thing about it being decentralized and this is one argument for decentralization is that it's forever on the chain and you're not dependent upon a company being around for that for that to exist so if an artist is engaged with a startup that is working on a Loyalty Rewards program for them and they run out of capital and die three years later as long as they stored their information on the blockchain that artists can then just pick up where they left off and it just it continues forward and we've already seen this happen where there's been several startups that have stored their information on the blockchain where they go out of business because they just their their idea didn't hit and then someone fills the the void and comes and says I have a better take on this and now let me tap into that public data and use it going forward so that not All Is Lost which is kind of a A New Concept in rather than just a database going away it's always going to be there and can be reused which I think is pretty pretty compelling the really simple two-second example of this is you play a game you you get really into fortnite you go buy a bunch of skins you you dress up your character you got the cool you know like glider and you bought all that stuff and you know a year and a half goes by your friends have moved on they're all playing Call of Duty now you've sank 350 dollars into fortnite you don't own those items you can't resell those items you can't recoup any of that value nor could you take those items into any other game so in a web 3 world either another game could come out that says hey we accept item we we plugged into this protocol so you can bring your cool sword from game one to game two that makes the sword more valuable because now it can be used in multiple games so maybe we're seeing this already the interoperability between multiple web3 platforms saying that this is a defined standard and now these items can digitally move between platforms it makes a ton of sense now those items are more valuable because they can be used in more places and the other one is that if I'm just done with the game I could just dump it on to the next person who's really interested in fortnite and I can recoup some of my investment which will make more people want to spend in games because it's not just a mighty pit it's an asset that they could resell all right so that's like the quicker example maybe I love that you joined my side is on your side but I have to argue the other way uh in order for this to be interesting yeah at the end you're like I get it I'm in there's another crypto nerd argument would be okay for years people have been saying that Bitcoin is this this inflation head or this currency that that's that's uh that doesn't inflate and oh my God you know how lucky for you guys the US government starts printing trillions of dollars inflation is at record highs it's in the news every day wait what happened to that awesome inflation hedge ask them why is it down 50 when inflation is is is is the bigger problem than ever shouldn't this be shouldn't this be your time to shine Bitcoin so yeah what say you to that yeah I mean it's it's a real shame that that Bitcoin has been so spiky because if it hadn't been this linear growth to 20 000 to where it is today we'd all be like this is the most amazing thing ever like like if you just take the spikes out and make it look linear it it still looks like an incredible asset like you know just go back five years look where it is now versus five years ago so it's the spiky nature of it that that that hurts it in the end I would say that um you know I I'm a fan I think Bitcoin is is a tough one because it's I I don't like that it's not a green currency and I don't see a clear path ever being the case um and I know everyone's trying to extend it in new and exciting ways and try to make it more ethereum-like and so that it can do more than just be uh this type of digital gold um for me you know when I when I think about those types of assets it's I'm responsible in that I I'm not betting the farm on this but is it a small percentage of my portfolio absolutely and I just considered another asset class that provides me a little bit of um of diversification across the board so you know the majority of of my you know personal Holdings is is still um standard you know index funds uh that that are pretty vanilla the low-cost index funds you know the Vanguard Way right yeah and I was actually going to ask that what what is your liquid portfolio look like like where like I was at I was been waiting to ask you that Sam is like a ETF low-cost ETFs and bonds dude I'm 80 in Vanguard index funds 20 bonds that's all and then I build private businesses yes Sean like has put everything into I'm like investing crypto and then like you know five companies I believe in and you know a little bit of index funds like it's like yeah zero like it's like five percent or something like that I keep ten percent in cash or something and so what would your or what would your pie chart look like and obviously it changes over time yeah so so my pie chart would be essentially this um you know 80 percent well I think there's an important thing to caveat here is that as a venture capital uh partner over true Ventures I have a lot of um risk on the table there in in Venture early stage Investments did you have to put your own money into that or is that just your character I do yeah I had to put my own money into it as an investing partner you also invest alongside the fund so um that is my bucket of risk right so just setting that aside and saying okay you know I have carrying the fund that's my pocket of high high risk too much capitalism right you put like I don't know what like quarter million dollars or a million dollars or something like that into that it depends on the size of the fund it's it's a it's it's a percentage of the fund we just closed our latest fund which is 750 million and so the partners put in a percent of of that um in back into the fund uh I'd have to look at what the exact numbers are but it's it's substantial they want you to have skin in the game when you're investing um so you know I consider that to be like those are those are the big high risk buckets so everything else I do I want to be just super vanilla and it's it's that it's that Vanguard index fund um keep it you know keep it really simple I don't do bond funds I'd rather rely on people to buy Bonds on my behalf um you know I am laddering into uh uh bills right now because you're getting four plus percent in the short term and so you know just just Ladder into to to those makes a ton of sense right now um you know anyone out there that has 10 grand that's sitting round that doesn't go by an eye bill right now that's earning over nine percent is just insane like that's the most no-brainer scenario for for someone that's listening to this podcast by the way there's like one week left of that right I was like yeah that's right obviously not investment advice but you are getting the full faith of the US government as the backer and it's over nine percent and you can do ten thousand for yourself and ten thousand for your spouse which is uh amazing so um anyway it's I keep it really simple and then and then the rest is is is the crypto the crypto side of things is like you know let's call it uh 50 nfts and 50 uh digital assets and that's you know probably ten percent overall okay so so 90 of non-venture stuff is in just an index fund yeah yeah in multiple index funds that cover a variety of markets but yeah do you touch real estate at all or no not really other than just you know my own stuff do you own or rent I own uh we're we've always had this debate and I know you got to go to them and I hear your alarms going off but we always have this debate well we both agree I I own I wish I would have rented dude I just want to rent everything I don't want to own a lot of stuff do you regret owning or or do you like being an owner um you know the the thing is when interest rates were low you can just take a bunch of capital back out of your house and pour it back into the market assuming that you're going to beat that you know if you could get uh own a house uh take a loan out against against that house and get you know a two a couple couple of points and and earn five to seven in the market like I'll take that Delta all day long so um that's kind of the way I play it cool well dude you're uh I'm really happy we got to talk I um I used to work out of the Reddit building at uh third in Bryant and I remember seeing you walk by and I was like oh [ __ ] that's Kevin I wish I would have said hey that was in 2012. so it's only been 11 years later 10 years later but uh I'm happy that we were able to talk um I've been a big fan of yours I know Sean has as well so it's really uh exciting to be able to meet you I love that you guys are doing this show I mean it reminds me a lot of like the the kind of fun little hash out debates that Tim Ferriss and I have when we do our random shows like they're just fun right you gave a couple of friends together and shoot the [ __ ] and some some crazy discussions uh it could come out of it so that's that's great dude those were I can't believe how big those were back then I remember the the Kevin and Tim shows I think they call that he like had a funny name for you like Tim Tim top yeah oh I call him Tim Tim still and it is Kev Kev but yeah we just shot one here uh in person uh maybe two weeks ago which was fun it was good to see Tim again I hadn't seen him in in a minute but uh little things you like I remember you talked about Wim Hof back been and I was like oh and that you know next day I'm on my floor like breathing everything yeah on purpose you're gonna remember your wife Dr Dara is that her name Daria yeah Daria like it's funny it's like that stuff was so I mean it still is but it was like particularly when I was in 22 and just getting into Silicon Valley like I really looked up to you guys I was like just show me how to Silicon Valley you know what I mean it was really cool yeah that was that was a fun I was I I miss not living in the same city as as Tim because we we always have get into some trouble when we're together so yeah you guys thanks for doing the blueprint for us in in terms of like hey if you could find somebody you got chemistry with and you shoot the [ __ ] and like what's your content your content is just yo I'm super curious and interested in a bunch of things and this becomes my outlet to summarize you know my set of experiments and rabbit holes I've been going down and like you know we would have never done a podcast of like oh the ad Revenue will be enough it's like no it's not really like [ __ ] that it's not really relevant um and we're seeing you know Tim and you and how oh actually it's these relationships and these Investments and there's these little side projects you kick up and actually you can make this whole thing work without having to go you know do this like you know traditional kind of venture path of uh yeah of raising money to go do this thing so that was pretty uh inspiring so yo thank you for that I think you know just seeing a blueprint is like that Roger Bannister four minute mile where you're like oh I can have the lifestyle I want but on my terms and yeah if these guys can do it then we can do it oh I mean it's it's congrats to you both it seems like uh from from what I heard here at the beginning of this episode you guys have done quite well and and uh congrats on your success it's awesome congrats to you too and thanks for kind of Paving the way we appreciate it and thanks for coming thanks for having me [Music]

so what they're doing is uh they basically take like a vacant property same thing as a spirit store they take a vacant property they say hey we'll cut you a check for 10 15 grand if we can use your house right or they'll they'll rent a property or they'll find a vacant property and they basically just use it for the month they have this operational thing where they can just spin up the haunted house and then they charge like 40 bucks you know to enter and you can sort of do the math and realize man they're probably making half a million to a million dollars in about a about a month [Music] all right you want to go with Rahul or if you want to come out all right troll of the year we haven't even done our my our Millie awards for the end of the year thing that we always do I'm calling it now the troll of the Year give the background so Elon takes over Twitter I guess the purchase went through I feel like there was never like confirmation like he actually wired them on he just literally showed up the office and like yeah there there hasn't been like a proper ribber ribbing ribbing ribbon-cutting moment like it's not like a squatter you just like went into the office and they're like I guess you own it now oh you seem to be here right yeah that's mine the playground rules like wow that's all it took to have Twitter have you ever heard of uh like a coup like a coup d'etat like with governments uh you know I was I I read a lot of yeah they're pretty cool yeah I read a lot of history history jokes or history jokes I read a lot of history books about uh whatever and they talk about like a coup and I'm like so you literally just like walked into the White House and you just said like you know this is mine and like the general has promised me that he's gonna commit these soldiers to attack you know what I mean it's like an interesting concept you're like so it's all just made up I guess like these rules that we're we we live by this is just this is fiction and that's kind of like what I felt like he did he just walked he's like well I I own this now thank you have you seen uh you know Derek Lewis the UFC fighter have you seen that compilation of his thing where he says just get up no so they're like Derek uh you're big like knockout artist but like you know the the knock on you've always been like what if you get a wrestling thing you know how's your Jiu Jitsu or your training it's just ain't real man and they're like what he's like man you don't need Jiu Jitsu just get up and they're like he's like why I don't want to stay on the ground with another man between my legs no I'm not into that like I'm not gonna do so I'm just gonna get up they're like but you you need Jiu Jitsu to get up he's like no I'm just gonna get up and so so there's a clip of him saying that and then there's like it's like a six minute compilation of literally somebody takes him down he doesn't he just stands back up so powerful that's how I feel that's what Elon Musk did he's like nah just just walk in yeah take it what do you mean he's like well I'm just gonna walk in with a sink and take it so anyway he does this thing where he just he says this is mine and there's all these reporters outside of Twitter's office and it's amazing for a story they're waiting for the story about something going wrong Elon comes here oh there's a protest there's a walk and so what happens is the first big story that happens is there's a picture of these two guys and uh kind of like you know kind of like nerdy sort of engineering looking guys and they're holding giant cardboard boxes and it says these two data scientists the data Engineers data scientists were fired today from Twitter here they're seen walking out with their possessions and their boxes and um and I saw it and immediately something looked a little off because I was like this guy just looks so goofy but I was like man that's pretty believable you know there's a bunch of goofy looking people are working Tech but okay oh my God he looks wild man they really found the perfect character he looks pretty goofy and then I read the name and it says but he but he but he had a box in his hand so he each had a brown box like which is just foreign because like if you work at a tech company like you you don't even probably own anything you own enough just to put in a book put your laptop in your backpack and like if you do get fired do they even like is that a thing where you like hand people a box anymore I don't know they played it perfectly so then it says Rahul ligma and something Johnson uh Daniel Johnson were fired today blah blah and then and I saw that and I was like oh my God this guy executed a ligman like for those who don't know ligma is a is a little joke that people play on the internet where it's like like you say something about ligma and then someone's like ligma what's like I'm not familiar link my nuts all right so that's the joke and they did this to basically I think CNBC was the first one who like reported it and then it just kept getting the same photo kept getting spread ever because everybody wanted this story about and then she was this CNBC reporter and I I the original tweet said something like uh we're at the scene of Twitter these two Engineers just came out who said they're the first to be laid off and it's just so clear how defeated they are and like there's like an audible or what does she say she's like there's just a visible uh they're just visibly defeated and totally broken and Rahul ligma says now he has no idea how he's gonna be able to afford his Tesla payments uh and then he's sitting there holding a Michelle Obama book and so it's like him with his box just holding this Michelle Obama book I don't know why and he just said it and she tweeted out like you know this is just they say the first of many that's going to happen it was just like a crazy crazy scene so people are um people are are have heard this part of the story but now we got that my first million exclusive juice on top of it so somebody in our group chat knows this guy who did this and he shared a text message that the guy sent before he did it so he goes um he goes yo bro and the person says sup he goes are you doing anything in the next hour want to help me pull off a stunt I'm at the gym and I need a box LOL I'm gonna walk out in front of the Twitter office with a box in my hand there's hella TV Crews outside and then this is literally how he pulled this up and he just goes he gets an empty box and a Michelle Obama book there's nothing else in the box and we watch out in the TV Crews go for it and so so that was I thought amazing and then he so that was like I mean what kind of Genius is this person then he goes uh there's hella TV Crews let's go get him there he goes he bro the media is so dumb I literally put five minutes of planning into this even my uncle in India has seen the picture now he goes he goes the first thing is did you just see the cameras and just walk out there he goes yeah basically I got to the gym it's near Twitter's headquarters I saw all these cameras and so I just went and did it amazing that is so funny the better who is this guy he's like a founder of like a tech startup basically he just did this before Oh my God yeah I am ready to invest and his thing says like stealth startups I'm like I'm ready to invest in whatever he's doing anything on TV there's hella TV cameras name your price ligma so so he goes okay so that was him did you see the interview with the other guy Daniel Johnson no he also had a little gem so his was on videos that they're like you know um how do you feel about this today he's like I don't know I just gotta like I gotta go home I gotta talk to my husband and wife and regroup I don't know I just I just really want to go home I really want to go home talk to my husband and wife the most San Francisco thing ever yeah did anyone comment on that the news didn't even like like they just played the clip and then I saw that I was like wow that is the funniest thing I've ever heard perfect timing and these guys are like you know comedic Geniuses basically so yeah this is pretty gold amazingly well played um yeah do you want to talk about the Elon war room like what he's actually doing in there like do you want to talk about that or not really have your phone not really I mean like I I read that he said like hey guys you have a week to get this one thing done and I think that that's cool that's that's a good way to run things I'm nervous he's gonna screw it all up and like because I make money from Twitter so like I don't want it to go away uh but uh of course chill bro yeah yeah I got Consulting calls to take uh so um I don't really care though like when he talks about this [ __ ] I'm like this doesn't impact me that much I don't I don't care what you're gonna do well I just want I don't care it's not gonna impact me but I do find it interesting how he's doing about this so basically the report is he goes in and the first report I thought again was another troll but I guess this is real do you see this he's like he told every engineer to print out all the code that they've committed and they've written in the last three or six months and have it ready for review did you see this why print so you can just see the the pages and then they change their mind like I guess they realize how bad of an idea that was and like you know an hour later they're like Shred the papers actually we're gonna review on the computer just be prepared to review and so people are like all these Engineers like I printed out like you know 300 pages of code so I guess I'll just thread this I don't know what's going on here dude and what's crazy is like if you go to businessinsider.com the headline is like you know I think it says like the toil of working at Twitter and it's like painting it like these people here's their initial yeah this is like this is what it's like to toil Elon musk's Twitter the expectation is literally to work 24 7. and is it really I think that that's I swear to God straight clown Behavior I cannot believe they're doing that I can believe it and it says this is it one of the people familiar said describing the feeling of the company under musk your job is on the line it's like dude your job's always on the line uh like is it you know like this isn't like it's not your right to work at Twitter you dumbass uh but I I uh I I thought it was funny because like come on man like you're you're coding this yeah you're gonna have to work 50 hours maybe for a little while but also I think a lot of employees at Twitter are probably like this is awesome we've been sitting on our ass let's let's do it and that side doesn't seem to be getting covered a lot yeah and so he created I guess a war room so he basically brought in a bunch of people he trust so he brought in people from his other companies like he brought in his chief legal person that guy's now like the general counsel basically he brought in he created a war room and now here's who's reported to be in the war room it's uh Elon his uh his his chief counsel then it's Jason calacanus oh and then I think Jason's Jason's amazing but like what the hell does he know yeah I guess uh sriram from a16z so just venture capitalist who's a former PM who used to work at Twitter is also you know how to run at Twitter um and Clubhouse and uh Snapchat yeah and then also um I guess like some other people some Engineers or people from uh like boring company or neural link or whatever like some people he trust like his cousin is there like and they basically just set up shop and they were like all right what we're gonna do with this thing and they're like change the logged out page it forces you to sign up now you should be able to read tweets before you sign in you know you sign up and then which is like an experiment's been tried many times before and there's like um you know we need to have this verification program you have five days to deliver this I guess and so there's like sort of uh trying to figure this out of you know who stays who goes what are we building how are we going to turn this thing around and um fascinating I wish I could be a fly on the wall in this uh in this war room I think that would be like probably the most interesting thing to do right now I think it would be awesome um I hope they don't screw it up though because I got some [ __ ] courses I gotta sell so don't screw it up my point of view has always been very simple which is all the things he complains about are things that like power users would be annoyed at on Twitter like the Bots problem or um you know verification or the algorithm you know like not serving me the tweets I want like the problem is that just only I don't know whatever like 300 million people use Twitter and it's like you know five times smaller than like the other big social services and it doesn't really grow that much and like it's not like you know my mom doesn't use Twitter because she's like oh there's too many Bots if I tweet about crypto that will tell me to buy crypto that's not her problem she just doesn't see value in it and like you know he just says I don't get it yeah I don't get it I I don't know why I would need this like you know I don't I don't need to check this whereas Instagram and WhatsApp and like Snapchat have all given her a reason that she needs to have it like she needs to have Snapchat if she wants to see more pictures of her kids she needs to have Instagram if she wants to keep up with what's going on with like Bollywood or whatever right like you know everybody finds a need in the service and like that's the core problem with Twitter is that the core needed addresses is only for like people like us and like it doesn't address the need for a whole bunch of other people on the planet and if they wanted it to be more valuable then they would need to do that our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new PRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better Happy Halloween dude yeah you too I uh since I'm not 12 I don't dress up I I don't understand like shots fired at producer Ben well I just like don't understand why people like obsessed over Halloween to me it just seems like when your wife was buying a wedding dress were you like this is [ __ ] you're gonna spend all this money for something that you're literally gonna use for three hours in your entire life and that's how I feel like Halloween is you know what I mean I just find it like to be the most impractical thing there is it just it's a lot of work for like a few hours bro you probably bought like a a giant sled so you could do sled pushes in your backyard like you know come on I'm sure you have some ridiculous purchase up your sleeve too I have a sled [Laughter] uh producer Ben what are you you look more like a figure skater or some like like a figure skater in between rounds like I don't I don't always want to put the hood on but it's a narwhal it's got like a little horn on top little horns and my wife has a matching costume a narwhal is just uh whale that has a yeah if you're if you're a parent then I get it but like for the people who work really hard at uh this stuff to me I'm just like that just seems like such a wasted time my wife loves it she's this person yeah my wife too she uh like we bought a bunch of costumes whatever I'm Aladdin which is pretty uh you know stereotypical I felt uh you know lean in bro is it racism if it's your wife yeah lean in I say lean into it I got the Cheryl Sandford Sanford book I'm gonna lean in put some [ __ ] man lean into stereotypes um but speaking of Halloween I did a bunch of research about Halloween I wanted to rant about it to you um I'm sure you know a bunch of things about Halloween because I feel like this is like like I'm not gonna say that because this is a rabbit hole that's kind of obvious and I feel like you know I went into this rabbit hole and I saw some footprints on the way out I was like I think that's Sam's size 11 right there I don't know what's going on but let me tell you some things I found okay so uh first and foremost Halloween okay what what the heck is this so this was a uh it's kind of crazy that today Halloween is this like family neighborhood thing where everybody you know young kids are going out and getting candy uh older kids are dressing up you know with an excuse to dress up like kind of [ __ ] and like you know this is like you know this is this giant giant occasion where people are spending 10 billion dollars a year now on Halloween is what gets spent which is kind of crazy that's more than almost any other holiday except for Christmas which is off the charts at almost a trillion dollars gets spent on Christmas and so um so I was like what the heck is this holiday who made this up where'd this come from it's first of all it's like some weird part of like you know the Celtic calendar the Celtic calendar I don't even know what it is but like [Laughter] so so there was like all right there's like this uh you know Festival where they would like they're like oh the demons are coming and so they would like dress up as demons themselves and like go dancing and whatever and that was like to ward off the demons like Hey we're already here and like that was the logic which is pretty pretty weak logic if you ask me and so uh you know then something had the Pope says something he's like oh this is you know November 1st is like the the day of the Saints or whatever baby we in Catholic school we just celebrated every year and so then the 31st became All Hallows Eve and so okay how did it go from that to kids dressing up as Aladdin and going trick-or-treating what was what was the Gap it basically it was like for a while it was this kind of like Lo like um nobody really spent money on this it was sort of like this more like adult dark holiday where you would buy like certain things you'd have people for dinner maybe things like that and then over time it got commercialized and what I was trying to figure out where did it get commercialized how did we go from this like obscure pagan holiday to this mainstream 10 billion dollars a year thing and the best explanation I could find was that there was like kind of a society thing which was like people wanted a holiday it was a good excuse to celebrate they liked that it was commun they could make a community and family oriented over time rather than uh like this kind of adult um thing and then the last thing was that retailers so like the biggest winner from all of Halloween is Walmart Walmart makes a killing on Halloween it sells candy it sells costumes it sells decorations and it sells it to like everybody Across America and so what happened was retailers would have this giant spike in like kind of spring maybe a little bit of Summer and then there was this dead time until the holiday the winter holidays and so they were like okay sales always dip let's figure out what we can do to make sales not dip during that time so they kind of needed to like invent an occasion for you to spend on and so this started which is pretty common right like if you think about like you know like bit there's like the the Hallmark Lobby man they've like really been pushing Valentine's Day on us for years I mean I think that's like a that's like a pretty common tactic I imagine Amazon is thinking like Prime day is going to be a holiday of like just random deals and it's not like a coordinated attack but it is like a bunch of people who all have an incentive so they had an incentive to do um just to sell more stuff and put something in the store that's gonna drive people to come by and so I just want to break down a couple of the numbers in a couple other businesses so like I said about 10 billion in spending uh 3 billion of that is costumes 700 million of that is pet costumes which is kind of crazy um there's basically like you know three million on 3 billion on candy and there's like a huge amount like I don't know like basically almost half the country is going to like give out candy during during Halloween which is kind of an insane level of adoption that's going on so Walmart's the biggest winner they they not only make a bunch of money they spend a bunch of money advertising during this period they'll spend like tens of millions of dollars in the week of Halloween just like blasting ads and so do all the companies that are stocked inside their Skittles Cheetos lunchable everybody's got like a Halloween themed thing and so a couple of the interesting finds I had when I was doing this so the first is a lot of people know about Spirit the spirit store right and people have heard about this but like the backstory of spirits were kind of cool have you ever heard the backstory of how it got started it's owned by a popular company what's who's it owned by oh your favorite dude it's your your Thursday night date night Spencers Spencers that's what I thought yeah like Spencer is like uh you know like a Hot Topic alternative Spencer's also owns Spirit Halloween yeah so they so the way this started was it's like in California in the 80s this guy owned a woman's clothing store and he was in October again traditionally a super slow sales month and so he's just sitting there not really getting much sales he looks around everybody's struggling except for one store he sees that this one Halloween um store has a line out the door and so he's like well I'm not selling [ __ ] anyways and so he just turned like three-fourths of a store into a Halloween store just for the month of October and so it's his women's Boutique so there's like women's clothes in like a quarter of the store and then three-fourths became Halloween stuff and it it really works and so he just does that again the next year he's like oh that's my Halloween Playbook but now he's like all right just forget my store I'll just open up another store and another store just for the month and so um that's their model these guys basically what they do is they go find vacant property so you know an empty box and they say hey landlord you don't have a lease well I'll lease it for two months how about that and the landlords initially were like well no like what about a two-month lease like no thank you they're like okay well look here's my offer if you don't have a tenant by July might as well take it some revenue is better than no revenue and like especially after the 2008 real estate crash this became like a pretty enticing option for landlords to try to recoup some money and so they do these two month leases and uh it's a pop-up Halloween store same place every time no different places they even have a kickout clause so they say hey look you could take how could I get more real estate look if you find if you do find a good tenant who you want to do a long-term lease you can just kick us out like like any time you could just kick us out basically and so they found this like no-brainer proposition to landlords and so they do these pop-ups they now have 1400 stores so like Fast rewind back to um you know like 2010 they only had you know 700 stores and the whole Halloween spend is on the same Trend so like I said 10 billion this year Well rewind to 2010 that's when I graduated from college it was 5 billion rewind to 2005 it was only like 3 billion and so that's like kind of a big like just during our you know lifetime our adult lifetime this thing is like you know more than doubled in in size and so um I don't imagine that by the way all that work for a week like I I know a guy who owns a Christmas tree light show business that I can't reveal how big it is but whatever number you're thinking of how much Remnant does triple times it bite times no times it by 20. we're talking like nine figures and Christmas tree light show means what you pay twenty dollars and you and your family drive through a park and you look at light shows and basically he's going to staff of I don't even know how many steps he is I think over a hundred they work all year round for four weeks of work can you imagine what your company's like like what happens if there's like a terrorist attack or uh you know like whatever or or a covid I mean something happens we're just like all 50 weeks worth of work is ruined for those two weeks do you know what I mean yeah that is the risk that is the risk with these like right now like it's Halloween right today there the whole company is working on next year's Halloween real estate how they're going to do the logistics to like because they just get an empty shell they gotta pop up the whole store get all the inventory there do all the decorations there and then run the staff the store just for this like you know real Blitz and 90 of the traffic comes in the two weeks before Halloween because their main proposition is just like for people who were you know who procrastinated it's like hey it's too late even now to order online so you know just come into the store and just get what you can get and uh it's that big of a business they do like a billion dollars a year in Revenue um the spirit store so that's just kind of crazy for billion dollars and basically like probably a three week time period for for the majority of that um of that spend eight percent of all candy sales of the Year happen like on Halloween it's really crazy that's wild and so what a wild stat here's some other interesting little businesses that were around this okay so have you ever heard of rubies no what is rubies rubies is probably the biggest I think costume maker I don't know if they're still the biggest that they were at a point in time so here's the kind of interesting story for rubies uh started in New York and they're like oh we're doing decorations and costumes for Halloween Halloween wasn't as big of a deal it's like in the 70s they were doing this and um at the time Halloween costumes were all the same it was all just ghosts and witches but then in the 70s and 80s it transitioned into basically like Hollywood and it was like oh movie characters and like TV characters what became like the big thing and so and Ruby's kind of fell behind because there were these other companies uh Collegeville and Ben Cooper that like got all the licenses so they were winning they were crushing it and poor rubies was just sort of like puttering along until that fateful thing happened I didn't even know about this but there was something called the cyanide killer you ever hear about this there was this big Scandal where I guess in Tylenol packages yeah we got laced with Cyanide and people and they never caught they never caught the person never caught the guy and it scared a bunch of people like holy [ __ ] Tylenol like this like safe thing how many people died like three or four I'm not sure I think it was more than that uh but it was a big story that definitely was big news and so people so candy sales plummet um you know like people start getting pretty afraid and so these companies got a little over their skis because everything was going so great and they start to falter during this uh sort of like this crash when people started to the Halloween sales crash because people did not want to go eat candy from strangers during the sort of like cyanide uh you know rush I guess and so rubies ends up buying up Ben Cooper and Collegeville and basically consolidates all the licenses Under One Roof during that time and so now they have Disney Marvel whoever they are like and they their job is basically there's like a you would think this is like I don't know a bunch of theater Geeks that run this company but in actuality like their big thing they have to do right is uh is like you know operations for the supply chain like cash management no no forecasting they gotta predict who is going to be popular next year for Halloween so they're like okay Donald Trump is a trump mask is going to be here or here or here and um and then they work with all the studios the studios give them like a little like sketch sheet of like hey here's the movies coming out next year and the year after and here's who's the good guy here's the bad guy and here's what the costumes look like and like you know you're under extreme lock and key but like you know we make a lot of money we make the movie industry makes hundreds of millions off of Halloween costume royalties they get like an eight to ten percent royalty and so they're like all right fine you can get access to these designs in order to start prepping for dude I Wonder Costumes I wonder what their research methodology is you know we've talked about that company wgsn it always interests me it's a 100 million dollar a year business that does like 30 million in profit yeah and all they do is they help I mean they all they do is simple but it is like a pretty amazing thing but they like help they help predict which color is going to be popular so Starbucks make sure that other labels on [ __ ] is like the right colored pink or like apparently they predicted that pineapples were going to be popular did you know that pineapple was a popular thing this year yeah yeah I'm all about it and they like somehow knew that and they're saying next year it's going to be the lemon which I don't I don't know is that really what they said are you just making that one up I think it yes I think it was the lemon uh like next year lemons are gonna be like a new thing instead of pineapple which I don't even know how you would draw a lemon on like an iPhone case I mean it just looks like in the Sun but anyway they said that like such a wonderful problem your brain just went to well like have yours you know like pineapples on iPhone cases it's like how do you make like a round like yellow thing there's like no density to it like I don't know we can Workshop that afterwards so uh so so so I think you know these guys probably you know you know like that Meme like the hello hello fellow kids or whatever little children like the guy shows up at the high school he's like 40 years old he got a skateboard on his back and he's like yeah okay it's like what is the good you know what's the good Buzz this year and like you know they're trying to figure out like what's gonna be hot um yeah I don't know I don't know the research method but I am I am intrigued but basically they got to be fortune tellers they got to figure out through movies politics all that stuff is it Pokemon is it Wonder Woman is it Trump is it what what is it gonna be the costumes and so so that's one interesting one um a couple other you know pretty interesting um pretty interesting things I'll give you some like I'll give you some like smaller Niche like side hustle things so um so first uh haunted houses so haunted houses apparently do 300 million dollars a year which kind of it's crazy it's kind of a big number for something that's like useful you know like dude I hate haunted houses six days a year what do you go uh I've been I'm not like I'm not a big like thrill seeker like roller coaster haunted house kind of guy I'm not like afraid I don't pay money to be scared that's my that's my rule of movies and haunted houses I I pay money to do the opposite yeah it's like you know those guys who pay girls to like you know slap them and stuff it's like no thanks you know uh pretty sure I'm pretty sure I should be getting paid if I'm getting scared or slapped that's my rule and I'm sticking to it um so so there's like you know haunted house is kind of interesting there's a guy who um somebody tweeted this at me they're like yo this local one near our place and I did the math um so this place is like small like so what they're doing is uh they basically take like a vacant property same thing as the spirit store they take a vacant property they say hey we'll cut you a check for 10 15 grand if we can use your house right or they'll they'll they'll rent a property or they'll find a vacant property and they basically just use it for the month they have this operational thing where they can just spin up the haunted house and then they charge like 40 bucks you know to enter and you can sort of do the math and realize man they're probably making half a million to a million dollars in about a about a month just off these things and they have like it's pretty crazy how like you know as a little side hustle you could do a haunted house let me give you some other ones that I think are kind of interesting there's a guy who created this website called zombie pumpkins you ever seen this no so I think it's zombiepumpkins.com so two million people a year go to this site just to print out a stencil that they can use to carve their pumpkin so he was like you know what uh if you go try to do pumpkin carving it's gonna be a pretty generic face I'm gonna make like super accurately drawn things so you could have like a really dope looking pumpkin like you can have like this is a really cool site really like you know Michael Jackson looking pumpkin it'll look like it if you just follow my stencil and so uh you know two million people go to this thing it gets like a million of those hits you know like in the last week of October or something and uh you know he donates a bunch of the money that that comes from this to uh to charity which I thought was pretty cool and he charges money so you pay money and you get stencils yep and every year he releases new ones uh okay here's another one pumpkin Steins so how would you like a pumpkin that instead of carving a pumpkin it looks like something what if the pumpkin just grew and only looked like like a Frankenstein hit that's what this guy did so this guy's got a crazy story he's like a I don't know he's like some farmer somewhere and he spent four years trying to solve this problem he's like what if I could just grow a pumpkin that was already a decoration so you don't have to do any work so he tried like this uh pumpkin Stein like Frankenstein yeah he tries to grow it doesn't work doesn't work doesn't work finally the fourth year he's like what if I tried this like I don't know type of seed or whatever it was and he got it to grow into this mold and the mold basically just looks like a Frankenstein head and so he started selling them and he does like you know a few hundred sales and he does a few thousand sales retailers start coming to him he opts to go with Sam's Club because he's like you know what like he was selling these for a hundred dollars a pumpkin he's like you know what Sam's Club we could sell for 30 and make money doing that with at their volume and these are amazing these are amazing and so he goes and he's like all right uh he's like this can be kind of a thing he said he got 90 000 orders last year so like that's like four or five million dollars in sales of these uh pumpkins he started going to other farms and bribing them being like hey I'll pay you 11 ahead follow this blueprint I need more production I cannot possibly keep up with the production at my rate and so he goes and he gives other Farms like eleven dollars per pumpkin that they can produce that can be sold this way and then they had they had like a malfunction and like the face still looked right but the back got all screwed up and it like looks like it like exploded and then that was way more popular people are like oh that's cool it like exploded in the back and he's like oh [ __ ] now I gotta figure out how to do this intentionally it's like this crazy little like you know like accidental you know side Hobby wow these are cool um another one Home Depot have you heard about the 12-foot skeleton no so this is like one of these like viral I think maybe from Tick Tock I don't know where but like my wife has been talking about this she's like oh I really want to get the 12 foot thing it's always sold out and I was like it can't be that I mean like let's just go to Home Depot and get it like have you seen Home Depot it's just like full of [ __ ] like this is the way they're just like out on every Home Depot she's like you don't understand and she shows me there's like Buy and Sell Groups on Facebook where people are buying these things for a thousand dollars plus like they retailed for like 300 or something like that and ebays they're selling for a thousand dollars and it became such a hit Home Depot figured out this giant lawn uh skeleton uh was like the big hit then lows came out this year and Lowe's was like the 12-foot mummy and I was like wow you know who's gonna come up with the 12 foot one inch you know um you know ghost next year it's like this crazy little Trend but there's all these things so all these things that really weren't categories before are becoming categories like the inflatable lawn you know decorations are just like surging in popularity different types of candy different types of costumes like it's all sort of surging in popularity because people are just more and more willing to spend I got thinking I was like why is Halloween so awesome I love Halloween um you know you don't have the spirit you're sort of the um the Grinch of Halloween as as you're known um and I realized Halloween is the anti-holiday it's not the cookie cutter warm and fuzzy it's dark it's kind of more adult it's more creative it's one of the few creative holidays and um social media is the Boom for Halloween because social media what is social media it's a hey look at me and Halloween is the perfect hey look at me moment it's hey look at my house hey look at my costume hey look at my body hey look at my candy hey look at my kids I look at everything right so it's the hey look at me thing and also it's an excuse to act like a kid and I'm bullish on anything that gives people an excuse to act like a kid uh I think that's why Burning Man is popular I think that's why Halloween is popular and um you know even things like the ice cream Museum and stuff like that I think is is you know really popular for that reason dude it feels like you just prepared a debate on why Halloween's great and why I should dig it and you have totally won me over so you're saying there's a chance yeah like you just put together this big speech on why Halloween is cool and I'm into it I think it's awesome this 12-foot Skeleton thing is awesome this pumpkin Stein uh is awesome I'm all about it this is awesome so let me tell you more ideas or um or a little little niche so I'll tell you a couple niches and a couple ideas Niche thing we had a guy come rig up lights to our house this week because he did every single house in our neighborhood and we just moved into this place and then our neighbor was like oh yeah you want lights you got to hit the lights guy he's booked but like if he can try to squeeze you and you'll have lights for this season everybody dude you're just getting sucked in all the Suburban traps by the way for the listener I went to Sean's house uh the other day for dinner and I walked in and I'm like oh that's a really cool uh kids shopping cart like he's got like a play like checkout aisle and I was like oh wow that cart says Target on it and he goes yeah uh or maybe it was your wife but if one of you guys were like yeah this has been one of the most in-demand toys we had to like find this cart on eBay for however we flipped one and we bought the other yeah you're like we had to get this car like the kids wanted this car which they didn't but you guys did I think probably the moms won this card yeah the moms it was like we wanted this Target toy cart and I just thought you know that's kind of interesting now I'm hearing this you are totally becoming a Suburban Dad this is awesome I'm I like this side of you sir you know I have a fanny pack you know it was equipped for this life so this guy comes up comes over and he's like I'm like how much for the lights and he's like I'll do it and I'll do it this day this morning you get like a one hour window and um it's like 600 to put up lights uh you know like 200 bucks for the lights themselves they last you for 10 years and then um it'll be like 60 bucks to take them down in January and I was like all right I guess like I'm not gonna [ __ ] climb up there so yeah go ahead like you know either We're not gonna have lights or like we're gonna get in the spirit of things and this guy just cleaned up around the neighborhood it took him an hour but why would he do it this way he should do it where I'll come and pick them up on uh like right after Thanksgiving and hey by the way while I'm here do you want Christmas lights well these were Christmas lights actually it's like they start the Christmas stuff now and then I hear you okay I thought it's Halloween lights whichever whatever that is yeah I don't even know but he should start being like you want Halloween and I'll do a bulb change in like November he should be upselling he was too honest of a guy in general because like he was like 60 bucks to take him down I was like bro once you put the lights up you could charge me six thousand dollars to take them down what am I gonna do like you know like where's the gouging you shouldn't have even told me that price until like gen one you should have called me like hey dude you need those down uh it's actually illegal to have those up here right now you look like a redneck you gotta take those things down we were pretty redneck when I was young and we'd leave them up all year round and we'd call them party lights yeah well they're called February lights now they're March lights [Music] um so this guy I'm pretty sure this guy made like twenty thousand dollars this month in my one neighborhood with like essentially zero cost um all he had to do was know how to string up lights and um you know that's a skill that I think can be learned and so like you know there is a like neighborhood side hustle here that I think is like a 10 to 20 000 side also like there's you know probably like 100 houses in this area flyer them and then um go start putting up lights and just say hey knock on the door yeah we just put up their lights would you guys want lights this year like I think that's a that's kind of an easy win um okay let me give you now some ideas so you don't like haunted houses uh I'm fine with a haunted house but man the effort to get out there is probably gonna be cold gotta get the kids ready gotta go in the car you know all that stuff why isn't there a haunted house I could just do from the seat of my chair at home that's right VR haunted house if you ever put on a VR headset there's one thing VR is kind of amazing at VR is kind of amazing at this like immersive experience where you can like look at you look right and you could just get scared like if you've ever done the demo where you're rock climbing and they're like look down or you look down it's legit scary and then they'll make your character like start to slip yeah you get that feeling in your stomach and so VR haunted house no brainer I don't know if there is one or not but like you know these there are I think a hundred VR apps that do over a million dollars a year I feel like the VR Halloween app the VR Haunted House app you know you could sell this thing for 20 bucks a pop and probably make you know I don't know a couple hundred thousand if not a million dollars in in a year just with the amount of sales that go on in VR um it's nobody and they'll feature you right because you're cool content for that month so you'll get like free promotion basically through the Oculus store that's an eight I dig it all right cool um okay my next one is gonna be spirit store for Christmas am I dumb is there no spirit store for Christmas I don't know but I do know that my wife is like your wife where like this weekend we are walking around and she's like anything that had a pumpkin flavored candle she was walking in and like she bought like a caramel apple she's like I gotta get a caramel apple today like we have to have one today yeah what is that [ __ ] Pavlov been doing to our wives man like there is something with this certain scent in certain color that like you know I must have I must have it's like uh in my life I just learned this weekend have you ever heard of nesting do you know what that is yes I didn't know what that was so I just thought it was like dude by the way it's it's so like for the single guys listening uh I guess for 98 of our audience yeah to all the neck beards out there for all the people listening to this on a Peloton in your one bedroom San Francisco apartment but basically when a woman I guess is like I don't know when it happens but like I think later in the pregnancy by the pregnancy she starts to Nest I guess that means like you start like preparing for the baby you want to like clean constantly basically you want to have an environment where the baby can come to and be safe until you want to clean you want to organize you want to make sure that there's no corners that's so that's a real thing well I I definitely experienced it like we were like what's going on that other people who had already acted like oh nesting yeah baby's coming soon you know you could sort of feel this it's like is your wife suddenly cleaning organizing all of a sudden the to-do list just gets like knocked out because it's like oh there's like burst of clarity and energy and like urgency around preparing the home for a certain thing that's crazy so you know it's interesting like we we we think that we are like these civilized like creatures different from an animal but then like there's these these situations that happen for example if you're a man of someone like disrespects you publicly you start feeling this like what is this rage I feel inside of me like I want to go do I want to go fight right now or like or like with a woman it's like the nesting thing like there's all these like things and having a kid is like a really good example of when like these weird things just start happening that like I I thought I was different I thought I wasn't just one of those animals but it turns out I'm just a beast like you know the rest of the the animal kingdom and nesting is one of them and maybe there's something about Halloween where just Sarah just has to drink or eat pumpkin flavored [ __ ] just constantly well and it's just and like it's the same way with Christmas she's like oh we gotta go get the cinnamon thing yep I'm like we don't need it but she's like no no it's a hot thing that I'm gonna hold with both of my hands near my nose like a small koala and it's like what is this what is this position of that all women assume during during the winter so the spirit CEO even said this he goes fall the Turning of the leaves the pumpkin spice latte and the spirit store we have become a symbol of the changing of Seasons people now wait for our store to pop up that's how they Mark time the passage of time in their lives so anyways I thought you know I thought why is it there a spirit for Christmas what what does Spirit do well decorations desserts and bag gone good gift ideas that's the three d's of spirit you are superb and I'm gonna start calling you dead [Laughter] guy I needed another dude the dag gone good gift ideas so Christmas triple D baby yeah triple D has decorations it has specific dessert eggnog candy canes all this stuff and you need gift ideas you need to go try out toys and things like that and so you know Hallmark tries to capture this I think they're doing it wrong I think Spirit needs to get in the spirit of things Spirit needs to pop up for Halloween stick around for Thanksgiving and that Christmas push and then wind things down right after Valentine's Day that's the spirit you need to get you need to get on this this six to eight month program I'm sure you've thought of this and you have a good reason why you don't but I I like to play pretensely you know like I think that's something that you and I or whoever listening don't think about enough is when you're thinking about a company to build you really do you think this would be awesome to run and being CEO of the holiday company would be awesome yeah I mean that would just be like a fun thing are you changing the world nah are you having a blast for sure you're in the season as we say at the Holiday company yeah that's this is it's the holidays what a beautiful word yeah which is completely underused yeah I love the tears uh yeah so I'm about this we're on to something so um okay a couple other uh interesting things so this pet costume thing I think is like a real Trend um you know we've seen pet vitamin companies like zestypaw sell for 600 million dollars we've seen pet ever you know pets is like a huge Niche and so if 700 million is spent a year on pet costumes I feel like you could just kind of like I mean I I can't tell you off top of my head who is the the go-to for Pep you know for for pet costumes and so that tells me you know there's more than enough room on the e-commerce side for it um you know the story behind halloweenclassrooms.com is also crazy it's all the same thing it's basically like somebody stumbled into this idea and then couldn't even keep up a demand as Halloween grew and now it's effing huge all right so that's my that's my Halloween rant that's mine that was a good one uh you know breakdown and backstory um let's see did I miss anything dude so I want to talk about a few things well we go to this one topic really quick it's I think it's only okay so I don't want to spend that much time on it but then I want to hear your silly story the Twitter thing and the Warren Buffett thing I think these are all those are all awesome but this is just one thing to put on your radar have you heard of this company called humane Humane is this the um like phone on your chest yes so basically this is just it's it's better for the shitty pitch you made I I don't actually know what it is and I don't think anyone knows what it is but basically I saw this YouTube video talking about it's the first time I've ever heard about it which is interesting because they've raised 130 million dollars from like some of the best VCS out there and the people who start it is it's this husband and wife company I think they spent like one of the the husband spent 20 years at iPhone or at Apple building the iPhone I think he was like one of like a six or ten person team to like the original team to come up with the iPhone his wife was also a director of engineering I think of of apple or something like pretty impressive like that and they've recruited like a hundred plus employees most all are from Apple like 60 or 70 of them are from Apple and they're like apple Ballers they're not just like the average just like entry-level person and so it's kind of an interesting signal and they filed for all these patents one is like a wearable multimedia device and cloud computing platform with laser projecting projections another one's like a portable yeah I mean that could that could go anyway you know what I mean like we're gonna another one's like a portable battery pack I mean like they've done all these amazing things they don't even have a website like you can't you can't really learn anything about it you go to the website first of all if you go to the website you got to commit three typos to get there it's Q dot ma like any Humane but split up with three two different periods and then you get there and it's a picture of like the sun and it just says like I forgot where it said like change everything yeah so I have a I have a strong take on that but let me finish this which is basically their whole point is that they view phones as a divider between us and the world and they want your phone or whatever it is going to replace a phone to be an extension of our bodies which that's like pretty vague I don't know what the hell that means but I guess it means like they want to build a new iPhone but it's not going to be a handheld device it's going to be like clothes that you wear or lenses in your eyes I'm not exactly sure but two tanks one I completely agree and I think that as an industry we're like way and we're we're too early to say that there's something actionable right now but I do think in like 10 20 years we're going to be anti-phone we're going to be like like what the [ __ ] you're looking at this [ __ ] this is like cancer why are you doing this why are you what you're smoking what are you doing smoking it's kind of like we look at smoking number two I think unfortunately I don't know you guys Bethany and Imran I think those are the two Founders I'm sure you're wonderful people but I think any company that raises that much money and has a site that says change everything and has raised 120 million dollars and has never shown anything I think they always fail nine out of ten times I think that they're gonna fail because of their hubris and it's like what the hell are we making what's one that didn't fail is there an example like quibby was the most recent one that was like this and uh quibby failed magic leap before that magically failing in progress um what were the other ones like Lucero that one failed I mean the only one I could think of is jet.com and uh but one would argue that that didn't succeed one would say it didn't fail but like they probably sold slightly above the valuation in which that they raised that yeah like I don't know if the underlying business was healthy or not it I I didn't feel like jet.com became this main yeah big consumer thing that was going on but like you know who knows the world is really big maybe there were a ton of loyaljet.com users who were you know using it all the time and the business was working but it did seem like it was the the team the story the technology that got acquired by Walmart in order to make Walmart's online thing better but nonetheless still a definite win Mark Laurie friend of the Pod love the guy uh you know owns a [ __ ] NBA team so like it worked you know in terms of creation owns a place in my heart more importantly but like you know how many of these dream big raised big hype big build instilled for multiple years and then like launch with the world changing device um or world changing product [Laughter] if I had a nickel every time it happened I mean I would maybe have a dime yeah you know it did happen a lot like you're opening game Minesweeper it looks like that um you know okay so so here's a couple things um number one we did talk about this before because when they came out the patent I think got leaked and it looked like at that time the device was some kind of clip-on sort of like camera that you basically would wear on your your chest um sort of like a GoPro but for everybody I don't know if this is still the product or not but I remember that was the the idea um and it was like oh that's cool you'd kind of have this like hands-free you know camera audio device that sort of thing oh yes I do remember that and so that was kind of interesting but that that would only be to capture it wouldn't be to um he couldn't like look at that and read something or watch video or anything like that so it wouldn't totally replace the phone but I'll say a couple things I think they're solving the right problem which is the phone is not the last that's not the Last Frontier there's certainly going to be some kind of wearable device after this is it a watch is it glasses is it uh something like this is it a drone that's floating above your head all the time I don't know but like most likely it's going to be glasses um you know that seems to be where everybody's going and so like we'll see but definitely will happen and definitely will change the world when whoever does get that form factor right so it is inevitable in my opinion the next thing the phone really is causing like you know a lot of damage and problems in terms of how Society like you know with the extreme strength that came from this device that helps us never get lost never be bored never never be alone all that good stuff you know I remember going to a doctor and he was like he did a scan he's like oh yeah you have a little you know slight thing up here C4 C5 whatever like your your vertebrae he's like uh I was like oh [ __ ] like what did I you know did I what did I looking down he's like oh no everybody has this now it's from looking at the phone he's like it's like the most chronic problem in the in the country right now is people's vertebrae are like you know messed up because their neck is always craned down and I was like oh damn man I gotta really start raising my phone higher when I'm looking I gotta really get like a selfie stick or something and he sells them yeah [Laughter] okay so I think they're solving the right problem I also think that the TR like people think the the common thing people would say and this is kind of the White Knight thing that I hate which is I don't want to have more technology I don't I don't want to have you know classes that have my phone on them and my eyes all day like shoot me now I'm like all right I will shoot you now you're in your compression I'm gonna kill you your impression of uh of a white knight you're basically like a white Californian guy I think you put a little more like lowerness in your voice and I think you've got the the best white guy impression I've ever heard of yeah social media all I can say is they need a Raul in their life so we'll talk about in a second but um but dude so so I think that there's this idea of like oh you know social media is too crazy I want to detox I want to uh I'm not going to uh I don't want more technology oh my God I don't want to live in a world like that guess what it's coming and you're gonna love it you're gonna do it and like yes it will have some negatives associated with it like anything but like it is going to happen what one thing that's gonna happen with it is this uh Zuckerberg has this law he he said I don't know if you remember this back he coined this term Zuckerberg's law did you ever hear what this was no he tried to get away from he said it one time in an interview never said it again because it was like sounded bad but like it stuck with me which was because every year people are basically willing to share up to twice as much as they were willing to share the year before so in terms of like you know we weren't sharing our status updates about what we were doing all the time but then like you know what Twitter comes out and now people are just you know sharing every random thought on their mind we weren't sharing our location before but then Foursquare and others came out now we started sharing location uh photos we were only sharing you know we weren't sharing online then we shared albums then we shared a single photo and then with Snapchat we'll just share like you know tons of photos because they all disappear so like basically as long as a product can unlock there is like pent up demand to share twice as much as you're currently sharing and I feel this all the time there are so many moments in the day that I wish I had captured my kids did something cute or somebody you know my trainer said something awesome to me in a workout and I'm not I don't have my hands on the keyboard at that moment to capture that video that note or that that image and so I think that there is a big pent-up demand to be able to share way more moments or capture way more moments and share some portion of those than is happening today and that will happen with either glasses uh you know like maybe a drone camera or like a this wearable thing on your chest so I think those things are all working for it the thing that's working against it is once you get this cute ass domain and you raise like 100 million dollars and you go into stealth and you hire a hundred people and you're basically like we're gonna change the world um you're basically saying I'm going to you know like follow this path you know I'm gonna walk off this Cliff like the many before me that many companies before me that have done this like hey magically if I could see you down there right like you know that is the the challenge with some of this stuff yeah I don't think it's gonna work but I think it's a cool cool move I'm glad they're doing it yeah it's like what do you say face tattoos yeah it's like hey like what do you say to his wife and they're like hey you want to feel what it's you want to feel what it feels like to spend 130 billion dollars like you know what I mean they're just like like you feel like spending money like you know they just like are coming over the way just to blow this cash but um pick one more of these things for the last few minutes Suli or Warren Buffett they both are incredibly interesting uh let's do this what we want all right so he tells the story he goes you know when I sold my company tiny uh tiny Co was the name of his his company was a mobile gaming company he says there was two parts there was our original games that we had been making like Tiny Monsters Tiny Zoo stuff like that and our license game like we made the Family Guy game the Harry Potter game Marvel game and we got acquired uh in the choir the guy the people who bought us they really wanted the like the licensed famous IP games and so after the acquisition we decided to sell the first one and there was a bunch of potential acquirers and they you know one of them you know one offered us 500k for it I thought it was a good offer but we could get more so I created a new bidder I hit up a former engineer from time to go and I told him to bid I said you're gonna need to offer like a million dollars like two times the current offer to get the deal because you're just like some random guy and he did and it was a lot more than James City imagine it was more than the market price and as such he won the bit and I was like congrats all right you had a million dollars right it was only a million million dollars I was like congrats you got it okay now here's the deal you we've underinvested in these games you should you know just you got to work like 60 hours a week just put some money into ads to grow it add these features that'll help you know retain it better and like you're gonna be able to three or four extra Revenue in the next 12 months and the guy like you know sat there and he's like I got a better idea uh he's like I'm working today at as an engineer at this company uh I'm just gonna quit and then he's like I look he's like I'm just gonna do the absolute minimum to keep this thing like refreshed and working and so he goes instead of doing more work he goes you know what I'm good with this I'm just gonna tap out of the workforce at age 31 and I'm gonna retire I don't need to spend any more money I'm gonna live you know uh like within my means and like this app that I just bought for a million dollars is going to keep giving me cash flow for you know forever I don't need a job anymore um and I'll just always maintain it so it keeps bringing me that cash flow and in the meantime I'm gonna work on my hobby projects and other software things that just scratch my itch and he goes and he goes then you know just like the world started working in his favor on on top of that he goes you know like epic and apple gone into a lawsuit Apple had to change their the Rev share deal so they said for for anybody making less than a million in Revenue will give you 30 uh instead of take a 30 cut we'll take a 15 cut so immediately profit went up by 15 for this guy he goes the business has generated more than 3 million in profit since he bought it the purchase price assumed that Revenue would go down over time but it remained steady and actually grew during covid and he goes takeaways the only way to win the rat race is to opt out this is a takeaway that I understand intellectually but I have not accepted emotionally frankly I'm still blown away by my friends Act of saying yeah I have enough and uh he goes number two when I tell you something to buy something buy it and I tell you to work harder on something don't do it and um and then he was like you know you know the self-serving part of this thread was like you know a lot of businesses have these little baby businesses inside that are undervalued like if you have one of these like you know I want to buy one I think these businesses don't have a lot of value in them and so um uh and so uh Yeah so basically and I think by the way he didn't just buy the whole million with a million dollars of cash up front he uh finances yeah right so he put down maybe three 400 000 and finance the rest uh as an example and so would you ever do that would you could you see yourself tapping out yeah I think about that all the time uh you know really yeah not tapping out forever but I feel like uh tapping out in the sense that I really have this urge to work on whatever the most like creative and fun project is which might make zero dollars or negative dollars but don't you do that now in a way like that's why how I started this podcast my plan when I started this podcast was I was like I think I'll probably lose 10 grand a year all in on production um you know paying my editor you know a couple hundred bucks a month and like you know I was like you know booking the studio you know four times a month that's 400 bucks I was like I probably net will lose 10 grand I'll have some sponsors but net will lose 10 grand I was like I'm totally happy to do that uh because I think this Project's gonna be a lot of fun and instead of starting a new business I started this podcast and this podcast turned out to be like my favorite thing I've ever done but the best project I've ever started and actually turned out to be a pretty good business actually on top of that and um I kind of want to do that again so I kind of want to go look at like what's something I would be willing to lose money doing because it's that fun to me or that intriguing to me because I think that that's probably a better signal of like what I really want to do and therefore we'll take an interesting shot at doing something dude I think that like a lot of people dream about retiring um and I've I've a few times in my career I've taken like as much as a month off to a year off sabbatical yeah I used to call it a sambatical and uh I was like I'm on a sandbatical and uh every single time I love it at first and at the end I'm like dude I gotta go do something I can't I can't just do this I like it like your friends can't hang out with you on a Wednesday at you know one o'clock like you're just so bored and you're like I need to go create I need to produce I need to like and then I just realize I am not built and Men or you know all people but I could always be from a man's perspective we are not built to sit idle we are you know created to work I don't think we're actually creating to work 100 hours a week but I think we are created to work like 30 hours a week and like that's the minimum where it's like you just have to produce and you have to contribute otherwise you feel pointless and I think you die sooner I mean human but also I mean like I I only know my I only know like what men are like because I'm a man you know that's what I mean uh so yeah sure all humans I'm sure are like that I just haven't had this conversation with a lot of people uh but I think that when you retire like I've got family and they're like I'm gonna retire I'm like I don't think you should retire I just think you should work a little bit less or do a six month vacation because I think the sooner you retire that's just you're just like you just actually taken off four years on your life do you know what I mean like if you're gonna retire you at least gotta go volunteer like you got to contribute in some capacity you gotta have something that you're living for yeah yeah totally uh my I wouldn't take a sabbatical uh I would I would just pour my energy into a more creative project that like is not the best business use of time like I have a bunch of ideas that I think could make a bunch of money and then I have a bunch of ideas I think would be really fun to do that would probably not make any money it might not even get anybody to use it or like it or maybe it'll turn out crappy but like I'm intrigued to do it and so um that's the temptation all the things I want to do they all cost money so I'm like [ __ ] I need to earn more yeah but you know what I mean like in reality you don't well it's only you know I guess perception's reality who knows perception right easier that you could change reality so it's just change that uh yeah I gotta run um but yeah good episode all right that's a pop [Music] foreign [Music]

[Music] foreign luck and risk are two of the most important words for anybody who wants to be great but they kind of I think for most people feel like it's something that's outside of your control right luck is this magical thing that either happens to you or it doesn't or uh risk is this thing that you either get screwed by or you don't and I don't think that's true I think there's a lot more to risk and luck than most people recognize it's the same way that uh I think Eskimos have like 40 or 50 words for snow right when we see something just falling from the sky that's white and fluffy we just think that's snow whereas they have 40 or 50 different words to describe the different types of snow as you would if you lived in an extremely snowy environment you would develop that vocabulary and so similarly for an entrepreneur who is going in an environment of trying to make great success happen maybe we need some Nuance some differentiation between the different types of luck the different flavors of risk and so that's what I'm gonna tell you today these are the four flavors of luck and the four flavors of risk let's start with luck so so this I got from Mark Andreessen back in the day he had a Blog that he used to keep up it's down now there's an archive of it up online somewhere called PM archive and I still remember reading this post like you know 10 years ago and it was about the four different types of luck I think he originally read it in some book and um the low the levels of luck are as follows level one is called Blind luck you just sit around you get struck by lightning and um you know you didn't do anything you just happened to be you and it's not something you can count on either right so this is blind luck and you know for me I was just born with the use of my my limbs and I was born healthy I was born in the right country and um you know I remember one time my cousin gave me a bunch of raffle tickets that he had bought he gave it gave it to all of our cousins and I ended up winning this dolly painting out of uh out of the raffle I didn't I literally didn't do anything I just sat there he handed me a ticket my ticket happened to win and so um that's an example of blind luck that's level one okay can't do much with that because it's sort of uh it's either gonna happen or it's not the next one you can increase the odds of of luck in your favor by going to level two level two is what the the phrase around fortune favors the bold and it's the same as the the one above it's sort of a lucky chance but you increase the odds of it happening by adding motion or action to the mix so you're doing a bunch of stuff you're running around you know if the first one is you're standing in place and lightning strikes you this one you're running around all over the place kicking up dust stirring up the pot and something happens as a result of your motion your motion increased the surface area you were covering where you might happen to get lucky and so this is a chance encounter uh right maybe you're just out and about and in doing so you bump into somebody who's really interesting and opens up some opportunity for you and um there's a phrase uh there's a quote that I like which is you know I've never heard of someone stumbling onto something good while sitting down and this just emphasizes the importance of Simply taking a bunch of action uh of being out there of of having some motion and um and carrying with you some good vibes so that good things happen in the way so that's level two motion Crea you know fortune favors the Bold level three this is where it starts to get interesting this is Chance favors the prepared mind right so this is where you notice that something lucky has happened where other people may not have noticed and it is your years of preparation of looking at things to even understand this so any investor knows this right you look at a hundred deals it's not because all 100 are gonna be good it's so that when that 101st deal comes that really has killer metrics you're able to recognize that that deal is unique that that price is a fantastic price so these metrics are off the charts because you have a benchmark of what normal looks like this also happens in science I mean there's an amazing story about the the discovery of penicillin right this drug that has saved millions and millions of lives in the course of history well the way it was discovered was um the scientist who was studying he uh just noticed that some mold had fallen on his petri dish and his accident uh right so that was not in his country was not the result of his action but he was he had a prepared mind he noted that around the mold in the petri dish no bacteria was growing they started to wonder maybe there's something about this mold that kills bacteria and he wrote that down he tried to convince others of it and nobody cared no none of his peers cared and then you know 10 years go by before somebody else picks up this paper and says huh that's weird that the sort of the staph bacteria was not growing around this mold the mold seemed to kill staff bacteria what I wonder if we could go back and revisit that and then they tried to try to actually revisit it so they had the prepared mind to read that paper and notice huh there's something interesting there and so that is luck favoring the prepared mind um the last one the level four luck is luck finds you so this is reputational luck you've heard me on this podcast say before that my goal with this podcast is not to become well known all right I'm not trying to be famous I'm trying to be known well meaning I just try to put my brain and my the things I'm most into out there on blast so that people who are like-minded will come find me people who are building you know startups in that space will come find me and I can invest them people who are um you know using a product that they know that I love they'll share it with me right that's the value that I get back out of this because I'm well known my reputation brings me some luck and so uh the example I think Naval gives of this he says imagine you were known as the best deep sea scuba diver in the world right you are amazing at Deep Sea Dives you're just sitting on your couch one day you're not doing anything and the phone rings and somebody calls you and says we've discovered a treasure off the coast of India buried deep down below will you come help us retrieve it and you get to share you know whatever 25 uh of whatever we find so now you your reputation has caused you to find a treasure right luck has found you your reputation of being a great person at doing X will cause people to come find you and so um you know we just did a podcast with Kevin Rose and he talked about this with Twitter he had the prepared mind to notice that Twitter was going to be a big deal and he's very humble like other Investments he says you know I don't know you just I just wrote the check I like the person it turned out well but for Twitter I said did you know it was a it's going to be a big winner and he goes I thought it was the next big thing he goes because I had seen blank blank like I was using it and I noticed man this thing has really given me this feeling imagine I'm just a little Tech celebrity imagine if real celebrities got a hold of this this is going to be crazy and like he noticed that Facebook and all the social networks before this were all based on this idea of a friend where I had to request to follow you and you had to accept it in order for me to see your content and that Twitter this new thing that everybody else was making fun I've had had one new feature which was it was one directional I could just follow you and you didn't have to give me approval and he goes wow that's going to be amazing for celebrities so that was luck you know the prepared mind he then took action he reaches out to Evan he says I'd love to invest oh sorry the round is closed um sorry about that so he's turned away but this is where his reputation allowed him to get lucky a couple weeks later EV calls back and says hey uh you asked about investing right you know we have this engineer who's leaving he wants to sell some of his shares we can you know you could buy his if you want right I'll let you in because it's you because I love I like you I like the way you are I think you have a good eye for product you're really active on Twitter um and I know you really believe in this you've made that well known well here you go here's your opportunity and that 25 000 turns into you know 100 million dollar plus payday that's luck finding you our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better so those are the four levels of luck now let's talk about the four levels of risk the four these are not levels these are more flavors of risk so the first one the first risk or I'll put it differently people think the big risk is you go and do something crazy right I'm gonna go jump out of a plane uh skydiving I'm gonna go invest all my money into crypto right those are obvious risks but because they're obvious risk people don't always take them or they take a lot of precaution with it so um most people don't go skydiving they say that that sounds risky so I'm not gonna do it and even the people who do they go with an instructor who's done thousands of things before and they make sure that the place has good reviews and that is a good track record and they say okay great I'll jump out of this with a parachute with it with a professional so they they do things to mitigate risk so I think you know same thing with crypto oh you're investing in crypto but you're only investing one percent five percent ten percent some smallish percent of your net worth into this risky thing because it was obviously risky so the things that are obviously risky don't actually trip you up it's the things that are not obviously risky so an example of that would be um everybody before you know 2008 generally thought that mortgages and the housing market was a pretty safe industry to bet in uh to invest in and that's why if you ever watch The Big Short you know all these mortgages were highly rated uh debt and in actuality they were much riskier than people realized and that's what caused the global financial crisis was because there was this huge there was this risk that people did not identify as risky they thought it was safe but actually it was risky and they therefore relied too much on it took out too much leverage blah blah and then you get disasters and so that's the first thing to recognize about risk is risk is not just the things you think about so here's some of the Hidden types of risk or different flavors that you should think about the first one is mediocrity because when most people go into a job or a business that they want to start they think that their risk is failure that I'll try this and it's going to totally Crash and Burn and in actuality at least for most people in America that's not that painful of a risk you waste a little bit of time but it failed it you know crashed and burned and you can move on and you learned a lesson and you have a story to tell and you might have met some people along the way you've built some skills and so you actually don't take that much risk doing it and you generally will you know not put too much money into something at that stage so that's one version of failing with us let's say a startup or a job but the other version that I think is much more sneaky and Much More Much plagues many more people is mediocrity which is the risk of having something that's just okay it's not bad enough to obviously fail nor is it good enough to be amazing and so the risk is that you're wasting your most valuable asset your time on something that is not great and so if you listen to this podcast you're the type of person that wants greatness out of your life then the biggest risk to you is mediocrity because failing is fine you'll just try another thing you'll try something else but something that's just all right it's not great but not bad enough to fail is going to deprive you of your most valuable asset your time so mediocrity is the first flavor of risk to identify in what way are you just settling for a bad relationship um or a just okay relationship a just okay job a just okay level of traction at your startup that is one risk the next one safety safety is a risk okay how is safety a risk well there's a risk in not taking enough risk so you got to ask yourself I have a dream I have an ambition I have a goal that I'm trying to get myself to if I keep doing things the way that I'm currently doing them right in my comfort zone where I am safe I'm not taking any risk right now is it going to lead to my dream right am I on path am I on track am I is my trajectory taking me to where I'm trying to go because if not then the safety you have now is actually putting your dream at risk your goal at risk so people usually think am I putting myself currently at risk but what you want to think about is am I putting my dream at risk am I putting my future success at risk by playing it safe now okay so that's the second one playing it too safe the third risk is the Eyes Wide Shut risk that's the one I talked about with the mortgages right it's one thing when you go in Eyes Wide Open you say oh I'm doing this thing but it's risky so therefore I'm not going to bet it all and I'm gonna take some precautions that's eyes wide open but what about Eyes Wide Shut what happens if you uh you think something is safe but it's not you trust the wrong person and you bet it all or you think that housing is safe and so you're super levered up um you think that this is too big to fail but in fact it is not and so um Eyes Wide Shut risk you want to ask yourself what am I assuming is safe that may not actually be safe um the last one is Market risk executional risk versus technical risk these are like the eskimos having 50 words for snow there are many different types of risk in business so Market risk is trying to figure out will does anybody even want this at my start my previous startup you know the studio I worked at Monkey Inferno we were building we had every resource available we had all the money we wanted we had team of Engineers that were super smart freedom to work on whatever we wanted but the boundary was we got to work on something in consumer and it shifted towards social and when we try to build the next social app you're taking on massive amounts of Market risk does anybody want your thing is this going to be the next Twitter the next Snapchat et cetera that was massive Market risk um you know it didn't matter that we had a killer teamwork we could build a killer product um because Market risk means if people don't actually want your well-made app it multiplies it by zero and um so the next thing is then you take friends like um enduring Ventures or Cody Sanchez and people who buy cash flowing businesses that's fantastic they're not taking Market risk the market has already proven that they want that business they want that product it's already cash flowing so they take executional risk they pay a price maybe three four five times um earnings and they're taking executional risk that can I improve the business can I improve through executional efficiencies or or growing you know growing revenue or reducing costs can I improve this business so they take executional risk you know when I buy this owner out is the whole thing gonna fall over or can we continue to execute so they take they don't take Market risk they take execution risk and then you have people who are people who I invest in for my startups that often take technical risks so the example I give of this is a pizza making robot let's say that I'm Domino's pizza and a startup comes to me and says hey we have a robot that will replace that worker you have in the back that's sitting there he's checking his phones picking his nose and he's calling in sick every fourth day and um you know he's the one who's supposed to take the dough put it in the oven put the cheese and sauce on it and put it in the box so here's the deal I have a robot that will put a perfectly circular dough with the perfect thickness that you specify or add the exact amount of cheese never waste waste too much too much extra cheese it'll bake it to the exact amount of time every single time it'll never call in sick it can work 24 7 and um and it'll never complain and ask for a raise okay that's this robot so there's if you could deliver such a product it would be essentially Zero Market risk um because of course dominoes would want to replace more expensive labor that is harder to manage with something that is cheaper and easier to manage of course they would do that so the only question is can you make a robot that actually delivers on that promise reliably right can you actually deliver the promise that's technical risk this is with a lot of Bio biotech pharmaceutical um and like you know you know defense contracts there's things like that where they're taking technical risk can they can they actually make a product that lives up to the spec and so you got to know what type of risk are you taking so those are the four types mediocrity the biggest risk of all safety not taking enough risk Eyes Wide Shut risk that's assuming something is safe when in actuality it's riskier than you think and the last one is knowing whether you're you're attempting to take Market risk execution risk or technical risk and being uh being honest with yourself about what type of risk you're taking when you go into this endeavor the goal is not to avoid risk it's to understand it and then work your way around it all right I think that's it um instead of one question Friday I did framework Friday let me know what you think I'm Sean VP on Twitter that's s-h-a-a-n-v-p on Twitter and so you can find me there let me know what you think about it framework Friday is in the books all right have a good weekend foreign [Music]

and so Nikita said something in the group message which he says I think it'd be an interesting idea to ask myself or to figure out you're making it too soft I remember exactly how he said it it's like oh so what are you doing what are you up to nowadays oh Sam you sold the hustle what are you doing shot on you so what are you doing Nikita you're sitting at Facebook what are you doing and he's basically he just said it straight straight up he goes um I'm just thinking about how I can make 10 million dollars in three months like uh and if we're like what he's like yeah I want to make an app that generates like 10 million dollars in 90 days [Music] foreign what's going on we have a good episode we talk about an app that's going viral but this app role is getting written about a bunch of Publications we actually have the inside story because we kind of saw what was happening behind the scenes early early on and so we talked about this guy named Nikita who launched this app that has made a million dollars in like two weeks or something crazy like that and we tell you the inside story behind it what else we got and he called his shot which you know we love here we also talk about a ransom note that we got through email and why this Ransom note was one of the best emails that we've ever got and me and Sam live brainstorm and live negotiate how we're going to deal with this Ransom note so if you want to see that that's at the end of the episode we also talk about the MailChimp CEO getting canceled and a little debrief of Palmer lucky so that's it enjoy this episode all right we live Sam par what's up nothing how's it going uh you know just the usual woke up decided okay no small boy stuff today got going immediately started considering some small boy stuff and then I remembered there will be absolutely none of that today what was it I woke up I was like I'm a little sore so wake up with a complaint and wake it up with a complaint on one of the greatest days I've ever had wow this is this is not how I'm going to start my day wait why was it one of your greatest days uh just like that's just like a general General attitude I have uh do you want to start off by recapping Palmer lucky because after talking to him I feel like he's kind of the greatest guy I've ever talked kind of the man yeah right is that how you feel I thought he was awesome um okay let me just say a word that describes Paul merloki I would say um like independent-minded I think uh I think I really respected that he is independently minded I felt like all his opinions were his own you know people like they write that [ __ ] in their Twitter bio like opinions are mine not my employer uh you know his opinions are really his uh also when people write contrarian thinker and it's kind of like if if you have to say that you're contrarian thinker you're maybe not like the most contrarian thinker do you know what I mean right it's like the no offense I'm not gonna raise this butt yeah yeah that's exactly what it is so I uh anyway yeah I I thought that he was an independent thinker I also thought that he was incredibly enthusiastic which I liked yeah very enthusiastic dead on the inside like we have we have said no to a bunch of guests just simply because they're like you know their intelligence is like cranked up to level 10 their success is cranked up to level 12 but they're like Charisma and ability to convey any sort of enthusiasm about themselves about the world about their story is so low and um and so they make for a terrible podcast guest but for him it felt not only like did he have Charisma to tell stories about the past he seemed really pumped about what he was doing and what the future looked like and why it mattered and I just felt like this guy you know just like Springs out of bed every day me too that's exactly how I felt I felt like he was incredibly enthusiastic about life and he yes that that's a great way to explain it but he uh dude he was so fascinating he was one of those guys that I like because I don't like I I can't think of a great word to explain say other than like prolific but also almost like this I don't think this is over explaining it or overgrandizing it but like almost like a renaissance man where he would say comments like yeah I bought this Marina because there's going to be new laws about I don't even understand like what he was explaining about his marina but he said like something about his marina and like Seaport access and how it's changing and then he made another comment but he was like he's like I was gonna do this well I mean seastating is is off the table for now and I was just like I don't even really know what seastating is exactly and you were just said it like well we all know she's standing now is not the time what are you talking about what the hell is he saying yeah he also he also and like he'll make another comment he's like yeah I have this house we rented we had like a a workshop and one weekend I was building a jet engine for the water and we actually discovered that like we should make biodegradable or what did he say we should make oil-based Foods it's kind of like building a Diet Coke for every food and I was just like we could take this over lots of different paths but it's just so interesting to me that you have that ability yeah it was like bunch of like candy being waved at us he's just like you know one of the largest samurai sword collections in the world and that just got me into thinking and it's like what uh he didn't say that by the way but there's at least a 50 chance he has one of the top 10 samurai sword collections in the world and 100 the guy owns swords like yeah he definitely owned swords um all right so where do you want to go next you can drive all right so check this out I forwarded you an email did you uh see the email I sent from about about Sarah's list or maybe maybe she sent this to you too what was it so a woman named Kristen uh sends a um an email I'm just going to read it to you we'll show it on the screen you know for those on YouTube because it's it's kind of amazing looking oh my God you open up the email and it says I am holding sarahslist.com hostage and she goes you don't know me but I obviously know you I purchased sarah'slist.com and I've turned it into a bomb ass website I am willing to sell it to you for twenty thousand dollars this is a steal as I purchased it for thirty thousand dollars I'm essentially giving you ten thousand dollars you're welcome if you'd ever if you'd ever like to see salesless.com again and then she turned this font small or for the first time you know reply to this message I'm looking forward to hearing from you Kristen and I was just like this is amazing who are you and um who is who is she yeah so she's um this is this woman Kristen Kent so she sends me her story after that she goes I've been in 12 tech for 12 years um you know uh regrettably I chose companies off Kristen's list which was not as lucrative as if I had chose companies off services so for those who don't know Sarah's list is this concept and we should explain we did a full episode about it basically Sam's wife Sarah is a self-made millionaire and did not do any of the heroic entrepreneurial things you hear about in the media she just did one really good thing she just picked companies whose Equity was going to like whose valuation was going to go up four or five x in a four year period so she worked at Facebook and not early at Facebook not like she was like employee four at Facebook like she was like in the thousands of employees joined us like a middle middle manager type not and again I say this not as disparagement because of how amazing it is so like she didn't do the things that you think you have to do to become like a self-made millionaire uh she joined Airbnb again as employee I don't know something hundred what was it maybe like 300 or 400 no a thousand oh a thousand okay great and Airbnb goes public at evaluation is four five x and so you know if you're receiving a stock grant for let's call it sixty thousand dollars a year uh you know on top of your you get you get some base Concepts I'm just gonna use fake numbers base compensation let's say is 150 and then they give you 50k of stock a year for for over four years that's 200k of stock but now the stock price four or five X's you made a million dollars during that time period um and you were safe you didn't have to like work 90 hour weeks you uh got to work at a fun growing company that was gonna like win this category and you didn't have to have this like amazing lightning in a bottle genius idea in order to do it and so she had done that a few times and so we we said oh this was actually intentional you and Sarah sat down and you guys yeah we like made lists we like made lists like what's like a 500 person company that has good maternity leave you know like these are all like the telltale signs that it's like an interesting startup has uh you're in the you know top quartile of pay just for off salary you have uh interesting benefits good health care like all this stuff that a lot of startups that are early don't have but big companies do yet they can still 5 or 10x so yeah we made that list so we made the list and of the we put 12 companies on that list this was like a year year and a half ago now 12 companies on that list and I think we did the the recap I don't remember the exact numbers but I think the in the year year and a half since then the average company values up like two and a half X or something crazy like that and an 11 out of the 12 companies raised a like significant up round since then so we were like very high hit rate and if you got in whatever your stock value would have been at that time I think on average it's something like two and a half X um could be wrong I don't remember the math uh but and so this lady sets a site by the way and I'm looking at it this is amazing but her email is she so she dm'd me on Twitter and so whenever people DM me on Twitter I either ignore them or I just like click the heart emoji like thank you I recognize you but I don't want to talk and that's what I did with her and I just replied and said I'm an idiot this is you're actually you're different different yeah this is a really good one so okay so then here's what I want to do so you go to the website it's just sarahslist.com it says 12 startups that can make you a millionaire it's got a picture of Richie Rich which is hilarious and then it goes who is Sarah who are we and why do we have any business sharing a list like this and then it tells the story about Sarah about us whatever selection criteria it uses our criteria which is that it's a company that's already valued over 250 million dollars so it has a low risk profile and it's likely not going to go to zero a stable work environment a high salary great benefits but still can make you a millionaire because the equity has potential to 5 to 10x and then it has our list which was like flexport and uniswap and Andrew and replit and airtable and figma like figma got acquired for whatever 20 billion or something like that but more than that uh you know after we uh after we mentioned it on this list when it was that's like a 10x I think from where we mentioned it so anyways uh then it says find a friend a job so you go to the job board and it goes these are placeholder jobs you guys should consider syncing this up to one of these websites but those cost money which is why and the last job post says I'm not doing it And the tagline so the tagline at the bottom says Sarah's list get rich in five to ten years over 50 guaranteed yeah exactly so hilarious so then I started thinking okay so I said let's brainstorm this live here on the podcast should we do this deal and no uh and okay so your opinion is no and give me why no here's why it's just a a website that would take me five minutes or no it would take me oh it's a website that take me three hours to copy and a domain name so for that reason it's not that valuable but what's more valuable is this lady uh Kristen who's making it yeah her email exactly are are beautiful her copies beautiful her I just looked at her Twitter this woman uh Kristen is the exact type of people that I like to be around she also works at xpa which uh Expo is basically a company founded by the founder of uber Garrett I think is it Garrett Camp yeah and they basically are a startup Studio that launches companies I don't actually know any of the companies that they've launched but I imagine a lot of them are really successful but she works there which is also a really good like indicator that she's like onto something uh do I think that we should buy this absolutely not do I think that I want this woman in my life and would love to work with her in some capacity 100 agreed the real value here is not the domain it's not the website it's Kristen Kent okay so here's my here's my proposal to Kristen Kent here's my counteroffer uh my public podcast counter offer to you Kristen I'll give you the twenty thousand dollars I'll give it to you in fact I'll give you the thirty thousand dollars that you paid for this uh this domain if you really paid that much for this domain I mean that's kind of crazy and uh but it comes with this catch we're going to work together on this project you're going to do the work on the on the company side and I'm going to do the work on the promotional side the distribution side and here's what we're going to do with Sarah's list we're going to turn Sarah's list into a half a million dollar a year passive income stream ah passive-ish I should say pass it for me that's a little active for you but Anyway by the way Sean when you say we gotta let's remember this is Sarah's list of which I am 50 of Sarah's list so whatever Sam is is on the side right now Sam said no no no no no no no no a moment ago and he's not a part of the counter offer Sarah herself will get a one percent royalty as we use her name here's what we gotta do what what per what percentage of the of the of the dividends would you give or would you want Kristen to have Kristen deserves 50. she deserves 50 I agree the the other 50 split you and I split and 90 10 you got it sir so the other share the royalty with Sarah so here's what we're gonna do actually I don't know if I even want to say this this deal now that we're having these uh this is this intense negotiation I want to give out my great idea okay I'll give up my great idea so here's the great idea here's how we're going to make this work so normally a job this is like monetized as a job board right it would be a list of companies that we are curating saying these companies are great and let's say we might take it to 24 25 companies um rather than the 12 we have today and normally on a job board you pay like 500 a post um for for job posting so we would need to go reach out to those companies get them to post the other thing uh you know but but hey this is maybe premium it's a curated job board maybe we could charge more maybe a thousand maybe two thousand dollars to be be posting your jobs on here so if we got people to do that you know let's say two thousand dollars a month 24 companies let's say half half of them actually do it you know that's like 24K a month not bad but I think we're going to be in this kind of constant sales Outreach period so let me put out a different idea here's a different idea we're going to take these companies and we're going to host a demo day once a quarter what's that what's gonna happen at the demo day we're gonna basically um each week we're gonna feature one of these companies we're gonna create an email list we're gonna spin off our current email list and we're gonna say we're gonna feature one of these companies we're gonna do Deep dive but why this company is a good company to work for and interested people you know high quality people in Tech might well that needs to be an upsell that needs to be an upsell it's where it's like for 25 25 000 like you get a deep dive as a minority owner I'm not sure you have a say here so I could barely hear your voice it was so faint like your Equity ownership of this um so so if we're in the same room do you think I would have hit you already or or will that be coming in the next will that be coming in the next 10 minutes or would it have already have happened so so you know the way you promoted hustlecon where you used to write these kind of blog posts once a week I think you would you would feature the speaker of hustlecon and you would tell their story in this awesome infographic and then you would say do you like stories like this you should come to hustlecon we're gonna have 25 badass entrepreneurs including this person speaking there and you should attend and you did that for 12 like 25 weeks and you sold out like 500 tickets to this thing so what we're gonna do is we're gonna do that once we weak Cadence about these companies do a little deep dive that's the email and then it's going to get people to attend the the hiring day and hiring day is where the founder of those companies gonna come and they're going to give a little five minute flash presentation on their company and it's going to be a cure and applicants apply to join and these are you got to be good to joins that's why we got to keep the quality high on the company side and the applicant side and then we're not charging for a job posting we take the like the recruiter fee because when a recruiter places a candidate one of these companies they take 20 or 30 000 right away and so if we could place like 25 candidates in a year at twenty thousand dollars a pop you're talking half a million dollars of of Revenue which is basically all we have to do is hire a writer we're gonna hire a Ghost Rider who's just going to write these company deep Dives on the companies that we select have you heard of the daily uh it was called The Daily muse now it's called The Muse the muse.com have you ever heard of that company the muse.com no I don't think so what's that all right it was like a women's hiring thing was that yeah yeah it was it's called the muse.com it's been around now for 10 years and the woman who started I've been actually dming I've been wanted to come on here yeah she went to Duke too oh did Catherine I think her name is yeah uh and so she went to YC and so I actually originally thought they that this was a great idea but they screwed it up by raising a lot of money and I think they've raised 20 30 40 50 tens of millions I don't know the exact number but basically that what they would do is they would do these deep Dives on companies and charge the company some like fairly big fee to do a deep dive on the company and they somehow got tons of traffic now they're still getting eight million people a month coming to their website or six million something like that and they had tons of people coming to their website from search which is incredibly valuable and I thought that they like were just chugging along but like not doing that great because I hadn't heard about them I have a feeling they actually might be killing it because they've raised a lot of money and they actually are starting to buy other companies at this point and they do these deep Dives on companies and another guy who does this is packing McCormick and I have no idea what he charges for this anymore but when the economy was crushing it I think he was charging 25 to 50 000 more per Deep dive I think it was how much do you think it was a little more I remember he was making a hundred thousand a month if I recall correctly off his deep Dives and I think he might have been doing one or two a month wow that's pretty amazing and so I think you could do something like that milk Road by the way we do a deep dive thing and it's like I don't know I forgot what it would cost I think it's like it's like something between 25 and 40K depending on on the total like promotion and who do you hire to do that uh I wrote the first few because like we have one of our writers wrote it and I like kind of like changed it big time but now we are hiring a writer just to do the Deep Dives how much would you pay a writer to do that um a couple Grand a month like two grand a month per deep dive like I'll pay you 2002. one article so this is the value is not in the writing the value is in that we have a huge list and that if we promote something to this huge list you're going to get a bunch of of traction or you're going to get usage or you're going to get candidates or whatever it is so the writer is not bringing the value the writer just needs to deliver value but the the list is what the list size is why you can charge that much yeah it's pretty fascinating I think this is a really interesting business I've always said I mean I'm the one who even turns you on to job boards aren't I so like you know new email [Laughter] and Sarah so and before me you weren't even into.com so like you're welcome so uh I think kudos to Kristen I think she's on to something well I think we're on to something but uh she also it seems pretty special like I said if you want if you want a side hustle that'll make I don't know 250k a year for you uh it's there for the taking uh I think that's understandable all you got to do is all the work yeah but we'll we'll promote it here uh this is an interesting thing uh I don't think this is an event venture-sized business which is I I guess why expert isn't going after it but it maybe could be uh it was a business back in the day that went through YC called developer auction do you remember this no but that sounds a little weird that's not very weird in a great way so basically what they did was they were like no dude that's not a good auctioning humans doesn't exactly have the best branding that's why it was great okay guys a head turner and uh and you know when you're a small company you need to be a head turner and so um so these guys basically they realized they were like wait the power Dynamic is off why is it all about applying to jobs when actually like the developer is like the most valuable like developer was like gold in Silicon Valley and so they said why don't we just curate like the top developers so like who are these 10x engineers and then let's just have them almost like a beauty pageant they walk down the stage and and the companies are like raising their paddle I guess that's not what happened to the beauty pageant but like an auction where the the companies were raising the paddle be like I'll give them 300 000. I'll give them 400 000 I'll do his laundry and then someone's like you know all sucking poop and it's like you know that's basically like the companies were like just falling over themselves trying to get this talent and so they did one and it was amazing it was like you know 50 Engineers or whatever and all the engineers got this huge pay jump from these top companies they're like oh [ __ ] that's awesome and then it built this little flywheel where they're like the next batch of really great developers are like yeah yeah dude you're gonna do all the work for me to like get me my next job offers awesome all I got to do is just go and explain how like yeah I helped scale Netflix's like video infrastructure so that you know we got this latency in this blah blah blah um so they would just go explain what they did and then the companies would bid and it was kind of a great idea I thought they eventually it but the problem is it wasn't going to scale up it was like too almost Boutique and so in order to scale up they changed the model and then ended up pivoting into something else altogether but like if you just kept it Boutique which again you you can't do this if you raise a bunch of venture money because then your expectations to go huge but if you're like if you like making you know a million dollars you know a year of like passive income you could do that with a boutique model like this just by basically creating a demo day but instead of startups pitching investors you have you have companies pitching to top talent and so you could just if you're good at curating right if you're a good curator right we we did a good job creating on the company side now you just got to do a good job creating on the talent side you could actually create a pretty solid side hustle here do you enjoy working with your wife no I uh there are enjoyable things but there are also some very unenjoyable things I but I tell you this on everything if we have to like assemble some like Ikea furniture I'm like I hate doing projects with you and like because like we're both we're both too stubborn we both want our way and I'm like why don't you just listen and she's like why don't you just listen I'm like because I don't want to listen and she's like I uh so I've been I'm I'm coming out I'm gonna do the ideation boot camp again and I um was trying to convince Sarah to like quit her job and like do this and it ain't happening we like did we did a few test trials and we cooked dinner together and yeah it didn't work out like it just like me talking to her like were co-workers just just doesn't work yeah that's exactly the problem I talked to her like I would talk to somebody who's like you know somebody you know on my team at my startup and she's just like why are you speaking to me like this and I'm like well but I'm not in husband mode right now I mean like yeah yeah it modes his modes yeah it's just like I would be like look you're not stupid but this is stupid and she'd be like why are you talking to me like this I'm like what do you mean I'm I'm trying to encourage you and like don't you want to like climb up this organization's ladder like don't you want to be great and Achieve great things and she's like just wants to punch me in the stomach back the wind out of me I'm like yeah I don't know if this is gonna work yeah I wanted this to work but I don't think this can happen so I I I don't know how the couples do it but uh it wasn't working for us there were many great examples like uh the founders of Eventbrite were that's a husband and wife couple uh the founders of bibo back in the days Yoshi and Michael burst their husband wife couple they were together just great and uh yeah but I think it needs like that complimentary personalities where one and also like I don't have the best bedside manner you know it was a shocker like you know pretty direct and pretty blunt about stuff um and I you know I don't have that thing that some people have going for them I think you have this where you could just be hella blunt and it's like it's a Sam being Sam like uh you know you know he's got it he gets to play by his own rules because that's just the way he is I have uh like I have too much finesse in my game like if you have if you have no finesse people are like he's got no finesse it's fine like he's just being blunt don't take it seriously but if you have any then it's like oh he could have said that differently but he chose to say it the wrong way and you don't get the you don't get that like that you know that pass to just like you know say things you know the wrong way earlier in the episode we said you would describe uh Palmer Lucky in one word and you I think you know we both said different things if I had to describe the this last 60 Minute episode in one word I would say exhausting this was an exhausting I I feel like I just went on like a journey with you and I need to go rest my eyes is that how you feel I'm just getting stronger by the minute dude that I believe that's called anti-fragile you and I are not the same yeah you and I are absolutely not the same Where Do We Go From Here do we end it here or do we keep going I want to do two little things one all right I just want to have a moment of silence for the MailChimp CEO what happened he got wait the MailChimp CEO or the founder uh Ben Ben who was this what happened though I think right he was I think he quit when they sold it so I don't know exactly benches benches down so okay so so MailChimp was this like darling they were bootstrapped I think they were Butch up forever then they sold to Intuit for many billions of dollars like they did it for like 20 years and they did it out of like Atlanta so they were like this Indie success story right like they're like you know like there's like hundreds of Indie hackers right now on indiehackers.com that like by the way you said Atlanta in a very funny way it's kind of like I usually say Detroit you just said Atlanta you put a you put a hard a t on that obviously and I like that Atlanta ah okay well you know it's like Detroit Detroit Atlanta so this guy he had to step down so he goes um so did you see what what he did or what happened so he sent a um so he sent like an email or something like that where is it let me pull up I see it yeah he basically just said uh he's uh he basically uh said Chestnut said he identified a dangerous Trend in his Workforce new hires introducing themselves using their preferred pronouns this is completely unnecessary for a woman who is clearly a woman to tell us her pronouns as she her and a man who is clearly a man to tell us that his pronouns are he him he wrote in an email uh to a small group of employees uh instead Chestnut said he understood the practice was rooting kindness but added that in the long run this approach just more harm than good forcing people to behave in certain ways that are the opposite of inclusion okay sounds not horrible but uh that's a dangerous dangerous path to go down by the way my recommendation to all of us is to just not comment on this I think we should just read it what happened and then a moment of silence for for uh for for this guy for getting fired from basically fired oh I stepped down coincidentally right after this uh but you know for for you know whether you agree with him or disagree with them I kind of feel like having to step down is a pretty like severe penalty having to step down from your own company is a pretty severe penalty for like having a point of view on this stuff but like maybe that's like maybe it's a lot more severe than I think I don't know like well what's great I think that when you look at when you think about these things words aren't just words you have to look at intentions right and his intention if you we don't even have to read it but his intention is not to say that anyway his intentions are good his intentions actually I think are rooted in like I want to make everyone feel included and I want to be productive and I you know whatever uh and I'm just reading this email a little bit like here's live and so it doesn't seem like a negative email here's the part where I think it got diceyform so he goes in the email he goes um first there was a tiny number of peeps at MailChimp strange to use peeps maybe that's like what they call themselves is that like a chimp word yeah so there's a very tiny number of peeps at MailChimp who consider themselves transgender forcing either with orders or through guilt the approximately 1300 other peeps to adopt a new communication Paradigm that Humanity has never had to use in our 300 000 years of existence and under 150 000 years of spoken language in order to make things slightly more comfortable for an extremely small group of peeps is completely illogical and he says that if you're forced to do something illogical eventually you will believe and do anything even if it's vicious okay that's like a little like he says now nowadays everything is incredibly politicized I'm finding that Peeps are no longer motivated by meaningful work they're motivated to make political statements they're using company time and Company resources to win a game against their opponents in a game that is Raging in their minds and on social media um understanding and respecting that people can have different different views as part of being American part of being mature adults peeps of all different uh political leanings are free to vote the way they want blah blah blah but it's not for the workplace so that's what he said um I'll leave it to anybody to agree or disagree my personal opinion is uh I understand what he's trying to say I think he said it in a pretty stupid way like it's a little too aggressive um and using the word peeps when you're talking about these things is also like if I I I I agree with the sentiment here but I think that if I if it were a hot button issue I wouldn't use slang yeah you can't be like to the homies that had to use the yeah I guess internally they must just always you that use that like you know like Facebook had like whatever like and now has like metamates or whatever like dude it's kind of a meta mate to use a pronoun is like there's two words that I hate using in a serious like argument or discussion like if I'm talking to Sarah my wife or like someone else about like look like you know they said this in their tweets like if it's ever like the word Tweets in an argument like did well I tweeted did you see the Tweet did you see their tweets you know what I mean like I know well he tweeted it like I don't want to use that word or text yeah like when I'm having a serious conversation I want to talk about something and I got to use well he tweeted that you see his tweets yeah because it's too much yeah it doesn't sound I'm not a fan but yeah I'm gonna add peeps to that list so yeah rip Ben I like Ben I don't know him I'm acting like I do uh I've called the emailed him a ton of times and he's never replied to me but uh so we kind of know each other so and it's like so karma yeah I guess he's just one of those peeps yeah he doesn't reply to my emails you can see what happens for those peeps yeah he's he's him in a six billion can go off and be unhappy by themselves but uh you know whatever uh I like Ben chasma Chestnut I love MailChimp I think it's a great company yeah um me too I think MailChimp is a cool really cool success story this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the clients hold history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better do you uh do you want to talk about Nikita uh yeah we kind of did but it seemed like I know but we've lost it over I think so at the end of a podcast a few days ago the Sean Story one we talked about this guy Nikita beer who you and I are both friends with but we talked about it at the end of like an hour session and I realized this is actually really amazing and deserves a significantly more time and so I'll kind of give yeah so Nikita beer he's our good friend we're in a group text message uh with him and that's actually how I got to know him and everything I'm going to explain most everything is public information so this is like through articles and it's Twitter feed so I'm not gonna say anything that is confidential but basically he started an app called TBH so he went to school in Berkeley California started an app called TBH which was basically uh some type of like viral High School app that like you could answer questions about your peers something like that no it wasn't incredibly significant of an app but it went viral and got millions of users very quickly after him spending over two years trying to create viral apps and so we kind of I felt like he kind of honed in on what works and more importantly what doesn't work Facebook eventually buys the app for tens of millions of dollars originally it was said to be like 100 million I think in a recent article they're like it was actually like 40 million which is still a great outcome and that was about five years ago and so Nikita said something in the group message which he says I think it'd be an interesting idea to ask myself or to figure out you're making it too soft I remember exactly how you said it it's like oh so what are you doing what are you up to nowadays so Sam you sold the hustle what are you doing Sean you still be what are you doing Nikita you're sitting at Facebook what are you doing he's basically he just said it straight straight up he goes um I'm just thinking about how I can make 10 million dollars in three months like uh and if we're like what and he's like yeah I want to make an app that generates like 10 million dollars in 90 days and we talked about that like that's just crazy that's outlandish we brought it up on this podcast but it was a really interesting we just thought of it as an interesting thought exercise like oh that's actually a really backwards from that dream okay if that's is that possible yeah it is possible I guess it is possible so that all right I'm a smart guy let me find out find out a way I would do it it's obviously very challenging and so I guess he must have had I don't actually don't know if this is true or not but I imagine when you sell a company to Facebook you have some type of non-compete well typically not competes are anywhere from two to five years the other day a few months ago it was the end of uh the five year period since selling tbh and so I imagine that was the period where he was like great I can do that and so he launches this app about three months ago where basically you like you it's the same app as TBH so what was tbh tbh was a Anonymous polling app or compliments app so you I don't know if you remember like in high school there would always pass this thing around the end of the year the the superlatives test and it would be like who is most likely to become a famous you know famous in Hollywood oh this person in our school who is most likely to you know end up with with 10 kids or whatever right you just come up with these like future looking things who's the best who's got the best smile this person wins best smile and so TBH was that because he was playing on this thing which is people are very interested in them themselves and and the people around them and so you're like all right if I I'll go through and I'll answer this quiz and it was using it like so that sounds very simple under the hood it's got to be pretty smart right because it's got a surface in your contacts it's going to surface the right four or five names that you actually know who do you actually know so you could pick you know your friends and um and then they would send them a text message and saying hey Sam somebody said that you have you have the best smile in your school download the app to find out who who said it and you're like 100 you're gonna go find out who said I have the best smile or who said I'm most likely this who said they have the biggest crush on me and so you know that Taps into like something pretty deep in a teenager and so that's what TBH was got acquired um and by the way that same idea had been done many many times our buddy suley who was the first episode of the podcast he had built that same superlative idea as a Facebook app when the Facebook app platform launched back in like 2007 or something and it also went by it also went crazy viral like this is is just an idea that goes viral and you can switch he did it on the Facebook app platform Nikita did it on the mobile platform where you would send SMS uh you know invites based off of this and so it's the same that was what he did then it got acquired immediately pretty much immediately got shut down uh there wasn't really much retention in it and so it was like oh that's a cool idea it gets people engaged goes viral for a short period of time but there's no engagement all right so there's no long-term retention seems like it gave him this like this Persona of like I am a I'm a wonderkin like I know how to make things go viral because a it is partially true and B Nikita kind of has this like aura about him that who knows if it's on purpose or not on purpose where he like is mysterious and like somewhat silent and only make sarcastic jokes and everything comes easy to him like that's like his like cool kid demeanor yeah yeah he definitely definitely tries to be a cool kid all right so then it's a app you open up it says who do you have a crush on who's got the best smile who's most likely to be whatever who would you trust to bail you out of jail uh and you you answer and they're all supposed to be you know sort of like pop more positive-ish questions or not it's not like mean it's not supposed to be bullying and uh again starts to go viral and so we sat there in this group chat as it was happening so describe kind of how it played out from your perspective he says things like all right now we're adding a thousand people an hour and I kind of brush that off because like I think maybe these are just Bots like this isn't actually serious well there's one little difference he launches it and we're like cool man how do we download the app he's like you have to it's geofenced to these three high schools in Georgia and we're like what and he's like and we're like hey and then he would post like a CH like you know he'd be like post this Graphics it's going viral but it's got like 200 people we're like oh only 200 he's like there's only like 2 000 people in the school this is going to take away like like right away but it uses like academic language like it has a k Factor or a blank but we're seeing that user retention stagnates at this thing the turn happens at three percent like it was density that's cool and then and then he goes then he's supposed to chart and we're like oh sick like I don't like how come I don't see it when I go to my App Store chart like you know social free apps he's like we put it in the games category under puzzles he's like he's like that way we're gonna like stay away from competition until we flip the switch and we're like whoa like damn this guy is like this is like if you want Game of Thrones and they're talking about like you know how to invade King's Landing it's like these guys standing at this giant table moving these chess pieces around like talking about conquering that's him but the chess pieces are like high schools and he's moving them yeah it was like uh it's like James Bond villain of High School uh you know quizzes if that's such a by the way there's one key twist to the whole thing it's TBH again but he's like this time we're not trying to be the next Snapchat we don't care about the retention we're just gonna put a in-app purchase that says pay to see who voted for you and he's like they're gonna pay and we're like well I get well will they pay they're gonna pay and it's like the thing is a freaking 699 Weekly subscription so this is basically 28 a month this is double the price of Netflix to see who voted for you and he's like yep so if we're converting you know whatever four percent of people and we can take over this state Georgia Georgia high schools each high school has this many students and yeah 1.8 million dollars a month okay good yeah let's go that's basically like my reenactment of how they're thinking about this and at this with TBH he had raised a little bit of money he had raised money from Founders for on Fund in Greylock and like the the when you do that it says uh you know you I've got to build the next Snapchat this way with this new company he just basically says dude I'm self-funded I've got 400 Engineers living in my La house right now we're just trying to like make it big make it fast and uh what do they say on South Park like uh scale up no start up get big cash out bro down you know like that like that's exactly what he's trying to do he's trying to just get in get the bag get out and just maybe return two idea for you yeah not uh and so anyway about 10 days after it launches I'm just making these numbers up but it's around a week maybe two weeks he starts saying like oh man people are starting to spread these rumors that this app is being used for human trafficking and we laugh that off and he goes so I changed it to no he was like he's like yeah it's like annoying like as hell like we're getting a bunch of deletions okay oh it's gonna die and we were like what the thing that like you called your shot you're like I'm gonna build an app that goes viral it's gonna make 10 million dollars in like 90 days and that's a ludicrous thing to say you spend like two years plotting he went through a bunch of different ideas to think about what it could be decides you know what it's TBH with a paywall launch it like spends you know it has these like seven Engineers living in his living room you know the place smells like you know Ramen and Old Spice and he's like all right we build the app after a few months we launched this thing in these pockets of Georgia it goes viral but then this whole you know this hoax starts saying this is for I don't know what the sex trafficking human sex trafficking which I didn't even understand but I didn't even understand but I shouldn't even say those words YouTube's gonna like de-prioritize this algorithm like and we're out of the algorithm now like because I said that out loud and he says that he's like well it's actually it's just like a couple reviews but I have a feeling that these couple of reviews are gonna like spread someone already made a video on Tick Tock this is just how things work and so I'm like it's whatever like that I don't understand that entirely that sounds like you're just being like neurotic but sounds good so he changes the name to crush right yeah so app starts getting deleted or no it gets taken down in the App Store Apple takes down or something like that he's like oh we're gonna petition blah blah we're gonna re-upload as crush and he sends us hey guys like new brand and it looks exactly like yeah exactly like crush the soda like like the grape flavor it sends it in the text and I I got so thirsty like you know like the pavlovian dog response I saw that and I was like I need orange soda on my tongue right now and uh I hadn't had orange soda in like a decade if I saw that thing and I was like I need that relaunches again in like you know Alabama this time he's like okay we're going south and they attacked Alabama with their four High School launch strategy they do they have this like thing set to a T and by the way like he had he had wrote a memo inside Facebook once about how TBH was launching high schools effectively he's like we created basically his theory is basically for a social app the most valuable thing you can have is a reliable way to test your app so like can you get this into a a small Network like like a high school where most people know each other or know of each other of a thousand people quickly because if you could do that you could test it in one high school see what the data says and then you could tweak the app launch in another High School do it again he's like that reliable like petri dish to test in is the most valuable thing so they had come up with a strategy which was they put this memo got leaked when he was at Facebook which was like they would create Instagram accounts like you know Crush you know um you know archipelago High you know and it's like they they take the high school name and they take the brand name of the thing and they would make the account private and they would go follow every kid who had like you know class of whatever 2022 um in that high school they would follow all of them so then the kid would say who followed me uh it has my high school name in it they click it it's private to find to see the profile you've got to follow back so they would they would request to follow so a whole bunch of people requested to follow he's like but we would not accept anyone and it's like this is like you know the Dennis system on all of a sudden he's like you know first we demonstrate value then we take it away and he's like then at 4 pm on the day before launch which uh the day of the launch when everybody gets out of school you know we have a guy in a truck watching people leave the school as soon as they do we hit accept requests we accept everybody's request everybody gets a notification at the same time and then they go to it the bio basically says download the app see who likes you you download the app and then he's like we would instantly go with Ireland in high school so he had this like launch strategy which which was I thought pretty pretty great pretty tactical so he's doing that again now with crush crush gonna go it's gonna launch like that and it starts to work and we're like wow dude you did it again like the first one wasn't a fluke you did it again all of a sudden it totally attracted a different demographic because of this like stupid Orange Soda logo and the name crush and so he's like oh God you know to cut all right let's move the scene around change the name again and he comes back for act three and this time it's called gas and by the way this hole so he'd been working on this for many months maybe more than a year I don't know but this whole thing that we're describing takes place over two to three weeks and it gets to the point where he starts making up phrases like uh we are acquiring new users at this rate per hour you know a lot of times we talk about saying like ARR annual recurring revenue and what a lot of companies will do is they'll take like their monthly run rate and multiply that by 12 to say this is what they're doing he was basically doing that at a per hour base so he's like oh we're you know we're we're acquiring a thousand users per hour which means our uh our rate of like a new users is like 365 million whatever and yeah he was like he's like if you look Dawn day over day it's like you're just measuring the period of like the sunrise day over day what's your what your numbers are that's insane and so gas starts like taking off similar to the original one but this time even even more and in a matter of like seven days I believe he starts tweeting out the results and letting us know and basically within like seven days give or take five days I don't know exactly it was doing a million daily it had a million daily users was adding 30 000 new users an hour users were answering 3.2 million polls per hour in a brown like 10 days I believe he's hit a million dollars in sales and are also around 10 days in it was number one in the App Store and he had been telling us it's going to be number one in the next handful of days it's gonna be number one and they totally called it and we're talking number one like above Tick Tock above Instagram above Facebook yeah totally this is all true and he said he tweets out he goes ladies and gentlemen after a five-year Hiatus I'm no longer a one-hit wonder introducing gas the number one app in the app store and this is when it turns to the point where it's incredibly hard for us to compliment him and a root for him because clearly this guy has a chip on his shoulder clearly for the last five years he was mad that he sold too soon or didn't become like huge or didn't become wealthier or didn't become whatever his his Target was but he fell short it felt like and now he's proving that he is the man because here's what's hap here's what here's what starts happening and he gets hilariously cocky about it which I I I love I love I love it makes me like him even more but I love and so like here's an example a really popular VC tweets out uh his name is Josh Gelman momentum growth is a powerful feeling and it could also go away really quickly I have been surprised I have been surprised how many things with seemingly Unstoppable momentum have slow crawl this past year zooming out growth without deep duration adoption and habits doesn't count and Nikita replies just at me and so basically he just starts going around anyone online on Twitter who's a big shot who starts talking about high growth stuff Nikita just pops out and said what are you talking about me and it's hilarious it is so funny and so Abram this time though the rumors start happening again about human trafficking and he starts tweeting and sharing the craziest stuff and this gets so big that Ashton Kutcher is retweeting who Ashton Kutcher didn't entirely know this but like his whole like philanthropy thing is human trafficking and so these rumors of human trafficking start happening again and Ashton Kutcher retweets Nikita and says something like Nikita sends us a screenshot it's Ashton Kutcher DM again and he's like he just he's just screenshotting us these like big shot people that are just dming him like wink face instead of even saying hi they're just like it's like is this how this guy like slides into DMS that's interesting that wasn't Ashton Kutcher but like uh but Ashton also retweeted it I'd love to meet I'd love to meet you I'd love to help you know uh this thing is a hoax because basically what Nikita is saying is he's like the scene is taking off like you wouldn't believe that you know it's going viral the K factor is two and then K factors too what that means is for every person who joins you know virally they invite two more right so it's like you know you thought covid spread fast watch how fast the gas app is gonna spread it's got a a incredibly High uh viral coefficient that just basically means for free it's gonna take over whatever demographic it is until that until that coefficient starts to go down because either it's saturated or hits a new market where it's less viral and so it's going viral um ashcrutcher's like I'll help you try to fight these hoax rumors because on tick tock on Snapchat you just see story after Story of somebody saying guys uh delete this gap gas app it's suss as hell I downloaded it and a white van started following me around my neighborhood and people are like oh my God oh my God share share just keep it keep our sis like our school safe uh and it's like girls like girls do not download gas app like like you ever seen the show you on Netflix say no more and it's like it's like the people are just spreading this thing and so it's like what the hell like where is this coming from and he doesn't know and he's like it's got to be a competitor and we're like okay what like what kind of combat I mean you've just launched like two weeks ago how are they doing this coordinated like social like psyops attack on you and your user base and he's like then he's like we've we've located the source of the hoax uh or or it originated in China he's like well here's what he says here's what he says it's this is the most official tweet ever it's so funny he goes after an investigation our team found several indications that the gas app that uh the gas app human trafficking hoax was planted by an entity or person originating in China our data shows users connecting from China when the app first began growing and the fake fake review the first fake review were posted that same day and so basically he's accusing something or someone in China who starts she's accusing the country yeah and so this is just taking off from I want to make 10 million dollars I want to get in and get out to China is trying to actively bring me down and he just tweeted out dude I am calling for a total and complete ban of Chinese Goods in entering the United no I'm just joking you need to go lean in way more because what he's doing in his PR push he's like the the the the hoax the false hoax is being spread about gas app human you know trafficking blah blah blah and um and I'm like bro you need to go full Trump you need to be like China the China virus is trying to take down this American success gas app is it you know Tick Tock is not only stealing your data they're trying to take us down because we are the number one app for teens China is doing this this is anti-china I was like you should be leaning in way more to this child I was like I don't know if it's true not true but like this is your only hope is to get this like you should stop saying your app's name with the words you know human trafficking and you should start saying uh you know why is China trying to you know spread fake news about this that is that is my my official recommendation to you and it's and it's totally working and so this entire story that we just spent 30 minutes on this entire story we're talking like 20 days and this is the roller coaster that we've been in and he would say what he says today yes but that's my point he says these things in this group chat and when it's on your phone when it's just on this small thing you think this is just limited to us six guys in this thing this is just no big deal but then you turn on Fox Business News and our Fox News business and he's on there you go to Wall Street Journal and he's on there you go to Business Insider uh Bloomberg all these places and it's real I go to tick tock and I open up and there's a video about this app and basically as much as I don't like saying this because I like Nikita but he is so smug he has 100 called his shot and he hit it he nailed it this is this is one of the most epic stories that I've seen behind the scenes in real time in a very long time it's been quite amazing to watch this entire thing play out in just 20 days yeah he's smoke as hell but I uh you know the same reason I find Conor McGregor very entertaining in the UFC right this cocky guy who tries to call his shots and then tries to pull it off like um I I'm thoroughly entertained and I'm here for the entertainment uh and like you know good for him made it happen this this matters to him he got really pumped about this and he made it happen and it's like I feel like you know you know Bane when he's like uh you know he sees other people like you know I felt like Nikita for like four years would see other people try to build social apps and he would just like [ __ ] on them or he would be like uh you know or people building apps and be like you know if your app doesn't let you you know flirt with someone buddy it's never gonna work you know like or be like unless you built the number one app in the app store like you know don't talk to me type of type of attitude and um and I find it you know pretty awesome that like you know like Bane when he's like oh you know you know whatever the line is he's like you know you uh you you trained in the dark I was born in the dark like that's him with these like teen viral apps he's like you know oh you're trying to make a social lap I was born to make social apps the fact that he just relaunched the save app is hilarious to me in so many ways um he probably had just like a countdown timer to like when the non-compete ends because I talked to him in between and he was considering all these like other ideas you're considering this one real estate idea it's considered this other idea and then it was just like like you know it's sort of all like Harry Potter the wand chooses the wizard it's like it's just pulling me back in just what I think I'm out I gotta go do this app again like who fucker's Really Gonna Let do this again and then he did it again yeah this is pretty amazing it also goes to show that uh it shows a few things it kind of breaks a lot of narratives which I actually like which is a like you don't really need like a mission you know all the time like and and I think that like with us you don't need a noble mission 10 million dollars for three months that's a great Mission and I do actually think that maybe there is something we're like oh it makes teens feel good or whatever maybe that's like there but like I think what's there really above all else is get big fast because that's exciting and just like play the puzzle it's just a puzzle and I think that that's like kind of the dominating Factor behind what's driving him and I think that that's the funny thing he goes on Fox News and he's like doing the interview you know they have the person talking and then the background they're showing screenshots of the app and so he's saying he's like well the thing we wanted to do was bring positivity to teens you know teens feel really bad from whatever like you know Instagram what positivity wanted an app where there's you know it's Anonymous but there's no bullying there's no um there's no like sort of negativity and the screenshot is a poll question that says want to steal them from their boyfriend it's like okay he's like you know we just want it he's like I get messages every day from teens saying you know uh you know I was gonna do something bad to myself but this app came out and now you know I'm running around in a field full of uh flowers and it's like it was just hilarious the whole thing is is like straight Silicon Valley uh HBO show like it's so funny to me it is so funny and it's so exciting another thing is that basically when you're building these apps like the really good folks are just like maniacal about these little small numbers and just tweaking them and just just being obsessed with these little small things when most people are carried about or worrying about design or branding or the logo or just these things that don't matter it's like dude all I care about is making this K Factor like more than one and so and when it's not when it's 0.99 it's we're screwed we gotta totally redo this and I just thought that it's a really interesting story and this has been like a roller coaster and one of the cool things that's happened in a long time I just love following along this yeah props to him uh great great job thank you for the thank you for the entertainment um all right do you want to do any more or should we save it for the next I'll tell you in one more I do have one more but um we should save that one it sounds too interesting okay let's save it same for the next one that's it we're out of here [Music]

I remember hearing at one point that only two percent of the Indian population paid taxes really the majority of the population just simply didn't pay taxes this is a big problem in India because they're not banked either so it's like there's no way to track anything cash economy you don't have a bank account it's like taxes no it's not for me yeah it's optional but I think that might have changed this was like 10 years ago I heard that stat and I was like what the hell uh so I'm sure that's changed over time

I remember there were times with the thing I needed it would cost like fifty dollars and it was just like it was it was inconceivable that I could afford it I mean like honestly Oculus owes more to the iPhone than anything else I mean like if the iPhone wouldn't have existed there wouldn't have been broken iPhones for me to buy unlock repair and sell on eBay like because I made tens of thousands of dollars as a teenager on that on that side hustle like if if that had not happened then Oculus probably wouldn't exist today [Music] foreign what's up we got Palmer lucky on the podcast Palmer is a billionaire he created Oculus which he sold to Facebook he's created Andrew which is now one of the biggest like government they make weapons for the government and um super interesting guy I'm gonna call it right now I think this is a all-timer episode I don't know what's I don't you know you guys know I don't hype it up like that unless it's legit this was an all-timer episode Sam what are some of the things that we talked about so early on we asked them basically what he did with his money so he made hundreds of millions of dollars at the age of like 23 or something like that and we said where did you put your money and it was very clear on what he did with it uh he talked about some of his early crypto Investments so he bought uh crypto way way early like in 2010 I think he said he talked about how he was making minimum wage and then became a billionaire like four or five years after just making minimum wage what else uh we talked about a couple different things where he likes to hang out on the internet we're like dude where do you how do you know about all this stuff where do you learn this stuff what are your subreddits what are you what are you listening to and reading because I need to start doing some of that so he told us some of his foot by the way do you remember he actually said a Facebook group that he liked and he actually named the Facebook group yeah he's gonna get a lot more popular and then um yeah he talked about basically like is world war three gonna happen right he's he's supplying you know uh that his company builds tech for the defense department uh Department Department of Defense and so is World War III gonna happen is there going to be a nuke what is a tactical nuke well you asked him a very specific question you go is Russia gonna drop a nuclear bomb and his perspective is interesting I thought it was a good question and then the best part was we said all right you sold Oculus and then you created Andrew which is an even bigger success I think it's like value to eight billion dollars or something but there was many years in between did you consider doing any other ideas and he opened up and he was like yeah actually there were these two or three other ideas he had an idea about uh creating a new kind of prison he had an idea that would try to solve OB obesity uh he had a couple ideas and we go into depth brainstorming with him so he had it all man he had the the crazy backstory the success story but he also brought ideas and then he also argued with us about why he flies coach even though he's a billionaire and um why he may or may not get into a fight with Jason calacanus and so this episode had it all had fighting had ideas had success stories it's got it all all right enjoy this episode with Palmer lucky I don't know you don't need too much of an intro but I'll do it anyways Palmer lucky is here um created Oculus created Andrew uh really interesting dude and uh and I think you know we have a bunch of topics so I'm not going to kind of belabor the intro Sam I know you've been itching we just you probably can't say the DM you you sent to try to get Palmer on here you really wanted this man on the podcast why like my first question is to you Sam why so Palmer I am like the king of left-handed compliments at least that's what they say about me but I I mean them as full-handed compliments or right-handed compliments but basically I love freaks I love weirdos I love extremists not like in the political sense but in the sense of like people who just go all in on stuff and are just passionate about maybe like nerdy or unconventional things and you go all in on things and I love that I love people even if I don't like what they're going going all in on I I'm crazy fascinated by that and you see one of those guys who just goes all in on things you you've done a lot at a young age and I like weirdos and I put you in that in that category thank you I'm happy to be happy to be a weirdo you know I'd rather be I'd rather I'd rather be a person that uh that that people think ill or or or well of then somebody nobody thinks of at all I think by the way I think well Sam had a poster at his office that was like for his employees he was like Let your freak flag fly that was like you know one of those like you know corporate values are typically like integrity and like determination and his was like be a freak um all right so so let's start with um I don't know let's start with some of the kind of we're gonna try to as much we can avoid VR and avoid the Facebook stuff because mostly just because you've talked about it a bunch of places I'm like frankly I'm interested because I am actually a VR Fanboy but Sam has has tried to forbid me from asking those questions so we're gonna leave that at the end if I get a little extra time but this is a podcast that started it's called my first million because we're interested in money and we think it's really funny that people are tap like money's like you know the Silicon Valley things you have to pretend you don't like money and like oh I know you're talking about yeah you know we're not doing it here for the money you know this money money's you know money's not the real objective I actually tell my own employees and onboarding that if if you work at a place where your boss is saying that you should be worried because it's one thing it's one thing to say that to the Press it's one thing to say that in your marketing materials but you you know if if your employees don't believe that at the end of the day you're trying to make their job a fiscally responsible decision if you're effectively telling them you could be making more money elsewhere and your financial success is not my priority you should be concerned yeah yeah exactly and you kind of did the best of both like for all the kind of ironic people who are like we're trying to change the world with this like you know HR onboarding software you know uh you actually kind of did and still made a bunch of money doing it so you know it's not like an either or uh 100 I mean when I started Oculus it was not because I thought it would be the thing that would make the most money there had never been a successful VR company in history to be clear and I did it because it was something I was really passionate about now that said one of the things I'm most proud of in my whole career is that everyone who worked at Oculus achieved Financial Independence because we were able to build something incredible and like I feel great that everyone who was part of that mission and who supported me early on was able to make a bunch of money and then a lot of them have gone on to do incredible things but uh yeah Oculus was not was not was not done because I thought it was the best way to make money it's because I thought it really was going to be the best way to change the world in the long run Android was a little different I I that one it wasn't just oh this will be fun I want to do something really cool Andrew was like I felt like I had to do it or things were things were going to go really poorly so more more of a more of a stick than a carrot on that one how much did you make off the Oculus sale oh man I probably shouldn't say because this is also one of those complex things where you know there was the there was the sale so there's what they believed they called the merger consideration form of uh you know portion of the of the of the uh compensation and then they you know you cut an employment deal where they say we're going to pay you you know this much for five years I can say that I was locked I was locked up on a five-year vesting schedule so typical would be four most of our employees were four I got locked up for five because I was a key guy and uh that that money technically is not for the acquisition it's just yeah I had that too um yep so yeah and of course you know you can't you can't pretend you can't say they're the same thing or they're supposed to be treated differently tax wise compensation wise and then of course there's the bonuses we had we had an earn out that was a it was a it was a it was a huge earn out it was hundreds of millions of dollars for the founders of the company if we could hit certain sales targets and user uh user like hours hours of time Target chance and we actually had four years to hit those targets and we we hit them within less than two years so we actually did it's kind of funny we'll be like oh man the acquisition must not be gone as well as people expect it's like no we maxed out the top bracket of our earn out uh because we're we're kicking butt but uh anyway it was in the hundreds of millions of dollars I can tell you that in the healthy hundreds of millions of dollars what were you who listened to this uh sorry I'll go real quick a bunch of people who listen to this are founders and and like would want to sell their company someday uh both me and Sam we started this podcast right when we both exited our companies because it's like all right we're kind of earning out well we can't start another company right now but like oh we can start a podcast that sounds kind of fun and um and actually just yesterday I just closed on another sale of a company but these are small scale compared to what you did right like congratulations thank you but you you sold for I don't know two or three billion bucks how does that happen somebody you know Zach comes over to your house and it's like I'll give you three billion dollars for this like how does that how does that even how does that conversation go down um when when when you're talking about the sort of like the Grand Slam type of outcomes well it's a it's a long story but yeah you know I I know I know Sam didn't want to talk all about VR but no this shit's interesting to me oh great then we we don't won't talk about VR Optics and in the metaverse then but I I guess on the business side of it the interesting thing about the acquisition is that we didn't have any of intention of selling initially when we first had our conversation with Facebook and I think that really was a positive thing uh because actually first time we talked I think basically we were offered a billion dollars to sell uh and we said no we're not interested we think this company's easily going to surpass that value we think it's not going to be a problem for us to make more money and uh yeah we were happy to work with you guys but we we don't want to be by the way was that easy to say no to a billion dollars I mean you started this thing like on a Kickstarter dude like you know at some point were you like was it hard to say no or was it not not an issue at that point it wasn't an issue for me and I think I think of different people had different opinions I mean look if you if you look over my career I've made a lot of similar decisions like when I was starting Oculus when I was deciding whether I was going to do a Kickstarter or work for someone else I actually had a job on a job offer on the table from uh from Sony to run a PlayStation VR lab uh you know out of PlayStation group and when I turned them down they actually doubled the offer and then I had to turn them down again and a lot of people were wondering how could you have done that you know how could you have decided to do your own thing it was so much higher risk and I think that a lot of it is is Social programming you know I grew up watching media that conditioned me to believe that when you have an opportunity you have to take it when you know when you almost have to follow the narrative and looking back I'm not sure I I could have done anything else like could I have stayed in school instead of starting Oculus once I realized I had this breakthrough in VR technology I think I could not have possibly done it there's it it's almost to the level of free will not existing I could not have chosen that could I have gone and worked for Sony looking back I don't think so I think I couldn't have made that decision and I think it's actually the same thing with that billion dollar offer like I almost could not have said yes you know like that that first offer like narratively it makes no sense it doesn't align with what I've been trained as what you do when you're uh you know when you're a free thinking iconoclast and so I couldn't have done it I think what what happened is a few things changed over over time after that initial offer you know we didn't talk to Facebook for for a few months after that and a few things happened one it became clear that our competition was not only serious but was going to be putting massive dollars into their success something not a lot of people remember uh but I certainly do because you it was a big deal in my mind the day that we announced no the day we find it wasn't anything else the day we finalized the Facebook acquisition was the same day that Sony announced PlayStation VR and we had known that it was coming for a while we we actually even shown each other prototypes and stuff but it really reinforced this was a serious thing we're gonna have some of the biggest games companies in the world putting hundreds of millions of dollars into competing with us and uh you know that that made I think our that made the the pitch that Facebook came back with which is listen you maybe you could make more money as an independent company but if you're with us we're going to make VR happen much faster so it you yes you might make more money but you're going to go much slower than if we were able to artificially supercharge your growth far beyond even what you could do with venture capital and they they were willing to commit billions of dollars a year for a period of a decade or more and that's that's a really tough thing to turn down when you really believe in something and is this like literally Zuck coming to your house and talking about this or is there like an army of lawyers in between you guys that are like you know bankers and and Corp Dev people it was a very small number of people I mean it was it was I mean I I think that the the the the lawyers and the accountants are much more likely to be involved in a deal when the deal is contingent on uh you know your revenue and your multiples and your P L's like that that's where you need to drag those people in to really make a an assessment this was such a high level bet it's not like oh I think that you have this margin on your headset and you've sold this many development kits it was so early and the technology so nascent the real bet is do you believe in the metaverse do you believe that there's going to be a virtual world parallel to our own where you're living and you're working you're playing and then most importantly do you believe this is the best team in the world to do it and I didn't know this at the time but I found out later that Mark had been going around and talking to various uh University Research Labs Government research Labs talking to you know seeing what other companies were doing and their conclusion was we were way ahead of everyone else and that if if this was going to happen this shift to immersive Computing the final Computing platform arguably that we were the people in the best position to do it and that's not something that a lawyer can really give an opinion on it's not something that an accountant can put a value on it's it's a very high level bet what was your personal financial situation when you turned down the billion dollar offer so at the time uh early early in Oculus so yeah I mean I started Oculus using my own money and at that time I was working a minimum wage job and living in a 19-foot camper trailer I was 19 years old so for people who aren't familiar with the story to that degree I mean I had almost no money literally had a few hundred dollars in my bank account because I spent all the money that I made putting myself through school and working on virtual reality technology and I was extraordinarily and I had a minimum wage job I was also fixing computers on the side for a while I'd been buying broken iPhones but fixing them and unlocking them selling those for spare cash and so I I burned a lot of money on my on my on my nutty hobby um and when we started Oculus uh we we didn't pay ourselves very much by the time the acquisition happened I had given myself a raise we decided that nobody in the company was going to make over a hundred thousand dollars we called it the 100K Club so we're paying the CEO a hundred thousand dollars uh I was getting paid a hundred thousand dollars and uh to me that that actually felt incredible I was like Wow hundred thousand dollars this is absolutely crazy I can I can afford anything you're like you know how many cell phones how many iPhones I'd have to fix to make a hundred thousand dollars a lot because you were fixing iPhones and like scrubbing boats or something I read is yeah I mean when I started working on VR stuff I was I I worked for a few years in a boat yard so yeah scrubbing boats repainting repainting the the the the the bottom paint uh sweeping the boat yard you know that that type of stuff um so so to me the money was not was not a huge motivating factor also because maybe maybe too optimistically I believed Oculus was going to be worth tens of billions or hundreds of billions of dollars so it really wasn't the the month I know this is what contrary to what I said before but it wasn't the money that was motivating me to make the sale the it was the pitch hey we're gonna get you billions of dollars right now like not not the not the compensation for the for the for the acquisition but we're going to give you your your organization billions of dollars a year to go out and make virtual reality actually happen and that's what you're going to need to compete with Google to compete with Sony to compete with Microsoft all of which have seen what you're doing bought in like they've drunk your Kool-Aid but they're gonna try to kill you over it uh that that was kind of the situation we were were in and Facebook was one of the very few companies that had a strong incentive to make virtual reality and immersive Computing writ large to come about as quickly as possible because unlike Google unlike Microsoft they did not benefit from the status quo in the hardware space so if we kept using mobile phones and normal computers for you know that 20 30 years Google and Microsoft are going to do just fine like they're already the winners in that Paradigm if you can shake everything up and force a reset with immersive Computing AR VR Mr whatever you want to call it uh it could be that Microsoft is one of the top players and it could be that Apple and Google are are some of the top players but it's unlikely that all of them are going to remain the dominant players and that's an opening for a company like Facebook to come in and even if they're not first place forcing the reset puts them in second or third place instead of being totally subservient to the operating system uh vendors and to the hardware vendors so it was one of those things where there were other companies that were interested none of them actually had a strong incentive to put billions of dollars into VR on an ongoing Basin I mean you can see Google killed their VR program first they killed their pcvr team then they killed their mobile VR team Microsoft is winding down their internal efforts I mean it's a it's a it's a it's a tough business and I'm not convinced that Oculus would still be around if we hadn't had those resources I'm gonna uh move on from like asking you these money questions but I want to ask one more because I do think it's fascinating because you went from like maybe not having a lot to having a lot and you're also like an eyeball yeah which I like when I sold my business I put everything into bonds and just Vanguard Total index funds and just did like a normal 80 20 split and then eventually some real estate and then HubSpot stock and just normal like basic stuff what did you do with your money and what have you because I know you bought like a a marina I think or you tried to buy it I don't know if it went through uh but like what what does like someone like you do with that amount of uh liquidity so most of it I did what you're talking about I generally don't believe in trying to beat the market through Market Market transactions I mean it's one thing to build like I think you build wealth by building companies that's where you should be focusing your effort not trying to be smarter than all the finance guys who are sitting around and using every tool at their disposal to try and game the financial market so actually yeah Vanguard funds like Vanguard 500 total index funds um my grandpa taught me a lot about investing and about how you shouldn't try to beat the market probably the the my investment philosophies informed mostly by John bogle's little black book on investing where he's like look you know keep your fees low keep your costs low and just go with the market and you know if the market goes so poorly that I become poorer then the United States has bigger problems than uh than than than the market um so that was that was most what I did I bought the marina not as a financial investment it was actually it was one of the only marinas so this is getting a little into the Weeds on something probably very few people care about but just so you know um in California almost all marinas the water is owned by the state or by the feds and then they do long-term leases like 30 or 40 years to operators that are allowed to operate those marinas and they might own let's say the parking lot the operator but they do not own the water they do not own the stocks it's just a long-term lease and they redo that over there's only a small handful of marinas in the entire State of California where the underlying land under the water and the water itself is deeded to a private title and the marina that I bought was one of those and uh you know without getting into without getting into my my whole seasteading delusion I think that you're going to end up needing uh if you want to have transport ferries that are operating from Land out to international waters you do not want to be in a position where the place you're doing that from is totally dependent on state government bureaucrats choosing to renew your lease on a particular on a particular Marina so that was actually that was actually a purchase that'll it'll it'll pay off someday uh you'll see you all see see I bought my house just like I like the walk-in closet was nice and I was like oh that's a good enough reason for me I didn't have to like you know go into international waters uh to make it all in my case I I did buy I mean I did I did a few things like as soon as I had money I immediately started learning to fly helicopters for real because I'd always wanted to be a helicopter pilot ever since being a little kid so like it was like it was like two weeks after the wire completed I was I was flying helicopter so that was really cool um I bought a 69 Mustang convertible that was really cool and uh I bought a first generation Tesla Model S that was cool and then I bought a house for my parents you know it's like the the it's like the basketball player contract move you know you you get the money you buy the you buy the house for for your parents and then I bought a house for myself that was close to my grandpa actually uh and unfortunately we then ended up having to move up to Silicon Valley because of the acquisition and then he passed away while I was up there so one one of my one of my regrets but I'm still in that house wow uh okay that's amazing and uh one other thing I had seen was that you I don't know if this is even a real thing or it's like some Twitter fake you know fake photo or whatever did you buy Bitcoin in 2013 no no I bought Bitcoin much earlier than that 2013 is when I was on I I was in the Forbes 30 under 30 and they asked everyone on it for a quote for the print edition and it was the theme was what is your advice to other young Founders and my quote was buy more Bitcoin um but I I've actually been involved in Bitcoin since before there were any exchanges I like I I was a true OG on the bitcoinetalk.org forums there were no exchanges you could only do direct transactions for goods I actually sold a banner ad on my game console modification Forum it was a one week Banner ad on this forum with almost no traffic and I sold it for 400 Bitcoin uh and then I ended up uh I ended up buying someone's uh Samsung Samsung Galaxy Vibrant which was the T-Mobile variant of the first Galaxy phone uh for 800 Bitcoin I believe uh which at the time was you know well well under a dollar per Bitcoin right so I I've actually been in 16 million very early days 16 oh my God how do you huh so like all right you you we had biology you know biology uh on the Pod and like he was one of these guys where he would like give an analogy he was like oh you know Bitcoin is kind of like the Battle of tames and I'm like bro I you can't you I needed an analogy for your analogy like I can't tell you about the Battle of teams in World War II like I can't have that conversation with you and you're a little bit like that where you're talking about like uh you just like threw in a few lines like all this gaming Forum I have when I was like well I could go down that path but then you're talking about like this boat marina thing and I'm like that's a whole conversation like how on Earth do you discovered that and then I'm sure you have strong opinion you just have a a very sh and then now obviously you're doing government stuff then you've done uh and you know a bunch about politics whatever how are you becoming so well-versed and also so opinionated on such a broad set of topics because you have to most of the time like the best things that I've done that I have done in my career have not been going super super deep on one vertical and then finding the really really hard gains that are at the end of a long fight that everyone's made like an example here would be uh with just like Optics technology most people are fighting way at the end of the spectrum where they're trying to like oh we're using new Cutting Edge materials that increase the ability to control light more precisely by two percent and we're trying to figure out the physics of how we can manufacture these polymers most of my best ideas have not come from that they've been from knowing things in totally different fields that have nothing to do with the field or at least people don't think they do and then pulling ideas from those fields and applying them in a new way like the the really key thing that made the oculus rift work is just one example rather than focusing on trying to make these Optical Stacks that cost thousands of dollars and weighed a bunch and that was really what was making these headsets way many pounds and cost tens of thousand dollars it was the high-end Optical stack that was able to project images on your retina with minimal Distortion but you needed you know a bunch of lenses they're all very very expensive very high Precision what I did is figure out that you could just render a distorted image basically render your image distort it on the graphics card uh in the inverse way that the lens distorted it and then basically you would render an image that looks terrible on the screen but after viewing it through the lens that I had which was optimized for high field of view low weight low cost but not optimized have low Distortion low chromatic aberration or geometric aberration it would come out looking looking perfect and like that that's something where an optical engineer someone who's working on just Optics would not would not think of that you know that's very much like a a a software idea but the software people are also not necessarily thinking about how they could obsolesce expenses expensive pieces of Optics and of course there are people who do that do that I think that some of the best entrepreneurs are people who have on understanding that is sufficient in enough areas to pull from one area and solve the biggest problems of another so I I mean I I make it a priority you asked how do I do it you make it a priority to know a little about a lot so uh two questions one just go back to the Bitcoin thing for a second sure how did you get into like why were you on the Bitcoin talk forums or why did you see it even before you know almost anybody uh so what were you doing there and why did it catch your eye um and then you know today 10 years later there's a whole bunch of people that are disillusioned by it they say oh it's all this time's gone by 10 years didn't work out other people are more bullish than ever you know where do you stand now so what caught your eye and where do you stand now so I mean I think I got into Bitcoin it would have been mid mid to late 2010 um and and I I I was really fascinated because I I mean look I'm a guy who was into virtual reality in the metaverse this is just adjacent to that it's another super cool you know cyberpunk con except the idea of you know uh untraceable internet currency that is based on only the consensus of all of the cyberpunks who are using it cryptographically verified and secured with no nation-state controlling it or issuing it or diluting it or manipulating like like what what a cool thing when you're when you're an anti-authority teenager who who loves who loves cyberpunk science fiction um and so that that it was like I bought into the the very original cool Vision not the oh this is going to be huge for everybody one but like this is this is this is cyberpunk Incarnate I have to be a part of this um and when I started uh like my initial thinking was not that it was a good store of value that was that's actually been I think the most contentious thing about crypto is after it started Skyrocket I didn't buy it because I was speculating nobody was even thinking about that back then like it's it's crazy to me to watch all these new crypto kids get in and it seems like it's all about just having having coins pumping the value dumping them it's really just you know these this financial markets play that I've never believed in because I always believe in you know investing in the whole Market um but to me it was always value as a as a means of moving wealth around it's not as a store for years or decades it's a way that you can move wealth around uh without any without being beholden to any any centralized Authority or centralized power and I think today like even for all the issues Bitcoin has and people you know putting it down because of it crashing well first of all every time there's a Bitcoin crash it's like oh no it's crash two only 10x what it was two years ago every single time every crash is like that um but more importantly it's still a good way to move value around and uh that said my prediction in 2013 was that Bitcoin will go to about a hundred thousand dollars and then stabilize I'm sticking with it I I think I think it'll get there I'm not I'm not sure that it in particular has the has the appropriate utility to reach a higher store of value and wow okay amazing and then did you oh by the way I have and I have to throw out there I'm one of those guys who lost a bunch of coins in the mount goxack oh man I got gox good um and it was it was one of those things where there was no like looking back everyone's like oh my God I can't believe that you know you would have and I had most of my coins in in my own wallet uh but I had a significant amount on on gox because people were transferring coins to my God to my docs account and uh now everyone's like oh my god of course you would never keep your coins in an exchange but like I was 16 years old and like you know there was there was no there's no like idiot's guide to bitcoin back then it was it was the type of thing you only used if you were a crazy A crazy internet Nutter and so you've mentioned forums and I'm a big Forum sky like I still I remember you know BB I wasn't like before whatever was before BBS that's not me but I've been on forums and I love forums and you talked about amen the Bitcoin talk forums I went and read a bunch of your early posts on the what was the name of the like odd retro no no no the the headset one that had TBS 3D yeah exactly your old post there I went and like stalked him just to be like because I like to see the origin oh my God it's fun like what are the like archaeologists for like the internet I like to go find the original and so um you know I saw you posting there and you're like hey I'm trying to build this thing I'm thinking about doing this you did a bunch of like kind of really cool crowdsource stuff I think you even like asked read it like you know should I buy should we buy Vive or something like that you did a bunch of cool stuff on forums and I thought about that and some of them like I when I learned poker I learned it through forums yep if you think about today like if who's the secret the 16 year old version of you today what forums do you think they're hanging out in what's the thing because when you were doing this is 15 years ago like we are still early and you were early early same thing with Bitcoin you were early early and so what do you think are the interesting forums today that people are hanging out in that you think will play out over the next decade or so and and also what are what are what are some of your favorite pockets of the web and and forums that you're hanging out in I mean much to my chagrin I like I love forums too I think they are more or less the Pinnacle of asynchronous communication like if you are doing collaborative products all of the incentives are correct like so so I like I I ran a forum the mod retro forums it was a forum for people who modified vintage game consoles in particular with a focus on turning them into handheld self-contained units so cutting apart Nintendo 64s and super Nintendos and PlayStations and then replacing like the Power Electronics with modern Power Electronics running them off of the latest lithium battery technology although it was nikad back when back when I started started you know working on Portables uh you know putting in LCD screens that were designed for portable DVD players and the like and building these self-contained units and uh it the forums are interesting because your your currency is is attention but you can only get attention by getting people to come in and you know respond and engage with you and so there's a strong incentive to update people on what you're doing to to write really interesting things and to you know get people regularly coming back and engaging with your stuff I mean that's the dopamine high right it's other people care about what I'm doing today it's been so algorithm you know algorithmically driven that you don't have the same incentives in terms of long-term sustained engagement and uh you know collaborating with people there's a lot more incentive to do things on your own do one big push in a form that will cause ordinary people who are not necessarily technically competent to you know watch it for at least three minutes so that it's seen as you watch it long enough and I like I think the pockets which is what you asked like there's great pockets on YouTube there's great pockets on Reddit there's actually a lot of private Facebook groups uh so like one highlight like I'm a member of a of a Night Vision Group where people build their own night vision night vision goggles and it's got a couple thousand people but it's it's a private group and very very much not virally driven uh you know it's not like the tick tock tick tock techno heads it's not like the YouTube techno heads but man I I really miss forums you know mod retro we had a core group of a few thousand active members that were that were doing stuff in the Heyday and we were doing a few a few million page views a month uh and you would you never see those ratios these days you know of of of engagers to to to Watchers one thing that um that uh I thought was actually really interesting I don't know I've interrupt I have to interrupt one last thing I forgot um actually a huge fraction of the people that I hired for Oculus in the early days were volunteer moderators on The Mod retro forums like people always you know they hire their Network right they hire the people that they know that they can trust and that they know are competent and that was my network when I was a teenager it was other it was other loser gamer teenagers on the internet and so we like that like we some of our lead electrical people our lead Hardware people our lead mechatronics people uh we're all people who had been moderators on mod retro in fact the first person I hired for Oculus was was one of the other moderators and I I actually uh sent him a message said hey what are you doing uh what are you doing what are you doing this fall and he said oh I'm I'm starting starting College I said no you're not you're gonna come work for me and I literally I like I told him that on a Friday and I literally drove out in my minivan to pick him up from his mom's house on Monday and he had all his stuff in like four boxes and I picked him up we got in my van and we drove to The Condemned motel that I was living in I mean it was it was it was wild I mean that and that that was that was my network so it's always funny when people are like oh you know your network is your net worth you know look yeah we're you got all the stand for kids you got the ivy kids and we were just a bunch of Internet losers and we did better than any of them you're like um I'm hiring hmd alumni they're like oh is that Harvard Medical no no head mounted display Forum alumni actually the guy that I was hiring uh is his name is Chris dycus and he had never built a head mounted display but he was he was very accomplished on these horribleizing scene consoles and I knew he was very competent I knew exactly like you talk about a job interview where you meet someone for you know whatever they're you know maybe an hour or something but I had been seeing this guy's work published on the Forum over the course of years and so I knew he had I knew he had skills and I knew he had work that's exactly we me and Sean have hired so many people on Twitter and I tell people all the time like I want to get a job I'm like man if you just like you need to post your thoughts so people understand your texture and your tastes and your character like that is significantly better doing it there and then just dming someone and then they're just gonna click their profile oh this person's tweeting all this like interesting Insight that aligns exactly well and that's harder to fake too if you if you have somebody who has a history of building things for themselves of doing things because they want to not because they're getting paid to that you can't fake that the way that you can fake an interview it's easy like oh I'm passionate about X Y and Z well show me your years of work that you've done for no money showing that you really are and I mean we we still hire a lot of people like that at Andrew like uh we we have benefits that are intended to lure people like that like one of our benefits we have is that we will buy anyone in the company any tool they want for their personal projects as well as work projects and that's the type of thing where people who don't have personal projects who just you know they show up to their to their wage machine and they clock in and they clock out they're not attracted by that but the types of people who want to create for the sake of creation those to those people that's a golden ticket on that note we did the same thing my co-founder he's a lot like you like 15 at age 15 started working at a.com during the.com boom it was like you know had a job and it was like what the hell is going on and always was just doing his own thing and so he used to buy um like 3D printers and Robotics and we're building like social apps it's like we didn't need any of this stuff and I was like what are you doing like why are we doing this he's like because hey I want it like I want to come to a space and like when I'm done with work I'm just gonna go downstairs to their lab and I'm gonna build like a drone or I'm gonna like take this Raspberry Pi and like shove it over here and figure something out out and he's like also that's also how we'll get great people like I want to work with other hackers like that who like to Tinker on this stuff and he's like he's like he's like he had had an exit so he's like you know doing very well his last company went public and so he was like you know when I was like 16 18 21 like I just couldn't afford to like the thousand dollar thing that you would need to have he's like I just got lucky that the dude down the street would let me come over and play with his thing and that's like that was like a a life changer of a moment he's like so I just want to do that for people like I just make it free anybody can come in and anybody can use this stuff and he was totally right even though like our CFO was like hey we can't justify this he's like don't worry I'll pay for it all out of pocket and it was like and I know and I know that struggle you know what like and it doesn't even have to be a thousand dollars I mean I remember there were times where the thing I needed it would cost like fifty dollars and it was just like it was it was inconceivable that I could afford it I mean like honestly Oculus owes more to the iPhone than anything else I mean like if the iPhone phone wouldn't have existed there wouldn't have been broken iPhones for me to buy unlock repair and sell on eBay like because I made tens of thousands of dollars as a teenager on that on that side hustle like if if that had not happened then Oculus probably wouldn't exist today that's amazing I want to um ask you a bit about Andrew but before before we get to that what ideas were you pursuing or uh I bet you if you're like us I imagine you have a list of like things that you're contemplating what was what was on that list uh prior to starting Android I know there was like a prison thing and but what what else like were you interested in well what was the prison thing let's start with that one because that one sounds interesting also there were two things I was seriously considering and then one thing that I'm I'm gonna do someday so see studying is off the table right now it's too long term but there were two short-term things that I was looking at uh aside from Android so the three choices were fixed National Security solve obesity or solve incarceration uh and yeah I tried to think about you know what are the ways that I would tackle these issues and the way I solved defense was I wanted to build a defense Products company that upends the incentives that typically exist in the military-industrial complex but the prison one was that I wanted to basically take out the incentives of the private Prison Complex that exists today right now private prison companies are are growing there's more and more people being housed in privately operated prisons they're publicly traded and those companies have a strong incentive to lobby for and and perpetuate laws that incarcerate people for the longest period of time for the least serious crime in other words they don't want murderers and terrorists they want they want non-violent drug offenders who will be in prison for a long time and when they get out of prison they want them to come back and be a repeat customer they want good good tenants they want good occupancy good tenants and and the incentives they've set up with the government where the government pre-pays for these beds the government basically says well we've already paid for the bed so if they're not full then we're not locking up enough people it's a very bad set of incentives so my idea was that I could start a private prison company that would run as a non-profit organization and we would use the tax advantages of that to out-compete private prison companies and more importantly we would have a business model that would incent everybody towards the right set of incentives so what I wanted to do is go to the government and say listen I'll lock up your prisoners but you don't get to pay us up front in fact you can't pay us up front you have to pay us after the person serves their term and then stays out of prison for five years then you're going to pay me and the idea is that now all of a sudden I'm motivated and EV my whole organization is motivated to get people through as quickly as possible release them as quickly as possible and then have them stay out of prison and not return to crime and I mean that would have been that would have been a game changer and it would have been a very attractive business model to these governments that are always you know looking to delay their expenditures the biggest problem that I ran into as I looked into this is it wasn't a technological problem it was a lobbying and marketing and government Affairs problem and it wasn't at a federal level where you can basically convince a handful of people and then achieve success it was going to be this like this Locale by Locale thing where you have a lot of people who depend on prisons for jobs you have a lot of politicians who are very involved in it was and also the deals are not recompeted very often this isn't like Enterprise software where people are always on the lookout for a way to get an edge or move to a new provider that could reduce their costs or risk it's like oh yeah we're going to recompete this deal in 35 years and so it would have been this thing where I I just couldn't have made an impact fast enough and so I've been involved with other people who are making impacts in other ways okay so that was one well you couldn't just have like some Silicon Valley guy wearing like tight jeans and brown shoes like every other sale salesperson sitting down like hey so we'd like to have a conversation about your prisoners we'd like to have your business like you know give me some of your unfortunately not uh yeah yeah unfortunately not and the thing is the people who make the decisions uh would not have benefited from us succeeding so in business like when you're and this is a big we can get into this with Andrew too one of the biggest problems with selling to the government versus uh businesses or private private individuals with with private individuals and businesses you just have to convince them that uh it'll be it'll be a you know that that'll be a good thing for them and then they'll buy them the people who are in charge of purchasing for government they often don't benefit from saving money or reducing their Manpower or any of this thing in many cases the guy in charge of making the buying decision is political power and earning power are directly tied to his ability to keep costs high and to keep Manpower up and to not allow anything to displace that so that was actually the big problem I realized that it's it's nice to think you can solve any problem with with new ideas through disruption but some things are kind of self-reinforcing very hard to fix the the other thing I was looking at is obesity you know obesity is uh is one of if not the leading preventable cause of death in the United States uh either there's so many there's so many other health problems that are the result of obesity and some people say that we need to make exercise more popular some people say that we need to stop normalizing obesity some people say we need medical treatment for it or we need to make eat healthy eating better I took a pretty cynical view of it I said no obesity is not going away unless you let American people eat whatever they want whenever they want as much as they want with no Lifestyle Changes no exercise and absolutely no effort on their parts whatsoever and So within that constraint what could you do to to solve this issue and uh the the the result the the idea I came on was uh long chain hydrocarbon based synthetic food so in other words oil-based Foods uh you guys are familiar with impossible Burger Beyond Burger have you had them yeah yeah so I mean it was probably better than the worst beef burger you've ever had right it was at least at that level it's better than the worst one you've ever had yeah it was a whatever I'll eat this yeah whatever really it is but certainly not up to the level of the best beef burger you've ever had no and and so one of the one of the interesting this is where I was drawing from outside you know an outside world all these people trying to make fake food they're all trying to build fake food out of food and I said well wait let's think of this from first principles if I'm a materials engineer and I'm trying to solve the set of problems that a fake Burger manufacturer is trying to solve you know how it feels in your mouth how it comes apart in your mouth how it how it Sears how it Cooks how it changes texture when it's cooked if I was a chemical or material engineer trying to build let's say it's not food just us you know a paste a substance with a certain set of of parameters what am I going to use is it is it beans is it chickpeas is it corn no of course not I'm going to use oil because man is a master of oil we can make it in anything waxes gels solids anything in between rubbers pastes we can do anything with oil we can make it into truly anything with almost any material properties that we want and so I said well let's leverage that let's leverage everything we know about making inert hydrocarbons that are non-toxic and use that to make fake food for people that tastes and feels like real food but has zero caloric value that cannot be absorbed by your body it just goes right through you just like fiber and this is not that crazy Taco but Diet Coke for uh yeah yeah that exists dude it's called The White Castle uh but you're I mean yeah you're just saying like the diet coke cheeseburger yes Diet Coke cheeseburger the diet coke cheese the diet you know the the diet coke dairy products and so I actually started making prototypes of this and I was messing around with uh frying foods and mineral oil uh with with high flash points because mineral oil also no calories I made some paraffin based cheese so it's basically like paraffin wax based fake cheese product that you could still make grilled cheese sandwiches with and it tasted great but at almost no calories um it was there were a few other wild things that came with I also built a device that injected uh soda syrup through a stream onto your tongue directly as carbonated water flowed over it because it turns out you can only detect it's a weird perceptual thing people think of optical illusions as as you know the the main type of Illusion that's out there but there's also physical Illusions like if you if you put putting in your mouth your body assumes that the full mass of the pudding is comprised of whatever is touching your tongue but if you can create a physically structured Foods where the part that's touching your tongue is different than the bulk of the rest of the material your body still thinks that the entire bulk of it is whatever's touching your tongue anyway dude for a while what does your house look like well I mean it it's a little more boring now um but at the time uh when when I was acquired by Facebook I moved up to the Bay area and we had about 10 people living in a 13 000 square foot home that was built in the 30s on six acres and so we turned the dining room into a machine shop we turned uh we we turned the there was like a like a ballroom for dancing and we turned that into an assembly area and and and Welding welding room I mean we had a soft goods room in a sunny area as someone does it was true I don't even know what that means what are soft goods that was just like um so like cream cheese I mean like the traditional example when people talk like a soft goods engineer would be like uh like tennis shoes bras um uh you know things that are incorporating fabrics and also apply or think you know like uh like a tennis a tennis racket is is is an example of soft good engineering where you've got you know the handle and the shock absorption and all that but in our case it was for head mounted display stuff um so like head mounted display straps the fat the fabric associated with it um we also were you know we're also cosplayers so we were also building our building our anime costumes there so a lot of soft good stuff the more you talk the more I realize you uh you do the one thing that we celebrate the most on this podcast because they're like people are like I don't get it like you and Sam you do a certain style of Entrepreneurship right for example I optimize for just I want it to be me and one other dude I don't want any employees I don't want to go to an office and I just want Max leverage and I'm not trying to be a billionaire I don't want to raise money I want to own the whole thing and just do it my way on whatever projects are fun and um but then sometimes we'll celebrate like the you and Elon Musk of the world that are going huge and sometimes we celebrate this dude who's making this Chrome extension he makes 20K a month and lives in you know Bali and he's having fun and so people don't get it they're like what do you respond do you admire like I get it TechCrunch admires this thing and VCS admire this thing but you guys seem to be across the board and we're like we like people that just Define the win Define winning on their terms and then like actualize it so like you having a house with 13 other people that does that has like you know an assembly room and a soft goods room and whatever it seems like you're living your best life in that state maybe 100 the weird thing about what I get to do now like these these all sound you know like like fun things but I'm still getting to do that and like Android we have all kinds of stuff like that going on actually the the tough thing is the coolest things that we're doing here I can't even necessarily talk about because the most successful projects that are doing the cooling going in the coolest directions are the ones that that we have to keep kind of uh on wraps oh I have to say on petroleum food just in case anyone's wondering why I didn't do that um one I thought National Security would would be a better use of my time and that was because I realized uh Tech was that National Security was a technological problem in addition to being a lobbying and marketing problem and sales problem um the the problem with petroleum Foods is that it was not sustainable if using new oil as a feedstock um it would just it would consume too much uh and the good news is you can recycle hydrocarbons but then I mean if you I don't know if you can see where this is going but it means you're going to literally be like centrifuging oil out of of the sewer system and then reusing it to construct new food and I realized have you seen all the media coverage of Pinks pink slime at McDonald's and that's just like I saw it but it looks kind of gross do you think people want to buy food that's literally remanufactured from sewage you know that that was kind of the main problem I said you know what I'm I'm pretty good at marketing and sales I am not good enough to sell sewer food to people yeah you you sound I need to figure that out you sound like you're a bad guy in Batman if you're like yeah he's going through the sewers and recycling it turning it into food it's like it's almost too good of a story right like like I under sometimes I think the media is unfair but it's like could you expect them to not you know sensationalize literally a guy who's who's selling reprocessed sewage as food like it's like they have to cover it in a sensational way and I can't even blame them for it and I decide I would rather work in an area where technological Improvement would be the main way that you would compete we didn't need to you know do crazy marketing you just had to be competent and be better than all of the other players which was not necessarily that high of a bar I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better do you uh you talked about the media for a second and I when I was doing research I was like you know there's this great Silicon Valley Post that's called like the hands of time of social media of of media in Silicon Valley it's like it starts at noon and it's like you're born you know nobody's ever heard of you then at one you're like emerging at three you're like the star everybody loves you and it like goes and then it Cycles all the way back to midnight and it's like you're evil uh you're ruining society and you like destroy democracy and whatever else and this happens with every hot company and every hot founder whatever and when I was looking at your media coverage to do research it's all like this is the boy wonder he's 19 years old he's making virtual reality real he's doing this out of his Garage in his house or whatever and then it turns into like this guy is like you know the Maga super evil guy he's getting fired by Facebook and then it's like the defense stuff so you've seen kind of both sides of the media machine does that make you kind of jaded like where do you trust the media today and like how do you think about you know the media well there's an interesting quote that people often misuse from the Nolan Batman movies uh you either die a hero or live see yourself live long enough to become the villain and a lot of people misunderstand that they think that it means you start out as a hero and then eventually descend into into being uh you know a bad guy and they look at Harvey Dent and they they think that's the moral but that's not what was what what Harvey Dent was saying Harvey Dent had actually always been a kind of crooked power seeking political type what what he was saying is that he had always been the same person fighting for the same ideals and that he just lived long enough to see the world change around him that so that people started saying that what he was was a villain you know he didn't say that you become the villain used literacy to see yourself become the villain in the eyes of everyone else and I I feel like I've definitely been through been through that uh been through that a little bit I mean it's worth noting I'm not inclined to dislike the media naturally a lot of people assume that that must be the case I I don't know if you know this I was a journalism major at Cal State Long Beach I was actually the online editor of the of the school paper the daily 49er so I I by no meat like there was a time where I thought I was going to go into a career in Tech journalism and so I I never really had had any issues with it um as a as you know I thought it was a very a very honorable thing to do you know to go out and be the guy who dig digs and gets the truth and lets people know what's going on that they otherwise would not have the ability or the time to suss out themselves uh and then unfortunately I've had quite a few experiences with the media it's like do I trust the media it's like well I mean I've had like literally dozens of major Outlets post literally fabricated quotes from me uh literally literally like things that never happened uh they said they all we did all these terrible things that just never even happened and then refused to correct them for years on end so it's one of those people like oh Palmer why do you attack the media it's like I don't know like there's not any real way to to get to get around this I mean like we're not talking about tiny Outlets like the New York Times posted a quote for me that I literally never said and I I told them like hey you you said that I said this I never said that they said well it's it's it's it's more or less what you said we don't think the meeting is different and I was like yeah but your your ethics guide I know I know what it is I was taught the New York Times style guide when I was in journalism school it doesn't it doesn't say you get to quote me and paraphrase me and you think that it is it doesn't mean anything different and then of course everyone re-quotes their fake quote you're like I don't think a quote means what you think it means you know you're like those those like you know those little signs in the paper that say it's a quote that means something different than what than what you guys are saying well I explained to them I said I said your quote for me is literally missing six of the words that I said but you have it in quotes with a period And I I never said that um and it was actually it was there was no period because it was part of a longer run-on argument I was making that that did not even have a period there and they're like oh well we don't think it really changes the meaning so just without belaboring the point uh I think you you can't you can't trust the media to to uh you can't trust the media to do the right thing and if you do you're probably gonna get burned at some point it worked for me for a while uh until it didn't what does um what does Andrew do and what made you realize that the the the the approach to solve that problem was the approach that you picked because that seems like such a grand I mean I understand the high level of what you do but it's so Grand that I think well like Oculus was fairly Grand but I kind of get that you can kind of Tinker in your garage and come up with a Nifty product and whatever and like No One's Gonna like get hurt really and it's like a pretty simple process hard but simple Andrew I'm like oh my God I don't even know where to start I mean I get I've seen the movie with Jonah Hill where he's like a war dog or whatever it's called where he like buys and sell weapons and I'm like is that what Android does yeah yeah I'm like is that what Android does and how on Earth does even a rich guy who's 28 in his apartment or his big house come up with this this is crazy like who do you call you call like hey uh Hey Brock I was thinking you know maybe we could try this like MVP you know what I mean I don't even know how you start that I mean it's tough and it is such a big problem and so unapproachable that very few people do approach it I mean like but very big picture anderol is trying to build the next major defense prime meaning we were the prime contract holder we're not a subcontractor to existing primes like Lockheed Martin or Raytheon or Northrop Grumman or Boeing and uh you know I 80 percent of the US defense budget goes to just a handful of companies these big primes that just completely dominate the industry and they get paid on what's called a Cost Plus basis they get paid for their time materials fixed percentage of profit on top which means that they're incentivized to move slowly they actually make more money when they come up with more expensive systems more money when they sell more of something more money when it even breaks more often because they get to sell more parts for it I mean it's it's a really bizarre Contracting system that we created in World War II to basically take over the U.S war machine or sorry the US industrial machine turn it into a war machine because companies like Ford were saying hey I can't even quote you what it's going to cost to make a tank because I've never really you know this has never really been my business and uh they said okay fine we'll pay you whatever it costs and then a fixed percentage of profit on top to make sure that you are able to keep running your business and then unfortunately we just kept doing that uh even though we were no longer in an existential War mode and so in the last 35 years since the end of the Cold War the government had completely lost its ability to grow small defense companies into large defense accounts companies I mean you know Samuel Colt went from working in his tiny garage Workshop to arming the entire Western world that's that's that's what we used to be able to do you could start small and get big if you had the best stuff but in the last 35 years there were only two unicorns before anderol in the defense space and 35 years not just being chosen arbitrarily it's basically since the end of the Cold War during the Cold War we did turn small defense companies into into major players but since then it's palantir SpaceX both founded by billionaires and then nobody else that's it and so it it's so hard to get in you know Founders say I have no idea how I could possibly start a defense company so they don't start a defense company uh Venture capitalists say I'm not going to invest in a defense company there's no examples of success in the last 35 years less the billionaires who can do anything I'm sure they could have done whatever they wanted with their billions and so the VCS don't want to invest in it and this is and then smart employees don't want to go work at defense startups because they look at the landscape they say look this might be a cool lifestyle business but it's never going to grow to a scale where the equity that I'm given is a significant is a significant way to generate money for me and my family and so I I said man you know if that's really what it takes uh it really if it really does take lots and lots of money and lots and lots of influence and really smart people that I'm in a position to start a company that very few people are very few Founders have experience running a multi-billion dollar company with thousands of employees Mass manufacturing millions of pieces of hardware and are and are willing to give up the Adoration of their peers in the media like that was actually probably the most important factor if I would have just left Oculus by retiring on my own it would have been much harder for me to go into an area like building weapons for the us and our allies because so many people got so angry about it you friends that I had who didn't want to talk to me anymore investors who said that not only would we never make money but that what we were doing was morally reprehensible and wrong and you know I was trying to explain to people listen we live in a world where our major strategic adversaries are rapidly building advanced technology that has no peer here in the United States war machine uh major conflict is imminent in Asia in Europe with a lot of our strong allies and partners and we need to be ready not just to win those Wars the goal is not to win Awards to deter a war from happening in the first place and if we don't have the tools we need to deter them then war is inevitable and you guys probably remember how things were you know I guess bat you bought five or six years ago it was very very popular to believe that we're at the end of history and that peace is too profitable for anyone to rock the boat and that that was the thing that would keep everybody in line I think that Russia invading Ukraine finally woke up a lot of people to realize that history is not over land borders are not fixed and uh like I mean look how Wild it is that Europe is still buying billions of dollars of goods from Russia even as Russia literally invades Europe I mean like that's that's how that's how screwed they are and I think people people did not see this a few years ago and I felt I felt a little bit like a crazy person um and if I'll ramble on one more thing you've probably heard me say this before elsewhere but it could be that you know your your viewers haven't had heard me say us I'll say it again you know we're living in the first time in U.S history where the most Innovative powerful and large technology companies in our country refuse to work with the military that's never been the case our most powerful companies have always understood that they had a responsibility to Aid with National Security but now I mean whether you're talking about Google or in particular Apple I mean Apple's got 95 of their Manufacturing in China uh they agreed to invest they've invested hundreds of billions of dollars in manufacturing capacity there they've agreed to invest a further 275 billion dollars in Chinese Manufacturing in exchange for being allowed to operate as an independent company in China instead of being nationalized into a joint venture majority owned by China I mean they they they're in a position where if they do anything to upset the Chinese government the one person in China could sign one piece of paper that would wipe out the most powerful company in the entire world instantly a two trillion dollar company like they they are not masters of their own destiny not by any means and I I guess I want to stress this because it's never been the case in history and that had me terrified you know I five years ago I could see we were on the precipice of war with Advanced Powers who had fully suppressed our most advanced technology companies through economic tools and you know if I I don't understand why more people were not scared by that but I felt like I couldn't do anything that was more important than starting Andrew all to start help solving that problem and thanks for letting me ramble for so long on that I know that was a long ramble but I've got a lot a lot of emotion all built up inside on it no I mean that's why we wanted you on is to hear what you're doing and why and you also flipped at like the common denominator with either the prison thing the food the oil-based Foods or this is that you kind of looked at it from another angle and also so maybe flip the incentives to the cost structure so what you were saying was let's say with the prison thing you wanted to be incentivized to keep people out of prison rather than in prison for as long as possible exactly sounds like for Andrew sounds so simple right yeah it sounds like it is simple but it's not easy yeah yeah and well and it sounds like what you ran into there was the incentive uh for the local official who you know um who decides on these things may have been to have a bigger budget and not a smaller budget and so you know your incentives were sort of clashing right whereas and he doesn't and he doesn't have to say I'm not buying your thing because my incentives are wrong you'd be like oh we've done an assessment of all the vendors and this one really has a lot more experience and we don't want to take a risk on a new vendor it could literally be that simple he people like oh but how would they justify the business model you know it would be so much better it's like he doesn't have to like you you can just be like nope I I too at risk and so what's the business model with Andrew because you're not doing Cost Plus you're doing something else and um that company I mean we work the way it's not even a revolutionary business model it's the way every tech company works you use your own money you build a product you make it work and then you go to customers and you sell it to them and that is a very hard thing to do in the defense space but we've basically bet that we will be able to pick the right things to work on that will be able to find the right Partners in government to help tell us what we should be investing our own money in ahead of time and that in the end when it works that we'll be able to sell most of the time to the government now there will be times where we get screwed there will be times where we don't build things that work and uh you know and it's our own money that we've earned instead of taxpayers but on the whole we're very incentivized to be efficient we don't wanted things to drag out we don't want to drag it out to be a 10-year r d program on a Cost Plus basis when we can get it done in six months with some really really smart ideas and so we've got the right incentives and we're basically out there trying to convince the Department of Defense and politicians that this is the way that all defense companies should be working everyone should live in fear looking over their own shoulder knowing that if they fail that they're the ones who are going to get screwed not taxpayers so when you get a contract that's like we got a 900 million dollar contract that's after you've already produced the product and they're basically just agreeing to buy the goods at that point is that what that means in your case yeah I mean when we recently just won a billion dollar contract with Socom Special Operations uh command uh to do all of their counter drone work so basically protecting like building the hardware and software that is defending them from uh from drones that are attacking their installations and positions and we started working on our counter drone system using all of our own money years and years ago before we had any customer we just we started building the hardware and the software building our interceptors building our Jammers and uh then we it was after we invested a ton of our own money and proved that this was the right way to solve the problem that we were able to go and actually there was a full competition for who they were going to select for this and they did basically a shoot off between all these different companies and some of the companies that we beat were actually getting paid by the government to develop their systems using government money but we had invested quite a bit more money and moved much faster and there were literally contractors that were complaining saying this isn't fair we have to compete with Andrew and they've been investing their own money for years how could we possibly be expected to compete when the government's only given us you know tens of millions of dollars over the course of the last two years and I I'm like guys like of course this is how it works like you could have won if you had spent your own money if you had spent your own money for five years you probably would be able to compete with us on an even playing field but you can't take no risk and expect all of the reward and we spent a lot less than these companies developing much better capabilities because we have the right incentives so you're you're I think you're 30 years old so you're we're all about the same age you're sitting there with just turned 30 a few weeks ago well happy birthday you're sitting there in a Hawaiian T-shirt with a goatee I you're probably the type of dude who walks around barefooted all the time and you're talking about Cosplay and yet you just said we just won a billion dollar contract from the government how do you work up like the the huevos the confidence to think like I'm gonna go in against all these gray-haired suits and like they're gonna the government's eventually gonna take me seriously and I'm gonna sell this uh sell this thing I mean or do you have people selling on your behalf but like that that's just a reach for me to understand some people think that I should that I should dress differently and try to kind of you know appeal to the government sensibilities and like you know I should be addressing in a suit and I should be very very straight laced and you'll be very very serious all the time but I think that one of the most important things that Andrew is doing is not just Building Technology ourselves but it's inspiring other companies to work in defense not just company like inspiring companies that aren't in defense to Pivot and defense and inspiring people to start new defense companies and if they see me like becoming a boring guy who's who's you know has to make himself super lame to sell to the government that's not a lifestyle that they're going to want to lead you know and so we need to show that they can be successful and show them that it's that it's going to be fun now I also want to keep uh wearing flip-flops in the Hawaiian shirts so maybe I'm maybe this is just you know post facto justification no I'm on board everyone a disservice if I were to change yeah I think it's working now you know we uh the podcast is all about the future we're always brainstorming ideas opportunities uh but none of that matters if there's not really a future if this is about to become World War III and there's nukes flying everywhere so you're kind of uh a lot more in the loop than any guest that we've ever had on this what's gonna happen here is this what are the odds of like you know this sort of Ukraine Russia conflict breaking out into something a lot more serious and like you know is there going to be a nuclear weapon you know in our near future so I mean it's very hard to predict there's people who are better at this than me like what I always tell people is like our role is to build the tools and then you have to trust in democracy to deploy them correctly and people think oh you know when would you stop supplying weapons to you you Ukraine and you know is there a point where you'd be too you know where you where you think that we should or you would make sure that you're not part of a nuclear escalation and I say listen if you believe in democracy at all then you should not want U.S foreign policy to be dictated by the ever-changing whims of Technology Executives like what an extraordinarily dangerous precedent to set that you know you'll build weapons for the people you are politically aligned with and then you'll suddenly drop it uh despite the uh like what it really is is I will sell to the people of the U.S state department and the usdod want me to like if that that because they have information that I don't they have uh intelligence that I do not and I cannot second guess that and say oh you know I I would stop supplying if I I thought there was this level of escalation but with that out of the way I think that we are going to see a tactical nuke get used uh and for people who are not familiar with the difference tactical nuclear weapons are designed for tactical use as part of a battle uh for basically conventional Warfare tactics so blowing up uh you're blowing up uh an Armored Division or taking out a wing of bombers or maybe even destroying an Airfield strategic nuclear weapons are used to deter Mass nuclear exchange and to engage in you know strategic level annihilation of cities and the like uh the United States disassembled all of our tactical nuclear weapons a long time ago we decided that our wart Doctrine did not allow for tactical nukes nukes are only something you use at a strategic level to deter other people from using them against you that is not the case for Russia Russia has tactical nuclear weapons if they train to use them they it is part of their doctrine that they will use them in conventional conflict and they are at like even just having that in their Doctrine shows that to some degree they are willing to bet that the United States and nobody else would respond with strategic nuclear weapons in response to use of a tactical nuclear weapon and uh if some people say oh even saying that they'll use a nuke is akin to supporting Russia and saying we shouldn't support Ukraine I'm not saying that at all I think actually appeasement has the the longer that they're actually the greater risk I mean if you can show if you show to the world that if you show to a world that even the threat of small-scale tactical nuclear weapons is enough to deter any kind of intervention in any kind of con in any kind of conventional Warfare you actually hugely incentivize the nations of the world to obtain their own tactical nuclear weapons like you you you don't really actually want the calculus to tip that way where countries look and say wow all Russia had to do was threaten to use their tactical nukes and then they were allowed to operate with impunity in a conventional Invasion and nobody was willing to stop to do anything about it or even stop buying their exports like that that's the that that would be a very very bad precedent to set even Beyond this war and so for that reason I I think this is a little contrarian and not everyone agrees but I think that the odds of a tactical nuclear weapon are very high it will not be used on the United States it will not be used on a NATO Ally it'll probably be a tactical nuclear weapon used to strike some inarguably military Target like it probably they're not gonna they're not gonna nuke cave uh it's much more likely that it would be a port or a you know or an errand relation or something like that and the reason I like to talk about this is I want people to get comfortable with this because there's this idea that you know you use it you use it you use a nuclear weapon and all of a sudden you're in World War Three uh I think that's actually probably the wrong the wrong way to look at it because if you do that you're tacitly admitting that tactical nuclear weapons deserve a strategic nuclear level response and if you set that up as you know the nice lubricated path we all slide down yeah things are really bad this sounds like selfish and trite but I I think I it's important to me and I bet it's important to a lot of people what does that mean for me uh a a wealthy American with money in the stock market who lives in a nice life like does that mean that like uh inflation's Gonna Get huge does that mean that my investments are going to go down does that mean that like people I know I don't know anyone in Ukraine so I care about them but like does that mean people I know are gonna get hurt what does that mean for me it's a fair question you know I'm in a different position I know I know people who are from Ukraine I know people are in Ukraine so for me it also it does get a little bit personal and we have employees here who are who are deeply deeply you know involved in one way or another with the people of Ukraine um but I think mostly you need to boil it now not to necessarily A Ukraine specific question but the broader geopolitical question is the United States the world police are we going to help our allies and to what extent and I'm not saying that necessarily means that we need to throw ourselves into World War III over every conflict but we do need to very carefully weigh like what what will happen in Taiwan if we completely pull that like there's a million ways to tackle this so I'm not trying to set up a straw man here but I'll throw out one that is actually very popular with certain politicians they say we should completely pull out we should not engage this is not our problem let the let the ex-soviet guys duke it out they can do whatever they want well one there the first issue is uh our European allies are going to be in pretty bad shape if they have Russia right on their border able to move deep deep deep into Europe without any kind of buffer more importantly what do you think China is going to do if they see that that's the United States attitude they say wow like there there is a price they will not pay uh there is there is a certain level they are not willing to get engaged at if we can raise the cost above that level then they will make the short-term decision to not get engaged age that's very dangerous for Taiwan which is in turn very dangerous for semiconductors and for our entire economy like I If Taiwan actually gets invaded by China you could see a 30 or 40 percent drop in the stock market beyond what we've already seen like that's not even that's not even a that's not even a a crazy assumption that's like a pretty well backed up by all of the the boring establishment economics guys uh prediction so that that the way that I see it is your question why should I care because if we want to maintain credibility as a player that can deter Wars not just win Wars then we have to take actions that maintain our credibility there if we if if we were to say the ultimate version of the screws you're on your own world we're all and we're going to do our own thing uh we're going to get screwed by that very very quickly and so there's something between zero engagement and you know D-Day 2.0 that we have to do this is a great uh Palmer where can people find you if they want to go work at Andrew or you know read more your stuff your blog your Twitter where should people follow you or find you if they like this oh man well my my my my handle my handle across social media is Palmer Tech um but on you can find me on Twitter under the handle Palmer lucky uh there's my website palmerlucky.com the number one Palmer lucky blog on the internet and I'm covered is also press sites I'm coming for you oh well hey mine's wordpressed too great tool yeah someone just tell me about Palmer lucky69.com he's is this new project he's working on yeah it's got a lot of Promise oh man I gotta check this out that sounds right up my alley oh wait wait do you want to rip a WWE style promo at Jason calicanis who's coming after you he's challenges you to a fight why would you challenge a guy who builds weapons for a living to a fight I don't understand this but if you want to rip a WWE style promo this is this is the place there are 100 000 entrepreneurs ready to back you here if you can get them on your side I mean maybe this is because I all like look I'm I don't know if you can tell like I'm actually a pretty big guy like I weigh about 250 pounds I'm six feet tall um like I it's kind of I understand the mechanics of fighting well enough and I've done enough of it recreationally to understand that it's unlikely that somebody who's like you know five foot five and 140 pounds is gonna it's good it's gonna have a a good shot but I the thing is I don't I'm not a I'm not a physical violence kind of guy I I think it's weird to be like oh yeah you know you you you you you you you don't like me well I could beat you in in hand-to-hand combat it's like well I mean maybe but like your ideas are still bad it doesn't it one does one doesn't solve the other um so no I unfortunately I don't think I'll be throwing I don't think I'll be throwing down the gauntlet beyond beyond noting that just you statistically speaking you know if you just look at the fights between people of of one bulk versus another yeah there's a there's a clear Trend yeah dude is this the most Silicon Valley call out ever I know the mechanics of fighting physics is on my side yeah you know I mean for people who are listening and don't know the very short version is Jason calacanus said a bunch of really awful stuff about me for for years starting back in 2016 what you know when he said that I'm a terrible person that I don't care about my family or my I think he said Palmer lucky is a complete who doesn't care about his employees or his families or his friends uh and then you know Palmer's an idiot he's a Zuckerberg should fire him get rid of him what a useless waste of space then not get fired he celebrates it over and over oh man I'm so glad that fire Obama what a terrible loser et cetera et cetera anyway then he just didn't then he just didn't talk to me for years never reached out and then he invites me to go speak it uh on his podcast and then at his conference so I went there and I I basically just told people I'm like I can't believe Jason invited me it's only because I've clawed my way back to having a second unicorn before the age of 30. like this guy treated me like total garbage for years he's never apologized he spread a bunch of lot even insult Society spread a bunch of lies about me and then uh at the com and I said hey here look at all this he said about me like yeah you had like a he was like a snapback it was amazing yeah and then uh and I did that at the end of my talk about you know basically the future of conflict and particularly the war in Ukraine and then at the conference he said that he was sorry if he said anything that offended me but then when he put my video up he said actually I take it back everything that I said was accurate and I don't regret exactly what I said about him um and I was and so now people people keep hitting him up like you guys need to bury the hatchet you know me in the middle I'm like I didn't do anything like you you can't meet him like you're right maybe maybe I don't care about my family but you know we can admit I I care about my friends let's meet in the middle it's like no no that's not gonna happen uh anyway so now now Jason's saying that he can that he can beat me up uh on and he's uh and and you know look maybe he could but the odds don't seem in his face I do think he trains Jiu Jitsu so that you know he does have that going for him if I recall correctly hey you know I I I did I did Karate one time when I was a kid well now it's been wild for me because I mean my whole career I've been uh my my whole career I've been a whiz kid you know it's like the Palmer lucky value proposition is wow look at that guy he's improbably successful given his age and now it's just look at Palmer he's yeah he's successful I guess you know 30. yeah I don't really want to agree with you anything and also uh you know I find Jason very entertaining I like uh I don't know him personally very well or anything but but you know he's entertaining but he also I think was totally wrong in this uh circumstance I remember when I first heard him say all that I looked up I was like man Palmer must have well actually called you Parker lucky I was like oh man this Parker lucky that's right this Plucky little guy must have done something really messed up and then I saw what was actually done and I saw the coverage and I was like oh he he donated ten thousand dollars to you know like this thing or whatever you know you you were right whatever but Jason is out there saying he says Palmer's paying Trump supporters yeah yeah yeah yeah extreme Terror trolling he said not quite violent but close to it and he's posting anti-semitic memes and misogynistic hate attacks it's like dude it was nine thousand dollars to a billboard like you've you've given a heck of a lot more yet to spicier political stuff than that you know in a political cause or a political donation it's nothing like you know I think that's one of the big one of the big hypocrisies it's not as mainstream as you can get the hypocrisy of Silicon Valley is like it's all about open-mindedness unless you disagree with us unless you unless you believe in the thing I don't agree with then how dare you believe that you know how dare you support that candidate I don't like how dare you you know that half the country you know votes for whatever it's one of the great hypocrisy so so it's so foreign to me too because I mean like one of my best friends is a socialist I like we we very we strongly disagree politically but like running Oculus I was never I I like I had my political beliefs but they were like one percent of my time I'm thinking 99 of it was on VR in my company and it's it's it's actually very funny where like I there was a story recently said you know Palmer Palmer lucky you know uh a very outspoken Republican I'm like I mean I've literally tweeted about politics two times in eight years like yeah I'm not outspoken by any means but to them it means like oh there was this story years ago where he privately donated not using his name and that means he's an outspoken Republican and you know imagine if people were like Mark Zuckerberg outspoken Democrat does X like yeah autocorrect would be like you must have made a mistake the sentence doesn't get typed yeah I mean that but that that's the best part about anderol is that like I have my political beliefs like our CEO Brian shib uh he's he's very much a Democrat uh and we have a huge mix of people at anderol across the entire political spectrum and what we've done is said listen we we might not agree on everything but we agree on the importance of National Security we agree that the United States needs to have the tools that deter Russia China and other aggressors from getting into fights with our partners and allies and we agree that we can save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year while we make tens of billions of dollars a year and if we agree on those things we need to put aside the differences and you'll focus on what's what's the same and I think that's been a really healthy company company culture like a lot of other companies you know they'll they want to take one political side of the other and we've been very clear no we are not a politically uh oriented company we are a mission oriented company and to the extent like if a republican does something that's bad for our mission we're going to push back on it if a Democrat does something that is bad for our mission we're going to push back on it but it needs to be about our ability to you know defend the West not our you know our personal opinions on how the country should be run so that's that's I I highly encourage people to set that to set that tone when they're starting their own companies if you want to be able to attract people from all over the country all over the world of all different political Persuasions because if you pick a side you're you're alienating huge swaths of people not just the people who disagree with you but also people who don't want to be at a company that's partisan and might not even care one way or the other I I know there's a lot of people here like look I don't I don't even really have a strong political set of beliefs but I do know I don't want to work in a place where that's the thing that drives all our decisions you're like oh we got the office socialist just walking around giving away snacks it's awesome it's great you need a diverse workplace like this this is awesome dude you're awesome man I'm that's right I'm so pumped that uh you came on uh this is this is this has been amazing I would love you to come on again well hey I have to bring up one more thing I have to bring up one more thing I so I I get a chance to bring something up fine good I I we we we we we we got we got to talk about the the Tweet you made where you said that uh there's no way that there's any billionaires out there that actually fly coach and don't fly right oh yes good you have got a good Henry do you do you fly coach oh you you do fly coach you said that you're an idiot what are you doing Jacob was right I mean so so I I the reason I wanted to chat about it is because yeah I think I responded I told you like hey you're wrong like I I actually do I don't fly private I do fly coach uh for me it's it's a it's a it's a reason thing where uh we we with exceptions for long-term like long long international travel we only cover coach travel for our employees it's like look it's only a few hours like it is a very bad use of company money for us to be buying business or first class for people because we have so much travel at the company we could easily spend a very serious fraction of our of our of our resources on just people traveling in slightly better seats and so and it's especially especially bad when it's like oh am I really going to pay you to like you know fly business class for three hours to a place where you're then going to like sweat it out in the desert for for a week like you know it's only yeah so you and your coach seats better than the desert you and your wife or your girlfriend or whatever if you're going to Europe you're going to fly coach even when I use my own money I fly coach and people say well why don't you just fly first class why don't you fly business and here's why because I expect my employees to fly coach and even like yes I have a lot of money but it's if I don't also do it it feels like I'm out of touch or I don't know what it's like or you know oh it's easy for you to say that we should fly coach because you don't have to do it because you happen to have a bunch of money and so for for me a lot of is setting example like look it's not actually that bad I am willing to do it even when I pay for my own travel uh because that's just not that bad and so don't you have like people who want to like kill you or like hurt you I mean aren't you like uh I mean like like you've got the whole anti-trump crowd who sees you you and they're like go f yourself and then now you're like dealing with Lockheed Martin and stuff surely they want to like kneecap you you got your your I don't know what you're talking about Fanatics yeah you got Jason like something's gonna happen you know what I mean like surely like there's like some type of security risk also I maybe you have life insurance or something like that if they're gonna insure you I'd be like dog you're doing you're you gotta have this a security person with you or you gotta like have someone with you like surely there's some type of security risk where you got to think like Beyond just like hey guys I'm in solitude with you on this flight like I get it like I mean surely there's some type of like you're totally you're you're you're totally right and I I mean it depends on the trip where the trip is and what I'm doing and like I I make sure to keep myself safe um and I probably don't want to get into the specifics because you know like you said there's people out there who who are not fans of me and like you you mentioned you know Jason calacanus and the Trump people but like what about the Mexican cartels that we've cost hundreds of Millions of dollars in drug trade what about you know all the people who have been foiled in attacks on U.S military forces because of our stuff and you know like there's actually a long list of people who are more who are scarier than Jason calcanus if you can believe it um but uh yeah look you you you're right that to some degree that that's a worry but I also think that in general if someone's going to come to kill me it's probably going to be a place where they know I'm going to be and there's there's actually much higher like to me the high-risk place is actually not on a on a flight in the secure Zone yeah it's not on Southwest in the secure zone of an airport uh like there's actually it's actually probably more likely to be the restaurants I go to too much um but anyway I guess I want to explain that's why I do it if I'm gonna ask my employees to do it I need to do it too even when it's my own money even when it's my own cost because otherwise you are like you but you become an out it's not just that I appear out of touch I would literally be out of touch maybe one day coach gets so bad that I tell everyone guys you know what I hear you we're all all go in business now but I think I think today is not that day you're crazy I've agreed with everything you've said except for that you are crazy yeah no I'm actually glad you said this because I was feeling like man this guy's great he's funny he's smart he's just really big thinker I'm glad you have something you're totally wrong about it makes me feel so much better in this interview that's a great service you did for everybody here by just having this absolute nonsense policy for yourself you know like if I go get you if I'm the guy who flies to go get that billion dollar contract and I'm flying back you know in the in the c-zone of Southwest I'm riding the next day at work I'm telling you I love the I love the back of the plane on the window no but nobody bothers you you can get on you can let everybody get off the plane before you do you don't have to fight anybody you just you know let everyone know what what is that I gotta throw this in my great my grandpa was a pilot for United Airlines for over 40 years and so I also grew up around commercial airlines and so this might be another thing like to me there is a certain Romanticism to like Mass Market Mass available air travel like what an incredible thing and we did it America did it we figured out how to make it economically viable and we build everyone else's airplanes like it is an American thing and so I even when you're on everyone else's planes they're mostly made by Americans and the ones that are made by Europeans were made with American Technology so I I uh look I I also like I think feet are gross you're into coach I think coaches grossful yeah to each their own and I think we'll leave it at that agree to disagree with their own no look I uh I disagree with that opinion but I respect it like hell and I respect you you're the best man I would love for you to come on if you want like in a few weeks a few months whenever and talk some more about ideas you're uh I'm a fan of yours so this feels really cool that you're here maybe we thank you I appreciate that this this has been a lot of fun we covered some good ground today yes and maybe we've suckered you into becoming friends with us so if you ever want you could DS DM us on Twitter we come up hobies who knows I don't know maybe we'll invite each other over and hang out you can show us a thing or two I don't know we'll see what happens but uh this has been awesome come on come on come on down anytime all right right sweet thank you so much all right see you guys later [Music]

there's a new era and I'm not part of it and that's kind of how I that's a little bit how I feel when I see this and I don't how do you feel when you see this and how do you intend to kind of like Get Your Hands you know we're a bunch of scheming greedy you know people how are you going to get your hands on this how you going to get your your stick and paws in this [Music] game okay this is the AI episode it's all AI everything is AI um I was mind blown I would say that's the right word like to me this is the biggest holy [ __ ] moment I've had when it's come to when it comes to technology of seeing what's going on in AI um for you you got emotional which is a strange response I think I'm more emotional than you are I think I like I get touched more than you do uh let me give the background really quick so it's a company called play. HT um but they and one of their side projects is a thing called podcast. a and basically what they did was they gave their AI algorithm or program whatever you want to call it they gave their uh program uh Steve Jobs's biography uh which is and I think they actually gave him one or two of his biographies because there's two two major ones then they basically gave him they gave the program every single Steve Jobs recording I think ever or anything that they could find on the internet along with every Joe Rogan episode ever and they made Joe Rogan interview Steve Jobs and in the interview it's like 25 minutes long they talk all about all types of stuff but they say some amazing things like Joe Rogan does the intro and he goes like he teases out the who who it is just like he does in real life he goes what's up freak [ __ ] which I don't even think he says anymore but he said that in all the early episodes goes what's up freak [ __ ] uh today's guest is someone who's incredibly smart incredibly weird we should just play it right let it let it insufferable well he says insufferable which I thought was crazy so go ahead this podcast is brought to you by play. HT all content is generated by artificial choice for this part listener discretion is advised hello freak [ __ ] welcome to another episode of the Bro joke experience and on this episode I welcome my friend who's difficult to describe um fascinated by him and I hope you will be too and he is weird and Brilliant and sometimes totally insufferable but my guest today has made some of the great technological products of our age and he's always pushing the envelope in Innovation like for example with his next computer he developed a new programming language and operating system system and then he became even more famous for making three applications for that computer uh word processor a spreadsheet and an image editor that just showed me that this dude was brilliant had amazing taste and I would just hope that I could be even like one tenth of the genius that my friend today is and I can't even say his name so yeah so I was super psyched about having him in the house today first time or yeah we've had you on before but not for a long time you're like Patrick sways and um Demi Moore and ghost you're a memory from the [Laughter] past so without further Ado my friend who is difficult to describe and wonderful and I'm so grateful he came on the show how's it going good to see you buddy it's been a long time since I've been on the show I missed this it's always fun wow like just pause there okay so the things that like first the voice quality The Voice quality is incredible like that sounds just like Joe Rogan it sounds just like Steve Jobs it it is it has gotten so much better than like how this used to be I remember like you know when you had like the Garmin GPS in your car and you could like choose the Morgan Freeman Voice or whatever like anytime You' to have like this voice robot that was trying to say something new it sounded totally computerized and this doesn't so the voice quality is one thing the fact that it kind of like it may makes more sense it makes more sense than it should like he's doing an intro it understands that he's teasing like this my friend who's here today this person is a genius but not saying who it is and what it is right away that's like a a Showmanship thing that I thought was like really interesting um the back and forth banter like he gives that long intro and then Steve Jobs just kind of laughs um like you would if you had sat down for this kind of interview with Joe Rogan I just thought that was incredible the way it felt like a real conversation and obviously there's some stuff that's like you know he's talking about word processors and documents a little too much like nobody would do that but like damn if 80% of that is not amazing and the reason I felt emotional listening to this was it's I felt both like in awe but also scared because as I was listening to this it I was agreeing with what Steve says and uh what what we'll do in a second uh Ben is fast forward like maybe 10 minutes in and basically jobs goes on this long rant about LSD saying uh you know LSD changed my life and I don't think it's for everyone but it changed my life and it opened my mind up and let me read all these books I never previously would have read and he says something like I don't I wouldn't take LSD a bunch of times in a row because I only needed it once or twice and it opened my mind and it introduced me and he goes in depth he goes it introduced me to India and it's just he he's talking about God he's talking about like all kinds of things that you're like it's not just like reading a Wikipedia page you know what I mean like uh it's very philosophical he's like when people think about God they think about this but to me it's and it's like well that's a fully formed thought and philosophy and like that sounds like something somebody would say when they're having like an in-depth podcast and not just like I did this in 1979 in March when I was living in Albuquerque and then in 1981 I once again you it was wasn't that it was like a very real sounding thing and he has this did you hear there's this beautiful quote that he says and basically the way that this company if you ever listen to a bunch of Steve Jobs interviews you'll notice that at points it almost sounds like they're just chopping up some of his clips and just weaving them together because he has talked about this before so I don't actually know if he's ever said this particular line before but he started talking about India and why he loves like uh that part of the world and he basically says like well it's so old and it influenced the rest of society and he goes there's an Indian epic that's 10 times as long as the Bible the Quran and all these other things the Odyssey yeah that's what he says yeah he's like basically Indian history influenced the rest of the world and there's an epic that's 10 times as long as all these other books and I just thought that that's just like such an by the way he does so and he doesn't say the name so he kind of leaves you wanting there but he is talking about the the the G which is like is I think that long it's like a 16-part series or whatever it's like this really really long thing I would bet that it actually is multiples longer than the Iliad in The Odyssey so I I don't think interesting that he said that I I and and this is the point is that when he said that I said I got to find that book like he just sold me on this book influ yeah I the jobs influence me so Ben click play just for like 30 seconds but there is some kind of deeper meaning to life and it can't just be something that somebody made up because if it was it wouldn't be compelling it would seem contrived and everyone would see through it so I think that the meaning and the purpose is by the cosmos the nature of the cosmos which is pretty bold thinking I mean I don't know how else to put it but it's not religious in the way people usually talk about taking LSD was a profound experience for me LSD shows you that there's another side to the coin and you can't remember it when it wears off but you know it it washes over you and tells you that everything is connected you're not here by accident you were put here for a purpose and if you can figure out what that is then you'll learn more about yourself than anything else could it's pretty intense so so so that quote is a real quote of his taking LC was a profound experience one of the most important things in my life it shows you that there's another side of the coin you can't remember it when it wears off but you know it okay so that is like an actual quote of his but it's weaved into the conversation like there's a part in the conversation where he where where he says he's talking about how he's a fan of Joe Rogan he's like it's nice to just sit back in the car and listen to you rant and it's like okay so the first one where he's the the LSD you know okay they just took a they just took you know his goodread section or his quotes and they're like okay cool he he says things like this but where did how did it know to say to Joe Rogan that I love to listen to your podcast in the car just love to sit back and listen to your rant where would that have come from how how does that happen that is there's like little moments like that that are like I just don't understand this technology well enough to know how it could know to say something like that in that moment so the first half of the call he talks all about India and these like kind of platit like life advice type of things which were pretty amazing but then the second half which Ben just started playing a little bit this he talks about Google and they actually say Yahoo Ron they call it yahoo uh they put the emphasis on the wrong syllable but they uh he he's he like does all these like says all these interesting quotes which I actually think are things that he said again in the past but he says stuff like you know that's a problem I've always had with Microsoft in many ways they're smart people and they've done good work but they've never had any taste they've never had any aesthetic taste and then he goes on and he talks about Adobe and he criticizes adobe's business model and he goes uh Joe Rogan actually says what would you do to fix Adobe and job says well they've got 800 people working on adobe's business model that's just way too many PE people and the fact that they charge just a little bit of money for a small bit of the product it's like buying a car but only getting part of the car and having to pay more money to get the rest of the engine and he like says these criticisms about Adobe which frankly I have no idea if it's true but he must have went on like a rant about this you know in the past but and and then he goes you know I had a lunch recently with Bob whatever at Adobe and he like says their full name and he leads up this part of adobe and he actually agreed with me that they need to fix it and they're working on fixing it and so anyway he like actually gives almost more advice and his opinions on what I think are current events I'm not well versed enough in with Adobe but it seems like current events it's pretty magical it's amazing uh yeah this basically was like bring bring back someone from the dead technology Ben do you have anything to add you're a you're a history guy what did this like do you have anything that you felt when you when you watch this I really agree with Sam it made me oddly emotional uh listening to it it also scared me a little bit just cuz thought of the application of like what if like you did this to my grandpa and like what emotions would that bring back and then that like frightened me of like I don't know if that's a good thing to be able to experience like this representation of my grandpa that would feel like the real thing but isn't right like where are these thoughts coming from so it's equal parts like really compelling really cool it's like a treat to be able to hear what I think is like a pretty accurate representation of how Steve Jobs would approach some of these things that are happening today but then also just like scary to realize but it's not really him and what is it really well it's it's like a video right today you could watch a home video and it's like you see their face you hear their voice you but you it's captured a moment in time to me this is an extension of that which is like now it's going to be somewhat interactive that you can kind of interact with these people or hear them talk about new things uh and you know that it's not like the real thing but it's you know there's a black mirror episode that's a lot like this where the the woman like uploads her boyfriend's Consciousness to like you know this robot she's kind of still dating him even though uh you know he's gone but like there's like the shadow of him that like you know can can simulate him um and I think I think there's more good than bad um Sam what do you want to say yeah so let me add two points about why this is going to get even stranger well the first point is is is almost scary so basically in 1985 here this is a quote from Steve Jobs he goes my hope is someday when the next Aristotle is alive we can capture the underlying worldview of that Aristotle in computer and someday some student will not be only be able to read the words Aristotle wrote but ask Aristotle a question and get an answer and so Steve Jobs wrote that in ' 85 which is interesting now here's where things get really interesting from that because that's that's he is what he's what just H what he just described is what just happened to him it's magical now here's where things are going to get even more magical so play do is it play. a or play. HT I want uh so part of their website you can actually vote for new episodes and some of the top episodes that people have voted for is Elon Musk interviewing uh Nicola Tesla Kanye West and Bob Marley talking about music Jesus interviews God and then I believe there's Einstein and Buddha having a conversation on science and spirituality um Trump interviews himself Trump interviews himself there's Lex Freedman interviewing Richard Fineman and then there's uh Joe Rogan mediates peace between Russia and us and that sounds like a joke and it is a joke but it's actually an interesting tool where you're like well like let's hear Joe Rog or let's see if Joe Rogan can like bring together these two PE different people and hear each other's perspective and we'll actually find out where one another is coming from even if it's make believe and but it will still be like maybe that is actually how they feel and I could work through this argument so that's why stuff is actually really really interesting and Powerful so let's switch gears I want to give you my kind of like big picture framework on how I think about AI so um I was having lunch with this guy who has built this AI app uh he built one app called I think Wombo is the name of it it had like a 100 million downloads it basically could take a picture of you and make you like make it look like you're singing uh and then they got copy a bunch and got taken out of the app store because of Music problems and then like I saw that now he has another one which is basically like one of these um text to Image Creators on mobile and it's like really popular and he started saying this thing and I kind of remixed what he was saying and here's kind of like how here here's where we landed with like what's going on with AI so the last I don't know 10 years have been what I'll call left brain Ai and like you know you have your left brain and your right brain left brain left brain is your analytical brain and that's what artificial intelligence could do you had big data you had machine learning you had you know oh oh the computer can play chess and it's amazing the computer can play go and it's amazing it beats the best players in the world you had self-driving cars where a car is taking in sensor data camera data and it's basically processing it and trying to make decisions like a human being using analytical decision-making processes it's trying to make the right Judgment at the right time to maximiz safety and so that's what I think that's where we've been and it's also in a way what we expected that sounds like the type of thing that super computer should be able to do is like hey computer you know just like you can multiply huge numbers and I can't do that in my head you know you should be able to drive perfectly every time you should be able to play chess better than a human like great I get that stuff and then was this game changer where it changed into right brain AI your right brain is your creative brain right so this is where you got gpt3 which is what generates um text like you know what we just talked about with the Joe Rogan thing so you can just give it a prompt and it'll just write an essay for you it'll be creative it can write rap lyrics for you that's where you got do which is Art so you could just say give me a picture of a starry night but with uh it takes place in Hogwarts and it'll just generate images that like create that scene it'll paint pictures for you and so you know all of a sudden the artists are looking at this saying wait a minute wait a minute I it was fine when you were just messing with chess but now now you're holding the paintbrush what's going on here and then you have that you know what we just played you know um play HT or unreal speech they're doing this for audio like how do you generate audio whether that's music whether that's U podcast it's just creating it from scratch and you know like here's podcasters like us that's wake up and we sit at our microphone and we have to come up with this content but now the machines are doing it too and um and so we're competing with that and then you have people doing this with video there's a company called Runway that's doing this where you could just describe a video like walking through the streets of Tokyo and it's really busy and then it it creates that scene and you go can you add some rain and then it adds rain what what's that called Runway ml can I go on right now and just use it Ben pull up the demo for Runway ml um I don't know if it's like launched yet but they they put out a sick demo of what I just described and so now you got this right brain AI That's doing creative [ __ ] Creative Images creative text creative video it's writing blog posts it's writing essays it's making paintings it's making patterns it's making music it's making podcasts it's making videos and so now it's doing both sides and that's the big change that's happened and that's the big holy [ __ ] moment in the same way that nfts brought a whole bunch of people into crypto who you know crypto when it was just cryptography or it was just Finance um there was a certain set of people that were interested then nfts came out and it was like oh cool there's a whole art angle you know like celebrity access it brought a new audience in this is that on steroids where the new AI stuff that's creative and is creating art and creating music and creating audio and creating text that's bringing in a whole new wave of people Beyond just people who were interested in a chess bot or a alpha you know the alpha zero bot that plays plays go um you know those were kind of limited to like just the Nerds now we got the Nerds and the artists both in the mix that's my framework for what's going on with AI and the next 10 years I think are this like right brain side taking over and this is that is that it what is that yeah so let's see oh my God like it's like make it feel more romantic add a uh remove the you just highlight an object it's like remove this I don't want this in the video and it just removes the Street Lamp and then it's like make a lush Garden make it look like it was handrawn make it look like uh a jungle where there's whatever going on [Music] wow so right like like that last thing it just did is so crazy it just you dropped a video in and it goes green screen the character and it's a guy walking around and it just like immediately removes the background and then it says add a sunny sky and it adds a sunny Sky then it says blur blur the Sun a little bit blur the background a little bit and it blurs the background while this guy's like skateboarding or whatever like that's crazy that it could do that um you know and now obviously you know a demo is generally like massive overpromise for what the tech can actually do yeah but it's we can all see it we can all see that like if they're not doing it now like it it's reasonable that in the ne in the near term of 10 years like this is going to be normal and add two inches to that guy's neck beard and this is done like yeah yeah we're measuring timelines by uh by hair low hair growth they um this is one of those things and it doesn't happen often where you see something and you say to yourself it's not there yet but it will be and it's almost like where you like test it's almost like when I was in a Tesla for the first time and it went and it was like a practical car that also went 0 to 60 in 3 seconds even though the range wasn't good and like this other thing wasn't good but I get into it and I'm like oh well yeah like in 10 years this is what this is just the norm this will be Norm and those types of like puberty it's like there's a bunch of changes happening the voice is changing but it still cracks and you're like all right it doesn't sound great yet but it'll get there yeah and this is one of those things and and it's pretty magical when you see it and like a really some seemingly basic but actually quite profound uh ways that this is going to impact thing I mean it's basically it's almost like I don't know if you know anything about music but like I was listening to this documentary on uh Nirvana and Dave Gro was talking about his newest album he's going to use analog like which is like tape recording he's going to like record it like with the all in one room but because he's like with Pro Tools like you know it's the technology it's the Recording Technology they use it's called Protools it's kind of like Photoshop but for music and he was like we could record all this music and like we only got to do it one time and then we can like drag and drop different stuff and we make like the sound perfect like the every snare is like exactly on the beat that it should be and it's perfect and he's like we kind of wanted it to be a little sloppier feel more human because Protools has made this stuff perfect and that's an example of what's going to happen and like some really mundane but interesting examples are basically you know have you ever done like sale like high ticket sales where you're trying to sell software or some type of service that requires tons of back and forth an email of you like cold emailing someone and then like them saying like oh well this is kind of interesting but we need this this and this and then you have to like reply back that costs so much money worth of people you got to train people on the right things to say you've got to give them documentation on all the right things to say then you got to like add in like the wow factor of like can you like flirt with them the right way and can you like play this game the right way like that [ __ ] the like reasonably it's it's reasonable to see that that will all be automated in a in in the near term like a call center won't be a thing there's going to be like your AI call center or whatever we want to call that your operations Hub and then there's going to be like just in case that doesn't work we'll have a couple people there right well I uh I in one of the companies I invested in is called Infinitis and the the funny thing that they did was they're like oh man doctors spend so much time their back office like just trying to do billing with insurance so you'll call up the basically you know patient gives you information for insurance you then have to call the insurance company and you have to verify the name and the number and you have to get it like here's the reference code for what treatment they had or whatever right all this back and forth and um most entrepreneurs solution was like oh this is so much back and forth we need to eliminate this and rechange the system from scratch and what these guys did was way smarter they were like oh why don't we just save the doctors a ton of time let's make a robot that calls their robot and so they created a robot that will call you know whoever insurance providers robot and the insurance provider was like please enter the patient's identification number and then the robot goes 92 4 3 3 six it's like thank you for your patience robot and it's like please say if you want number one and then the robot has infinite patience to just do the whole call by itself and it saves doctors a ton of time they're doing really really well let me give you um we have to talk about interior AI yeah so let's do a couple other examples so uh here's another one where you know Peter levels who came on the Pod um you know massive out a fan favorite this guy's got like a a killer following and one of the reasons why is because he loves to just hack together and make stuff I think when you I think when you were looking at his thing you called him it what did you call him you called him an artist in that way too you're like I forgot your description of him but you're like you're a um I can't remember it was something like you called him basically like a like a a code artist or something like that well I I I don't know remember what I called him but to me he's like a Craftsman you know like he's like a he's like a punk rocker who like uh he's like a musician who just instead of playing on a a musical keyboard he's playing on a computer keyboard and he's pretty magical he's a pretty magical like Creator I think yeah there there's definitely an element of punk to him where he's like for example he's like I don't do email or phone calls ever if you want to if you have a question for me here's a frequently Asked question thing like why because I like to just work on my [ __ ] and then I like to go swimming and like those are the things I want to do right and he's like you know I don't want to live in one place I'm going to just move around and like be a nomad and I think that's cool and he did that before remote work was popular so he what this is he's been building it publicly on Twitter for a while now about 3 or four months maybe so uh no not even dude like couple weeks so um he created this thing it's interior AI like interior design and what you do is you could basically upload a photo of any space and you can say what it is you so you drop it you drag and drop a photo of a space by the way I I want to create a YouTube video that does all these demos live one by one um but like you upload a space and then you say what type of room it is you say what type of style you want like do you want ski chalet do you want tropical do you want like minimalist do you want a Max look and then you um you say how many versions you want and then you click render my idea and it just creates like an interior designer would a super realistic like go to his Twitter and just uh look at the um look at his like demos there Ben um it generates like a super realistic looking interior so he took like for example um Kim Kardashian's house and he took the photo from their like living room and then he uploaded um he said like you know give me a give me some inspiration and it turned it into like a hot spring like it turned it into like a whole different like thing it all together um but it's really amazing and it's like yeah here's all the stuff you would need to make your house look like this do you like this look nope you want a new one push a button get another one push a button get another one push another and which is what you were saying that would be so much back and forth of a human being you would sit down for design meetings and then they would have create a lookbook and then you'd give your feedback and then they would you know maybe give you a rendering but that takes time and energy on their part and then you'd say no and then you'd have to go back and forth here you just push buttons and you just immediately get this like dream just like you just get to Dream Out Loud and like you're just dreaming and it's just generating images of like you know that for you to kind of like remix off of which is a totally different creative process like that cuts so much friction out of the creative process that even somebody like me who doesn't have design taste this is a the superpower to give you design taste but B it takes all the friction out so you don't have the impatience right okay look at look at this one yeah go go back and forth of this so so it's this crappy Warehouse like space just empty I don't know Sam like describe what you're looking at here so this is clearly an old factory that someone's trying to turn into an apartment so it's an industrial style th000 to 2,000 square foot room that looks beautiful but is too rustic to live in and entirely empty and he says uh I found an original empty loft photo I wanted to add interior decorating that was industrial style and I wanted to Auto detect different parts around the building so it looks like there's like a pillar in the in the middle of the room so he wanted he said I wanted to decorate around that and he said all right go ahead interior AI do it and let's look at the next picture and then it turns it into this like modern looking Loft uh it's the same place um and then it replaces the floor and then it does this and it does that like and you could I think there's another version that it creates like it creates like multiple versions of it um oh my gosh yeah some of these are little outlandish this one's crazy right like replace the roof with like bamboo and like you could see through the roof now so some of this is not as super realistic but you you said something earlier that I think is worth noting which is um it's not perfect and there's like definitely some weird stuff that it's like well that doesn't make any sense but you have to see through that right now because that stuff's going to get better and there's this great blog post from back in the day by this guy Paul buite who created Gmail when he was inside Google and the blog post is called if you're great you don't have to be good which honestly is kind of the motto of my life right like Sam do I show up late to this podcast yeah I do am I wearing my boxers right now yeah I am did I prepare for this podcast not fully but if you're great you don't have to be good and like that's true he's like you know with with Gmail people were like oh my God it doesn't have this and it doesn't have a contact book and it doesn't have this he's like yeah but look it's lightning fast has unlimited storage and the search is amazing you could find any file on any email instantly and he's like when you're great you don't have to be good he's like the iPad people were like oh my God it doesn't have a keyboard it doesn't have a USB port it doesn't have this it doesn't have that he's like yeah but watch this you Tap a button and it like instantly is on it doesn't have like a bootup process and like you swipe and you're on the internet and it just lets you browse the internet from your like your couch you know where you're you know on the go where you're you don't have your laptop or you don't have your desktop computer he's like so when you're great you don't have to be good and he had released that when the iPad came out he's like look the iPad just got released all these critics are saying how that's a huge flop I think they're wrong because they're making this mistake they want things to be good everywhere but you just need to be great in like three things that matter and everything else can be kind of sucky and it'll still win and he was absolutely right about the iPad are you so let's talk about opinions a little bit where's your head at with all this I mean when I see this I think a I am not capable like I I I don't have the ability to work on this I I I just I simply don't have the horsepower and like I appreciate it but I the engine I got upstairs you know it's more of a go-kart yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm definitely well I'm I I'm very much either going to be a spectator or a only semi in active person in this in this game like you know you made a You made a funny joke when we were talk you and I so Sean and I are obsessed with Tik Tok so we watch Tik Tok constantly and we made a joke or Sean made a joke he goes we're content creators in the same way that uh a horse carriage person uh in 1912 and they just saw Henry Ford Drive by on his car wh by and you're like oh [ __ ] yeah the hell was that yeah like that's when I watch Tik toks yeah I see an 18-year-old with Vans who like makes this like spectacular like video of uh and it's just the funniest thing ever and I'm like oh there there's a new era and I'm not part of it and that's kind of how I that's a little bit how I feel when I see this and I don't how do you feel when you see this and how do you intend to kind of like Get Your Hands you know we're a bunch of scheming greedy you know hor people how are you going to get your hands on this how you going to get your your stick and paws in this game well that's a great question it's a question I've been ask myself I'm a little bit different than you and that I'm I give my I have a little more self- delusion where I'm like I could do this you know um I could I I I if I hired the right people you know I could be the vision guy yeah yeah yeah I'll be the vision guy and like you I'll have the idea and then all these Geniuses will just make you you you you previously had a company that was a my I would tell my parents I had a tech company but it was really just an email newsletter it wasn't a tech company you actually had a proper technology business right right yeah you you were just basically like writing brochures and uh whereas I was running a a Silicon Valley Enterprise I'm like I'm like a a restaurant who has an online ordering menu uh calling themselves a tech company yeah ex the next Google um yeah yeah I'm used to working working with people that are way smarter than me and I like go over to I roll my chair over to their screen and they're just like what do you want I'm like hey bud um can you do that thing again where you made the thing like bounce during the animation like that was so cool I want to just like upload this to my Twitter can you do it again and they're like uh yeah sure um so I'm used to working with designers Engineers are way talented so I I kind of look at it as as following my plan is this invest in everything CU investing is easy and great uh right like I'm a Believer in this wave I'm uh excited about this and I think that I can help because a lot of the people who can build this stuff they don't know a where to apply it like what's the what's the actual pain point I should be solving and B they don't know how to like build maybe a defensible business or a go to market strategy that might make sense for them so I'm like okay cool I'm going to invest in a bunch of these companies that's plan a that's already in motion it it would you say that this is the most interesting sector um for sure for sure I kind of feel like an idiot because it's like oh cool now you're interested in the new thing and it's like on one hand I get that um you know oh crypto you are you are in fact a dumb idiot who chases yeah I just chase the next shiny object and there's some truth to that like crypto was the more crypto prices went up the more I invested and the more uh you know then I created the milk Road and like that you know I turned my content attention to it um so you know now oh you know it's like that Meme it's like you know the guy the guy who looks back at the new the new thing that's like you know the hot thing behind it it's like yeah AI is that new thing but at the same time what am I supposed to do I just saw a [ __ ] flying object I just saw a UFO what am I supposed to do pretend I'm not interested like no I'm super interested like you know Count Me In Like beam me up and you know have your way with me aliens that's how I feel about AI did I ever tell you the time that in our office there was a porn Studio across the street that would leave their windows open no so so at my office in San Francisco was at Bush and Kerney in the financial district of San Francisco and we were on maybe the fifth floor and there used to be this company called breather and it was almost like Airbnb but for office space maybe like Wei work uh where they would like pre- rent tons of like one single small rooms a meeting room yeah yeah a meeting room and then you could rent it by the hour and we had these huge beautiful windows at our office and you could see across the street which was only 20 yards you know just the size of a small Street and you could see across where this other room was and eventually this softcore porn company started renting it uh it was a breather and they would rent it by the hour and I think it was for only fans I think it was where a freelance photographer who's specialized in like webcam girls or something like that and they would come and take like their their portfolio pictures and they would always come at like two days a week at like 2 o00 and they would get completely naked and they would just be there taking pictures and I had this woman working for me named Edie who's probably 65 and her and I sat next to each other and I remember like it happened and be like uh yeah they're there again today and like you can't not look and Ed's like hardcore Catholic and she used to do the of the Cross muffs they're here yeah she would do like the side of the Cross and like start go to her like Rosary whenever they would come in and she would like oh GE like she would say like oh baby Jesus like you know dear but for different reasons yeah for different reasons she was more so and like wow I was more like wow yeah we and uh it was one of those things where I remember sitting there and our office was like six young men and then like Edie and this this this like porn was just not not porn but this nude photo photography was just happening right there and we just like had to stare at it all day and I remember it being so challenging to work when that was happening that's sort of like AI That's my long tangent yeah I was like where's he going with this okay yeah I I'm with you I'm with you on that that's that is you don't remember that you you were never there when the the they got naked no I never saw that um but you know thanks for not inviting me um so so yeah that that is how I feel about this where I'm like what am I supposed to do not look Edie um I'm looking I'm looking and you know I'm looking as long as they're there that's how I feel about AI so I'm going to invest in this stuff uh I'm going to keep learning about it and then who knows maybe start a company in this space you know it's pretty exciting yeah it's exciting I mean like this is like a it is exciting it's an unlock it's like oh we got new toys to play with like I can't leave them in the box like I got to unbox it and see what I can do with it so you know I I don't know we'll see what happens with this but let me give you a couple other um kind of mind-blowing you know examples here so okay so another one is Jasper so I just invested in this company called Jasper Jasper AI dude the valuation was steep I'm shocked you did it yeah the revenue curve is also steep it's it's working really well and now I I I went in and I told him this I go your numbers are insane um this might be fraud that's okay you know we'll we'll see I don't think it's fraud but like the numers are so so impressive that it's like you know when you say wow that's unbelievable there's a part of you that's like is it wait is this believable um so you know there's there's there's that and I said the other thing is you know sometimes these companies that get off to really hot starts they don't necessarily sustain like uh sometimes that explosive growth can can can make but it can also break you group on La you know during Co hoppen was an example of this where hoopen was like you know started and then it was like the perfect thing at the perfect time and it just took off like a rocket ship and it became worth $5 billion and then now there's like they just laid off like whatever a thousand people because Co ended the demand went down they couldn't sustain that sales growth they had forecasted that that they'll always keep growing like a rocket and maybe that didn't happen so you know and by the way the founder took $1 million in secondary yeah you know just had to secure the bag for his family right uh he's like I got kids he don't but good for him I I'm going to have kids I better get this bag I'm going to use that excuse all the time regard if I got kids dude I got kids to feed I got a family right I am such a good uncle um okay so check out this demo of what Jasper can do so basically I teach like a um a writing course called Power writing and my my whole goal is like hey if you're going to write something on your website or an email or your Twitter bio or you want to write content for blogs like you're either going to write it and no one's going to read it it's going to go nowhere it's going to drive no results no clicks no signups no followers or it's going to like actually like achieve the thing so it's like a genie right you say you say what you want and you just give it like a little guy like make it funny I want an ad that's going to like promote my gym it's called crunch uh we have this welcome offer where you get it for 20 bucks make it funny and I want it as a Facebook ad and then I want it as a cold email and they just gen and like give me 10 options and it gives you 10 options and then you can just like edit them or whatever or you can literally highlight it and just say rephrase this I didn't like the way I didn't like this intro give me a new one and it'll just give you a new one you're like give another one and it's like gives you another one I mean it's like the best employee that's like creative super prompt just immediately delivers the thing you want it's kind of like amazing so like watch watch like another 30 seconds this is like the boss mode version access to documents now I want you to imagine documents it's kind of like Google Docs if you had an assistant in there and you're the boss giving your assistant instructions on how to do stuff now for our first example imagine a real estate agent who has a lot of outbound sales emails to send out this week and he wants to save some time by using his AI assistant Jasper now you're probably getting a hang of this by now on the left we give Jasper some context of our situation any background information we need along with tone of voice and keywords and then on the right we can supply a pattern so Jasper can follow that because Jasper is really good at following patterns and apply that with all the information it knows from the internet so here we just provided a really good example of what good behavior would look like and then we provided some merge tags empty little slots that we want Jasper to fill in in our situation the real estate agents Dave clients James markets Austin Texas it's the New Year season demand is up inventory is down and we want hop on a call so now we're going to write with AI we're going to do a Jasper command remember that feature for later okay now what we're going to do is activate voice mode hey Jasper write an email from Dave to James about an update on the Austin Texas real estate market and ask for a call later this week all right we're submitting that command imagine if you're the boss and Jasper's your assistant now he's following your directions look at that it's perfect you can go ahead and ship it imagine all the sales emails you dude so isn't that crazy so like so that's why these guys are taking off because they basically say you know where you had employees you no longer need employees or if you had a good employee they're now they can they can now be 10 times more productive uh when they do this you know so so this is like kind of mind-blowing on the like text generation for business side of things this is crazy let me tell you like this absolutely crazy another wild example are you going to use this for your business yeah so yeah exactly so I'm using it I just started using this for for ours and for well two things one is I'm going to try to use it when we do our prior writing course I'm going to teach people how to use this but also use it in the like kind of the sales process but um like with our Ecom thing I want to try it uh even with milk Road like there's like there's cases where maybe our writers can be more productive if we give them this tool for example at every day at the milk road we make we start with an opener that's like you know uh hey what's up this is the milk Road the crypto newsletter that brings you news so fresh you'll think it's you know um do so fresh it'll smell like laundry straight out of the dryer I love that smell and it's like that's what we like I just made that up off the top of my head but you give it three of those and then we could just tell Jasper generate and it'll generate like 500 clever openers like that which is great because that's like one thing our writers every day have to come up with a cool new one and like you know it takes like you know a little mental energy to do that and it's it's not the easiest thing but now they can get better doing things like that let me give you a wild example so go to uh I don't know where this is going to be I don't know if they have a website how how how are they any different than copy AI cuz that I invested in copy Ai and they do the they're kind of the same thing just imagine cop AI with more Revenue no offense to copy those guys are cool it's kind of like LeBron James just not good what's the difference between me Lebron just imagine me taller faster stronger more handsome more successful and richer I think no I I've been by the way I've been investor in copy yeah I love those guys uh Paul is the founder who I invested in they they're at 10 million in Revenue it looks like they're it looks like they're actually quite similar but I think they're geared towards a different user but uh yeah I would have to dig deeper into Jasper to truly understand but anyway go ahead so okay so here's other examples of things that I think are amazing so the Same by the way the same thing the way this just helped a Content marketer or a salesperson generate text for their emails and blog posts like this thing will write whole blog post for you and by the way you can write a blog post and then you click the SEO button and it'll score how SEO friendly this is and how much it thinks it's going to drive for you right so that's pretty smart to like link these things together because on the surface what the what are all these companies doing they're just using basically the same sort of like gpt3 engine so on one hand these companies are not very defensible because anybody could take these open- Source language models and build a user interface on top of it and so like I can create another competitor to copy AI or Jasper or one of these kind things but it's all in the like the user interface the applications and how much like business utility you add to it so let me give you another example of business utility so this is now in the photography uh use case so for example for my e-commerce brand we spend a lot of money every month maybe something like $5 to $10,000 a month easily on photography so you have to take pictures of your products you have to take model photos so you have to do castings and then book models then they come to your studio and then they use your products or whatever and you take photos or videos of that you use that for your website you use that for your ads that sort of thing and so that whole process takes like multiple people right you got a photographer you might have a casting person you have an editor maybe um it takes time so like we can't just have it instantaneously like you have to schedule these things they take weeks um they don't always turn out good like maybe you have uh somebody doesn't it didn't turn out the the shot didn't turn out how you wanted it whatever so check out um dream Booth so dream Booth let me give you the link for this so there's two here osmosis Ai and dream Booth but try um let me give you this link so this guy Hub one no this one I think work this guy I think works at Shopify if I'm correct yeah so this guy like works in the like future division at Shopify I believe um strange native is his uh his Twitter handle and so basically what he does is he shows like um AI can unlock unlimited product photography so basically you could take a a generic image so like the left image here is just God a shoe on grass it's not a particularly good it's like kind of a glare it's on grass it looks like you didn't put a lot of effort you know you just went out in your backyard or a soccer field and took this picture and then you could just say make this shoe look epic and then it puts it takes that shoe cuts out the background puts it and it automatically puts it on this like lightning background or whatever but like look at the other example so like that second example I think is better look at the training image so it's a dude taking a selfie in this hoodie and it looks okay actually doesn't look okay it looks bad you can't use this on your website for e-commerce and then it generates a model like Studio looking photo of this same hoodie this one is kind of unbelievable to me this is that good where it's like dude if I could just take me wearing some crappy we me wearing my product and like don't care about the lighting don't care about the background don't care if I have my hair done that day and it'll just generate like it gave this dude pecs and it gave him like you know better shoulders and like a jawline and like you know it fixed the lighting and it put them on a background image and like what the hell but gave him mat how do I use this how do I use this you just click like on the tweet for now I don't think you can use this yet I think this is like proof of concept I don't think this one's like a a product product yet uh I could be wrong but I think a lot of these are like they're doing demos training models just to see what happens um dude this is this is crazy and some of them they open source the codes right here's this photo of this chair oh wow put this chair and like this epic thing so there's this and then there's someone doing this woman doing this thing called osmosis which I think is more of a real product uh let me give you the the link to this Mickey Friedman is is her name um so what she's doing is basically you give it like an image and then you say turn this into an ad and it'll turn it into Facebook ad creative for you by turning it into a video making it look cooler uh that sort of thing now again I haven't tested these products for like for real for real to see if it's like any good or not but the concepts are good and whether these exact products are the ones that do it someone's going to do it cuz all these are really valuable business use cases that like if I could do this now a process that's costing me 10 grand a month um cost me just cost $29 a month yeah $29.99 a month and it's instantaneous and it's better now you're 10 times faster 10 times cheaper and 10 times better and like that's the makings of like those are billion dooll companies when they do that and so um that's really exciting this is just this is just 100% frame breaking is what it is when I see this stuff it's just like I just got a little Peak into the future and so then then there's and and by the way this is still super early it these products work but so few there are there's a lot of people hundreds of thousands and millions of people who know and care about this but comparatively to how much of an impact this is going to have this we're we're no one knows about it um yeah so so check this guy out so I just talked to these guys yesterday young guys I want to invest in them but I didn't love their idea um so check out this guy I'm going to send you a link so I'm going to send you this link but in the meantime um you should uh just yeah hear me out so these guys basically they young guys they started one guy started a company out of college raised a little money didn't end up working out failed and he's like then I was just thinking about what to do next I was kind of joining these different communities and he's like um then I met Hugh uh through Tik Tok I was like how'd you guys meet I always ask every co-founder per how'd you guys meet he goes we met through Tik Tok I was like you met through TI people kids meet through Tik Tok nowadays you do YouTube what um so he's like yeah uh Hugh has been making Jarvis so I don't know if you've seen the movie Iron Man but basically an Iron Man I I guess I haven't seen it so but it's like you know there's a AI assistant who he like talks to and like takes care of [ __ ] so this guy for the last year has been building in public on Tik Tok trying to create Jarvis like trying to create the real life Jarvis on on on Tik Tok he's got like a million follow follow on Tik Tok as he's been building this so they met through this process and they decided to like create an AI company together that actually like does you know some version of this and one of the things that they made the first thing that they made is this thing called Carter and what they're doing with Carter is they're like you know in games you walk around there's just like you know you walk into the store it's Grand Theft Auto and there's like a guy working at the store and they call these NPCs non-playable characters it's just like a character that's in the game so that the game's not empty but they don't do much you can just like punch them or like talk to them they say the same three words so what these guys started off doing was saying hey any game developer who wants their characters in game to actually just be able to talk using like AI just plug this like line of code in and all of your non-playable characters will all of a sudden be like able to hold conversations with the players uh chitchat back and forth um do all the stuff we've been showing that like you know the AI Joe Rogan AI Steve Jobs thing like just like hold a full conversation as long as you want or guide the player to go do something like hey um I'm looking for the sword to like well if this if it's the sword you seek you should go check behind the waterfall you know maybe there's some answers there for you and like it guides you automatically you don't have to hardcode that response because if the player asks for something else they'll say something else but like kind of guide them towards that answer um I don't know if it all works yet it's like in beta whatever and I don't honestly I don't love this use case but it is a cool use case it's a cool idea of like oh yeah I guess in the future games just these like stock characters that are walking around are going to not just be like random objects they're going to actually be like things you can interact with which will change the way that the games work like you'll be able to spend hours and hours in the games this guy hu just retweeted a tweet from this guy named Alex Wang who's the CEO of scale AI which I don't even know what entirely scale AI is other than it's like a 1010 billion doll software company it's always it's like for labeling data it's like to to make your to make your machine learning smarter you need to label data let's say you're a self-driving car company you need to like look at a million images and point out which what was a a sh Shadow versus a dog crossing the street so they basically give you software that will let you upload your images and then there's humans like I don't know the Philippines or somewhere I think that like will label your data for you and you just pay per image like two cents or one one cent or whatever so presumably he's quite intelligent and he has like a really Grand perspective because this company's so big and he sees lots of information he this guy Hugh retweeted something from Alex and he says we're at a critical turning point for Humanity children born today are likely to have more AI friends than human friends AI friends are going to be more reliable cons I don't even know what that word consat what's that mean agreeable uh and considerate what does this mean what what does this mean for childhood development and social norms we will find out uh that's wild I I completely agree with him and then he says loneliness is an epidemic it's on the rise in a real public health problem this technology when it exists has a lot of potential for good yeah I love that and I'm I'm a h fascinating so let me tell you three ideas that I think somebody could build that are not in the demos we just talked about all right okay idea one is exactly what he's talking about and I call it you know some version of either the AI friend or the AI therapist so there are a lot of people out there that would benefit from therapy and there are apps that will connect you with a therapist on your phone like I don't know seven cups of tea or like I don't know talk space or I don't know some companies you're like you're like I don't know I'm not one of those therapy losers yeah exactly but you broken people you you know what you use so these companies and these companies doing well they're they make you know uh like h100 million dollar plus a year it's great but it's very expensive and so if you wear one of these're it's just it's a cute little company you know they're they're whatever like you need like a there you know what the crypto Bros like you you you started using the word web 3.0 and you're like those those Web 2.0 dorks like that's what you have to describe like whatever is just like human uh you know old school yeah exactly reality reality 2.0 AI replaces DNA that's what I that's what I believe and so what they were doing was they're connecting you with a real life therapist who's licensed and blah blah blah and blah blah blah and because of that you know they maybe take an in-person visit which might be $150 or $200 and they turn it to a $60 or $90 a month subscription where you get three visits or something like that I don't know the exact economics but something like that where you're paying a kind of meaningful amount of money but you're getting it more conveniently than if you just went to you were going in person and you also don't have the you know the stigma the taboo of telling your friends where you going I'm going to this no they're just on your phone in your pocket well there are I don't know tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of people who would benefit from having someone to talk to either a therapist or just a com a friend a companion somebody that they can confide in somebody that won't judge them somebody that will be positive and helpful somebody that will uh maybe offer good advice um somebody that will never share their secrets and somebody that has you don't you know no self-interest in the matter um you could now provide that for like I don't know a dollar or something like that right like the cost and the the accessibility of of Cur you know sort of like loneliness or um helping people talk through what's on their mind and get things off their chest that's going to drop dramatically so AI therapy SL AI companion and friend I think is a mega mega idea I think that is a TENS of billions of dollars worth idea now I think maybe there's it's going to be a lot of competition there there's not clear like the network effects around that but I do think that that is a a very very big idea and I think it's a very imp F so that's one startup idea you want to react to that and I'll give you the next one yeah that's pretty plain and obvious to me like like that that's a pretty obvious straightforward Solution that's obviously challenging to pull off but like straightforward and we could all predict that so yes I agree the next one is a little sexier this is called AI Spotify so what's AI Spotify okay so traditionally the music business has been like um uh what's a situation where people just like run into like a burning building people just make terrible decisions it's like a horror movie when you're like don't go in there and they're like but I heard a sound I want to just go check it out you know like it's like ah you're going to get slaughtered that's basically what the music business was you know basically you're competing it's like everybody loves music so you are competing with a bunch of people who want to like you know make it better it's like someone creating like a to-do list app or something yeah the oh do do you like pain because you're going to get pain yeah exactly oh you like music I guess you like pain too cuz that's what you're going to get music and pain um so the second thing so you know unlikely you would even ever break out of the like thousands of people trying this if you did guess what here's your prize a lawsuit your suit out of existence whether you're Napster or like one of the many many music companies that came in between okay you survived the lawsuit your Pandora your Spotify you you didn't even get sued out of existence congratulations here's shitty economics cuz guess what to deliver music have to have the rights of the record labels they can always they own the pricing power and uh that's why you know Spotify after you know like building the best-in-class product getting everybody to use it after 15 years or whatever like does not have impressive economics it does not does not spit off a bunch of cash the way Google or Facebook or other companies are able to okay so why is AI Spotify different now basically you can create a really cool music app that doesn't have to pay musicians a dollar all right musicians everywhere are getting pissed but you know here's here's the good news you know uh here's what the service would look like the same way interior AI was just like you you want an industrial look you want a minimal look you know give me a starting image and I'll I'll riff off that what you're going to be able to do with AI Spotify is you pick like you could basically upload a playlist or you could just like um you know like pick a song that you really like like Pandora tried yeah it's just going to be it's just going to be Pandora radio but they don't exist but these these songs don't exist so it's just going to generate a new song on the Fly for you and like Tik tok's algorithm it's going to learn like when you skip okay that was not good where did they skip why did they skip what songs get liked um if you like this song will you like this song that sort of thing so it's going to generate an ALG the algorithm is going to generate music on the Fly for you and then you could add crypto to it where I would be able to say if I hear a good song like by default all the songs are like they're here today gone tomorrow they're like ephemeral you don't get to hang on to them but if you like the song you're like oh I want to keep this song want to you you don't just get to keep it and save it you get to own it so you'll click mint you'll mint an nft that now you own that song why because it was your taste it was your directing the engine that created that song now you own that and maybe it could split royalties with all the artists that like inspired that music or the algorithm just owns you know 50% and the user owns 50% did you just come up with that or or is someone working on this off the Dome baby got that big brain got that big boy brain no small boy stuff just straight Big Boy ideas that's this is wonderful I think yeah this is finally you web 3 nerds are probably finally coming up with interesting [ __ ] A use case we did no one believed in US 10 years and a trillion dollars and we did it we got an idea that doesn't absolutely make no sense no I'm just joking but I do think this a great yeah joking with some elements of Truth um the uh but but I do think this idea is really great I think that the I think somebody should make this and it's it's not ready yet so for example what happened was with gpt3 somebody you know open AI basically like downloaded all the text of the internet to create this text generation engine and then with do they did the same thing they downloaded all the images of the internet to create this image generation engine and what these guys from the podcast thing or the speech stuff they're downloading all of Joe Rogan's back catalog to generate Joe Rogan's voice as a as a voice engine somebody's about to do that for music they're about to download all the music they're about to go download all the music off Spotify and then they're going to train an engine to say hey create new music this is what music is create new music and that's what's going to happen and they're going to release an open source model that will say would you like to generate music Here's an API that will just let you generate music using this this engine that we've we've been training by downloading all the music that exists wow brilliant finally finally brilliant finally is the best backhanded compliment ever dude you did it you peaked the back at of C wow that is brilliant finally too good we're so stupid it's like be and Butthead made a few bucks yeah you might have artificial intelligence but we got that real stupidity over here this is so stupid all right what's the third one um I don't know I lost my list I I misclicked but uh okay last thing I want to leave everybody with is um there's this guy who's I think the I think he should be the Billy of the week [Applause] [Music] million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion [Music] dollars Imad mustak so emad is his name he's the guy who is behind stable diffusion so I don't do do you know what stable diffusion is no I know that the tweet that you just referenced was talking all about stable diffusion so stable diffusion was basically um the a an open source competitor to DOI so open AI created do it took over everybody was excited about it but you know you had to like you had to get permission to even use it we were asking hey who can get us permission for gpt3 we want to get access who can get us access to DOI oh you have to pay for all these credits oh you don't know XYZ so stable diffusion is basically a um a like here here here's their tagline their tagline is great AI buy the people for the people designing Implement designing and implementing Solutions using collective intelligence and augmented technology they're just they're like the fuboo of the AI world you know what I'm saying yeah anybody who does US bias anybody who does for us bias generally they're full of [ __ ] but this guy um I watched one interview with him and I can confidently say From The Bottom Of Me heart after this one interview I watched this guy's the real deal holy field so let me tell you about this guy so he um gives all he's my Billy of the week uh he's not a billionaire yet but this guy's going to be a billionaire he basically for stable diffusion he put in $600,000 I think to fund like the development of it uh the company's worth like a billion dollars already what was he wealthy from so the guy he's born in Jordan he's got like a British ACC for some reason he's like a math background Quant type guy you could just tell in like the first few minutes talking to him it's like I bet this guy could say more than five prime numbers and it's like yeah he definitely can um so he works at a hedge fund and he's like like I'm the Quant guy at this hedge fund I'm doing trading and it's good like I'm it felt good to try to win that game and I was winning that game okay good so he does that then he has this life change he has his first kid and his son is diagnosed with autism so he he decides to take a few years off I don't know if because it was the autism or just because he had had a kid but he decides okay I'm not going to do the Hedge fun thing I just kind of retired early after winning the hedge fund game um retires and he's like okay um goes to the doctor and he's like what do I do about this like you know what can we do when it comes to autism and he's like well there's no like there's no solution and he's like but I'm an engineer like I have a problem that means there must be a solution like and he's like no there's no solution he's like doesn't accept that response so he starts doing his own research and basically ends up like I don't know curing his son's autism or at least making it a lot lot better so here's how he did it he basically was like all right there's a lot of like liter out there like research papers but if I try to read this one by one it's going to take me forever so he creates an engine that just ingests all the papers and does a semantic search on it and basically creates like this machine learning thing to to learn what is all the research about about autism telling us and um and by the way I didn't verify any of this I don't know if any of this was real this sounds a little too good to be true but again just judging the book by its cover I think this guy's legit so I choose to believe this is the biggest hedge ever in case like three weeks from now this guy turns out to like you know this guy pivots to selling his nft collection and it's like oh wait this guy changed his name and like used to launder money for a living in case that comes out let me just say there's a chance probably probably he's just a super nerd who's amazing okay let me tell you why I think that's true just because he's a brown guy with a British accent is what you're saying you said just based off of what he looks like and the vocabulary is stunning so he's describing autism and he's like you know the way that he's like autism is is a is a sort of like uh it's a it's a phenotype it's like a um it's like a a a behavioral description and it's has some underlying causes which is like you know certain chemist body chemistry things he's like well what causes those and could we rebalance the body chemistry so that the the behavior changes and what he realized was that autism as a whole comes from many different types of these imbalan he's like so he's like the doctors are correct that we can't just like fix it or cure it because there's so it's a multimodal system there's so many different um like inputs that create this output he's like but on an individual level if you can understand where in one individual the body chemistry is maybe slightly different perhaps there is a treatment that we could do or there is a a rebalancing that you could do of the body's biochemistry and so he starts to create like a a uh a process for himself over a couple years to try to help this and he said in this interview I was watching he's like yeah you know his my son is doing so much better and like you know uh he didn't claim like oh I've cured autism or anything like that but he's like I learned you know deeply like you know what was what goes into these kind of like biological systems and like uh what we can do you know how maybe science is going to get better in the future using AI so that's kind of where his AI itch got got started you know machine learning AI is going to be able to help these things and so um then in 2020 he's at a dinner in Davos um you know as you do as yeah as yeah as BR people with British accents huge vocabularies do I had dinner at Chick-fil-A last night okay so any this guy was at a dinner in Davos and um he's uh he's he's he's there you know and he's uh people are talking about this virus coming out of China and he's like huh that's the way they're describing this virus uh his covid-19 thing and he looks into it he's like sounds very similar to autism where it's a he calls it a multi multi stomach inflammatory disease and it's basically his main thing was like this thing is complicated and he's like it was pretty clear right away that uh developing a vaccine for this was going to take some time like we weren't going to be able to do this in months it was probably going to take you know a year year or more uh to try to figure this out and uh and even if we did it wouldn't work for everybody because again this is like a multimodal system and like you know these like one siiz fits-all Solutions are not not going to work very well and so he starts this like thing to try to help um use data to help you know policy makers for Co like do a better job blah blah blah um anyway he goes through this process the bureaucracy of like this whole like you know dealing with these World health organizations and UNESCO and World Bank and all this stuff you know it ends up being too bureaucratic and he like you know gets fed up with it and it just like sort of the whole initiative uh collapses and then he comes up with what he calls his promethian mission uh the you Prometheus the myth of the guy who you know sort of like gives fire to humans he like I want to open source all of the powerful Ai and ml tools that exist so that they're not controlled by large private corporations I like that um and so that's why the the for us bias baby like open AI is called open AI but it's a private organization they're very you know close to the vest about what they're working on and then when they release it they release it kind of like not to everybody all at once and all that stuff and if you look at the charts like stable diffusion has like far surpassed open Ai and then the the the the tweet that went viral on the was like you know open AI meaning the actual open sourced AI is beating open AI right so the the people who actually are taking an open approach are crushing now the company the private organization called how how do they make money then um I think it's the same sort of thing you like you know you pay for some credits or usage along the way like they open source the model but if you want to run it blah blah blah who knows maybe they're going to have some like you know open source companies have these like weird weird models where it's like Linux you know Red Hat makes a bunch of money through services and things like that that are not like what you would expect um so you know he says he starts stable diffusion because his daughter asked him if he could do the same thing he did for you know Co or whatever for art oh by the way in between he wins this grant that uh or this like X prize like I think um uh Elon Musk and somebody else put up this $15 million prize for who can uh what was it so um it was like who can basically create a system that um like teaches kids in foreign countries like I don't know I forgot what it was like English or mathematics uh for less than like you know $75 a total cost something like that and basically they created this thing on an iPad that you could just give to kids in like countries and they would basically like be able to learn or pass certain test within 75 days or something like that I don't know the exact specifics but he wins this gr he wins this like $15 million uh thing again doing good in the world and so um so anyways he creates stable diffusion and um or his company stability AI creates releases stable diffusion it kind of takes off um and he also has you you know what that thing uh what's it called like a Fantasia where it's like you say a word and it creates an image in your head or something like that or like or like emotions have colors or something like that it's like it's like these senses are linked in your brain in a way that's not normal or like numbers have smells you know the [ __ ] like that uh he has one of those what has it been cesia there's synesthesia but he has a different one uh he has another one I think called a Fantasia um anyway so he's like supporting researchers and he's trying to give the money to like open source this thing and then he's like okay I'm going to bring together 20 of the best Engineers like Manhattan Project Style and I'm going to self-fund this thing and I'm going to like uh you know we're going to create you know a project in the space and they created a staple diffusion and basically uh you know he he self-funded 600,000 and and got these 20 Engineers come in and they created this thing that's like you know taken off and now you know valued over a billion dollars and dude isn't it crazy just how bold some people are just like it just when I talked to Ryan holiday the other day for the Pod I felt inspired at the end because I was like your type of success is awesome and inspiring to me because I I too can work hard and like achieve what you achieve and then I hear a story like this guy and I'm like he just like that story just [ __ ] slapped me in the face you know what I mean like like like I just I am I am nothing and I am nobody and this guy is going to steal my lunch money that's what this that that idea just bullied me no he's not going to steal your lunch money he's going to give you lunch money and you're be like who are why did you give why are you giving me lunch money and he's just like don't even worry about it son and you're going be like wow uh thanks Dad yeah like this guy yeah I feel I feel inadequate yeah that's actually what the bil of the week section is it's really the in inadequacy of the week it's like yeah it's like ladies and gentlemen are you ready to feel like [ __ ] cuz I got a story for you this guy who's younger than better than you smarter than you richer than you did it faster than you doing the same thing you said you wanted to do but he actually did it and guess what he's also ripped and like that's how I feel about a mod uh do is there a world where he's full of [ __ ] like I said I didn't know of this guy's existence till like three weeks ago so yeah like you know there's there's definitely a world where everything I just said turns out to be like you know not true or this guy turns out to be you know he's like yeah I taught those kids math but then you know they work for me now and it's like whoa whoa whoa what's going on here like why are the kids in Kenya working for you bro there's like this commercial uh for a car commercial and there there's like a they're on the highway and it's in bumper to bumper traffic and this guy pulls off on the side of the road and starts going through this bumpy forest and uh the the guy and the passenger seat goes dude this is pretty scary have you ever uh taken this shortcut before and the guy driving goes yeah once including this time that's like uh uh you telling these stories you're just like yeah yeah yeah yeah I know all about this guy I just learned about him an hour ago yeah I'm literally reading it while I'm talking reading I'm reading my researchers notes while we're talking uh cuz I watched the interview but I wasn't taking notes because I was driving at the time and so all I remember is my feeling right what's the may angelu quote you won't remember the facts of what you're researching you'll just remember how it made you feel that's what happened to me uh you I don't remember any of the words this guy said and I didn't go fact check them but I remember how he made me feel said that yeah her famous quotes like people won't remember what you say they'll remember how you made them feel uh so it's basically that I remember how this guy made me feel and he made me feel the same way I felt when I heard vitalic talk for the first time about weak at the knees um you know vitalic when I heard him talk Zuckerberg when you hear them talk like people who are extremely Mission driven while also being slightly Asbergers and also being extremely impressive in their past accomplishments um and they're just very matter of fact about the way they think the world is going and they're not trying to Hype you up they're not trying to sell you on it it's like you asked them a question they gave you their answer and then you're like that answer just broke your frame and so you keep asking them questions and then and there it's almost like the tone of their voice is sort of like I said what I said I you know like yes this is what I believe and this is what I'm doing with my time and yes like you know yeah this is what I think is important and you're just like you know you just sort of like you look stupid when you're talking to them because you just come from like you know it's like you're speaking a different language uh you know they're speaking a language of like being Mission driven and confident and like knowing their [ __ ] and you're just like you know me you know just being silly old me trying to understand what the hell they're talking about dude this is one of those episodes that we record and I it's like I have to take a nap at the end I'm so exhausted from excitement do you ever get like that you're like uh you know like my dog like if I like feed him too many treats like in such a way where he like gets pumped up and about it he's got to take a nap just from the excitement that's how I feel like I got to go like rest my eyes like I'm going to go like I'm going to go buy a dad chair just to take this nap that I need I need to be reclined at a 34¬∞ angle and my feet needs to be above my hips yeah yeah yeah at the end of this episode I'm going to get up and make a grunting noise just because just because of not from Pain just just just out of habit [Laughter] this is uh just so fascinating to me I think this episode has had a lot of mind-blowing things I'm eager to see what people say I think that I feel just amped after I this is almost like a quit and dedicate your life to this topic type of thing you're like um almost not actually good it's like it's like other people should go it's like with someone has worked at your company forever and it's their last day you just you got to go say goodbye and hug them but they're like all the way across the room you know what I [Laughter] mean like they're like worked for you for like 10 years and you know their wife's name and their kids Nam and and you're so excited to give them a hug and tell them how much they mean to you but the couch is really comfortable and they're just all the way across they're all the way across it's gonna be at least 50 steps is AI is all the way across the room that's so good all right we're ending it on that we're out of here [Music]

it's almost easier to be great than it is to be good I had lunch with Manu Ginobili I just got inducted in the Hall of Fame this month I want to say he's a regular person because that sounds like that almost minimizes it but the point is we tend to thin fit it to be that good requires some fundamental trade-offs about what kind of person you are and what your day-to-day life looks like Tom Brady right uh Comes Back to Football you can't walk away and it may well cost him his marriage right and people see that that's what it takes I'm not sure that that is what it takes

[Music] foreign we're talking about is it's Joe Rogan interviewing Steve Jobs and we'll sell the background of how it works but basically it's both it's all AI generated and Joe Rogan is inter fake Joe Rogan is interviewing fake Steve Jobs and I got a little emotional because like I like Steve I kind of like Steve Jobs but I respect him a ton and just hearing him talk about topics that seemed modern I was like he's you know he's back from the dead you know what I mean I wouldn't exactly say he's one of my heroes but he's someone I respect and just I'm like oh my God the dead is alive again and that was let's pull it up so the way I think we should do this episode is I think we I think we focus on AI I think we show some of the stuff that has caught our attention so it's kind of a show and tell so if you're if you listen to the podcast I think you're going to want to be on YouTube right now to actually see this stuff and when you're there you're gonna want to subscribe and when you subscribe you're gonna want to share tell your friend no okay but like you do want to go to YouTube and just I don't know go to YouTube and search my first million and then then click the channel this will be uh you know the AI episode will be up there Ben is going to screen share here and Ben do we have audio let's play a little bit of the intro well let me let me give the background really quick so it's a company called play.ht um but and one of their side projects is a thing called podcast.ai and basically what they did was they gave their AI algorithm or program whatever you want to call it they gave their program uh Steve Jobs's biography uh which is and I think they actually gave him one or two of his biographies because there's two or two major ones then they basically gave they gave the program every single Steve Jobs recording I think ever or any that they could find on the internet along with every Joe Rogan episode ever and they made Joe Rogan interview Steve Jobs and in the interview it's like 25 minutes long they talk all about all types of stuff but they say some amazing things like Joe Rogan does the intro and he goes like he teases out the who who it is just like he does in real life he goes what's up freak [ __ ] which I don't even think he says anymore but he said that in all the early episodes he goes what's up freak [ __ ] uh today's guest is someone who's incredibly smart incredibly we should just play it right let it let it insufferable well he says insufferable which I thought was crazy so go ahead this podcast is brought to you by play dot HT all content is generated by artificial choice for this part listener discretion is advised hello freak [ __ ] welcome to another episode of the Bro jogan experience and on this episode I welcome my friend who's difficult to describe I'm fascinated by him and I hope you'll be too and he is weird and Brilliant and sometimes totally insufferable but my guest today has made some of the great technological products of our age and he's always pushing the envelope in Innovation like for example with his next computer he developed a new programming language and operating system and then he became even more famous for making three applications for that computer uh word processor spreadsheet and an image editor that just showed me that this dude was brilliant had amazing taste and I would just hope that I could be even like one tenth of the genius that my friend today is and I can't even say his name so yeah so super psyched about having him in the house today first time or yeah we've had you on before but not for a long time like Patrick Swayze and um Demi Moore and ghost you're a memory from the past [Laughter] so without further Ado my friend who is difficult to describe and wonderful and I'm so grateful he came on the show how's it going good to see you buddy it's been a long time since I've been on the show I've missed this it's always fun wow like just pause there okay so the things that like first the voice quality the voice quality is incredible like that sounds just like Joe Rogan it sounds just like Steve Jobs it is it has gotten so much better than like how this used to be I remember like you know when you had like the Garmin GPS in your car and you could like choose the Morgan Freeman Voice or whatever like any time you'd have like this voice robot that I was trying to say something new it sounded totally computerized and this doesn't so the voice quality is one thing the fact that it kind of like it makes more sense it makes more sense than it should like he's doing an intro it understands that he's teasing like this my friend who's here today this person's a genius but not saying who it is and what it is right away that's like a Showmanship thing that I thought was like really interesting um the back and forth banter like he gives that long intro and then Steve Jobs just kind of laughs um like you would if you had sat down for this kind of interview with Joe Rogan I just thought that was incredible the way it felt like a real conversation and obviously there's some stuff that's like you know he's talking about word processors and documents and a little too much like nobody would do that but like damn if 80 of that is not amazing and the reason I felt emotional listening to this was it's I felt both like in awe but also scared because as I was listening to this it I was agreeing with what Steve says and uh what we'll do in in a second uh Ben is fast forward like maybe 10 minutes in and basically jobs goes on this long rant about LSD saying uh you know LSD changed my life and I don't think it's for everyone but it changed my life and it opened my mind up and let me read all these books I never previously would have read and he says something like I don't I wouldn't take LSD a bunch of times in a row because I only needed it once or twice and it opened my mind and it introduced me and he goes in depth he goes it introduced me to India and it's just he talks about he's talking about God he's talking about like all kinds of things that you're like it's not just like reading a Wikipedia page you know what I mean like uh it's very philosophical he's like when people think about God they think about this but to me it's and it's like well that's a fully formed thought and philosophy and like that sounds like something somebody would say when they're having like an in-depth podcast and not just like I did this in 1979 in March when I was living in Albuquerque and then in 1981 I once again it was wasn't that it was like a very real sounding thing and he has this amazing did you hear there's this beautiful quote that he says and basically the way that this company if you ever listen to a bunch of Steve Jobs interviews you'll notice that at points it almost sounds like they're just chopping up some of his clips and just weaving them together because he has talked about this before so I don't actually know if he's ever said this particular line before but he starts talking about India and why he loves like uh that part of the world and he basically says like well it's so old and it influenced the rest of society and he goes there's an Indian epic that's ten times as long as the Bible the Quran and all these other things coming out of the Odyssey yeah that's what he says yeah he's like basically Indian history influence the rest of the world and there's an epic that's ten times as long as all these other books and I just thought that that's just like such an interesting thing he does so he doesn't say the name so it kind of leaves you wanting there but he is talking about the the Gita which is like is I think that long it's like a 16 part series or whatever it's like this really really long thing I would bet that it actually is multiples longer than the Iliad and the Odyssey so I I feel so interesting that he said that and this is the point is that when he said that I said I gotta find that book like he just sold me on this book he influenced you yeah the dead jobs influence me so Ben click play just for like 30 seconds but there is some kind of deeper meaning to life and it can't just be something that somebody made up because if it was it wouldn't be compelling it would seem contrived and everyone would see through it so I think that the meaning and the purpose is by the cosmos the nature of the cosmos which is pretty bold thinking I mean I don't know how else to put it but it's not religious in the way people usually talk about taking LSD was a profound experience for me LSD shows you that there's another side to the coin and you can't remember it when it wears off but you know it it washes over you and tells you that everything is connected you're not here by accident you were put here for a purpose and if you can figure out what that is then you'll learn more about yourself than anything else could it's pretty intense so so that quote is a real quote of his technology was a profound experience one of the most important things in my life it shows you that there's another side of the coin you can't remember it when it wears off but you know it okay so that is like an actual quote of his but it's weaved into the conversation like there's a part in the conversation where he where he says he's talking about how he's a fan of Joe Rogan he's like it's nice to just sit back in the car and listen to you rant and it's like okay so the first one where he's the the LSD you know okay he they just took a they just took you know his Goodreads section or his quotes and they're like okay cool he's he says things like this but where did how did it know to say to Joe Rogan that I love to listen to your podcast and the car just love to sit back and listen to your rant where would that have come from how how does that happen that is there's like little moments like that that are like I just don't understand this technology well enough to know how it could know to say something like that in that moment so the first half of the call he talks all about India and these like kind of platitude like life advice type of things which were pretty amazing but then the second half which bench just started playing a little bit this he talks about Google and they actually say Yahoo Ron they call it yahoo uh they put the emphasis on the wrong syllable but they uh he's he like does all these like says all these interesting quotes which I actually think are things that he said again in the past but he says stuff like you know that's the problem I've always had with Microsoft in many ways they're smart people and they've done good work but they've never had any tastes they've never had any aesthetic taste and then he goes on and he talks about Adobe and he criticizes adobe's business model and he goes uh Joe Rogan actually says what would you do to fix Adobe and job says well they've got 800 people working on adobe's business model that's just way too many people and the fact that they charge just a little bit of money for a small bits of the product it's like buying a car but only getting part of the car and having to pay more money to get the rest of the engine and he like says these criticisms about Adobe which frankly have no idea if it's true but it must have went on like a rant about this you know in the past but and and then he goes you know I had a lunch recently with Bob whatever at Adobe he like says their full name and he leads up this part of adobe and he actually agreed to me that they need to fix it and they're working on fixing it and so anyway he like actually gives almost more advice and his opinions on what I think are current events I'm not well versed enough with Adobe but it seems like current events it's pretty magical it's amazing yeah this basically was like bring bring back someone from the dead technology band do you have anything to add your uh you're a history guy what did this like do you have anything that you felt when you when you watched this I really agree with Sam it made me oddly emotional uh listening to it it also scared me a little bit just because I thought of the application of like what if like you did this to my grandpa and like what emotions would that bring back and then that like frightened me of like oh I don't know if that's a good thing to be able to experience like there's a representation my grandpa that would feel like the real thing but isn't right like where are these thoughts coming from so it's equal parts like really compelling really cool as like a treat to be able to hear well I think it's like a pretty accurate representation of how Steve Jobs would approach some of these things that are happening today but then also just like scary to realize but it's not really him and what is it really well so let me it's like a video right today you could watch a home video and it's like you see their face you hear their voice it's captured a moment in time to me this is an extension of that which is like now it's gonna be somewhat interactive that you can kind of interact with these people or hear them talk about new things uh and you know that it's not like the real thing but it's you know there's a black mirror episode that's a lot like this where the woman like uploads her boyfriend's Consciousness to like you know this robot she's kind of still dating him even though uh you know he's gone but like there's like the shadow of him that like you know can can simulate him um and I think I think there's more good than bad um Sam what do you want to say yeah so let me add two points about why this is going to give it even stranger well the first point is is is almost scary so basically in 1985 here this is a quote from Steve Jobs he goes my hope is someday when the next Aristotle is alive we can capture the underlying world view of that Aristotle in a computer and someday some student will not be only be able to read the words Aristotle wrote but ask Aristotle a question and get an answer and so Steve Jobs wrote that in 85 which is interesting now here's where things get really interesting because that's that's what he is what he's what just happened what he just described is what just happened to him it's magical now here's where things are going to get even more magical so play dot is it play dot AI or play dot HD uh so uh part of their website you can actually vote for new episodes and some of the top episodes that people have voted for is Elon Musk interviewing uh Nikola Tesla Kanye West and Bob Marley talking about music Jesus interviews God and then I believe there's Einstein and Buddha having a conversation on science and spirituality um Trump interviews himself Trump interviews himself there's Lex Friedman interviewing Richard Feynman and then there's uh Joe Rogan mediates peace between Russia and U.S and that sounds like a joke and it is a joke but it's actually an interesting tool where you're like well like let's hear Joe Rogan alert let's see if Joe Rogan can like bring together these two people different people and hear each other's perspective and we'll actually find out where one another's coming from even if it's make-believe and but it will still be like maybe that is actually how they feel and I could work through this argument so that's why this stuff is actually really really interesting and Powerful [Music]

[Music] foreign [Music] my name is Rob how do I keep my marriage and other relationships healthy when I work long hours all right it's one question Friday somebody asked a question about marriage I've been married for a few years I've been with my wife in a relationship for 10 years plus and it's a pretty great relationship someone was asking me for advice on it and I'm going to reference something that I used to do so basically I talked about this thing on this pods basically I've got this new thing I'm working on and my co-founder and I we did something interesting that seems pretty obvious to me but when I mentioned on the podcast it surprised some people but basically we kind of like both had an idea that we wanted to work on and we were like cool like this is something I'm working I would like to work on would you like to work on and he said yeah whatever and so we got a little bit of Attraction we go all right we know this book can work but let's pump the brakes stop right now and I want to have a conversation with you and what I want to know is a bunch of questions and so I said I sent him the same questions and then I went and answered them on my on my own and it basically outlined what so here's the categories it was what do I want so financially I said what I want my personal net worth to be I said that I want to have freedom I want the ability to fly private I want to live in different cities throughout the year I want to be present in my future children's and current wife's life current life you know what I mean uh I want to own a bunch of different uh real estate I want fun and Adventure I want to work hard but I want to work like a line me lion meaning I'm willing to work like in grind for many weeks but then I want to take three or four weeks off uh a year or five weeks off a year and I want to travel the world comfortably I also said that I care about influence I said I want to see at the big boys table and for people to think that I'm really good at my job and so I just said like here's like what I want in life then I we each answered a question of ways that were uh ways in which we want to get to where we want to go so basically things we're willing to do and I said I'm willing to do this I'm willing to do this and I'm willing to do this like I'm not willing to hire 10 000 employees I don't want that I'm not willing to have recurring meetings I'm not willing to do this or that I am willing to work 80 hours a week I am willing to put this first above every other project I have things like that and then finally we said like here's what we want out of this business we want to aggressively scale it or that's what I said I want to aggressively scale it I want to hit 100 million dollars in Revenue in x amount of years like so anyway really specific and then he answered this on his own and we came back together and we said all right let's see where we aligned and where we don't align because I want to figure out right away if there's any deal breakers and in fact this is what I do did when I sold my company I said um have a spot wanted to buy us and I go they sent me a cold email and they go hey we want to talk about partnership and I was like I don't know what partnership means does that mean you want to buy us just tell me right away and they said yeah we want to buy you I said cool here's a Google doc and it I list out all the reasons why you don't want to buy us and where we stink if that list is okay with you talk to me again and so they said yeah we're okay with everything on this list it's none of it's that bad and we said all right cool let's keep talking and so anyway my point is is I've learned with relationships throughout the years particularly like marriages and business relationships and with my partner or HubSpot you want to get the difficult conversations out the way early on because that will literally save you a decade of heartache and with my marriage I did the same thing this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better so my wife and I sounds kind of lame because I don't want it to sound that my like business is so important to me that it like permutates into like my marriage but in a way it kind of does but basically bye two months or three months into dating I was like hey just so you know or maybe it was six months I was like just you know like I I see us going places and like being together for a very long time and potentially marriage is that what you see and she was like yeah I was like oh awesome we're on the same page um and then we actually outlined you know how like when people say they're like yeah I want to like have a nice house with kids and all this stuff and I was like all right let's get really specific tell me how many kids do you think you want you don't need to like tell me you want exactly three kids but like give me a ballpark like where your intentions are now and I know they might change but uh give me like a ballpark on where they are okay great now how much money do you want to make each year okay cool where do you want to live oh you want to live here let's go in Zillow right now oh that house is eight million dollars so let's work backwards to like where how much that how we're gonna afford that house uh great so we understand like where we want to be or you know financially let's talk about what we're willing to sacrifice in order to get that and we listed out all those things it's like look for my uh 20s business is gonna come before uh like relationships so like meaning there's going to be a lot of times that I'm not going to be around when you need me but that's because I'm gonna be dedicating a lot of time in order to get this other goal that we have that we're going to have in our 30s things like that and so we really just outlined like very specifically where we wanted to be in 10 20 and 30 years and we did it exactly like a business where it was like here's where we want to go specifically like here's how much money we want how many kids we want the type of Lifestyle we want the type of family we want in our life um if we wanted to raise them religious or not religious like all this stuff and of course we knew it will change as we grow and get more information but anyway we did that to get that hard stuff out of the way another thing that we do which is like kind of lame but you know how a company has okrs uh which stands for objectives and key results and like you're supposed to set those quarterly we and annually you have like an annual Target and then like quarterly like benchmarks we do that for our life and so we have an adventure one we have a like relationship one we have a financial one and we have a um a a physical fitness one where it's like all right here's where we like here's what we want to do like for our health here's what we want to the trips that we want to take here's we want to be financially here's the um ways that we want to like give back to our family and spend time with them and we actually do these check-ins once a week um I use this journal that uh my friend started her name's Kat uh it's called Uh uh best self coat and she's got this relationship journal and for the longest time um we still do it but we uh would meet once a week on Friday and we would document where we are according to our goals and it's pretty successful so anyway um that's how I look at my marriage I take it like I do two things that are kind of odd but I think it works is I we kind of operate it like a business of course there's like I remember when we were getting married you have to like meet with the priest ahead of time and we were like yeah we have the same values we have the same this and he was like well do you guys love each other and we're like yeah dude obviously like of course so like I want to acknowledge that like this sounds like really regimented but there's like all that love and the important stuff is totally obviously there that's the most important thing but like logistically we do a really good job of like outlining what we want to achieve together as a family for the next quarter and the next year in the next 10 years um and then we do a really good job of like checking in weekly and monthly to discussing like are we happy with how things are going what do we need to change and things like that and I think it works really well like learning how to do these having these conversations that was actually kind of hard but I think it works so that's my tips for successful marriage but honestly a successful in a relationship I've got a lot of relationships Sean and I you know the less popular co-host of this podcast uh him and I have had a relationship for uh 10 plus years now and it's fairly harmonious but it's very harmonious um a bunch of my co-workers I've worked with now for six seven eight nine ten years um so it mostly works pretty good um these types of check-ins and conversations so anyway that's my small amount of tips for having a good marriage [Music]

with the pandemic a bunch of restaurants have gone online quote unquote they have the QR codes right and something that I think of every single time as an internet marketer is why they are not a b testing their menus and so I think someone needs to go and create a b testing software that restaurants can ingest super easily [Music] what's up Steph Steph is back uh back in the house one of the most requested return guests of all time um we should have you on more what are you doing now by the way you uh you left the hustle slash HubSpot you went to Andreessen is that where you're at still are you doing other things yeah exactly I'm at a16z I'm their new podcast host so they've had a podcast for like seven or eight years and then it went on Hiatus they looked for a new host and that's me we haven't gone live yet but we will be soon every time you come on you bring this like document that's basically like it's sort of what me and Sam do but when me and Sam do an episode we have like two or three bullet points each like three words and I have two and he has two and that's how we prepare you send this like Encyclopedia Britannica of topics ideas like half fake things in your head um so like I'm looking at this this is like seven or eight pages or something like that oh no 12 pages long so um we have a lot to choose from so where do you want to start I wanted to share this one idea I think I've actually talked about it on another couple pods but with the pandemic a bunch of restaurants have gone online quote unquote they have the QR codes right and you pull up the menu some restaurants have reverted back to the physical menu but tons of restaurants are still using these QR codes and something that I think of every single time as an internet marketer is why they are not a b testing their menus and so I think someone needs to go and create a b testing software that restaurants can ingest super easily and the basis of this is well a if you think about what has made so many internet companies successful it is the fact that they have these alternate worlds that they can a B test right Google home page are we using this font or this font I'm using this color this color Netflix you know Amazon every all of these large internet companies have used this but also there's the restaurant equivalent so the hustle did a story on this woman Michelle banesh and you can just look up design restaurant menus the hustle or something like that to get the article but we wrote about this woman who her job was literally to go redesign menus physical menus and based on her understanding of human psychology orientation there's like this Zed or Z effect on the menu and the way people scroll she was able to figure out how to get one restaurant just as an example to bring in nine dollars more per customer by redesigning their menu same products but just the orientation the order of the menu the design of it and I was thinking why aren't restaurants not using this as in now we have the QR code which allows us to direct someone to any unique link right we have the digitization of this and so you could hire someone like Michelle and she could probably figure out how to do this for you or someone should be just create a software that allows restaurants to do this they don't need to change their menu at all but they can mess around with the menu design the same way you mess around with landing page design and get higher conversion and of course the average restaurant owner is not going to know how to do this and that's why I think there needs to be just some sort of software that says hey we can increase your conversions right by 50 we can increase your average customer value by three dollars whatever it is and I I haven't seen it anywhere this is amazing um this is great I remember so I started a restaurant back in the day my very first startup was a restaurant and we were but when we finally got to launch long story short we were like um do we want to launch a physical restaurant we got to sign this 10-year lease with a personal guarantee that sounds scary and our Mentor kind of was like could you test your concept by doing delivery only and basically it was like a cloud what a cloud kitchen is today but this was back you know more than 10 years ago now where there was no doordash there was no ubereats at the time but it was like What If people could just order online what if you just had a kitchen nearby downtown there was no physical seating there's no there's no storefront you just deliver and we were like uh okay listen so we tried it and when you do that you're really conscious of well our whole menu is online so that means we could run a test to just see like what makes people order more or not and so we did the most basic of a B test the first thing we did was we were trying to lower prices and we talked to this guy Dan ariely who was um he wrote this book predictably irrational and we were like Dan uh hey we're you know three dudes trying to build this like sushi restaurant startup you know um do you know anything about the restaurant industry and he's like I know a lot about the restaurant industry he goes I get paid by companies to come in and help them with either the menu or like he told us about some experiment I think Panda Express had paid him a bunch of money to do to basically say could we get people we have healthy items on the menu and people tell us the reason they don't eat here is because it's unhealthy but nobody orders the healthy items so like what gives and he's like oh humans are predictably irrational they'll tell you one thing and then they won't do it and he the one test he had made was when you walk into a Panda Express instead of putting both items on the menu and just having you choose it was right when you walked through the door it would say there was like a little angel path it's like if you're gonna eat healthy go this way and there was like the dev you're going to eat indulgently you know like if you want full flavor go this way and when people make that choice upon walking in and then they only see a menu of those items like they were happier with their choice and they ordered more of those items and so he like figured out that was the only way he could design this restaurant to do that one thing um and so similarly he was like oh he goes oh yeah I can help your business your prices are too low and we go what do you mean like everybody says Sushi's too expensive we're trying to make it more affordable like how is that a bad thing well you know like what are you talking about man we're trying to do the people's work here he's like he's like sushi uh people like do you ever want to if I told you you can eat cheap sushi would you want that and he's like no and he's like you know he's like so just like the you know wine industry uh people buy expensive things because it makes them feel good that they bought a higher quality thing so he goes just test the price so we did it we basically upped the price 50 on one menu versus the other we just a b tested it and we had like higher conversion rate on the higher price which is crazy um like not even just it netted more money it was higher conversion rate on the higher price so that was like the first time I saw this like menu a b testing I mean think about how big of a lift that is like if you can convert every customer at a higher rate at a higher dollar amount that's like you know meaningful in an industry that's like 10 margins and so we did that then we tested other things like uh instead of just saying you know this is a whatever this is like the Philadelphia roll we use salmon it's like Alaskan salmon hand caught Alaskan cinnamon farm caught hand hand you know handled Alaskan salmon or whatever we just started adding all these extra words that were like nothing change nothing they were all true but it's like always fresh never Frozen Alaskan salmon hand caught by a farmer near you and it's like oh people like love that and then they would buy more and so you could see these little menu tricks now what I didn't think of which is your your genius idea is how do you actually turn that into a business where you could become an agency that does this for companies you could become a piece of software that does this as AV testing of QR codes um you could do this with physical menus also by the way like you could just give out two different versions of the physical menu and say and just track the tickets and be like cool we know what the what the checkout is for both um for how much they spend on both sides and we can just prove to you that menu design a is better than b and like you know your current menu was designed by like your niece who knows Photoshop so like you know I think we can do better than that and if we do that if we beat your current menu then you pay us you know 50 a month and we'll keep running tests for you yeah I think this is actually a really really great idea yeah I think the key difference I mean you always look for inflection points I think you guys say or changes and so before you're right you could do this with physical menus but you know the data is so much harder to get and you have to like match up the physical menu with the POs software you're using but now I don't know what the percentage is but we all know a ton of restaurants are using these QR codes and so they're already they've like taken the major step that they went before of digitizing the experience and so now what you need to do is just apply those analytics and so some company needs to just go create the software ideally it integrates into the POS so you just literally can pop out a report at the end but even if you don't have it integrating with the POs I think you can even just like look at oh how long does someone spend on this menu versus this menu how are they scrolling yeah what items are being sold I don't think you would even need to because you're basically so basically they'll scan the QR code and it's like you know Google optimize or optimizing one of those they'll enter an ABS exactly and then you're gonna pass the the final value Here's the final cart that they're checking out with to the you know to to the thing and when it's in person uh like in restaurant like they check out uh with everything you know they don't they don't like they don't walk away you know they actually do order food so you can kind of like bet pretty heavily on that I wonder if people would also do this with uh doordash or ubereats like yeah could I be a service that just optimizes your doordash listing with photos menus copy and like if you're a national chain that's in like you know whatever thousand cities and I can get you an extra half a point conversion or extra two dollar you know cart size that's pretty meaningful for for these uh you know these restaurants that are on on these delivery platforms yeah I was thinking about that too because ubereats menus are always so long and you know there's like that what's it called where you have too many options um paralysis by analysis or whatever exactly exactly yeah and also ubereats will have three or so items at the top of like our most popular items and I don't know if Uber actually selects that for the restaurant but if you had the option and actually if you're an engineer at Uber working on this like create a platform where people can a B test right on ubereats so that they feel like that's a platform where they're making more money versus doordash versus their own like that's a value add passed if someone created their own online menu that people ordered from uh which would make obviously more sticky for people to stay there well I looked at the startup that was I know this works because I looked at the startup I was doing exactly this what they were doing was they would go to a local mom-and-pop restaurant that was like let's say Chinese food they'd say great you know Mr Hans Chinese you know great you're you're everybody loves you locally and now you're on doordash but like your photos are kind of crap your you know your descriptions are all off you're not saying what foods are vegan even though they are vegan you're just you don't list them um like you're just not optimized so what he would do is he would partner with the restaurant and he would just create a shadow like a like a clone of the brand but he would call it like you know um like choo choo Chinese like it would be like a more like catchy name the all the photos are super bright um so it's like you know on a backdrop of like orange or red or whatever and like really good looking photos and they would trim the menu down he'd be like look people come in here they want like fried chicken and they want dumplings and they want this and that and so he would just do like this is just these items um he wrote better copy he took better photos and then all it was was when an order gets placed on those restaurants that same restaurant just gets a ticket they don't even it's like they don't even know it's like from this other brand basically and then later they would send them packaging that's like hey if it comes in through this Regis this like uh ticket printer um put it in the choo choo Chinese like box don't put it in Mr Hans like you know like local box um and so they just create a separate packaging so he's like yeah we have 200 restaurants we do like you know 17 million in gmv and we operate none of these restaurants they were already restaurants that already existed all we did was just Rebrand them for Postmates and ubereats and doordash and I was like oh my God like this is like a mind-blowing idea that yeah actually works he's like yeah they love it because they get like 30 extra Revenue just because we're better at marketing on those platforms than they are and um I wonder how they do it now I actually haven't caught up with them I didn't I didn't end up investing because I was like I don't know where this goes like this I feel like this could just get like banned or blocked in one second but like uh it was a fascinating idea and that guy was really talented who was doing it yeah uh one more thing on the idea of food have you seen that I think it's the FDA their food pyramid or at least in Canada that's what we called it the food pyramid and you have like all these grains and they're like eat this much bread and and they're rethinking that have you seen that they're they're really well they should right carbs the foundation like fruit was this time fruit and vegetables were this like they shared a little section like they had bunk beds at the top of the pyramid it was crazy yeah they were uh you know people got upset because I mean a simple example is they'd be like nuts no nuts too much fat and then they'd be like butt white bread okay you know they're foundational and so uh they're coming out with a new food pyramid of sorts and that impacts I didn't know this but foods can uh apply the word healthy to their products like you know Brands you could like actually have the word healthy on your cereal box as an example based on this food pyramid or some sort of requisites and they're changing that and I just thought I don't know if there's a business idea here but I feel like there's going to be a ton of content a ton of changes coming out because of this because I mean the food pyramid was pretty foundational and so I don't know what the business idea here is but it's just like one of those uh there's there's got to be something here well that's a good inflection I'll give you another inflection like that that I was thinking about over the weekend um so you know like the law change that allows College athletes to monetize their brand or face called nil name and like this and um so that came into effect this year and so now now College athletes can get paid for example when we did our MFM camp we paid uh puff Johnson this basketball player at North Carolina to come like drop in and play pickup with us it was just a cool moment it's like oh yeah here's like this guy who's gonna be in the NBA in a couple years like he's just he's just playing with us and we paid him I don't even know what like 200 or something like that to show up for for an hour and he's like cool like I got nothing else going on on a Saturday like I'll go pick up 200 bucks and by the way he was an awesome guy um so that's a little like Market that's gotten created I was like I was asking Ben I was like how did you book him like what'd you use and he's like I just dm'd him on Instagram and I was like oh interesting there's no there's not really a great Marketplace yet that's connecting College athletes to the like people who want to pay them for their you know just to to do an appearance or a sponsorship whatever there's some people trying but nobody's like don't know there's going to be one company that just owns this here's the liquidity it's like we got all the athletes and then like because of that we got all the brands and we take care of all the transactions and you don't need to use Instagram DMS and like venmo like it just all happens to your platform and we have all the reporting that we hand over to the universities so I think that's like a big idea is like create Angel list for like you know the nil Marketplace the second thing is just what opportunities does this open up so Dave Portnoy who runs Barstool they jumped on this pretty early they're like oh great we'll have a Barstool athlete program where you can sign up to be a Barstool athlete which will help you get these deals and uh they came out they're like we're taking zero percent cut on these deals I don't know how or why but they just decided to say that and um and he's like we have 200 000 College athletes as part of this now some some like huge number like that that's insane so I was thinking I was like man so many different products and brands have been built off influencer marketing everything from you know movement watches which were like early to Instagram like influencer marketing and built 100 million dollar watch brand um you know Sugar Bear Hair you know they got the Kardashians to be take pictures with this gummy you know biting this little blue gummy and that became like this iconic look and then that became like again 100 million dollar like you know uh supplements brand and so now I'm thinking well all of a sudden overnight you now can tap into the influencer marketing of college athletes across the country and probably very few brands are doing this just yet and you could almost create a company just working backwards from all right if I could get every influential College athlete to post something what product should I make that's going to work best with their audience and like their trust and all that stuff because it's kind of an unsaturated marketing channel right now in an unsaturated marketing channel right now is like worth it can be worth like 100 million dollars if you can if you can be the first to figure it out that debt platform and so you could kind of think about what products would Their audience buy because now I can reach them for a very low cost and they this couldn't this literally couldn't happen before so you have this inflection change and so I think that's another like brainstorm that somebody could do and figure out what product would fit that category and just work backwards from the distribution what would you do do you have any thoughts on if you were to choose that as your Channel people talk about like Channel Market but what what product would you create well so so thinking on the Eco like kind of the e-commerce side just for a second so I was like all right you can uh and I don't know if eCommerce is the best like I think probably like some credit card or debit card or something like that is probably the best like if you could basically go get you know um a million people A million college students to start using your credit card because you got you know 100 000 athletes to just say like oh I'm using this and sign up for this bonus Point program and you get a you know whatever 500 credit for spring break or whatever I don't know you could come up with some offer but you distribute it through these athletes and you basically say cool if I if I get at age 18 to 21 somebody to pick my credit card what's that Worth to me um and I think that's probably like you know one of the best categories you could be in but if it's not that let's just take e-commerce for a second like I think that you want the you find that you would first go to the class of the best e-commerce products to like high purchase rate high like kind of lock-in basically high margin um you know low shipping why like native deodorant was such a great product it weighed less than a pound so you could ship it in a normal envelope so shipping was low cost it's repurchased because you wear deodorant every day and you run out of it every whatever two three months and so you're gonna keep buying in um it's high margin like it only costs this much to make and they could charge whatever 20 bucks to to sell a two pack and so like it had a lot of the traits that make for a great product and so I would try to figure out like whether it's like protein powder or like athletic greens or you know like some you know like sparkling water brand or like you know some Seltzer smelly water oh yeah smelly water I try to figure out some product like that that's like Mass Appeal high margin High repeat purchase rate and then I would just like work backwards from that and I wouldn't do you know products that are like you know big one-off purchases with the low repurchase I just try to stay away from those so I would go look at the winners of like current e-commerce and then I would try to you know retrofit those and be like would that like particularly hit with a um a college ground like I think like an energy drink would be like amazing uh like I think I think if you could do like you know whatever Red Bull rock star type of thing is if you could just make like the next the next either you know um vitamin water or or energy drink I think that's probably the the strongest one but if it's not that then some kind of like subscription product like maybe deodorant or um I don't know something like that this is probably where I'd go for it deodorant would work you can be like don't smell on the court or some you know cheesy thing like that but yeah I think deodorant would actually be well you could also like just if it's like just riffing on that you could take the deodorant Brands and you could like make it specific you could make the sense specific to the to the campus so like you know whatever whatever the name like you know you have like Longhorn you know whatever for UT and then you have like the names of the scents that like kind of fit that market it's the same scent you're just labeling it differently depending on where it's at but you're now pulling into that kind of like brand Affinity they already have with their with their campus or whatever else and it makes sense for the athlete to be promoting that because it's like again they're like a college athlete for that school maybe you could do some things like that to like juice how um you know how attractive it is I kind of love that because I I'm just you know my marketing hat is on and there's so many taglines you could be like sniff out your competitors or like you know you you could imagine these internet Wars of like oh man that like that University is sent sucks or that like high school like have you smelt that like that that stuff's nasty or like you know people actually competing on which which college has you know for every every stick that's bought here we you know drop one stink bomb at your rival school like that's like some some way to like you know compete with the other schools nice I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better okay let's do a quick one which is I actually saw this in the trends newsletter a while ago I didn't write this but um it was the stat which is the average person spends one and a half thousand dollars after a breakup I have no idea where the stack came from but definitely got the wheel spinning and they came up with a bunch of different ideas which I think actually are getting some traction divorce party ideas is something that gets search volume breakup cake um people throwing their own breakup parties and I was just like huh I don't know if there's you know specific brands that are taking this on but I was like huh that that's that one and a half thousand dollars don't know where it came from but there's something there that's like if I'm if I'm F Jerry you know that like Instagram account and they have these like they built a kind of like a little media Empire they have a bunch of other accounts but they also have products they make like they made that that card game I think they they make some products yeah if I was if I was one of those accounts I would be jumping on this I would basically say all right it's already viral it's meme worthy it's it's remarkable people are gonna talk about this so how do I make you know like the best breakup cake delivery service or yes um you know like uh the Revenge body kit and it's like you know we send you this like the seven day detox um where you said you're like a healing Crystal we send you like a juice cleanse and whatever else to like you know get that person out of your out of your life so you're gonna get the bad juju you know away and I'd be like you know this is called bad juju or whatever and I would just try to create like a viral product through that um because I think it's on brand and I think it has like enough demand where there's you could see this doing you know two to ten million dollars a year all organic yeah just because the product is so viral um you know it's probably not going to be enormous but there's a there's enough of a niche there especially if you're one of these accounts because you already got distribution or you're somebody who goes to those accounts and partners with them and says hey I got the right product for you guys let's do you know some kind of profit share and I'll run this business and you guys just help me promote this like you know uh whatever like the breakup vodka and it's like you know this is the break of vodka kit or whatever you know whatever the thing is yeah I mean I'm imagining you know all the tropes of someone gets broken up with and they become super fit and like they get a PhD and they just become like the best version of themselves after the breakup doesn't always happen but you could imagine something like that even less work it's like what's those what are those like voodoo dolls where you like poke it and you're like you know you're just sending like ill will towards them you could just like upload a photo of your person we print you a doll that looks like you know like close enough like them and like you can do that that reminds me of did you see that startup empty it was fake did you did you hear about this it's I think it was you know it had the silly spelling to it was like e-m-p-t-i or something and it was a fake startup that people thought was real and basically they sent people these empty boxes um and the whole idea was like look we send you these empty boxes and there's some like motivational quote from Buddha in it and it's like you know rid yourself of all the things you don't need in your life and the idea is that people are supposed to take all their junk put it in these boxes and send it to this company for free but they pay this company to send them these boxes um but it was a fake startup and all these people are writing about it they're like oh this is so smart like what a cool company yeah exactly it was a joke but yeah actually you could do that with this too you could send them the breakup box it's like put all their crap in this all their crap they've left in your house that reminds you of them put it in this send it to us and we will send you a video of us like burning this box in this like epic way and like you get to have that at the end that's it those are the types of ideas you could do with this nice so you were right before we started reporting you were starting to tell me you go here's my theory of why people like this podcast and what is your theory okay so there are many reasons to love my first million I think there's something that you guys have done especially recently when you and Sam just go back and forth and you tell a really funny joke and then Sam just starts laughing hysterically like in a contagious way that most people would hold back maybe on a podcast but it's it's literally as people say like you're in the room with him and it reminded me of this subreddit I found recently called r slash contagious laughter 4.5 million people subscribe to this and it's one of I think the top hundreds subreddits out there and it's literally just a feed of people laughing and there's there's dozens of posts every day and I I was just as I went down it I was like there's gotta be a post of Sam and Sean well okay let me tell you a couple interesting things about this first I think this must I think the subreddit must be kind of like almost like new or growing faster recently right because I hadn't heard of this subreddit before and I kind of keep an eye on on the top ones but maybe I just missed it but I I've also seen this trend on Tick Tock I don't know if you've seen it somebody will be like I'm a clinical psychologist and I can make you happier in the next 10 seconds repeat after me huh and there's like a duet so that guy's like hot excuse like haha and you're just like okay I see where this is going and then she just gets like haha and like by the end both people are just cracking up like because it's like 10 Deep and uh you can't help yourself like the body will just start like genuinely laughing just from making the sound like it goes both ways it's not like something funny happens therefore I break out laughing it's like if you break out laughing intentionally you could just like it could it's like something funny just happened basically and um yeah and so I've thought about this like contagious laughter thing in two ways one is as if I was thinking about the podcast and I was like I was watching I was watching the all land pod and um I love that podcast but they do something that really bothers me which is one of them will crack a joke and the other guys don't what I call Selva joke like they don't laugh um and I don't know if they don't laugh because they're trying to they're a they don't think it's funny B it's not that they're trying to keep it serious or see they might just edit it where they just don't use the audio track from someone because it kind of makes it a little choppy because you're using one on top of the other but it totally changes the vibe of something when um in a podcast especially when the other person actually sells your joke like if you if you try to crack something and I go with it or and this works for for other things on my first million too I call it the homie move where Sam would be like do you know how many people buy this thing and I know it's probably a high number if he's telling me like that but I'll be like I don't know what like like 100 and just to give them they're like no dude a million and like I give them that like assist basically and so there are several things like that where you got to kind of sell the other person's thing and it's not fake it's just like be expressive like laugh hard react big that stuff works when it comes to content and people are very shelled up about that sort of thing um I don't know if that that is in line with what you're talking about totally one of the funniest moments on my first million was your Orlando Bloom story which I think if I just heard you telling it by yourself I'd be like yeah that's pretty funny but Sam's laughter layered onto that where he was you could just tell he was dying as you were telling that story just made it honestly top five moments on my first million history for me but that's why I think this subreddit is so great even in their rules or their like Community guidelines you know how someone posts something and there's typically a bot that says hey report this if X Y and Z on that subreddit it's like report this if you're laughing at a joke or some sort of incident and not the laughter specifically they're like we only want you to be on here to hear other people laughing so I don't know I just thought that was like a fun a fun thing and reminded me of why I think some people love my first million it's just so authentic well you're you're about to do a podcast and do you remember what I told you my advice to you when it came to to doing a podcast I don't know if you remember this this is a couple years ago now I actually don't you should tell me I was like um don't be too normal or I was like you're too normal I was like you need to be um yeah like to me the ideal podcast guest is like half insane um and what that means is like there's things that they're not even aware of that are inside like Sam has a ton of these where he's like dude I was thinking you know you know you think about like what happens if someone broken right behind me right now and tried to kill me I'm like no I don't think that the fact that you think I think that means you're kind of insane like you're not even aware of that that's a weird thing you're doing you think that other people do that too and then the second is like being willing to say something crazy stuff like that uh and then the third is like they don't hedge um and like try to downplay like most people are basically taking their own little volume knob and turning it down all the time just because they want to fit in and so the best thing you could do if you want to be a personality on the Internet is like you can't have that I'm trying to fit in turn the volume down thing you gotta like turn it up if anything um and so that was my theory on it now I do think I might be wrong because like there's people like Lex Friedman or whoever who are successful with their podcast and like you know it's like you know Lex is not you know his volume is like down to two basically he's a very monotone calm normal person and people people do end up loving it so I don't think my theory was was entirely correct but I do think it helped to have like you know a bit of a screw loose and like you know you're a very stable smart person you don't have that much of a screw loose I think you're almost playing from behind uh when it comes to internet content no I think you're right I so in preparing for every episode that I do I go and listen to that person on other podcasts and it's crazy how they get asked exact same questions everywhere they go because there's just kind of a template of like okay so tell me about your life like tell me why you went this direction in your career and I think you've even talked about this on my first million you're like we don't do that we we ignore all the questions that we know everyone's gonna ask I guess maybe some people want to hear but we ask you like the real stuff like how much do you make like what keeps you up at night like when have you failed or like even more than that you actually just ask the questions that people probably want to hear yeah there's this there's this great thing that happens if you always ask questions like that you it's like a get out of jail free card it's like well that's just what he does versus if you just try to Spring that on one person it's something like Whoa it's a little intrusive there but it's like oh that's just stick that's this that's the show stick like that's what they do um then you can get away with being a little more blunt and so uh you know cultivating like an image of being you know sort of a don't give an f slash blunt personality has all these advantages because people just create new rules for you they're like ah you know if a normal person did this yeah I would feel wrong but that's that's just Sean being Sean that's just Sam being Sam man you're like whoa okay I just get to be that uh that's awesome that is awesome wow okay that's good let's keep going what else you got cheating scandals everyone's talking about it chess poker fishing I even saw Irish dance in a newsletter recently so every you know cheating's everywhere but uh well if people are out of the loop frame it frame it for them about what what other controversy these okay so I don't know all of them in depth but I've been following the chess one pretty closely Magnus Carlsen World chess champion played Hans Neiman several weeks ago uh Neiman beat him but then there was all this controversy after where Magnus was acting sketchy and then eventually came out with this statement saying hey I believe Hans cheated I can't speak to exactly why and then there has been a history of Hans cheating in the past as well so there's all of these people on the internet who are taking sides and saying no Hans has been really good how could you cheat over the board and then there's people who believe in Carlson and are like no he's had a history of cheating we just don't know how and then there's been a similar poker controversy and then a fishing one where they were stuffing fish with like lead balls and so I think a bunch of people have just you know become fascinated with this idea that oh my gosh people are cheating even though they have been for a long time but um I have a couple ideas around the idea of cheating but I first want to hear your take like what do you think about these cheating scandals well there's something very seductive about them I don't know about you but like I don't follow chess normally but when it came to this I was like God damn it if I don't have to get to the bottom of this like you know here goes four hours of like YouTube rabbit holding to figure out and I don't it's not even like it's a better entry point for me than just this person is great or this was a great match it's like here's the controversy oh what is it right and it goes back to this thing that uh I remember Dana White said once Dana White's the president of the UFC and he goes I go they were like you know UFC is kind of the syringe small thing but you're saying it's going to be huge why do you believe that he goes I believe that because if you go to a park or a playground right now and you've got a basketball court people are playing basketball you got a football field people playing football you soccer over here baseball over there and then somebody screams fights and there's a fight going on guess where everybody's head's turning to the fight and that was his whole thesis of like why I think the UFC is going to be big because fighting is this Universal Universal thing that just gets you to turn your neck whether you wanted to or not and it's actually kind of played out the UFC's become This Global sport you know a five billion dollar plus company and um and it succeeded in places where you know like football doesn't really translate into Europe or Asia but fighting does fighting you know like there's Chinese the Chinese viewership is big in the UFC so is Russian and so is you know wherever every little country so I think controversy is kind of the same thing uh where like I wasn't that into chess until I found out that there might be this like Scandal what's the Scandal I gotta know and um and then you look at the evidence and you're like well there's two kind of like interesting components one is like how did how would somebody cheat that's kind of interesting it's sort of like a Ocean's Eleven like how did they rob the bank type of thing uh because you know you're sitting there at a chessboard it's not online so you know this guy had been he had been caught cheating online admitted to cheating online and many people cheat online they basically have a program running because you know AI can play chess better than a human can um but then you have how is he cheating over the board and there was this then somebody threw out this crazy uh Theory which was that the anal beads yeah he's got anal beads you know basically up his butt that vibrate and tell him you know what to what move to make or whatever and so I and and the way that Magnus did it kind of added to it so he first when he got beat it was big news because Magnus is the greatest player in the world maybe the greatest player of all time he then goes online and he tweets out this thing like um he tweet out like a meme or a quote from a soccer coach it was like you know I can't if I say what I want to say I'll get in trouble and people are like what is he trying to say then he comes out with a statement saying I think he cheated then he plays him again and one move or two moves into the match he just uh resigns he basically quits and walks away um again sort of like saying I'm not gonna play with this cheater and um and so some people are like is this just sour grapes and other people are like no he knows something but he's not said why he thinks he's cheating yet and then over probably because he doesn't know right well like I don't think that he thinks that Hans cheated but he doesn't know how and that's probably why he hasn't been descriptive about it because he's like I think this guy's cheated there's two pieces of evidence one is just he says he didn't look like he was trying like the guy beat me I'm the greatest player in the world and I know what it looks like when people try to beat me they're very focused and concentrated he barely looked like he was paying attention yet he played basically a perfect game in BP that was his first thing was just like I didn't feel like he tried and he beat me um so that was the first piece of evidence and the second was people went back and looked at all of his like past games as he ranked up because he's had like this crazy rise from like you know a normal great player to like Grand Master or whatever top ranked player and they and they did this thing where they basically can put your game history back in this like chess solver engine and see how close to perfect how close to AI did you play and like the greatest players of all time have played like at 62 or 72 percent of their moves matched you know like what the AI would do like perfect moves and he's had like several mini games where he's at 100 and like the greatest players ever will have like no games at 100 during their like rise to the top and so it's sort of fishy on that front like you know really this guy's making like 100 Game Theory optimal moves uh and the greatest players ever at best are like at 70 and so that those are the kind of pieces of evidence against him but still nobody knows how he did it if he if he is indeed cheating yeah exactly so I used to play chess competitively as a kid and both of those are very compelling arguments the first one especially like if you've ever played chess across the board if you're in a tough situation certainly if you're playing the world chess champion you are concentrating so hard I think there's stats that say like you know a full chess match can burn like a thousand calories or whatever if you're sitting at the board for several hours and so I think that's really compelling my question is a how do you prove that someone's cheating I don't know if you can I think you can prove someone has the intent to cheat if you catch them with like yeah some anal beads or something in their shoe but how do you actually prove that someone has cheated and then I'm also curious to know how these you know like the Chess Federation Etc how are they going to change the way they operate to catch the shooting in the future I don't I don't know I guess they make people walk through a metal detector but um right yeah you can always do that yeah exactly like and I'm not going to get caught once you know it's just like you know in the Olympics you have you saw or wada who basically the agencies that are supposed to catch you from doping but what happens is guys go to the Olympics they test clean they break all the records and oh they're a natural athlete and then six years later wada updates their tests so they can test for new stuff uh that's new to them but the athlete had it all along and then they go back to Tesla samples and they're like oh turns out they were doping right and this has happened like a few times in in the Olympics and in High Level Sports And so there's this problem of like it's this cat and mouse game between cheaters and the in the and the sort of like the anti-cheat but anti-cheat is actually a really interesting business-like category so I didn't really know much about this until we started building a startup that was in the gaming space this was the company that ended up getting acquired by twitch but when we were building in the space we would play games in the office just for fun we'd play fortnite played OverWatch played a bunch of bunch of different games like that and um and then you you sort of see two things one is like wow the importance of like um this sort of hand-eye coordination aim basically being able to aim and shoot uh in these games is like critical and then there's like you'll play somebody and you're like oh my God like as soon as I peek around the corner boom I get headshot immediately perfectly one time every time by the same guy and it's like oh it's an Aimbot it's like basically somebody's using a basically like a piece of software that will automatically just aim for your head every single time more than a human can do and so then the games have all these anti-cheat mechanisms built in to prevent that because it's I mean it ruins the game when you have uh when you have cheaters and so at the highest levels and these games now have like a really big competitive scene Esports like they have to figure out how to catch this and so you have a software game and then you have software anti-cheap which is different than like the Olympics or this like chest metal detector thing where it's a it's an offline game now you do offline offline anti-cheat and so I think that the offline world needs to sort of learn more from the gaming World about anti cheat because there's these companies that are quite big that are anti-cheat providers to all games because each game individually can't build the security system that's going to stop every you know potential form of cheating and so there's just individual companies that are like we are anti-cheat software every game becomes our customer and we can use them and so I think that's what's gonna have to happen which is that you're going to have to have like anti-cheat companies that are security systems basically for the for the competitive Integrity of the games and I think chess and poker and you know fishing and others are going to have to like ramp up in this area um But the irony is this is the best thing that's ever happened to us best thing since Queen's Gambit right more attention than ever uh on these things yeah I mean there's like conspiracy theories which is like Huns and Magnus are in this together and like they're they're associated with chess.com and they're all doing this to just like hype up chess which I don't think is true but I mean it's kind of crazy when you think about fishing for example how was the fact that there was lead balls in a fish not caught earlier I mean I think you're right that some of these in-person sports are just like way behind on the concept of cheating which is ancient uh so I'm interested to see how that progresses but one idea um like you said there's gonna be this wave of measures that needs to be put in place and I just thought of this this thing that I saw you guys have had Peter levels on the podcast before and he had so Nomad list is one of his companies and for ages people kept trying to copy Nomad list there was all these companies were like we're gonna hire 10 engineers and we're gonna just like smash you right because you're one engineer and and we're just gonna take all your data and he would just for fun uh put in fake data so there was this country or city that he put in called dorobo and he would just do that to be like who copied my data set just to see which I kind of loved and I am I was trying to think through how that maybe could be applied elsewhere I don't know if it could be applied to chess but you could imagine like what if stockfish just had just had like a couple incorrect moves right that would catch the cheater it's like oh you played G4 you were not supposed to play G4 if you were a great player you would know otherwise and I just wonder what other kind of spoofs or like tricks you could put in as anti-cheating measures well I don't know if you saw this uh I was looking at I was on Twitter this morning and I saw that Elon had tweeted um at somebody this story as that was pretty interesting so somebody tweeted at Elon they go hey Elon back in the day you had this 2008 I think there was somebody who was leaking internal company data and um they kept leaking into news outlets it was bad for business and then you found them uh I'm curious how did you find them when it when it had happened and he goes actually it's an interesting story because normally elon's tweets are just memes but he's like actually it's an interesting story we sent everybody in the company the same email but with one slightly different space somewhere in the email um so like we would you know between this period we would either do two spaces or one space but we it was a long email so we were able to create like a unique fingerprint for everybody in the company we sent them all a slightly unique uh email that was like sort of like binary proof that this was your email that got out and it's like so we found the person that way you know we caught them sort of immediately it was the fastest path to catching them versus going through all the email like servers and like patting people down as they leave the the leave the factory like how are we gonna find this person and that was the best way to do it was to put out something juicy that was false space out the thing differently and then they caught the person immediately and he's like you know that we we you know we asked them to pursue a career in another company and like a way of saying it yeah that's so clever yeah so I'm interested to see how this progresses because I do Wonder it's like who who wins did the cheaters win do the anti-cheating measures win historically I mean in gaming what was the case like could the anti-cheating measures keep up with the cheaters no like the the best cheater is always one step ahead because you know there's always a the bigger the more money involved the bigger the incentive to cheat and so you're anytime you have a big pot of money you're gonna find people are going to cheat this is why you know PayPal and Facebook and others they they have so much so much staff every day dedicated just to catching cheers and um because there's a huge amount of money involved in it this is why people love Bitcoin they're like wow if somebody could have hacked this or spoofed this or done a double spend there is a literally like half a trillion dollar prize for the taking and because it hasn't that just shows you how secure this is so it's like the absence of a hack shows a security and so with with anywhere there's a lot of money there's going to be an incentive to cheat and there's always the hardest part is that it's usually not sophisticated so for example in the if you followed the poker one that's been going on it's like this that this uh like high stakes game in La that they stream the game and so they have like a twitch Channel or whatever where they're streaming the game so it's like kind of like the World Series of Poker but just going on all the time people are playing for like each person has like 100 or 300 000 on the table so you get these pots and like half a million dollar pots and this girl makes this This Woman's playing this hand and she plays it in a way that kind of makes no sense she has Jack four off suits and doesn't make any sense why you would even be in the hand uh the board has no Jacks no fours and it has a flush draw has a straight draw the other guy has both and he Betsy bats she you know she calls it all in when she has nothing and she wins the hand and people are like there is no way you could make that call like there's no you're holding those cards the only explanation is you looked at your cards wrong and you thought you had something else but she kind of like if you read the audio is there too where she's like no I don't have it right she's basically saying I don't have uh they're like do you have a three she's like no I don't have a three um and so she's basically she's like oh you know I just did this as a bluff catcher and literally the guy's face when she calls at first he's like oh you got me I didn't have it you caught my bluff but then she turns over her cards and he's like okay you caught my bluff but you caught my bluff with that that makes zero sense that you would ever try to even catch a bluff with that and he's literally stone-faced for like a minute and a half he doesn't say anything he's just looking and his eyes are just moving between the table and her and he's like you could tell the computer and his brain is like breaking it's like there's no way this could have happened he is detected basically in an anomaly and a an anomalous move that has to be something like cheating like there's no other explanation it's not about how somebody could make you know a 200 000 bet on with those cards unless you knew what my cards were and what's coming out and so um and so they like launched this investigation and like I think Reddit and YouTube are great at that where they like crowdsourced the investigation they're like finding old clips and they're like more than any police officer could do you know put Reddit on the case like when they found the Boston Bomber or whatever I don't know if that ended up being true or not but like it's the same idea and so they're showing basically what it looks like happened was just there's a human input in the production team who was probably feeding her the information and she had like a vibrator device on her like in her pocket or in her pants or something like that um that was like signaling her just like if it vibrates that means you're good uh like call the bet if it doesn't vibrate that means you don't have you're not winning full and um that's what people think is the like sort of most likely explanation for this at this point but that's hard because it's human engineering and like um there's this conference that happens every year I forgot the name of it but you might know it's in Vegas and it's like the hacker conference I don't know if you've heard it's like Defcon or something like that it's like oh that's familiar yeah it's basically it's the number one like hackercon hacker convention like you know like I don't know why anybody would go to this it's like you know walking into a you know a shark Den basically but one thing that they showed like I kind of went down this Rabbit Hole of like what what do they talk about at this thing and one thing they showed is just how much of like hacks is not like brilliant Computer Engineering it's somebody just calling you and being like hey I'm just verifying some information with the bank here could you just tell me your mother's maiden name and your date of birth and your last four of your Social all right thank you you're confirmed nothing else to worry about and then they just take that and they call the bank and they say hey I need to change my password can you change it for me I forgot what my old one is but you know oh my security questions yeah my mother's maiden name is this and here's my last four and then they get the password change to take all your money and they didn't hack in the system they just literally like they catfished you right they sort of like uh the you know human engineering they basically just like trick you into giving up information and that's how a lot of the big hacks happen is they just trick a human into giving them their password and then they don't need to break in it's like you gave me the keys I can just walk right in exactly that's why Sim swapping is like one of the unfortunately super common ways of hacking people because people will just go into like an ATT and be like hey I'm this person this is my phone number I lost my sim could you give me a new one and they just get that um and so yeah it's it definitely humans are the like faulty piece there's a great business that came out of this Insight which was there's many of them now but but when I heard this I remember thinking oh my God that is a genius it's basically a business that goes to companies and they say hey the number you know that 90 of these hacks happen just because your your employee is going to just type their password on the wrong page and they're like yeah I guess that's true yeah they go so here's what we're gonna do we're gonna send false phishing emails to your employees and um but don't worry like you know when they type it in we're just gonna give you a report every month because you're paying for a contract which is just to say this employee click this link and this would have been a breach oh thankfully we caught it you can now educate the employees better and we you know this is a way to like you know make sure that your your employees are not going to fall for this and um and those companies do extremely well because it's way cheaper to like prevent the hack that way just by having somebody kind of stress test your employees in that way try to break through the system and just say hey here is where we found a vulnerability and um I thought that was just like a genius business category to be in yeah I I have a co-worker that fell for one of those recently and she was like oh man I got to do this training but I was like really that's all we have to do we just got to do a little bit of training like this seems pretty faulty if all these employees are clicking on this but I kind of love the idea of ethical hacking have you seen there's been someone recently I think their their code name or their hacker name is like bjorkska or something and they've hacked into three of Indonesia's like large government databases and at first people were like oh man this is just Indonesia is a huge country right in terms of population they're like oh they've got like Millions hundreds of millions of Records the first time and then the second time they were like oh my gosh this happened again like this person has way too much data but by the third time they were like this person is just exposing how fragile all of our systems are because they haven't you know sent the data anywhere they're just like you guys you have to fix this and they're just like using proof to show it instead of saying you know going to people and tweeting like our systems are really insecure or whatever instead they're just like let me just show you and I think it's uh I mean I think have you heard of whiz I think that's like enter some sort of Enterprise security software uh it was the fastest or at least one of the fastest that hit 100 million ARR recently like faster than deal faster than a lot of the companies that we're familiar with yeah just Wiz right I think that's the the name of it with Cloud security yeah exactly yeah they had they came out with some I've never heard of this company it's like hey we're the fastest growing company in the world exactly and they do is this what they do they do the sort of like bug Bounty stuff yeah 100 million errors 18 months I don't know exactly what they do but I just know there's some sort of Enterprise security software and uh yeah they're like quietly the the biggest fastest we're not the biggest the fastest growing company in a while yeah that's insane all right enough uh enough hacking and cheating and stealing uh although I do I just I love that stuff I can't get enough I love the controversy I know same let's do these internet portfolios so I think these are these are pretty cool I I think these are good inspo for people and you've curated a group of them let me just kind of set it up which is basically people have these kind of like um personal websites portfolios and I think you you wrote something on this doc I want you to explain you wrote evidence greater than greater than greater than confidence uh so what is that what does that mean and then why do these interest you yeah so I think in the age of social media especially it's like really easy for you to be seen as an expert in something you know someone who's done no marketing can look up a bunch of Wikipedia articles and start tweeting threads on it and a bunch of people who don't know any better can just say oh wow this person has a lot of confidence right and you know that's fine um but what I think is important especially in this era where everyone can seem like an expert is evidence of evidence over confidence and what do I mean by evidence it's like don't tell me you're this business Expert show me the businesses that you've built and how successful they are and how you built them or let me see how you built them instead of you telling me how you built them and I think one version of this for individuals are these personal portfolio sites so you know you can have a site which again it's like I've written for fortune and I have this many followers on Twitter or you know all of these things that you've made up that tell people you're confident instead of how about you just show me your skills and some of these portfolios which will hopefully pull up here um are just really fascinating because as soon as I go to them I'm like this person is a badass I want to hire them just based on what I see here based on the evidence that they are a killer Creator and so we should pull some of them up but for example pull up this one from Bruno Simon and tell me what you see so basically it's Bruno hyphen simon.com and you land and it's literally a like Jeep that's on the screen you hit the click Start there's a Jeep that's on the screen and it says use your keys to move around and it's like and you just like you can you can go forward and you can just like drive into stuff it's like a 3D it's basically a game uh and it's like his resume almost but you can basically drive around crash into stuff and like clearly this person is like super talented artist creative web developer type of person it's like all right I'm gonna drive to the projects section um and like okay I'm in the project section and I can see their different things if I park my car on the open on the parking spot there it'll open that like you know um that link to go see that website that they built and this is amazing like this is one of the best portfolios I've ever seen like this is like stunning yeah it's pretty awesome pull up um another one which is just another example click the one that says interactive resume from Robbie Leonardi so Robbie okay oh my God it's like basically like a game of Mario so there's a character and I'm scrolling and all of a sudden I'm like okay level one that's his about oh wow this is cool um this is sick it's basically like a chart of like oh I'm good at design illustration whatever but it's like I'm running through the level and I'm like learning these different things about the person about what they're into okay NBA fan oh my God now I'm underwater I'm doing the underwater level yeah so this is crazy they basically just took a resume designed it beautifully and made it play like a Mario Mario game and at the end of the level it's like contact me here if you want to work with me or whatever you know here's my contact form you you've won you've made it to the end of the level you've won the thing I love about this is I assume these people are not applying for jobs but can you imagine if you had a job opening and you had like a hundred typical resumes of people being like yeah I've worked here for three years or I've done this I have this degree and then one of them was this how could you not hire this person how could you so I made something like this when I applied for so when I moved to Silicon Valley I did this so basically I I applied to two jobs when I wanted to move to Silicon Valley I applied to stripe and I applied to a place called monkey Inferno stripe everybody knows turned into like you know whatever 100 billion dollar company I would have been like employee I don't know like 35 40 at the time so it would have been great it would have probably made like 10 30 million dollars something like that just as like a mid-level sales Biz Dev type guy that I was going to join as unfortunately I crashed and burned in the interview when he was like sell me this pen and I was like uh and I just fumbled um but the uh the other job I applied to is monkey Inferno and monkey Inferno was a really cool company and one thing that's interesting is the more the company shows that they're unique the more you sort of get the vibe and you're like okay I can read the room you're cool and unique and you appreciate like a you know creativity and a sense of humor so that's how I'm gonna apply so I didn't send in a resume I just made a website and I you know I can't code I'm not like you're way more technically talented let alone these people who are like you know freaking you know they're creating like you know fake Mario game as their resume but I made a basic website that was basically and I just sent an email I tried to copyright it while I was like you know my first line of the email was like um you know uh hey Michael um I'm applying for the I saw your role for product manager um and even though you know I have none of the qualifications you're looking for let me explain to you why I'm the man for the job and like you know I think that was like gonna get his attention to read the next thing just to be like is this guy you know a complete clown or like is there something here and so I wrote this email and I said you know I rather than add a you know resume to the stack of resumes like I made a website for you and so I my my website wasn't about me it was like why I should work at Monkey Inferno so it was like more tailored um to him and I had these same things I had this like uh skills chart but I included stuff that I wasn't good at I was like hard work I was like ah 40 percent like you know that was like one of my lowest skills I was like I'm kind of lazy actually um you know I I'm kind of lazy I can't force myself to do things that I don't love to do but I gave them like things and then in the interview like I remember one of the guys was like why would you apply for a job and write your hard work is not high and I was like well I'm glad you asked I can explain here's here's what I think about that and um and so I had this whole thing and I kind of wrote a resume exactly for them I was like you know here's some of the my mottos here's like I looked at your companies here's some of the things I think I could do for them and so I kind of tailored it to that and I remember he later told me he was like you know if you hadn't done that website like there's no way we would have hired you because on paper you had like literally none of the qualifications we were looking for like the entire job description was like just not you but um that website was really cool it was really unique nobody else had done something like that and so it just made me feel like we got to talk to this guy and so that was like the the in that got me got me the job in the in the in the end yeah I mean I think I've hired a decent amount now and there's so many people who mass apply to jobs and they're like yeah I'm interested in this job and I have the qualifications but the times I've been really impressed is like you can tell someone really wants to work there and has done their research and you know the second they get in you almost don't have to train them on the company you probably have to train them on other things but you know they understand exactly what you're trying to do because they've been following your company or your team or your people for a while um so I think that's that's spot on right let's do a couple of a couple of these other ones so uh yeah let's rapid fire through so the neil.fun one I think I've talked about before on here this one's awesome um so it's n-e-a-l dot fun but I don't think pull it up but basically it's like it's just like the headline is a tiny website on the internet and then he's basically got a bunch of little like interactive little projects that he's made that you could do and I I remember I went through the Absurd trolley problems one um which is basically like if you remember in school where it's like you know there's a train on the tracks it's gonna you know kill five people but you can pull the switch and just kill this one would you do it and you're like yeah I guess I'd rather kill one than five I think I would do it and then it basically like changes it to like but the one is a baby would you do it and you're like no I wouldn't kill the baby and then it's like it's like okay but the other one is five cats would you do five cats and it's like it just takes you through 30 like absurd variations of that of that question and each one when you say yes or no it says 74 of people agree with you 26 disagree there's been 2.1 million votes of this and you're like wow that's like that's cool you can see where do you differ from like you know the masses when it comes to these things and so that's the one I did are there any other cool ones that he's got here well I mean he has so many I'll call it a couple so it feels like he just took all of his Curiosities which are the same Curiosities that many people have and turn them into these yeah internet games of sorts so one of them is like explore the scale of space or um see who was alive and next year you're like I wonder who was alive in 1870 and you can kind of see what um famous people or influential people were alive at the same time um another one that's fun is the internet's greatest debates so it's all these questions like you know is it gif or GIF or I can't remember what some of the other ones are but he gets the internet to vote on them um so you actually you know you get the answer to the internet's greatest questions but as you can see if people are watching on screen there's just so many that he's built like this one that was like design the next iPhone it just lets you drag and drop like you can put a camera in the like I put it like off to the side like halfway off the camera you could put an Android logo on it um that's good this is this guy's kid what does this guy do for a living is he this is what he does or he's like I don't know let's pull him I'm pulling up his Twitter his name is Neil Agarwal I think so he says creative coder yeah this guy's cool um yeah I like this personal portfolio you had a pretty good portfolio website that you had built uh do you like maintain it or what did you do with it I haven't updated it in a while but I will say the page that gets the most traffic or or really gets the most people who contact me is my open page so a lot of well not a lot some startups have an open page uh that is we make this much revenue we have this many page views and normally they don't go much past that I created an equivalent I haven't updated it in a while but it was basically like okay this is how much I make from my personal projects but it's also my goals and it's like if my goal for example is I exercise 50 of the days in a year I hooked it up to my spreadsheet and it publicly tracks it daily so you can see exactly how much I'm doing or it shows what books I'm reading or I don't know silly things like that but people seem to love that for some reason yeah yeah people do love that they wish they were like as organized and on top and clear about their goals as you that's why they love it but you only put your side project revenue on here right yeah I've actually you know what I have debated I've been wanting to write an article which is about my like could say monetary Ascent through life um as in wow that's that's a that's like post-economic my monetary no no that's amazing I will say so the reason it's an Ascent is not because I make so much now but I just made so little starting out and so I've been wanting to write about that because it's kind of you know I feel like I've learned some things but also I think it'd be interesting to actually publicly say in this year I made X and and I've seen some celebrities do this but you know 20 years later they're like look at my tax returns right but I kind of want to do it now and say look five years ago I was making X and then I made X and and to really like publicly share how much I made how like what jobs they were Etc and what I learned along the way but I know I'm just gonna get trashed you know what I mean because because saying you make a bunch of money now is not it's not something people love so I've stayed away from it but I kind of want to anyway yeah yeah I've thought about those same things and I'm just like uh why do I want to invite this in I don't need this what's my a bunch of money you're like I don't need to kind of [ __ ] myself out there for the uh for the attention anymore so there's kind of this like this like counterproductive thing where it's like well the reason I would for me I'm very like simple which is like uh people when they do that stuff they're like I just want to increase transparency in the world or like you know I just want other people like me to know you know I think you know we should openly share I think we should openly share strategies I think we should openly share tactics I think you should privately with a group of trusted people share the your numbers itself but to publicly for everybody share how much you make I think only is is in your interest when you're not making that much but it's growing then once you're making a bunch at that point the kind of risk reward flips I think at least um and so you know I'm not that into that but but this cool I noticed there's no 2022 goals what happened we're almost at the end I know I gotta I gotta post it but I will say I'm way behind on them so maybe that's why are you are you like a goal hitter like do you hit like most of these goals no I mean I'm one of those people who I hit some of them but that's how I think it should be right if you're hitting 100 you're not setting ambitious goals if you're hitting nothing then you're just lost in the world probably but I hit maybe 50 every year yeah I think at Amazon they had said somebody had said like 75 if you if you're hitting more than 75 of your goals like you weren't sufficiently um ambitious if you're hitting less than 75 of your goals uh or like maybe maybe it was a little bit less than that I don't know but it was like you're not executing well enough like you didn't you didn't do a good enough job um yeah okay uh all right what else we got you got a bunch of ideas on here you want to give us let's go some business ideas some quick ones okay so business ideas I don't know if there's one like a new business idea here but I thought this was interesting I'm calling it salty bowls and smelly water and so basically there's two examples of everyone wants to eat healthier uh that's I think a pretty Universal human uh want at least and two companies are doing something interesting here so Kirin which is k-i-r-i-n it's a company in Japan and they partnered with the university and they found a way to make to basically use a super weak electrical current both in bowls and Chopsticks so that when you're eating something about the ionization or the electric current makes something taste saltier so you can imagine like when you actually eat something your taste buds or yeah what there's some something happening chemically on your tongue and they've basically found a way to somewhat reproduce this so you can actually eat food every not everyone a lot of people including myself love salty food you're actually eating foods with less soda but they taste salty and then I'm just going to quickly tack on the other one which is similar where it's I'm calling it smelly water because it's this company called air up which basically has found a way to create a scented ring around a bottle's lip so similarly they found a way to make something taste better in this case through scent instead of electrical current and they I think raised 68 million dollars and so I think it's just this like interesting phenomena of how do you make something and there's the train how do you make something taste good without actually changing the caloric or the the intake of the food and hang on your note here says it's making 100 million plus a year as like an estimate according to Glimpse air up is this like flavored ring of the bottle so you basically you bring a bottle up to your lips the water itself is not flavored the ring is scented or flavored in some way so that when you drink the water you get that you know whatever hint of citrus or whatever you're looking for is that it yes and I put according to Glimpse because I wasn't able to reproduce or like find that number online I don't know where they got it um they definitely raised a bunch of money I just don't know if that Revenue number is correct that is crazy wow um have you tried either of these no I want to I saw the Chopstick Bowl One very recently so I kind of want to order one and then I haven't tried air up wow uh these are this is fascinating I had not uh I didn't know you had said the salty Bowl smelly water thing I didn't understand what it was until you said that but that's crazy I mean the the sort of like salt taste without without extra salt that's kind of I mean that's that's kind of Genius if you could do that all right you want to close things off yeah we can wrap it up where should people kind of find you follow you where do they get your next podcast that's coming out uh tell the people what they want yeah so you can find me at stephsmith.io or on Twitter Steph smithio and then yeah we're gonna be hopefully launching the podcast soon the a16z podcast you can find it anywhere that you find your podcast do you have a name yet or or not yet it's called the a16z podcast okay yeah sorry yeah all right all right uh thanks for coming on Steph and uh best of luck with the Pod thanks [Music] foreign

[Music] foreign things off uh how do you think about audience building and and what does your audience mean to you Sean oh wow emotional question uh how do I think about it I think about it like um I don't really think about it it's the byproduct of what I do so the way the way I approached it was after I sold my company I said all right I could do whatever I want now so like hey time to face the tough question what do I actually want to do what do I actually care about in my life uh well and those are big questions that kind of scared me so then I I trimmed it down I said all right well how do I just want to spend my days what would be a normal it won't be a great day that I could do every day and um the thing that came to me was like the thing I enjoy doing the most is just getting curious I'm generally very curious about things and if I have to like go do work and then put those on the side and hopefully get to them when I get to them that seemed like uh that was not great but if I could just make my work that I could just be curious about these things whether it's crypto or it's audience building or some new Science Tech thing or it's you know where the hell you know do peanuts grow on trees or from the ground I don't know let me go find out right like whatever it is I was like I want to be professionally curious all right well that's cool the Curious part's easy how do you be professionally curious well one way was let me turn that Curiosity into content so I'll take these questions and I'm I want to you know go look into and then I just gotta package up my learnings at the end and share them with others all right cool that'll make it more fun for me and it'll turn into something that actually generates a bunch of income which will let me just do this all the time that was my thought process so audience building and content was just a kind of a necessary means to an end or a byproduct of the main thing I wanted to do which was just be professionally curious be able to wake up and just dive into the thing that's most on my mind that day and have no other restrictions beyond that about that uh I was talking about you yeah I mean I think that building an audience is a lot like making money um especially in the year 2022 which is that you have to provide something that doesn't exist and then people will commoditize it with their attention or you know if you're a business then you're building you're trying to get Revenue so with the way that I built my show and the way that I consistently think about building and getting more audience is just to continue to fill niches you started out filling one particular Niche built niches and niches and niches put an underlying philosophy that girds that and then continue to try and build more on top of that which just results in overall Top Line figure that continues to go up I actually don't think it's really that complicated as a concept it's just incredibly complicated to execute uh which is why not a lot of people do it and there's really you know not that many people at the very very top of the game and why you know in the whole influencer Market all returns are exponential both you know the top 0.01 of podcasts get just so many more downloads and even the top one percent of podcasts like what I figured when I found out what was even in the top one percent I was like wait like 20 000 downloads I mean how can you I was like I don't even know you make a living um for something like that and then you know you compare that to what the top ten are so I think that execution is harder than every anything else in this game probably exactly the same as business I mean it sounds easy to fill a niche uh but actually doing that doing a consistent basis over years and years through changing conditions you know changing market conditions for business changing information environment um for somebody who's in the content game that's where the scale uh all comes into play like simple simple not easy right it could be simple what the answer is but not necessarily easy like um we did this uh like getaway like this getaway where we wouldn't play basketball with a bunch of interesting people and one of the people that came was Mr Beast the number one YouTuber in the world so he you know he knows a thing or two about audience building and it's like if you talk to him you're like hey you know awesome what's the what's the same figure what's the trick for getting huge on YouTube and he's like he's like I just want to make the best YouTube videos possible make great videos all right okay yeah but like yeah how did you do it how did you become number one he's like I just tried to make great videos every day I just wake up and I'm like all right what's a great video how do I make that and it's like simple not easy in the sense that like he he didn't over complicate okay well what makes a great video something that gets your attention something that holds your attention something that you know makes you feel something at the end you know laughter or a feel-good moment or outrage whatever it is you could choose uh and you could break it down from there and add a little more detail but fundamentally you're not going to get some answer that's like damn um I never thought of that all right wow they had this Insight that's just not it wasn't available to me and and now that I have this Insight oh I too can go succeed it's like the best the people were the best do the simple thing just better than everybody else totally is is make great content is that really kind of the the bottom line here if you were to say like what separates that top one percent that soccer was mentioning from the other 99 is it as simple as just make great content or yes um okay well you went through YC right although you guys were you in YC we did yes yeah what's the YC motto right YC the greatest startup accelerator in the world bardnon has a greatest track record created almost half a trillion dollars of value of the companies that went through it what's the secret make something people want is their motto just trying to hey startup don't get distracted by fundraising and press and all these other things that you could try to growth hacks are you making something people want of course really uh you know tell me uh how do you know what gives you that feeling and then there's sort of like I don't know I just sort of assumed I was it sounds so simple that I just sort of assumed I was already doing that same thing with content or audience building are you making content that people want right that's the that's the thing because I just make great content it's make content that people want that's what great content is when he talked about picking niches and then figuring out how to serve that Niche that's what he's doing he's making content that people want in that category and then doing it better than than others and doing it consistently so they build a habit et cetera et cetera I completely agree yeah I mean I get approached by a lot of people hey will this light do it for me well this camera my camera's not your problem bro I'm like your content's problem I'm like everything falls off the mat you know I recently spent sixty thousand dollars on cameras and that's after three years of doing this but needing 4K cameras was an added benefit for my existing audience not what I needed for a requisite to start like sure there's the Baseline level of production I think a pop filter uh like a Yeti USB mic and a basic webcam and that is not a high startup cost and everybody's like what about my thumbnails what about my listen thumbnails matter headlines matter all that other stuff matters Etc but what Sean is talking about which is that all Mr Beast does is he knows exactly how to rank a retention thumbnail all of that stack it all on top of each other iterate it a million times and then come up with the quote unquote Secret Sauce he has the exact same YouTube dashboard that I have that all of us have that that you have access to he just figured out how to read it better than anybody else so I always say is the content good that's my number one concern is it good is it compelling and that as he said except simple it's not easy they're not a certain point it is strange like it is really one of those like you know it when you see it I can listen to something and be like that's compelling and I can listen to something just like I don't know what it is man but this needs work um and it's tough to exactly explain what that is yeah we listened to a session on product-led growth yesterday and it was almost like everybody was kind of like well what's what's the hack what's the tactic what's the secret and our speakers were very simply like well you need an A plus product in order to have any sort of product-led growth and I feel like the the principal stands stands true for any form of audience growth as well um now both of you have pretty distinct uh personal Brands as well as uh like a business brand that you're you're both independently growing either on accident or on purpose um how do you think about uh the sort of brand building as a as a company as an entity versus personal brand building do you have any heuristics or ways of thinking about it Sagar um you know the way that you kind of use your own Twitter versus um breaking points yeah that's interesting um so from a business obviously it has to be whenever and Sean you you too you're like you're in a partnership right so this is inherently not something that you have total at 100 freedom on so so whenever I'm doing something under the BP umbrella or you know business or hiring it's not necessarily just a reflection of me it's a reflection of the ethos and the principles that we decided that we were going to grow on mutually agree on together re you know within that framework everything is being branded is being used that's a reflection of us of our philosophy Etc on my personal brand uh to be honest I just have a lot less capacity for uh care I like if I'm interested in it I'm just going to explore it I frankly I'm at a level where I can do that if I want to and if people have only I'm just like I literally don't care um you know either Instagram you know how hard it is fine tweets that I'm able to show uh yeah I was like I was a little scared whenever you were like I was like oh man I was like we're gonna piss off half the audience but I mean that's fine you know I'm used to it in this line of work and that's kind of what I'm what I'm getting at which is that there the business has an orientation which is a make money B perpetuate itself for me personally I mean obviously my personal brand I probably thought about this very very differently whenever I was younger and I was like on the up and up but at this level I actually just do whatever I want to do and so that is the the only dichotomy between the two uh how do you think about it Sean so what kind of answer would be interesting to you here what's like the like uh because I try to figure out what's the question behind the question so so the question is the surface question is like what's the difference between your your pod brand and your personal brand but what is the question behind that the question behind that here let me start with the problem so the problem is that audience building as a brand is hard it's hard to uh create Affinity when it's it's not uh coming from a human face um and uh people often find at least in in the folks that I've I've chatted with um even pers honestly demand curves Twitter has has been difficult to grow um versus like you know personal like individuals as like Julian for example has a much easier time with his with his growth than we do as a company account so uh yeah the question behind the question that's a great question uh Sean um is uh you know how how uh to uh like how how should startups and companies be thinking about uh audience audience building when they have um uh yeah but they have got like the personal brand in there no I understand no I understand yeah uh the question really is like what am I doing wrong here with demand curve hey but but more generally speaking like I don't know the it's I haven't cracked this nut what's the difference I've noticed personal brands are easier to grow but I also I do I want my company thing to grow blah blah blah I think that here here's my like very simple slash controversial take on this which is I think if you're a company you should be using individual faces to grow you'll go you'll go faster that way if you're an individual trying to grow like a media property you should put it under a brand umbrella mostly because you can't ever sell you um so like if you wanted this to be an asset and not a job you need it to grow its own brand like you need breaking points or like in our case like I had a personal newsletter and a personal Twitter That Grew really fast I grew my personal Twitter from like 10 or 20 000 followers to it's at 300 000 in like a year basically a year and a half in a year we got to 200 000 and then it just trickled up um but like great what am I going to do with that I'm I I don't really want to be some like influencer and um and great like you know I can't hand this off to anybody it's my voice is my name it's my face so it's a job now I need to maintain this thing and it's cool because like I just don't get like I'm like sorry I just don't care so I'll go six weeks without tweeting because I'm not trying to maintain some schedule this is not a business of mine but when I created the milk Road it's intentionally not called Sean's crypto newsletter which actually would have been easier at the start to get subscribers for because people already had bought into the Sean franchise so going for oh Sean is going to talk about crypto and do crypto analysis and crypto opinions great I want to know about that but instead I called it the milk road because I thought one day I'd like to not be the guy writing this thing one day I'd like to not be the person maybe even owning this thing I'd like to sell this someday um I want this to be an independent asset and so for that again me as an independent media content creator I created a brand umbrella for those reasons but let's say it was my my startup I would be saying hey I'm Sean the growth guy from bibo and I'm going to talk about growth over here not the bibo account doing it because it's going to get less play uh because people would rather follow people than uh than companies and so you got to use you make that trade-off when you're already a company then use the fact that people would rather follow people if you're an individual you take a little hit by putting it under a brand umbrella but you get this big benefit of it's not tied to your name and face forever that way so it's a strategic bet that's my it's my opinion on this yeah well no it's super helpful uh and it kind of points to the problem that we originally had a demand curve where so much of our brand Equity was tied up in Julian's brand Equity uh and so you know being able to build that up under a new brand has certainly been something that uh uh you know we've done over the last last couple years so that's super helpful um okay we uh yeah let's go ahead and uh start the repeat that tweet segment uh here let's uh we're gonna experiment with screen sharing for the first time um see how this goes and uh yeah both of y'all the idea here is for both of you all to just react to the Tweet what were you thinking when you tweeted it out why do you think it took off why did it work uh and yeah any other context that you think would find interesting I wonder what percentage of these I'm just gonna be like I have no idea what I was thinking I'm gonna believe that that's stupid these are bangers only so hopefully uh hopefully you remember um Sean uh you you did this hot take about everybody being wrong about the metaverse obviously it was a very Hot Topic at the time when he did this um what can you what can you tell us about this um well I'll tell you kind of like okay I'll tell you my point in a second but like I guess that's a little less interesting even than just the uh what made this work so this thing for each I think uh I don't know the exact stats I think it's like sort of like somewhere between 10 and 20 million people in the US but then it also was it got shared like crazy on Instagram and I shared in China like some big Chinese like social media influencers were posting it I guess so I got like millions of views there Logan Paul was talking about on his podcast Mark Zuckerberg referenced this in a Lex Freeman interview so it like went really far and I was like why did this go so far and I think it was because it basically had three things number one it was timely so this is right when Facebook had rebranded to meta people were talking about the metaverse and I think everybody had this like it was sixth sense of this little sort of like you know sneaking suspicion that everybody's bullshitting about this um but like nobody knew it was all smart people like big names that were saying how The Meta versus the future but nobody was saying what the hell the metaverse is or why it's the future and so like I think everybody kind of smelled [ __ ] but didn't know how to call it um so it was timely I was calling [ __ ] which generally is like something people are going to want to click into and read and the last thing was I think I backed it up I think I had a good point that could get you to agree with my my conspiracy theory if so to speak was not so far-fetched and basically all I was saying was like when people hear the word metaverse they think about this like virtual reality [ __ ] like oh I'm living in some thing I'm an avatar now and I said actually I think it's more like this concept called The Singularity which is an artificial intelligence which is like this moment in time this Tipping Point where computers you know have reached a super intelligence and they're so vastly smarter than than humans and they they are so smart they just program themselves to become it's like runaway intelligence they program themselves to become smarter and so um I thought oh the metaverse is kind of like that it's basically this Tipping Point where um well a lot of my friends are online now I think I have this experience many you guys do look at this like experience we're having now a lot of my work is now digital um my social identity like my profiles my followers are all digital um you know my if I buy nfts cool so my art is not digital more and more things more more things that are important to you are now like they live on the internet and so at some point all of your digital stuff matters to you more and you spend more time in energy energy and focus there than you do in your physical that doesn't mean you'll never go eat or walk or exercise or anything like that that's not what it means but it just means like sort of there's a Tipping Point where before rewind 20 years it didn't matter you know I had a computer room in my house uh that was like you know there was a computer room and everything else was non-computer and now like you know the computer's attached to my body basically right so it's like you've seen this transition already it's just going to continue and so hey don't think it's this crazy virtual world it's just this Tipping Point where at some point we've been creeping towards it creeping towards it at some point we're just going to value our digital stuff more than we do our physical in the sense that we're going to spend more time and energy and effort and money on on the internet than we do offline um that was the idea so that's that's my explain this tweet super helpful man um it was surprising to me uh during your podcast with Hudson Minaj that he was he was genuinely triggered by this tweet uh it affected him as like an identity level uh yeah he called me he was like hey can I call you I don't know the guy by the way I didn't know him before this he's like uh he had followed me from one other tweet that went viral about Clubhouse and he then he he called me and he was like bro I like I do stand-up comedy and real little crowds with real people that energy that is my home that is my craft that is my favorite feeling in the world and like God I don't want this like you know metaphor's [ __ ] like you know and you know talk me through it and I was like I don't know what to tell you man like I think it's going in that direction I don't think you know I remember I remember people being like I I love waking up getting the newspaper bringing it in from my front lawn and the feel of the newspaper right and like uh it's true you probably did like that thing but guess what you liked more was like instant real-time news constantly flooding into your brain turns out that that was more addictive um that like you know being able to get news from all these different sources rather than just your local provider that turned out to be really important uh being able to access it only go on your phone turned out that wasn't really important and so yeah you like the feel of it but there's all these other benefits that like ended up crushing that um so that was uh that's what happened after this tweet you conceptualized it well you talked about kind of the benefit of accountability uh it's a double-edged sword here where you know uh get the upside and the risk uh involved in that uh super interesting Sagar uh yes like like I said challenging to find tweets I can share with everybody here uh but uh thank you uh yeah actually I think they're most viral is two days ago um I I just saw that yeah uh yeah talk to us about why why did this this tweet work um what is this speaking to and like why do you think this resonated yeah uh I'm actually it's interesting I kind of pivoted to becoming the gas guy politically uh this really is really just purely a function of what I talked about earlier which is that if you were to ask me why I think my show is successful I think because I cover things in a way that most people feel are not being covered by existing sources of information that's very basic like thesis statement that's why I think it does well I've always noticed that coverage of gas is skewed in a particularly partisan way so one of the things that I like to do is just highlight Basics textualize them think that every American has to put into their car on average a couple of times or at the very least like once a week a couple of times a month so uh what did I do there I said the average American Nets x amount of money after taxes at five dollars a gallon that means they're spending approximately 10 of their take-home pay on gas or when you include food and housing it gives you a picture of how bad things are that's not a political statement that's just like a statement about where things are that got shared that's what I was saying I mean people screenshotted it it was shared on Instagram both ways it's like a lot of you know oil companies need to stop profiteering here's why Biden needs to start drilling I mean you can put it any particular way you want I mean in general my most viral content actually Auto just speaks to uh more putting out like facts and then contextualizing them in a way where people feel like they can be used to something that is very meaningful to their life I'll give you another example one of my most viral posts recently has been about mortgages and it really was just a basic uh take about like hey 2021 you could buy X house price house for this monthly payment mortgage's price has now gone up so now you get less house once again like you can read that whichever way you want like you can be like congratulations Jerome Powell you can say screw you drone pal like you could put it uh any particular way so I think uh to piggyback on what Sean is saying I think timeliness is everything uh everything so timeliness is you know timeliness is number one it has to be timely uh number two it has to be the most viral stuff I believe uh has to be able to resonate with somebody and not tell them how to think just give them the ability to then form something and then three uh I think it's also concise which is why Twitter is very very helpful yeah that that's great by the way this um it's like you handed them like a hammer and you're like don't beat up whoever you want to beat up exactly and this can be moved on any anybody you know just Bingo use it to serve your agenda which is like kind of the like I don't know cynical take on content creation which is like you will blow up faster if you sort of gas up an audience around something that they already have a bias or or belief system of and you feed that this happens for example it doesn't have to be political with crypto this happens all the time which is like oh just be anti the dollar anti-fed anti-born buffet anti-whoever and you just keep feeding information that like Riles up this zealous crowd that already believes and all they're looking for is like they're not looking for real information they're looking for information that just fits their world view only and I I don't mean that to pick on them because pretty much everybody does this and so you know everybody's looking for information that feeds their world juice so one useful way of thinking about it is what worldview do I like and respect and maybe share what worldview do I understand and then that's the world view that I can serve by producing good packaged nuggets because I know what will hit with that audience and then I I'm focused on that versus just uh generically producing content and then not really thinking about the world view that it's going to go live in our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better oh by the way what's the what's the tweet that went viral two days ago oh that was about Dr fauci we don't have to get into that one what are we here to do I mean I'll go into it I don't care uh sure uh well although that's a derail your uh um for those who are not familiar with something called the lab leak Theory the theory is is that coronavirus leaked from a lab and so the uh underlying facts and circumstances around this are pretty interesting the tweet that I did was again you know actually speaks directly to what you just talked about Sean which is that if you're familiar with the characters who are involved there's one particular guy who served as the cutout um as so-called cutout of funding from the NIH to the Wuhan Institute of virology his name was Dr Peter dazak he's been intimately involved kind of in the cover-up of any facts or evidence around the lab League Theory this I was all old news at this point basically two years ago that we've known all this information well you know Dr fauci on his weighing days uh as the head of niaid actually just granted a 600 000 Grant to the same individual for the same type of research which possibly led to the The Escape of coronavirus from the Wuhan lab that was it there you go uh it's right in front of you I said vouching his winning days as you said I'm like here's information why do I think it went viral I mean that's not difficult because nobody else was reporting it and millions and millions and millions of people are interested that's literally just a screenshot from a government website by the way yeah um you said something like you know I know a lot of people care about uh you said like I know the gas issues something a lot of people about that they don't feel as being adequately covered how do you know that uh you're reading YouTube comments to get this information you're talking to people where how are you figuring out both what my Niche is interested in and then where they where there's a lack of service on that topic is it because you're not seeing it and so you're like oh I am a customer that's how I know or you have some feedback loop how do you do it at this point is Art and a science so I have a general intuition of like hmm this is not being covered also the reason why I got into gasp was because I could see that my segments on inflation were going astronaut like dramatically High really what it is is I did a monologue months and months and months ago uh just it was very basic I was like hey we are going to have an energy price crisis this was actually before the entire Russian invasion of Ukraine because we were still having problems in our gas supply and I was really obsessed like why these specific market conditions and it just went Mega viral and I got all these emails from these people being like hey man like thank you so much like nobody talks about artists like heating oil in Vermont and like public contracts look like uh for these things and you know for me and my family I only make fifty thousand dollars a year so when I have to lock in at X price like it really really hurts and I was like well that's interesting and so then again you know you throw a couple test segments and you're like do some segments on it each one either consistently performs or does more so than normal I'm like okay well clearly people care a lot about this and so what I do then is like kind of use my Insider ability as a guy who worked in the Washington press Corps more to like cover it in a professional manner and I think that was the way that I could discover but I also have a general sense of you know I work in this media I work working media I live in DC I know what the people in power are talking about and obsessed with and my general orientation had to bet against whatever that is and cover anything else and in general that serves me very well so there you go that's cool I like that one thing that Sagar shared maybe when I when we get into more tactics later he can cover this but one of the things that worked for him early on was uh I think you had said like um just posting transcripts of like what different people would say so if Trump would say something all you would do is just snip the transcript and just sweep that out and let people have whatever cake they wanted on it yeah I mean I can share that so my first 50 000 followers uh I was I was really obsessed with Twitter like obsessed uh which is not a good thing uh I should say when I was younger and I was like I want to get more Twitter I remember Michael I would say I want 50 000 followers I I had like four thousand uh at the time I had a job I was a White House correspondent I'm like okay well how can I take advantage of this so all I did was I just got really proficient at using live transcription Services which literally watched cable television and then spit out rough transcripts copy and pasting it taking out the cast editing it for clarity and just trying to be one of the first people to be like Trump said X or the Secretary of State said why and as you said Adel you're just pumping information uh out into the world this is why also you know I think I probably have a timely bias because I work in the news business like for us Timeless is everything if you're two hours late like you might as well be dead you know you're a zombie and so for for us like micro seconds especially in the you know in the so-called like information distribution game you're competing against the Associated Press against Warriors and uh you know like major multi-million dollar professional organizations it really just turned out to be getting pretty good at tweeting out transcripts so I think my first 50 000 followers all just came from people who were following me in order to find out like what was going on that day in politics and since that was literally my job I was both doing my job well and I was building an audience there's a lot of yeah there's a lot of ways that people in this audience can apply that I mean you're all in your own Niche you all have uh the influencers and the leaders in their in those niches going out and doing uh appearances um there's ways of adapting this strategy not just in the news and time in this context but even in the uh in Tech um timeliness uh oh yeah yeah exemplifies it so I created uh or so there was this big news event that happened in crypto where this token called Luna crashed and it had been one of the High Flyers and then it goes to zero kind of like overnight and I had a position in Luna so I ended up losing was like a million dollars in that crash and um I also had kind of like an interesting take because you need to have a take on uh you know everybody knows what happened what they want to know is you know either why it happened or what it means and um so I had a good take and I decided okay the way I'm gonna do the and two things happen hey I was a little bit busy that week I was like on vacation stuff like that came back back all right a couple days go by and then I was like okay what do I do either I'm just going to post this as like you know um you know a couple tweets a thread or what if I made like a video on this and so I go on YouTube I end up creating this like almost like a like the John Oliver show what's Last Week Tonight I go and I create this like I'm like I do this rant I I rant about Luna I rant about why why it got big and then why crushed I got devastated and it was had jokes spliced in I hired this editor the editor is amazing we're working on this we're iterating on it we're making great content and we put it out now two and a half weeks have gone by as we put it out you can see this if you go to YouTube Luna Sean or something like that and the video has like I don't know 17 000 views or so uh 20 000 views maybe at this point uh but it never went viral and like so you know I consider that sort of like a flop uh of a piece of content especially one that I tried really hard on and the funny thing is like I kind of knew this that like like the smarter thing would have been if I literally had opened up my phone typed out a thing in the notes app screenshotted it and just posted it immediately when it happened it would have been less great because it was not the jokes weren't as good the there was no video production there was no nothing but it would have been on time and on time matters way more than great and when it comes to this type of reactionary what does everybody care about right now because a lot of time three weeks have gone by just nobody cared about it anymore the world had moved on there's two other crises to worry about and so uh that was a lot an expensive of time-wise lesson of of uh how much effort I put into something that did not go viral compared to [ __ ] that did go viral because I did it you know good enough at the right time is better than great at the wrong time totally agree good enough at the right time is better than great at the wrong time that is the uh the quote uh and uh heck of a uh some art here that you got going on Sean I love it um okay cool let's rapid fire through one more each um let's see so Sean we have your Clubhouse one but I feel like it's pretty close to the metaverse one as to why that worked um do you want to talk about uh this Elon one or do you want to talk about uh this learning one uh yeah I'll do both real quick the Elon one is actually like soccer was saying I uh I I one of the threads that went viral was not no original Insight uh Elon was on clubhouse Elon like popped onto Clubhouse when Clubhouse was hot and you know just a guest appears by Elon Musk is not something you get very often and also Clubhouse was like overloaded it was like invite only and it was overloaded so I just go for those who are locked out of the Evon thing um here's what he's saying and I just live typed and transcribed everything interesting he was saying in a thread in real time and I was the only guy doing it and like you know on one hand I felt a little silly I was like oh man I've become like a professional Note Taker on a [ __ ] Beta app of Clubhouse like geez what does my career come to and then also I was like oh wow that's just like 7 000 likes already okay nevermind shut up like go and so uh you know I just like just did it but it was like it it talks about that same thing which is like some people think they need to have this like really great Insight or amazing you know perspective or whatever and sometimes you're just providing a service better than others you're just clipping good content and you're posting it and you're doing that consistently and people will follow you for that you can build a huge audience as simply a curator or remixer of content you don't even need to be an original content creator I would say in most cases you do not need to be um so that's kind of what this one was which was I just pulled this was separately I just pulled out um you know this this great quote um you know by Elon and you know this is another one where it fits people's world view my my audience is mostly entrepreneurs entrepreneurs love to have this chip on the shoulder this Badge of Pride about like how hard it is to be an entrepreneur which I find pretty stupid in general but I can play to it and so I play into it here which is like Elon was like you know if you need words of encouragement for doing a startup don't do a startup oh yeah like you know that's right we are the special breed and like we don't need this you know motivational you know speeches whatever so I knew that this would play and so you know just threw out there and and sure enough it hits um the other one that you shared was um oh yeah this was meant to trigger people uh so everybody thinks that everybody thinks that things like education and Healthcare are like highly nuanced topics and I find also that really funny and stupid like um uh I I think that Nuance is something that smart people love to hide behind because it's so easy to just say oh well you know it depends and like you know it's it's not so simple it's not so easy and it's not so cut and dry it's not so black and white it's not so binary they love to like do this this nuanced thing and so I knew I could trigger everybody if I just said here I could fix education um in like a tweet and it's like oh classic Tech bro thinks you could fix education in a stupid tweet and so you know I know how to like you know just bait the animals uh with like here you go right and it's something I do believe which is that most people when they want to learn something they start by trying to learn it like go read about it they watch about it they they go attend seminars and workshops or take courses about it and they'd be better off just going and try trying to do the damn thing and then when they get stuck they should go look up how to get unstuck like I do believe that that's true but if I had just said that it would have gotten a tenth of the likes by by adding there I fixed education I was able to trigger a bunch of people and so um you know that was yeah these are the Jedi Mind Tricks of the of the great creators I mean I really hear that you relate to Twitter as a game like it's not like uh thing where you have to tell like what you believed exactly the way you believe it um you're you're there's a bit of a game that you're playing is that how you would relate to it yeah don't take it too seriously like um I don't think anything too seriously but definitely not going to be Twitter of the things I think I barely take parenting and like you know things like that seriously I try to be playful and silly and lighthearted with those too so I'm definitely not going to take Twitter too seriously and the other thing is I uh I'm lucky that Twitter is not where I like I'm not uh Twitter's not my my real job you know like I've basically been successful outside of content creation so I had the security that I can just kind of f around with content creation and do what I think is interesting because I'm not doing this in order to become successful so I don't have to so I didn't have this mental block of like I need to play things a certain way soccer was talking about this too like once you get to a certain size here whether you did it outside of content or even through content you can start are playing much looser because at the end of the day your life's short just do whatever you want to do say what you want to say it's a lot more rewarding and fun and interesting that way and so uh you could do that you know you could buy yourself that right um but most people sort of have this mental block where they're like afraid and they take everything so seriously and then it becomes an unpleasant experience for them I think well I think a lot of people don't don't enjoy social media um because they don't treat it like a game you enjoy games you don't enjoy things that are Ultra serious and so um you know I think that's where most people get it wrong about that yeah uh having that that block of like oh I need to get it right I think is the kind of internal conversation that that keeps people from even even taking that action in the first place soccer um let's see we have this on student debt or this on CNN plus which one would you like to chat about uh oh that I like that like that one that's a good one uh narratively that I always enjoy that so uh that one was yeah so just for those uh oh man watching the failure of CNN plus and lapsingo Obama Spike are related so why is this tweet successful you take two Viral Events that are being discussed you pair them together and then you put a thesis statement on why exactly it supports a broader meta-narrative shitty establishment content previously force fed to us in cable Monopoly era simply cannot compete in the free market streaming the revolution has just begun so revolution's just begun Punchy feeds the thesis you know most of the people who follow me and I in general anybody below the age like 50 doesn't like cable Monopoly and cable news so obviously huge uh Market there you know biology actually said biology screen of action one says something to me is always spent on charts it's just you got to find the right chart to bet on and so I always say that uh the right chart for me is trust in the mainstream media which is 13 that means my market size is 87 of the United States so I only have even more to grow and if you put a globe on that team you're like man so I feel sorry for CNN serving this Niche 13 of the audience poor guy if they need some help I got you it's about flipping things it's like no no it's like you're the one who's only serving they need so putting these two things together the Obama Spotify contract CNN like two Legacy established political uh both Brands kind of in their own right everybody knows but yet not a lot of people are consuming and then putting them together and saying and trying to describe a market condition that is arising that can tell us about why these two things have failed that goes against the way that people who actually work in professional media explanation uh are able to tell you I mean to date I have not seen a a dispassionate view maybe out of one or two people I can count on one hand Sarah Fisher over at axios I think she's awesome uh there's like uh Dylan Byers over at Puck news I think he's a straight shooter too those two are pretty much the only ones I've seen with like an actual rundown of like why these things don't work uh compared to the amount of money that are being invested in them the Obama Spotify contract it's the same one it's like you know they paid the former president of the United States millions of dollars and it just didn't do that well when he was paired one of the biggest rock stars on Earth that's that's kind of insane I mean you have somebody who hundreds of millions of people uh knew that no he's billions of people probably know his name uh you have somebody who received like 10 hundreds of millions of votes collectively over two elections and yet he can't even crack the top ten on podcasts like how does that how does the former MMA cage fighter beat this person like how is that possible and so that's a very interesting story now nobody wants to tell that story because you know when you work in the quote-unquote powers of B you're gonna offend the wrong people and so it again that's just a niche that opens up for me to come in and to fill that so I think that's why that it took off it was it's not not even a difficult one really to explain cool no that's that's I like that take two Viral Events Stitch it together with a thesis statement uh and then cater it to that uh 87 of the audience uh who doesn't trust in the mainstream media very clever um cool well let's go through uh some rapid fire questions tactical questions uh and some uh questions from the audience uh over the next five to seven minutes uh and then we'll call it a day um soccer talk to us you know you mentioned the strategy that you did early on um kind of just taking scripts of what other more influential people are saying um like what were really the inflection points or uh tactics that took you from from that first zero to 100K uh let's say Twitter okay so zero to Twitter is actually not that hard which is that most of the people follow only a few amount of accounts so get those few amount of accounts in order to follow you and get them to retweet you and that's basically the secret to growth I don't think it's like a complicated so what does that mean it's like well find the that Niche the 0.01 what do they need in their feed that they're not getting provide that service for me I was the first guy in order to tweet the transcript which means that they were all following me which means they're all retweeting me and exposing me to their millions of followers which means to some people would then follow me so for me it was I would say around 10K is a big is a big challenge uh for some reason in people's minds it's like when you cross ten thousand that is a point where you're going to get exponentially more new numbers of followers what I've discovered across all my platforms the more followers you have the easier it is to get followers which is so frustrating whenever you're starting out you're like when you're oh man five thousand that at that point if I had five thousand followers on Instagram which you know once upon a time was the case if I got 50 I was like oh my God I lose 50 a day uh to now actually more probably more like 100 and yet I'll net out you know at a thousand a week or something like that and it's simply because of like the churn the burn the way that your algorithmic treatment um is offered so I think 10 is a big inflection point I think 50 is an even bigger inflection point that's where things really begin to go vertical and you know this is probably the same startups which is just getting that you know uh first initial customers and then compounding that to a sustainable-ish business is like the really most difficult requires the most amount of thought because at the end of the day that's right that's where you're filling the niche that's where you're discovering the niche that's where you're uh playing around that's that's that's really the time too of the most experimentation uh where you have really really high stakes so I would say it's there and then also on the other end where you know after I reached 300K actually after I reached 200k on Twitter I was like I just don't care anymore I was like if it goes up it goes up I could care less you know my business is almost entirely dependent on YouTube and I frankly I care more about Instagram um than I do about Twitter I think I have much higher quality engagement um just from what I've seen my ability to sell either my subscription tickets uh any of those things are there so then it just became a complete game after that I just genuinely did whatever I wanted so those are kind of the interesting inflection points well yeah I like the idea of uh finding look there's a few accounts that everybody follows like it's almost account based marketing at that point where it's getting and in touch and making an impression with those nodes those sort of super nodes in your in your industry um Sean do you have any uh anything to add uh that's smart I wish I had done that um it didn't have that Insight but I learned something great today um yeah mine was sort of like uh this actually it was the same but I did it in a much slower stupider way which was the first kind of 25 people mattered a lot and so it's not the number it's who those 25 are for me I built those relationships in person so like um you know Ryan Hoover had a popular Twitter and I had known Ryan in person you know for you know seven eight years at that point and so once I started getting active and started saying things he was happy to kind of like share I never asked him to he just he followed me already he thought some things I said was interesting and he would share it with his audience and um and then that happened with like 25 important people in Tech that were already well known but I had built in-person relationships with them build in-person credibility with them and so it's kind of the same idea actually but just a very slow version of what he just talked about and I didn't think about it like creating content that that serves them um that they would want to share with their audience I just thought like it just it just accidentally happened so it's you know sort of along the way um the main things that I would say is like you know uh figure out your you know the the domain you're trying to build your Authority in so you know get really tight on that the tighter the better uh but it's very tempting to be broad um and I've made this mistake many times I just like being like well it's that but it's also these other things that I like and there's also this and it's also that and actually you'd be better off just starting off uh starting up there um then there's basically like some tactical things like you know for example uh there's this Theory called The Red Pill Theory I guess uh I think in politics just has a different definition but I heard it when I talked to the guy um there's two guys who do weight but why and so there's like Tim who's like the writer the famous guy and then this is his friend Andrew who childhood friend who helps run his businesses and Andrew I talked to Andrew and Andrew was like yeah you need to have your red pill which is like you need to have the truth that you can say that people that wasn't like um it's not the thing everybody's saying but when you hear it people like some said the same with people will nod their head vigorously right so what is the answer other people call this your spiky point of view it's like you know what is your what's your thing right like you know maybe your thing was like that inflation is a way bigger problem the government is playing this down boom that's your red pill and you can you can base your whole brand off that for a period of time and then you have to eventually swap out and create a second red pill which is like you need to be giving people and by the way red pill comes from like the Matrix where it's like do you want if you take the blue pill you go back into the Matrix you just live like a sheep again and you just don't question anything or do you want the truth and that's the thing you're trying to give people the truth in a way that they're not that they haven't been told and then you can become known for that and so I think that's important that's a very useful tool I think some other tools are speaking from the eye I I found great success in this which is a lot of people in um the more successful that they get they'll just keep saying you like a fortune cookie like oh you you gotta do this you got to do that you know when you feel this way you got to try doing this and it's like it's much more powerful when you're like you know uh I was feeling this way or I was going through this I had this experience and it made me think this but what I need to do differently is I need to do this um it's a much more I think in general it's good for personal accountability to speak from the eye but secondly I think it plays really well into content because it's different than what everybody else is doing so same thing personal stories um and speaking from the eye I think works but like the high level things is you know you could be either a generous expert sharing your knowledge and expertise or you could be a curious novice and a curious novice is somebody who's just going through like you're saying you're just typing out the transcripts you're just finding interesting clips and sharing it you're remixing packaging curating and presenting you know stuff as a beginner's point of view rather than saying I know everything um so you got to know what areas are you an expert in and what areas are you going to be a curious novice and then use both in your content um and the last is just I don't know don't quit and go viral like that that's ultimately like if you want to win don't quit and like find ways to go viral or you won't grow so uh if you just you're only gonna remember two things on the strategies like don't quit go viral I would say the the takeaway I could talk to both y'all for another hour this is uh awesome uh yeah just the the the nuggets at the end non-stop I I think we're gonna create an illustration of this uh to capture a lot of those things so stay tuned for that um yeah thank you both so much for spending your time with us today uh this is a ton of fun [Music] foreign [Music]

so age 18 him and his brother get on a plane they go to Hong Kong and they're like we are going to start our Toy Factory here in Hong Kong they get their first night he literally sleeps in a bush because they didn't have like you know a place to stay that night so you see something why wouldn't he just do a sidewalk too hard bro he you know you don't want to sleep on the ground you know you want to sleep on on a bush so he sleeps on a bush outside be normal use the bench [Music] all right we live I got something good for you I got a crazy story in fact this is a billy of the week [Music] [Applause] [Music] ten dollars isn't cool you know it's cool a billion dollars uh you know sometimes we get a little fast and lose with the Billy of the week where it's not a real Billy this guy is a real billionaire okay so have you ever heard the name Nick mowbray no okay so Nick bobray here's the here's my headline for this University Dropout from New Zealand becomes a billionaire with zero dollars invested okay so what what happened um I'll click yeah you clicked all right here's here's the next bit two brothers um when they were in I think Middle School they enter a science fair and in the science fair they create a hot air balloon modeling kit and they end up winning the science fair so here's Nick 12 years old wins the science fair and he decides all right people really liked my hot air balloon kit that my like model hot air balloon kit I'm gonna go selfie so he goes to start selling them door to door and he opens up a farm a little like Factory in his his family's Farm uh to like build the kits uh as he's going but like he's having trouble scaling up because he's trying to do production himself and uh and he's doing the sales himself and it's like okay this is tough so age 18 him and his brother get on a plane they go to Hong Kong and they're like we are going to start our Toy Factory here in Hong Kong they get their first night he literally sleeps in a bush because they didn't have like you know a place to stay that night so you see something why wouldn't he just do a sidewalk too hard bro you know you don't want to sleep on the ground you know so when you sleep on on a bush so he sleeps on a bush outside be normal use the bench they end up getting a apartment that I think was eight dollars a month um and that was their their apartment they start a factory this was now maybe uh 15 years ago-ish something like that and so they're in a very small city in China and so not they're not in Hong Kong anymore so they they end up creating a a factory so here's the factory so they they create a factory Nick ends up sleeping in the factory for eight years and um they had 13 000 to their name that was what their parents loaned them uh to start this business and so they're like um they're like how do we make this work and so they they want to create um this like kind of toy company and so they're like all right and so they do they start doing two things number one they're like all right we only have this much money and now we're living in China we gotta like make this stretch so these guys are like doing all the like you know the hustle porn stories you hear for entrepreneurship they're doing it where he's like we used to eat only off the dollar menu at McDonald's in China and he's like every day he's like for Christmas we would go get the Big Mac and it was like two dollars and change and that was our celebration um he's like I would eat half my fries and then I would go back to the counter and be like hey this is like I'm not even full that's awesome full container of fries he's like that's how we did it he's like we had the Thirteen thousand dollars from our our parents and then we had to make this work and so they end up creating a bunch of um you know fast forward till today they have um they have basically like uh the like they do a billion dollars a year in sales on their toy company this guy is personally a self-made billionaire they've created toys uh zuru z-u-r-u and so they've created a bunch of toys that you've heard of like Robo Fish I don't know if you've ever heard of that it's like a like a little fake it's a toy fish that'll swim around in a jar or like a fishbowl um they've created a bunch of balloons which I've bought this a bunch of times it's like you could you put the hose in it'll fill up a bunch of water balloons all at once um and so they they you know the dark Blaster they've sold 39 million of these or whatever and so they basically built all these um like hit viral toys and so and early on what they did like at the beginning what they did was they basically just knock off other good toys like gimmick toys and they would just make them themselves and try to like out execute them so they were like trying to out manufacture them or out distribute them so there'd be like a light up frisbee that was like hot so he they would like clone the light up Frisbee and then they would go and they would like like to get into retail stores they crashed the like the buyer's dinner for Dick's Sporting Goods and his sister just like showed up and kind of like schmoozed her way in and got the account and they just did that over and over and over again they you know they and they would get sued by the companies like hey you're copying our toys they're like oh yeah okay we gotta create original toys and so they kind of knocked it off they they brute force their way into retail and then they started creating the original toys like bunch of balloons of Robo Fish and the stuff and so basically um they uh you know they would basically sell these at Walmart wherever and um their big thing was like how do we manufacture this with no people so they're like um can we do this where it's automated and 10 times cheaper than everybody else and so they claim they claim that they're factories that have the robots that produce these have like no humans on the line uh I don't know if this is true because like even like Tesla which tried to do this with the factors was not able to do this but like maybe maybe it's true or maybe it's like pretty much true like there's very minimal human intervention how did you find this guy um someone dm'd it remember I talked about being known well somebody was like you're gonna love this this is a perfect Billy of the week um I forgot your name and it looks like him and his brother co-founded it and their sisters the CEO yeah so it's all in the family family owned they own the whole thing I think still and it did basically they have uh 8 000 employees 26 offices around the world last year they tripled sales to 1.1 billion um in 20 in 2021 and uh you know they're still not as big as Hasbro or Mattel or like you know Procter Gamble which are like hasbros 6 billion Mattel's 5 billion pngs like you know 80 billion um but now they're like launching new new products and new new brands so so they do the toy business they conquer that becomes a billionaire there and then he's like all right what can we do next so they go into other products and now they're like all right we're going to create um what does Procter and Gamble do they have products in every category we're gonna do diapers and so they go into the diapers thing with this brand called rascal friends and I think in the first year the rasculine friends is going to do 200 million uh that's not the first year but last year they're gonna do 200 million this next year they're projecting it to be 400 million and so um highly profitable just print cash and the toy business basically prints cash they use it to invest in these so how did the diaper business take off well they saw that Huggies is partnered with Disney and Procter Gamble's partnered with Warner Brothers that's why they could do like you know Disney or like Batman like things like that and so these guys went partner with Coco melon which is the YouTube like Kid Sensation and so um Rascal and Friends uh sorry last year was 100 million this year 150 million next year projecting 200 million um then they also did this with hair care they have a brand called Monday hair then they did pet food with a brand called nude they did a collagen brand called dose and they're just trying to replicate this with each thing so the Hair Care brand is going to do 60 million this year and so there's stacking these on top of each other but then the coup de gras the biggest one they're trying to do of all of them is this thing called zuru Tech um so what are they trying to do with zero Tech they're basically trying to create a factory that can just build you houses robots that build houses is the the big idea and so they're trying to create the biggest Factory uh on Earth period uh bigger than Tesla's gigafactory bigger than all of it so let me give you the stats on this thing um where is it so they're trying to scale it up to 1.6 million square meters two kilometers I can't even okay so two so that's uh that's about a mile and a quarter long yeah 2000k yeah and two thousand meters yeah they're trying to yeah they're trying to um they're trying to hire 2 000 more people in the next 24 months which is just insane and so their idea with this um with this Factory for the for the zero Tech thing it's basically like you can design a home they basically took a gaming engine like unreal or like uh Unity or whatever and they're like okay if you go into a game like The Sims you can like create a house and you can paint the wall and you could put a couch there and then you could put make the floors different like in The Sims you can basically design a house you can design a whole neighborhood you could design a large house small house whatever so they're like why don't we do that except it's real like when you're done you click print and then the robots basically just make that house and so this is what they're trying to do with this thing which honestly just sounds like you know frankly bizarre um but that's what they're doing and so that's the that's the new Venture that they're spinning out of this called zero Tech and it's basically a way to to use robots to build homes which is just kind of insane that is the architecture software using a gaming engine what do you think made them so special I mean this guy like I'm looking at him and he he just seemed like a have you ever met any New Zealand guys yeah like they're like the same like The Stereotype of like an Australian guy's like fun-loving loves to get drunk bad with money will spend all their money because they're like they just want to like be care like a lot of Australians don't have a lot of savings because they just don't mind spending at the bar they're fun loving they're always a blast to be around uh that's and that's what this guy like if I had to like just look at him like oh this guy seems like he goes all in on things well I think the key he's a redhead key to success so you know redheads they they have a chip on their shoulder from day one that there they got something to prove so I think that's like a uh that's a big deal that's I would say 80 for real though another 20 is hard work fine this guy's cool and he's only 35 I think yeah so I'm gonna read you some of his uh tips for Success okay you can give me a uh a thumbs up thumbs down or or a man or whatever you know if it's if it's just okay so the first one rethink your vocabulary I never use the word employee because we're High performing team and we're playing different positions I'm coaching the team I'm trying to get the best players in all the positions we have team members not employees in our business what do you think cool I I do the same thing I I hate calling them employees sometimes I'll use the word staff but I hate using employees uh but yeah I thought you just say the help I'll do the same thing also I'll never like when somebody um when they say it worked for for you I'm like no you work with me it does exactly what I was gonna say I always correct people on that oh yeah you know I work for Sean no you don't work for Sean you work with me and I I never say I work for anybody I work with them and it's an arrangement it's a partnership um I do X and I get Y and you do X you get Y and that's it um you know hold yourself to that okay next one bullets before cannonballs he goes the first thing I learned one of the things I learned early on was to fire bullets before cannonballs we're always firing lots of little bullets everywhere to see if those work if they work then we fire a cannonball behind it love it that's a good analogy um all right Break The Rules I went to University I studied law and commerce but I didn't like it to like it to be honest and there was a big hill I had to walk up every day to get to law school I didn't like that Hill either I did it for a year and I thought oh why not have a CR why not have a crack at just doing this work thing so I moved to China I didn't even make it to my second year of law I missed out which is probably a good thing a blessing in disguise okay yeah I don't really get the the uh it's a move to China but I didn't like a hill Different Strokes for different folks but I appreciate it all right don't be shaken by competition so he says in the early days we had this tiny production lab we spent half our money on an injection Motor Machine we started to produce our hot air balloon which didn't sell many of because it didn't meet regulations globally so we went online and copied a couple products one was a frisbee we got sued after it we went to a toy fair and we got through day one but the companies we copied came to our booth and yelled at us then we started innovating and it was our journey that took us six or seven years to get successful at product we lived off very very very little we scrapped uh we scrapped and scraped to find something that would work awesome okay yeah right fair enough all right let me skip these let me see if there's another good one um okay don't lose sight he says I remember when we made our first million hey fan of the show um we did we did a big deal with David Beckham where we made it David Beckham Tamagotchi at Walmart I was 21 at the time we got a 28 million dollar order from Walmart but we couldn't Finance it Walmart ended up canceling the whole order we was stuck with half of the Tamagotchis we were so excited because it was this because this awful amount of money at the time we had no money but we got a little bit complacent we were always checking how we were doing every month and we ended up losing I think uh 200 000 that month we lost a bunch of money we sat down and we thought from this day forward we are never ever gonna have a month where we lose money we took that approach and we never lost money again we were always profitable this guy's awesome what's his name Nick mowbray yeah mobre I think hey if anyone knows Nick or can do the introduction to him this guy I would love to have him on the Pod this guy's awesome right this guy's done the redhead Joe love Reddit my friend said something really funny he goes yeah my wife he uh he goes um we're I'm doing this deal and like uh we were dealing with some people that I was like I just can't tell if this person's like all hype or they're just gonna go like a charlatan or what and um and I was like for some reason they're just not getting along with this other person and I don't know what to make of it he goes oh he goes I've seen this many times in business two charlatans can't be in a room at the same time together they just combust they can't stand it because it's like my girlfriend she's a redhead she she told me once I can't stand being in the room with another redhead and I was like it's the same thing with charlatans and he goes one is a Charlotte one person's a charlatan you put him in the room with another known charlatan they'll hate each other that's so funny this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better our buddy Julian has this company called demand curve he's like hey will you speak at this like Divine curve conference thing and I'm like you know you know the rule the rule is hell no we don't do nothing for nobody except if it's our friends if we do it for free right so it's either big money or a big friend Julian's big friend so I did it for free the um so we go on there and I'm like um I don't know what this is oh it's a it's a it's a conference talk about audience building or content or something like that you get that all the time I know and so you go up there and you're like I'm gonna do my Spiel but something really interesting happened so it was me and this other guy sauger from the show called breaking points I bet you're familiar with it have you heard of this or Ben you have to know about breaking points you know this thing no you guys don't know about this okay this is basically like a like like a TV show like a podcast you know The Young Turks that that channel on YouTube that was like they did I know breaking points which is I Googled soccer and Crystal they do their own version of like a political correspondence show or whatever like a I don't even know what you call a political talk show basically and they do it they started off just doing it on YouTube or whatever and um and it's kind of blown up and so this he was the guy was on the panel with me and there was a few things he said that I was like really taking notes on I was like oh that's really smart and also this what this guy's doing is actually pretty awesome and I think could get huge like it looks on the surface sort of goofy it looks like kids playing dress-up because it's like they they made it look like a talk show so they're like at a desk he wears a suit and tie um you know so it's like but it's like you know is it like a liberal news it's like a liberal uh a Young Turk sing or is it like conservative uh I don't know how they would call it I'm not very political so I don't really even want to say I want to misclassify it but it's their schtick is like they um they cover the things they say the things that the mainstream media is not covering or is either undercovering these stories or they're just like spinning it for their own agenda and they're like we'll just try to say the truth like what we think is and like we'll just call it like we see it um which again everybody says but the question is like how close are you to actually doing that it's like company values every company says Integrity is our core value as they like you know destroy the Earth and so um and so that's what these guys do and so they have this set and it like looks like you've you went to you know when you go to like KFC in like China and it's like I don't know when I do KFC you've even been somewhere right I don't know Canada where have you gone Sam yeah you know like uh on Friday nights when you're like all right at Domino's in Tokyo like you know that feeling sorry I had to Big Dog you there with my International experience but uh but yeah basically they're this like I lived in China and they had this phrase nqr like I'd be like yeah I go to McDonald's here but I don't really like it I don't know why they're like oh it's nqr well thank you not quite right and it's the perfect description which is it's almost exactly right but it's not quite right and all my uh all my Asian friends say it's same same but different yeah exactly same same but different like this this knockoff Nike shoe it's same same just different exactly so so anyways that's like what these guys show looks like it looks almost like a knockoff correspondence show that's kind of that you know my initial judgment then they started watching it and they got on Joe Rogan and I was like wow this and Joe loves the show Joe's like Joe basically he was telling me just now he goes I go how'd you get on Rogan and he's like Rogan was just a fan of the show and he just reached out was like Hey I love the show guys and they're like wow uh we kind of didn't think we were like you know we had like most people like early on you kind of feel like am I doing the right thing I quit my job to do this it's not big huge it's on YouTube it was on YouTube and how many views an episode uh they'll have like I don't know they have like 800 000 subscribers or something like that so they're gonna go like media now but this was like before that Joe got on it well Joe was like into it when it was pretty early and he was like they're like wow Joe Rogan amazing if the number one podcaster in the world thinks this is like awesome maybe we're on to something so they just kept going and then um Joe invited them on the show and then there they they've launched like a paid subscription because they're like hey look like if you go to their website it just says help us what is it so breaking point that kind of what does the the title say goes like help us beat uh mainstream Media or something like that like help us defeat mainstream Media or like cover the stories that they don't cover some like it painted them as an enemy which is great uh like just a smart smart like marketing tactic basically um but but basically they so so Joe uh their first show the first paid show Joe Rogan came on and so you know they like had this like amazing way to like kind of kick off but that's because they had put in a few years of like hard work before that it's like four years old now and um and so he said a couple things I thought were really smart I'm gonna share them here in fact I actually think we should just run the whole uh interview we just did with him like as a my first million episode if those guys were down to that because I thought there's a bunch of interesting things one thing he go they go how did you get started like what's how did you get your first thousand customers and or like subscribers or whatever and we all get asked this a bunch I rarely do you hear something that interesting but he said a pretty interesting answer he goes well here's what I did I saw that in my Niche there were these people that were already like popular accounts and so he's like I just went and looked at who are the top one percent of of like popular accounts already and then I just decided okay the first content I create is just going to be content that they love because if they love it they'll share it they'll kind of endorse it and that'll drive a bunch of growth right away of the Right audience and so what he did was he's like okay they have this they need data they need visualizations they need charts cool so I'm just gonna or they need transcripts like quick transcripts of like what Trump just said they need to have like the edited well-formatted transcript so he's like we weren't doing our own opinions and Analysis no I would just sit there and I would live when Trump was talking I'm transcribing it I clean it up I format it I have the first to post Trump said this and then those guys would retweet it he's like and that's how I got my first like 10 000 subscribers he's like after you get 10 000 they're psychologically the same where you'll just start growing faster because people want to follow popular accounts What It Is Well what was your advice though to these people on growing an audience um my advice was pretty simple I go I don't think you should grow an audience for the sake of growing an audience like um the audience is basically a byproduct of you doing something else you really want to do like if you just got that itch you want to scratch like I want to create content like I've seen YouTubers I think I could do it that's actually a better reason to go do it than if I can get to a million subscribers then I'll upsell my merch to this percentage of them and I could make this much money it's like don't do the calculating way to do it just be like I'm doing this because either like in my case it was I'm super curious about these topics and like how am I going to justify spending nine hours reading about this [ __ ] topic that like I have no agenda for well if I had a podcast or a YouTube channel then I could just like make the content out of that then it has like a kind of like a purpose to my curiosity I have like an end point to it I have a justification for my curiosity I get to be professionally curious or like lately when I when I originally started the Pod I literally wrote this in a doc I've shared this before I wrote most likely nobody's going to listen to this but there's a hack really smart and interesting successful people are willing to go on a podcast even if it has they don't know how many listeners it has and so at the very like my main goal is to just have an excuse to meet with 50 awesome people that live in San Francisco like I'm in the tech Hub of the uni of the World San Francisco and I don't drink coffee so I don't want to just invite these guys to coffee I'll invite them on my podcast instead that was my whole like number one success criteria like number one agenda with like starting this podcast was oh it's a great excuse to hang out with these people that are like they're nearby they're in my Orbit and don't do it and like I don't know it's better than saying let me just get lunch with you please please please and so that was why I started the Pod dude I have uh like people ask me all the time as well how to build an audience and I used to have like an somewhat academic answer where I'm like well you just kind of like find content that like ranks well other places and you repurpose do all this this and lately I just like quit saying that and I just go well just like be an interesting person live an interesting life and just be at least kind of okay at talking about it publicly uh right because the thing you just said like if you're interesting if you lead an interesting life then all you have to do is share 10 of it and you only have to be okay at talking about it give people a peek into 10 of your life yeah and you don't even need to be that great and so people like over optimize for like this like the like you know it's kind of like when people talk about search they're like well you need all those keywords and do this do this and I'm like or I just do dope [ __ ] and write about it and people just gonna go straight to the website and look it up and that's harder and uh I still think you need that other stuff but like I I still think that it's mostly a game of just be interesting learn interesting stuff and be kind of good at talking about it so everyone else can consume and like there are people that do it other ways like Trung who used to work for you at the hustle you kind of discovered him you set up I think his Twitter account now he's got like whatever I don't know a million Twitter followers something crazy and I don't think Trung took that advice like I don't think Trung lives a interesting life or has this interesting business experience that's what he's sharing well he's he he learns about interesting he but yes that is true and so he didn't exactly you could make he's a remix right you could make the argument yeah but you could also make the argument that he's leaving leading an interesting life in that he's learning and discovering cool stuff uh so that's like you could make the argument both ways but I remember I'm not I I hate saying this because I'm definitely not like a ladies man but I've come a long way from being like a Napoleon Dynamite like males man yeah more of a malesman I'm a guys guy but not the way that you think it is not the way that it's usually meant like our many guys's guy and uh but I've come a long way from looking like Napoleon Dynamite and I remember like I had some like 18 year old ask me about like meeting girls and I was like shocked I was like your your bar for advice is quite low here but let me give you some advice if I could give anything which was basically I'm like you'll meet more women if you just focus on yourself and have cool badass hobbies and just invite people to come and do those Hobbies with you and I was like that's the that's the coolest hack ever for a young man you just do dope [ __ ] and then you just bring along people that's kind of like that with content yeah that's exactly right I think there are a bunch of different ways to win you could be uh like Ben for how to take over the world I would say he's curious about these you know great men in history or like these you know these sort of like biographies or whatever and then what he does he does a service he says I'll save you time so I call him a Time Saver because he packages it down into something concise the hustles newsletter and milk roads newsletter is exactly that it's a Time Saver I said what do you do you curate you package you deliver then you have like you know sort of like a remixer a remixer basically takes maybe one or two unrelated things spins them together puts them together and and puts that out there you have an original content creator that's like a naval or apology they're coming up with like independent Theses about the world and opinions and analyzes that really just originate from them and they put that out in the world um and then you have what I'll call like a lifestyle influencer that's what you're talking about which was lead an interesting Life share 10 of it so there's all these different play styles that you can use it's like in a video game so you want to play tank you want to play DPS you want to play healer you can play all these different roles and they'll all they're all winning you just have to know which play style you're trying to play uh so I see that with with content um but the one use you recommended which is live an interesting life and then share 10 of it I think that that is the most fun play style to play and the most valuable and the most valuable and the most unique because anybody honestly I don't know offense they're trying but like many people do and anybody can go read [ __ ] Reddit and Wikipedia and like create a threat of you know here's the story of how whatever the dude created Starbucks and it's like okay the one that you repeatedly done is is the hot sauce Guy what's the hot sauce guy okay yeah everyone talks about that guy that guy is the king of the thread boys yes every thread boy at home has like a small bottle of sriracha on a shrine and they're like I'll always remember the day I could tell people that Sriracha started in Thailand or the peppers were so bad that the Neighbors at the factory hated him and they don't even advertise and it's the same bottle since day one hot dog is still a dollar and fifty cents like you know classical but uh the one you said was the most I think the most rewarding playstyle and um my trainer had a great phrase for this because I was like um I was asking about his business I was like I was trying to help him with his business and he ended up dropping like like I thought I'm I'm the business guy I'm gonna share with him this great knowledge and I was like you got to think about your Niche your audience who's your ID you know who's your customer Persona and I was like just looking back you know just cringe City about like trying to help him with these things and he just said I was like you don't have a website you don't have a business card blah blah and he just go and I was like so who's your you know you got to know who's your customer he goes my customers are people that love what I do and I was like I was like okay that sounds like some smooth ass r b lyric but what does that mean what are you gonna do with that he's like and I didn't understand at that time but he just he's like that's it he's like my customers are going to be the people that love what I do and I said okay well what do you do he's like I'll train you on your Fitness and during that during that session I'll train your mind as much as your body right it's mindset and because the mindset's totally aligned with this stuff and that's what I'm into and I'll just share with you stuff that I'm doing with my own training with my own mindset training or my personal training I'll work out with you together sometimes and I'll come to your house and we'll just kick it for hours I don't I don't watch the clock right like that's how I want to live and people my customers are going to be people who want that and I'm not going to try to go backwards and say what does the market want I'm going to conform myself to it and so there was this real artist streak to it I thought all right well that sounds cool but like that [ __ ] don't work in the real world sure enough how does it work I was this only client I think at the time and he and we work out like in my garage but we just leave the garage open and then people walk by and they walk by and he never he never he just super friendly with him but never says like hey by the way you know if you're ever interested in my services here's my card never like they would walk by he would joke around with them sort of like just a flirt with people and then he would just like you know go back and keep doing our thing he's just a happy guy by like the seventh day people are like man it looks like y'all are having fun the music looks fun the home gym they saw us like setting it up each day it would get better and they saw us joking around they would see my you know I'm breaking a sweat they would see how we're using like we'd use our tree and we'd use all this stuff that was just around us because I didn't have all this equipment and it just looked like two people having a lot of fun and so my neighbor signed just a bunch of there's a bunch of sweaty shirtless guys hugging you know what I mean hanging off the trees and just yeah his body and so guess what people wanted some of that and so my neighbor signed up and her husband signs up then the other neighbor signs up then my sister's visiting she does a workout she signs up my mom signs up my brother-in-law signs up she their niece my niece and nephew sign up everybody starts signing up this guy now is a full roster still never had a website never had a business card uh never went and knocked on a door tried to do a sales pitch all these people like confluenced their schedules to him he's not even a trainer he's just a guy who just comes in and hangs out dog the best part is he's me [Laughter] you need a guy to come hang out with you I got a guy long story short this phrase of who are my customers the people that love what I do that is like playing in my opinion business at the highest level because it is the most freeing imagine if that was true that's the most freeing thing you could do right same thing with content creation Who Am I who am I going to get subscribers how am I going to grow my audience I'm just gonna do the most interesting things I'm gonna share it as I go and the people who follow me gonna be the people who love what I do and like that is just I think a much better way to go than like this frankly a sort of desperate approach that I think most people take to building a business or getting customers getting subscribers all that stuff dude let me show you an example of I think might be the exact opposite of what we're talking about so I've been researching and I think someone's DMV on this on Twitter but I found this thing called strong land like the word strong and then the word land strong land publishing his main thing is called uh life math money all right check this out so this guy he owns maybe half a dozen to a dozen I've I've found like four or five so far uh different Twitter handles one is is called the 48 Laws of Power bot or quote bot I believe another one is called the book of pook p-o-o-k and the 48 Laws of Power bot quote or quote bot is just like he's got a ton of quotes loaded into this and it has maybe two or three hundred thousand followers another one is called the book of pook I think that's how you pronounce puke p-o-o-k and he's just like quoting like this pickup artist from the early 2000s that no longer writes and then he owns a handful of more of these like just Twitter handles that are just like generic and they're all basically focused for men and it's about getting laid meeting girls making money getting fit and he owns like six or twelve of these handles which is obviously like not the hardest thing to grow because it's like these cool taboo topics so like it's one of those things where you don't talk about your friends but everyone wants to be better at all those things so you follow these these guys and he like has like a circular thing where he like retweets each one and each handle links off to a gumroad page that sells a document related to that so like the 48 law is a power one it's like here's how you get more powerful and power here's how you get more power and influence at your job which like who doesn't want to learn that and he sells it for 89 and then it's another one it's like here's a bunch of lines to pick up girls here's like a workout plan to get abs in eight weeks or here's like the perfect way to eat healthy and feel good and if I had to guess I would say that he's doing between 500 and a million dollars a year in sales just off these Gum Road things because you can see the sales so basically uh not the sales the reviews I think no no it's a sale so like for example oh wow live intentionally 90 day self-improvement program it's I think it costs 89 and it says 9506 sales how much is that is that 900 that's half a million that's half a million bucks uh I don't know how long right so maybe this has been out for years I think he's only been doing it for two years and then there's like you know his crypto one there's his like uh uh you know build your Twitter audience and how much is that how many how many did that sell so that has five thousand four hundred uh sales so oh how much dollars uh let's see I want like 100 bucks how much is it 179 so golly for his Twitter one has generated a million dollars his next one has generated 500 000 so I think pretty safe to say he's doing at least half a million a year probably closer to a million is that funny is this is this hilarious this little guy and his name is Harsh strongman I believe his name is so it's like an anonymous name and his blog is called lifemathmoney.com and if you go to and look up who is Harsh strongman and he says I'm a fine certified financial planner in India and I guess he he just has this blog and he talks about this stuff and and I think it's cool I think there's this Anonymous blogger who only uses a some type of like freeish looking website builder and uh gumroad it's just killing it and I think it's awesome that's amazing that is this is hilarious it's awesome right when I think about a horse strong man a man who just embodies life math and money I think of an Indian a mid-20s independent Indian certified financial planner like you know this is my cousin Vikram I just found out are living there's a reason Alpha and accountant both start with a this guy's as Alphas they can get the alpha accountant is gonna be his new thing and he's gonna have it he's gonna have a Twitter and on like Excel courses your [ __ ] yeah that's hilarious the Andrew Tate of excel all right um dude I uh on air I need you to help me make a decision all right okay so I am in the process of I'm I stopped in St Louis so I'm recording this from St Louis but I'm driving from New York to Austin I always stop in St Louis for five days to see family I'm gonna drive back to Austin I miss New York I miss Brooklyn already I absolutely you missed the energy there's something about this city the city you have to go romantic New York for some reason that's why I refuse to go there [Laughter] I love it I like I'm in Grind Mode I love being there but there's one thing that I'm currently doing that is it's it is something that I told myself I'm not gonna do it and that is [ __ ] about taxes and let taxes decide where I live I'm 100 doing that right now so I want to tell you some numbers so uh I currently live in Texas which has no state income I think the federal what what's the federal uh tax uh tax rate for the highest income is what's it 36 or 37 36 ish yeah all right so I think it's a little above 30 36 so hypothetically on a million dollars of income I'm spending three hundred and seventy thousand dollars a year on taxes or around 30 31 yeah Federal because Texas doesn't have income so Thirty one thousand dollars a month in tax uh sorry uh Thirty one thousand a month yeah which adds up to about 30 uh 370 a year in New York if I move there I would basically be giving away 51 to 52 of my income because uh the city of New York has like a 3.8 tax rate and then the state of New York has a 9.7 tax rate and so that means I'm I would have to be spending an additional 11 500 a month in income taxes plus New York rent that's the New York State rent that's not even the digital event of your place yeah yes plus the torrent of a place my current mortgage right now in Austin is around four thousand to five thousand dollars a month I would not want to purchase a place in Brooklyn I would want to rent a place and my budget to renting to have a family there would be around nine thousand to to fourteen thousand dollars a month in rent probably thirteen probably probably 11 to 12 I could probably get a place that I would want and that's what I would spend so I would be spending just and then let's say my income this is all hypothetical I'm not saying what I do or don't make if my income is two million I'm going to be spending around 280 000 a year in extra income taxes plus an additional hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year in uh rent meaning my costs are gonna be like 400 to 500 000 a year in additional costs just to live there not including the fact that like I'm in St Louis right now I just went out to eat for three people it's 51 if I'm in New York for three people for breakfast it's gonna be you know like Yeah a hundred bucks two times the cost so how would you justify making the move or not move well I kind of did myself right because I live in California and California has the same problems that New York has a High Cost of Living High state tax that sort of deal and now and I you know I work remote I could live anywhere at this point um and so you know it's very tempting especially when you hear like you meet people who who live in Texas then you meet people who live in Puerto Rico they're like you pay federal 37 I pay four percent I pay zero percent on capital gains like wow um all right I guess that's also an option so there's sort of like no end to it and I I used to live in Indonesia and um you know for two grand a month or three grand a month like you know you're living large um out there so like you know you could have a I had a cook and a maid that lived in my house I had a driver that drove me everywhere and like you know didn't have to think about anything so there really is no end to this idea of like optimizing cost of living uh versus you know like what you want to do there is no end to it but maybe there are thresholds yeah there's there's more rungs to the latter than even what you presented as I guess what I'm trying to say you could do you can take it even further um I think that I've always thought that sort of like goes back to that what you know what advice would my 18 year old self give me my 18 year old self which was like a more simple-minded version of myself would say this doesn't mean they're right but they would say this wait I thought you're rich like oh you wait you're wait so you're moving to where you don't want to live to save money that sounds not very rich right so if it's the same if if it's all the same in terms of where you enjoy living cool then obviously pick that pick the difference if you enjoy one more I would go to it now it's the hard part is how do you price that enjoyment how do you price that energy of New York we're gonna put a dollar we're gonna price it we're gonna say it's around four or five hundred thousand but dude for the same price I can live in Texas six months and in New York six months and fly private back and forth twice actually like two round trips and it'd still be cheaper uh but that's yeah but it would also add hassle to your life right so there's there's some situations where the variety adds what you want right it's like a win-win it's like oh yeah I don't want to be in one place all year anyways or I like the weather this time of year in one place and this time in another place so I'm just gonna move around the weather and that happens to coincide well with my tax situation but basically my thoughts my simple thought process is this if you're rich you can do tax optimizations but make sure it's not driving the car right so it gets to be in the car but it doesn't drive the car so I would do some things that are no sweat that are going to save you tax money oh great I would do that I would not move which is like one of the biggest things that changes your like day-to-day quality of life I would not move to a different place just like based on taxes as the primary reason I would have to have another primary reason so for example my reason for being in California is that me and my wife's family is all here and I just want to see them more often and have that be like I prefer that lifestyle I don't know how many years we all have left we're all healthy or my kids are little and they get to have this experience with their grandparents around but that matters more to me than than anything on the tax side so that's my decisive reason I made that one reason the priority and then I'll live with the rest so I think that's what you should do you should come up with your one decisive reason about where you're going to live and I would guess if you're rich that reason should not be taxes I gotta do it unfortunately but golly it sucks in the back of my head it's that famous Michael Jordan quote [Laughter] Republicans buy shoes too worthy quote Yeah but but also you know you also got to factor in how much more are you going to make how much more is maybe the connections you'll make in New York one investment you make um you know you can make more uh it's easier to make more uh for a guy like uh guys like us than it is to um adjust your lifestyle to try to save more I find it I would rather work harder to make more money than change my lifestyle in a way that I feel like I'm I'm making some compromise in order to save money well I think I'm gonna do it I if I could do this again for some reason I think Miami is just like hell on Earth uh it's not for some reason I could name about 50 reasons why I think that I think Miami's horrible but at the same time if I could do it again I almost wish I would have done so right now I live in Austin Texas it's because I got a bunch of friends there my best friends are there and we had an officer if I could have done it again I would have done Florida though and New York because Texas doesn't have nice enough weather that I'm just going just for the weather during winter time whereas Florida like you know you could I feel like I'm in the Caribbean sometimes in certain parts of it I wish I would have done Florida and New York if I could do it again that's what I wish I would have done I'm surprised the best friends being in Austin thing is not a bigger pool for you I feel like that's huge it is and that's why I'm I'm I don't actually mean if I could do it again I wish the Stars would have aligned so that could have happened it's kind of what I mean what a slap in the face I'm just glad I'm not your friend I'm not Neville who lives right next door to you in Austin who's like oh the energy in New York that's what's gonna get you you're gonna move away from me for the the energy come on bro dude New York's happening man it is quite fun it is fun whenever I walk around there I get pumped I do get pumped uh but I also like also I also want to kill like I I want to kill someone half the time dude like every time I'm in line at Whole Foods or some grocery store there I see a fight is this there's always a Como there's always commotions it's all something's always happening it always raises my blood pressure and I want to like I get in my protector mode that's hilarious um all right what else we got wanna do some more yeah uh I have one thing uh so I think we've talked about this and we've just you and I have hired this guy but go to dreamstudiocourse.com his name's Kevin Shen and I went and looked at his landing page this guy's landing page for a course a is awesome and B he's selling a course that I never in a million years would have thought would work but then I look at it and I think 100 you've nailed it and I understand how you could potentially make a million dollars a year so it's called dream Studio course and it's a fifteen hundred dollar course I don't know why he didn't just go two thousand but it's a fifteen hundred dollar course all on setting up your your Zoom setup basically because I don't even think it's for a podcaster but crazy cool looking landing page and whenever I when I saw his landing page I thought wow I really want this uh but how sick is that landing page it's a great landing it's a great landing page for a bunch of different reasons like first just start with headlines so headline is not a course about uh setting up your Zoom it says make your home video setup look like Hollywood right dream outcome so sells the dream outcome right away then there's a picture of him that's you know that shows a really awesome video setup so you know show don't tell and then it basically says build your studio with expert help it's a six week course that'll do whatever um okay enroll here so good call to action and then he's got a bunch of before and afters right here's Thiago Forte look he looked like [ __ ] before now he looks great right um you know look here's this person now they look great and he just keeps showing you know basically success stories of Transformations because fundamentally when people buy a course they're buying transformation of some kind they want to walk in one way and walk out another and uh most courses I've struggled with this myself most courses struggle to even understand that you're selling change you're selling a transformation not content not information and secondly they don't know how to show that I can actually provide this for you and with something that like the visual like this you're gonna get a before and after which is like before and after is my favorite sales pitch of all time um I think a before and after is the most compelling sales pitch do you have like a file or something that because all you're you're saying this as if you have like like categories of headlines headlines or of uh well you're like uh you're like oh he's doing the before and after style headline I love that style yeah I have the and so in my course I teach these I'm like here's a bunch of frames you can use to like sell your product if you can do did you send that to me like this yeah I will like this yeah you use before and after if it's not visual there's another one I call stop the struggle so stop the struggle you sent me this landing page actually abstract Ops used to have this landing page uh I think you invest in those guys they it was like a stick figure running away from a tornado and it just said stop putting off your back office tax your back back office tasks or like stop running away from your your your to-do list or whatever and that's what I call a stop the struggle pitch which is basically saying instead of saying what we do for you we'll say we can put you out of your pain is that pain hurting you I can stop the pain for you I can stop the struggle that you're having right he could do the same thing so he does dream outcome before and after right like make your home video setup look like Hollywood he could also have a stop the struggle which is like um you know uh you know basically a stop showing up to work looking like this and it's like the up the nose camera shot blah blah and it's like instead you could look like this after and so you know so basically I have these different frames and I'm like this is a way that you can present your product your information and so because I have a one of my sessions in my course is a landing page one and so that's why I'm like you this is where you need to use this it's on your landing page because your landing page is your 24 7 salesman that will always deliver the pitch exactly as they were trained to do 24 7 anywhere in the world never have a sick day and take no commission on sales and so like a landing page is the greatest salesman ever and so I think you should train your salesman to like be able to sell your product effectively essentially I uh I'm writing a new landing page now um for my thing and it is daunting like it no matter how many landing pages I've written it is always hard well because your order keeps going up because you're like oh I know what Great Looks like I know I want it to be great and so what would have otherwise been sufficient five years ago now you look at that you're like no I'm sure it can be better I know it could be better right because you're already really you're really good if I was gonna get somebody in my landing page I would hire you and so you're already very good at it um so the fact that you're feeling daunted is like I don't know like a musician going back into the studio to record their new album and it's like they know that they're good but it's like I gotta do it again I gotta make magic again I gotta make a hit again that's exactly how I feel I'm staring at this landing page and I'm like no this is lame this isn't up to my standard this sucks this sucks and I'm just like looking for you know what I what I usually do is what I like to do is find the way that I've been getting inspiration now is I find uh competitors that exist now or that used to offer a similar service and I go to uh newspapers.com and I find old articles written about them and I see how reporters used to explain this and if I see a catchy sentence I go boom got it um I'm still in that angle and so that's what I that's how I've been using uh that's how I've been getting inspiration is I just use newspapers.com to find old just articles New York Times written about a certain company that's in the same space there was this guy we hired once and I actually don't think it was a smart hire I made a bunch of mistakes now I think about looking back at my business career I'm like man we hired a firm to do that like yeah we hired this person to do this we paid this like I remember out of the Indy 500s like was doing their race or whatever and it was like Hey you there's free billboard space we can give it to you for your app and then I was like oh wow that's cool Indy 500 I've heard of that they're giving us free space and I we spent the next 48 hours like filming this [ __ ] video that was gonna go on this billboard or this like video billboard and I was like looking back I'm like oh my God I how cheap was my attention that I let this random cold email divert me and my marketing teams like Focus for 48 hours to do what like did we really think this billboard was going to like Indy 500. Drive downloads it was up to your app so yeah it was on point but like they're just not trying to download apps in that moment and like there's no way to track it it was it was awful and so like and that's happened to me a thousand times I've made a thousand dumb decisions like that I'm like wow we really like spent time and energy doing that that's like kind of embarrassing now that I know what I know now um so similarly we had hired a naming agency like I hired an agency I don't think that's a horrible idea I don't think that's the worst idea I think it was 15 or 25 Grand it was a lot of money and um it took like six weeks which is also more expensive it's like if you just had the name we would have just moved faster um what was the name that they came up with dating app is that like they just came back with like Jersey Shore characters your app is called the situation so we were thinking so fun party at the front yeah so so basically again Pauly D say it with me Paulie D the latest and greatest dating it was like um so anyways it wasn't even that they did a bad job they actually did a good job with their thing but it was just unnecessary it was an unnecessary thing to do but I I do respect the craft because I remember I went to this to the to the meeting room it's got Eli was sitting there uh I think Eli Altman is his name I think um and he was like okay so tell me about it and I was like so here's the screenshot and he's like no no just like tell me about it I'm like so it's an app that lets you do this it has these features he's like no no like why'd you make that and it's like oh because I'm at the time I was saying I was like so I'm single I've used dating apps and and he's like um I was like they just they all sucked and so that's why we wanted to make this great one and I like I was kept rushing into the here's my answer here's my solution he's like but like you said it sucked what sucked like uh what sucked about him I was like well they're just like too hard to use again generic and he's like so like what did you like do you remember just getting really frustrated about it one time so he's asking me these good questions to like actually unfold the unpack the customer Stories the words the phrases that actually mean something he got beyond the jargon and then I was like okay so what happens now now you guys you have this crazy brainstorming exercise where you come up with the name he's like no just like give me some time and he just took a whiteboard marker and he just sat down cross-legged like you know like Indian style in front of a whiteboard on the floor and I was like yeah he's literally like a child at play and he like he just like put his phone at silent and put it outside and I was like whoa this guy there's no bigger sign of seriousness than somebody who turns their phone off it like leaves it outside of the room and he's like he just started writing and he started writing long form like not I was like oh he's got some names and I went there to look for names he's no he was like you know dating is like hard actually it's not hard it's just kind of it's frustrating well the thing that's frustrating about it is like I know that I'm a good catch but I'm sitting here trying to perform and he's just like writing out like the feelings that go through the mind of the person the way the story needs Ed is it's the most like weirdest horrible thing like he's this thoughtful thing and he comes up with like dick butt like basically that's basically it um so he you know so he he did this long process and I actually think that there's a um there's some military phrase which is like um slow is smooth and smooth is fast yeah and I've always tried to go fast when it comes to business stuff how do I go faster how do we speed this up and I paid the price many times where like if I had just slowed down at the on the appropriate step the whole thing would have gone faster even though that step would have gone slower for example figuring out what is the actual problem I'm solving what are the what is the pain that the person is feeling here what are the words that they would use to describe it that they that would resonate with them and get them to nod their head and be like yeah I've had that um and then how would I explain it in a way that's simple to them like that's what he was ultimately trying to do he was trying to figure out what's the problem what are the words that somebody would actually use that would resonate with them or they nod and be like you know amen preach like I I feel that you wow you just you put it in words better than I even could how I was feeling about this situation and then oh you described the solution but instead of describing in terms of like the features and the widgets and the gadgets around it like you tell me kind of like how my life's gonna be different because I'm using this and this works this different way and it kind of makes sense that it would work that way right because you know let's use an analogy imagine you ran a lemonade standing blah blah blah and so that's what he did and I remember just walking out of that being like wow that was like an impressive thing this guy did and it looked so unimpressive he asked me some questions he kept slowing me down didn't want to jump to an answer then he just sat with a marker alone in a room and wrote for a long time on this whiteboard like paragraphs of stuff and then through that he came out with like you know a b a better understanding about my product than I had to begin with and I think that that like there's something cool about that process and like yeah when you go make this landing page it's like that's the thing you actually want to do because slowed smooth and smooth as fast well did you uh did I show you that I hired a branding agency I saw that yeah you sent me this I think I spent 15 grand on it and they're based they're in Hong Kong so like I think there was a like I think normally this would cost 30 Grand in America and I was actually happy with the work and this is normally something I would never do and it took him 30 days and it's like you just get this deck that like outlines and like I never would have done that and I think it was totally worth it this is not something I ever would have done and I think it was totally because whenever you like build [ __ ] and you make a website you slowly iterate and then like you hire new people and you're and they like come up with ideas and you're like no we already tried that or like no that doesn't work because this page looks like this like it's I'm like let's just get it all do it all the right way the first time and that's something I never in a million years would have done and it was worth it yeah we did that for the milk road too we hired uh this guy Jeremy um who did our initial branding and I never hired a branding agency like that for for a startup that I was doing but I was like all right I told Ben I said we're not going to do it off the bat like you're saying you're doing it up front um I think that's okay I don't think that's necessarily bad but I also don't think it's necessary and so usually for a startup you just kind of want to do it when I say off the bat I already had a quarter of a million in Revenue yeah yeah exactly so I had told Ben I said he's like uh he made a logo like in five minutes on canva and I was like all right I like this I like the name milk Road sounds fun goofy easy to say you see I can get the domain for two thousand dollars let's do it and he made this logo in like Fiverr or canva or something like that and I was like all right um let's run with it he's like you know don't you think we should uh blah blah blah and I was like all right here's the deal um it seems like you want to spend more Cycles on it because you think the brand is important and I agree the brand will be important I just don't think it's important for us to get our first 10 000 subscribers or even 100 000 subscribers so let's make a deal if we can get to 100 000 subscribers through our janky thing that will will reward ourselves by investing in the brand because I think ultimately the brand this whole exercise of like having a Cool brand is really for our own Pride more so than it's gonna improve the like conversion of this right now or like it's unproven how that's going to do so let's let's reward herself so we got to 100 000 and then we hired this guy and then he took us through these like cycles and you know like you know review after review of these like decks and then both were good I have this guy in India who's like my designer for all my projects and uh to create that Milkman character who I think is actually the best part of the brand um he actually made it this guy in India made it in like one day and well I was like wow perfect thank you uh that's exactly what I wanted uh thank you so much and so we just like ran with that dude I think uh I think the outcome was actually quite good I loved your brand um uh no I thought it was good I thought it was a win I told you the story right when I went on vacation to Hawaii and the the uh got Jeremy he lives there he lives in in Hawaii and he's like oh you're here like let's hang out I was like oh yeah great and so he comes to the hotel he walks up Barefoot and I was like uh something happened okay and he's like um he said what do you mean I was like you're not wearing shoes dude and he's like oh I don't wear shoes I was like you don't wear shoes and I was like most [ __ ] branding agency thing I've ever heard the most creative is he a white guy respect for taking the I'm a creative to the the the the peak like you thought the bean bags in the office was it you thought that you know having these like is he like a white guy who moved to Hawaii or is he born like I moved away Australian guy I moved to Hawaii when they moved there they were like oh we don't need shoes on the island like we just live we're part of the island and so they put their shoes in storage and so he's like yeah we had to go travel to Australia to go visit our family he's like I need to go get my shoes out of storage and I was like what a weirdo you don't need shoes that much that you didn't even just Chuck it in the garage like just in case like you you put them far away like that's the equivalent of the guy The Branding agency guy putting his phone on turning it off and leaving it outside dude just just so for the record I'm on board with that I think trees are stupid I walk around barefooted all the time when it gets above if it's 80 above 85 no shirt no shoes just that's that's just the rule I'm always outside shirt like I'm wearing socks right now no man I you got to get the calluses on there and then you then you it's like you wearing shoes anyway I dig it um but I'm happy you're back we went I went oh I had Ryan holiday on and uh we'll do a recap about that and then yeah I leave for one day you guys do a podcast about how great Hitler is I was like wow all right basically we did this part on hit on Hitler and I was talking about how sad it was and then our freaking YouTube guy I he like put up this stupid thumbnail and it said like um things or no uh uh things that I learned from things something about like it was about like like you know things you could learn from Hitler on business building and I was like whoa no not a chance and I texted bad I go bed you gotta get rid of this this is that's not at all what we talked about this is you know I and it had my face on it it had my face next to it and I was like dude that's not even remotely what we talked about we talked about how horrible he was um and so yeah we talked about Hitler and had Ryan holiday on Justin right when you left yeah so I decided to come back I cut my emergency short to come back oh I got [ __ ] man I can't let you totally throw our YouTube guy under the bus because he did contact me he was like hey I think I'm gonna do the Hitler angle I think it'll get tons of clicks but obviously it'll be controversial do you think that's cool and I was like yeah man go for it anything for clicks more YouTube if you're like and you're like yeah saw it while you're at it not my face only Samsung can you brighten the image can you break this face up a little bit turn down the color balance yeah can you get damn doing like a heart shape with his hands it was the worst man I saw that picture and I was like Baron I can't have this man you got to delete it immediately please delete that this is uh the reason I thought it was okay is because in the first 30 seconds of the video you say Hitler's obviously a bad person but I don't think it's wrong to like study his life and learn lessons from it and so I was like why he says he's a bad person in the first eight seconds of the video I think it's okay uh you ever heard that phrase if you're explaining you're losing yeah if you're explaining you're losing that is that that is totally right I was like it did it didn't work that that was a that was a I understand people like that episode but multiple people were like my favorite episode uh you know I just shared it I don't know if you saw those tweets there was a bunch of people who really liked that episode yeah and they also like the Ryan holiday one so basically uh you're welcome you're welcome for uh for carrying the load for a while I'm gonna take a uh this November I'm thinking about doing a motorcycle trip and I'll be gone for uh five days so you're gonna have to see if you can uh uh I got you carry yeah you're gonna see if you can carry the weight during that time yeah why um you know why uh yeah why Stalin is so misunderstood we could talk about this another time but do you know that YouTube channel Ghost Town living yeah that's um that abandoned town and they they kind of Vlog about you know as it as they've been building it out or whatever so I invested in it and um it's like me and Ryan Nathan Barry and like three or four other guys and I wrote a I think I gave him 25 Grand so I think I own like less than one percent of it but uh uh I'm gonna I want to ride a motorcycle there and check it out it's like four hours outside of La I think it'd be fun that's interesting why do you invest in that well you can ride your motorcycle there anyways right so what what do you think like this is going to become a valuable investment or no it was an emotional thing no it's it's it was an emotional thing my justification was it was like me Ryan Brent the guy on there my friend Brendan uh in like three and Nathan Barry and like and then only three other entrepreneurs so it was seven of us and I figure well if I can like somehow like get invited to like a thing there or get to talk to them and I invested 25 Grand I bet I can make that money back just off these relationships or just like a cool story like so that's kind of how I thought about it and I thought and I asked Nathan well and so I did for that reason and I also I did the whole deal without seeing any documents and just talking to Nathan Nathan Berry wrote me a text he goes just so you know there's a little bit of room if you want to join this here's the pros and here's the cons here's why I did it and uh he and I go okay cool I'm in then because you just said you're in I'm in because you're you know I trust him so that's it was that simple that's great yeah I think it's a good idea um okay cool and I have by the way I have a couple uh Banger topics I'm in a uh like I have a lot of research going on right now and uh I'm excited there's some that I'm like I'm like they're almost so good it might need to be its own episode like I want to do one that's basically breaking down like what's actually going on with VR like is VR kind of like dead in the wall why is it Loki killing it like yeah that sort of thing and so we've been doing a bunch of research on that um share it with me yeah and we'll do a whole episode on it on Monday and I'll be the straight man and I'll ask you questions like I don't know anything okay sounds good I think it needs basically it's good as is but I think it could be a lot better I actually want to go talk to a bunch of like the VR app developers to be like yo give me the real deal like what are you like here's what the data tells me but like what yeah do you agree or disagree so I want to talk to a few other experts which normally I don't do that normally it's like either that happened already accidentally spontaneously yeah you're not doing it it's a capital J journalism yeah so this time I'm kind of like I don't know going further for some reason but I I think it's because I actually want the answer because I want to know if I should be investing more in this space or not and um dude a couple of my investments have taken off like the first of some of the early deals with the fund is now two years old and we now have two or three companies that are like 40x to 80x returns um not liquid yet so you know anything can happen but that's like a crazy multiple and it's like it's such a it's like so in my brain I knew intellectually this is how it's supposed to go you're supposed to do this Angel Investing thing you get this basket of companies and then you're looking for these breakouts that are going to return this huge you know multiple uh 20x 30X 50s 100x thousand X returns and then when you start to see it actually happen you take out the calculator app and you're like wow this is incredible 100 000 can turn into 10 million just like that a hundred thousand dollars could turn into 50 million if it does one more like leap year um and that's pretty exciting so so that that's just been a like I don't know for some reason that's been a um I don't know like a second wind in terms of like once things I I guess in general When Things become real um things always ratchet up I've always felt this way like the first time I took a dividend out of my business I was like oh okay I was I thought I was already like you know all in but like this made it even more real and exciting and I'm watching it up when I thought I was already ratcheted all the way and the same thing's happening with the start of investing stuff for it now as these startups actually break out it's like you ratcheted it up even more even though you thought you already were but that that tangible hit of success same thing happened with content creation I thought I was already trying and then oh now we're getting 100 000 plus per episode okay I'm start doing research I'm start doing more like that I was like I thought I was already doing research but but no now I want to push the envelope further all right well let's do a whole thing on VR on Monday and we'll talk about your Investments cool we should actually do a thing where we portfolio yeah and we can balance it we could be like okay I lost this much money in the stock market and we could do a more wholesome like uh a more holistic thing so it's not just hey here's some wins it's like that means I have to log in and look though I don't even know [ __ ] that nevermind [Music] foreign [Music]

one thing I always tell young people is to invest in experience and opt out of the pressures of the Rat Race to plug right into some kind of career trajectory because there's an undue expectation with young people that they're supposed to know who they are and what they want to do with their lives at an age when their brains are barely formed and I think it's important for young people to go out and have as many experiences as possible before they make a certain particular choice about how they want to live their life because how can you make that choice until you've been exposed to a lot of different things until you've traveled and spent time with all different kinds of people

I'm mostly holding cash and waiting for winter to come and I'm going to buy businesses personally as well I just yeah I just want I want businesses you don't own any like uh Vanguard index fund [ __ ] you just are literally sitting on I imagine tens of millions of dollars of treasury bills yeah [Music] all right on today's episode we got Andrew Wilkinson joining if you don't know you gotta know Andrew is the creator of tiny tiny owns like 20 30 businesses at this point they own dribble they own Aeropress basically he buys and sells buys and sells businesses of total value maybe over a billion dollars at this point um definitely over 100 million in revenue and um and he's sort of known as the the Warren Buffett of the internet or that's the model that he chose to create so he didn't do the startup path he creates one genius idea he didn't do the investor path where he's just putting Small Checks Into these companies instead he was finding these little gems of businesses buying them and he's been doing this for like you know I don't know 10 15 years now and uh Andrew's become a good friend he's a friend of the Pod he listens to the Pod so he knows the vibe he's probably the most well-liked guest that we have so we're always happy to have back in this episode we talk about preparing for winter so how what moves he's making or has made in order to prepare for like you know what's going on in the economy so what he's doing in his business what he's investing in that sort of thing we talked about a couple of his new ideas or businesses that he started one uh like negotiating as a service or procurement as I'm told or um or this other company called um actually I don't want to give it all away but he talks about a couple of the ideas that he's working on and then we go on some tangents about why you should only rent your house and not buy houses we talked about um you know uh different ways that he gets together with other entrepreneurs and groups it's a good episode so about an hour and a half I think you'll like it uh all right enjoy this episode dude wait hold on Sean I haven't seen you in a minute where are you what you you good oh dude I've been literally sitting at Tesla charging stations for like the last year of my life it feels like I made a horrific mistake of renting a Tesla for a road trip where'd you go just from here to LA from the from the bay to LA and I thought okay that's cool might have to stop once or twice it'll stop five times basically every 90 minutes I had to stop for 30 minutes it was awful how fast were you going were you going above 80 no nothing not fast two kids in the back and a bunch of you know snacks like it was this was not like some this is not me it was you that's how I felt that's how I felt towards the car I was like apparently this isn't what most Teslas would be like but the Tesla I had rented you know was uh was not the greatest and which kind of sucked because this was my sell my wife on a Tesla's the next car trip and uh I had the opposite effect you know what's interesting is like I bought a Tesla like maybe eight or nine years ago and it was insane it felt like you know going to the future or whatever and I just bought the new BMW IX which is like their electric SUV and you realize that the main feature of the Tesla is how quiet and fast it accelerates and instead of being a Tesla feature you realize oh that's just an electric car feature and then as soon as I get in my BMW I plug in car play so it's like the Apple interface and you realize like at the end of the day these electric cars like there's really not any competitive Advantage um you know and Tesla frankly the interior is so much worse than BMW and all these German and American Manufacturing lectures so like I'm really curious to see how it all plays out now yeah they've done such a good job of rebranding uh fake leather to vegan interior and uh that's what they say they say it's vegan friendly interior I'm like oh you're just low quality like the fake leather and whenever I sit in them they feel like plastic I'm not a Tesla fan I also think that they're like super not sexy yeah like the model X looks like a weird big toe or something I mean I think like it's they're great they're great cars like I I really like them but I just think that everyone overestimated their competitive advantage and that at the end of the day you've got all these Legacy manufacturers and you know ultimately if Apple and Google are providing the interface that most people use it barely matters right it's just like a platform with an electric motor that takes you from A to B and then you know does it work with your iPhone or your Android uh and if you look at the Tesla interface it's like really bad it you can't sync your Maps up on the screen or anything like that it's it's not great so Sean you're not getting one uh actually I still probably will get one but um yeah I gotta like do research and [ __ ] now like I joined the subreddit for Tesla fans it's so crazy by the way how many products are just for Tesla owners because you basically have I don't know how many million but like like in the subreddit alone there's two million members and that's and that's Reddit reddit's like the niche part of it right so like I don't know exactly how many cars Tesla has sold now but um somebody can grab that I think they're doing they did like a million this quarter delivered or something like that something crazy like a huge huge jump but let's say that there's five million Teslas out there those are five million High net worth people who can be targeted with specific products and I've seen some people do this uh one guy had this thing called Tesla I forgot what it's called like Tesla uh camper or some [ __ ] like that it basically would turn the trunk of your Tesla if you fold down the back seat and you open up the trunk of it it would turn it into like a sleeper van and um it was just like a bed that goes in the back of a Tesla it's perfectly made to fit in the back of a Tesla it looks sleek like a Tesla thing and it was like there and they were doing like you know they're doing pretty well these guys would do seven figures on just just this one product with very minimal ad spend because they can go highly targeted with content Instagram and stuff like that to to reach Tesla owners and then same thing people selling these adapters that let you charge everywhere or there's an app because I was like trying to plan the road trip and I just typed in the destination and like you know it gives you a suggestion on where to stop to charge but it wasn't great that's why I stopped five times I was like there had to be a better more optimal route uh than this and there's some old ass app called a better route planner or something like that abrp and it's like the number one ranked thing the interface looks like it's you know from the 90s and um it just does a slightly better job at like giving you some custom control over what what charging stations you should hit on a trip and I just realized like wow there's this is like a um it's like Rolex owners or things like that like these high net worth um communities that are super passionate and they're locked into that ecosystem uh you know Apple being the biggest example of this like the big like the Apple blogs that's that were out early on right huge over time uh this is like there's the same opportunity with Tesla and other products like that that's awesome yeah maybe maybe I'll be getting one too but we'll see um so so we should reintroduce Andrew so Andrew Wilkins is back uh definitely the the the number one guest of the Pod both in our hearts and the fans Hearts so uh and I don't know why we don't schedule more of these because like we should but uh every quarter or so Andrew just texts us he's like hey I want to come on I got stuff and we're like great pick a pick a day let's do this and so he's back he's the uh founder CEO of uh of tiny and they buy beautiful internet businesses he's done a bunch of pods with us in the past explaining that stuff but he's also he also listen do you still listen to the Pod regularly I know you used to listen to the sauna at night yeah all the time I take little breaks because I get too pumped up sometimes when I listen like in the song really yeah listen I listened in the shower of the sauna usually [Laughter] all right if that lasts for more than four hours I'm always fully I'm always fully nude when I listen to you guys would it make you feel comfortable now if we turn the cameras off and take off our clothes that would be ideal so you had a bunch of ideas or topics Sam you want to go to yeah so you got you have a bunch of good [ __ ] uh where do you so we're going to talk about like what you're doing for winter meaning like what you're doing with your personal and business finances given that the economy may not be going well uh we're gonna talk about like different ideas that you have um I want to talk about the anonymized workers so you like you've been hiring some Anonymous folks and then you also have uh like five or six companies that you've started and we're gonna do like a postmortem on them and like say like what went well and what didn't go well so Sean you're starting yeah all right great I was gonna say you you drive Sean because Andrew already told me a lot of his stuff so I want you to tell me what's most interesting yeah let's start with winter so Andrew baby Tee It Off which is uh I think there is a consensus now that like we're either in a recession or going to be in a recession and that this is not gonna end uh soon give me your take on what your what you what your view is of the market and then what are you doing to prepare for that situation yeah so I mean there's this great quote by Andy Grove only the paranoids survive so ultimately like none of us know what's going to happen right like we could have a rebound I was super terrified like when kovid hit I thought the world was going to fall apart and it didn't but what I do when something like this happens is I stress test my business so if you think about it like um if you're about to drive your family in a minivan across a large Bridge that's like you know a kilometer in the sky and there's a one in 20 chance that bridge can't take the weight of your car you don't want to drive across right doesn't matter if you're probably going to be fine you just don't want to go across and so I think you want to stress test and over engineer your business for all the worst case scenarios no so effectively you know that's what I've been thinking about a lot and I think what people Miss is there's two ways that you know something like this can go bad right the worst way it can go bad is total loss right you go bankrupt your business fails you're embarrassed it's terrible well I think that's the worst but the less bad option that no one really talks about is missing opportunity so you get presented with something incredible and you're illiquid you can't take advantage of it so for example let's say you're an e-commerce company and suddenly ad rates drop you know 5x and you could go out and take the market and sell shitloads of your product uh you can't do that because you're you're a liquid or you're just barely holding on you don't have any cash reserves maybe there's an amazing acquisition you can merge or take over a competitor or something but you can't do that so you get instead of Errors of omission you get errors of commission you're not able to actually execute on those opportunities um and so you know I've been thinking a lot about this over the last couple months and generally we operate quite conservatively uh our goal is like you know any debt we have we want to be able to pay it off pretty much at any time we try and keep as much cash as we can at head office but there's a couple specific things that we're doing that I figured I'd share that could be useful so number one is what is a stress test so that sounds cool I want to stress test my businesses great I sit down today what the heck am I doing to do that okay so you would say um okay what happens if Revenue drops 50 in this business right are you able to lay people off is that a possibility are you stuck in a bunch of long-term contracts and leases that you can't get out of do you have a lot of debt that you can't pay um you know you're really modeling out like what I'll do is just do a simple spreadsheet and say like okay if Revenue goes up by 20 here's what it looks like if it goes down by 20 if it goes down by 50 if it goes down by 70 percent or for example one thing that often happens is you still have customers but in many businesses they have accounts receivable and people stop paying so people they're gonna pay you but they might just pay you late maybe in 90 days or 120 days and so what happens if no one pays you for two or three months do you have enough money in the in the bank do you have credit lines Etc so um I think you know it's really wise to kind of do that Shadow Boxing and imagine a bunch of nightmare scenarios us so that you can sleep at night great yeah actually continue where you're going continue where we're going then I'm going to ask you a question yeah okay so I'll talk a little bit about like what we're specifically doing um so everyone always says you know the best companies get started by during a recession which is absolutely true um but at the end of the day I am not going to be putting a lot of money into crazy Venture bets and what I mean by that is I'm not going to be taking like a lot of risk right so I'm not going to go and invest in the e-commerce company with 500k of Revenue at a 12 million dollar valuation I'll still keep betting on new companies but I'm doing it in a much more conservative way so for example we have an Angelus rolling fund we invest about 12 million dollars a year there and I'm pivoting it to totally focus on secondary and minority buyouts so for example a Founder who gets cold feet or wants to buy out their business partner something like that I'll do non-binary deals so what I mean by that is like if revenue and earnings get to where they say they're going to be the valuation is one thing if they don't the valuation is another so kind of our investors win in either scenario and then the other one is Strat uh like structured deals so for example saying to someone look I'll give you a five million dollar valuation but I want a guaranteed 15 return in the case of liquidation or dividends and that kind of stuff and then also I mean you guys have talked about this a lot but the idea of default alive I want to be investing in businesses where if they can't raise the next round they're not going out of business um and then the the other thing with Venture is like we've realized too we can do Venture internally by incubating businesses with low downsides so for example like turning our p l expenses into businesses in and of themselves so for example like we want better procurement internally we want to negotiate rates and get our p l under control and so we started a business to do that we want to you know get better credit across all of our businesses we started another business to do that so that's the kind of stuff we're doing with venture we just we just talked all about that the other day and what was your take Sam uh um what on what he just said I think it's I'm I should do that I am doing that or I'm doing something different uh part of me thinks that like that's a little well I personally wouldn't do that because I'm like man when [ __ ] gets bad I get afraid and I just want to focus focus focus and when I think of like you starting something new I'm like whoa aren't you gonna have to like allocate like another 500 000 to this salary for buyer.co and like uh or you know like however many of the salaries and however much it's gonna cost to do a new website and so I get I get nervous about that so are you not are you baking those into like new expenses are you saying like look I could just go and cut costs and save a little bit of money or I could go spend a little bit more money build a company around it well I'm looking at businesses like there's been businesses where okay here's an example so when we started buyer which is our negotiation service for software that we launched two years ago and we ended up selling it to ramp so I think we started that business for 50k at the end of the day we're looking at it and going this is a very low risk bet where we're basically finding someone who you know they want to start a company we're giving them all the tools to do it and we're going to partner with them provide all the capital but at the end of the day we're looking at really really simple Capital light businesses that can get Revenue within like two or three months I don't want something I mean I've done I can talk about this later but I've done businesses where we go for 10 years that are never profitable and we're just pouring good money after bad I you know I don't do that anymore what are you doing with your personal uh portfolio at the moment what's that like what's those percentages look like where where each thing is so um basically it's cash so I have treasury bills and then I also have a the only stock I hold right now is Pershing Square Holdings and the reason I really like that is a it's trading for far less than the value of the underlying assets so it's a holding company that owns a bunch of Blue Chip stocks and it's trading at about 66 percent of the net asset value so if there's a hundred dollars of stocks you're paying 66 cents and then they also are most of these kind of like uh holding company types trade at a discount anyways not to this degree right at the end of the day like this is why isn't for the type of fund it is uh well I think there's a variety of different reasons I mean it's illiquid it's traded in Europe uh it's run by Bill Ackman who has had you know a few blow-ups and people associate him with blow-ups if you actually look at his record he's killed it um and the other thing I like about that business by the way is that they own a very large position in interest rate swaptions so as interest rates go up the fund actually does better so over the last if you look at the net asset value over the last four weeks it's barely moved while the larger market has gone down significantly but anyway I'm mostly holding cash and waiting for winter to come and I'm going to buy businesses personally as well I just yeah I just want I want businesses you don't own any like uh Vanguard index fund [ __ ] you just are literally sitting on I imagine tens of millions of dollars of treasury bills yeah and that's why what do you do I guess where's your main focus with your balance sheet like uh how much of your worth is in your personal accounts versus let's say If you think about okay my my net worth how much of it is associated inside tiny and you need to be smart about what you're doing inside tiny versus Under personal because I think for most entrepreneurs most of their net worth is in their in their business and then their personal kind of checking accounts savings accounts and stock trading accounts are much smaller in comparison yeah I'm like 90 in Tiny But what I have done is I've had I've had liquidity and other things outside of tiny um you know tiny is a holding company that I co-own with Chris and there's been other assets like Legacy assets that have sold or cash flowed and so I've taken that money and compounded it and done stuff with it personally and the way I look at the personal money is if everything goes pear-shaped with tiny I still want to make sure that I you know can retire and be free and have enough money to do stuff so it's a little bit more conventional but you know what's funny is you know you're like oh you don't have ETFs and stuff as far as I'm concerned I do have an ETF because Pershing Square Holdings owns 10 positions right so it's a diversified stock portfolio and it just happens to be managed by Bill what percentage of your net worth or sorry if you have one number in treasury bills how's that compared to the other number in purchasing squares Pershing Square um I think it's 50 50 right now and one thing that I've been following is basically like uh two years ago so or a year ago you own or Co you're a major or I actually don't know what your percentage is I think uh it's in the the annual report but uh you own Wii Commerce which is yeah a collection of Shopify plugins as well as a few other products that's like a really really good business I forget what it said in the annual report but it's publicly traded it's like 50 or 60 million dollar a year in annual revenue and it's Peak stock was like 600 million dollars it was crushing it now like the rest of tech it's just been decimated to like I I what is it today I I think it's like 80 million or something so how does it feel like you're the only person I know who's like this wealthy well I know we talked to darmesh our master's like yeah I lost like 200 300 million dollars the other day uh how's like what's it feel like what's it where's your perspective and where's your emotions when you're seeing this thing destroy it and be amazing at 600 million all the way down to 80. like how do you feel about that so I think if I was just like a pure one of the interesting phenomenons I've seen is people who are great entrepreneurs often are just great entrepreneurs they don't become investors they you know they don't like thinking about the stock market and finance and stuff I actually really enjoy that side and so I've spent the last 10 years learning about investing and reading about Warren Buffett and Warren Buffett's Mentor Benjamin Graham has this whole idea of Mr market right so the stock market is like this Moody person it goes up and down at the end of the day if you know what your business is worth it's irrelevant what the stock market says it's worth so personally I mean yeah like sure there's a little bit of an ego hit seeing your net worth have some zeros pulled off of it but at the end of the day I know that number is made up anyway so for me it really doesn't affect me day to day I just go do I still own a great business well in it you're you're personally you're fine like you've got liquidity and you've helped all these other things going on but like um I imagine let me put let me put it this way there's a great Buffett story and he says you know Sam let's say you own a farm and it makes you a million dollars a year of profit right and some Yokel walks up and goes hey Sam I'll give you fifty thousand dollars for that farm you just go go away like no I'm not gonna sell and then someone else one day comes along and says hey I'll give you 20 million dollars maybe you consider that but the idea is that at the end of the day these yokels will yell numbers at you and you don't have to sell right unless you sell that's when it matters right if you sold for 50 Grand because you're panicked because you're going oh the economy's in a recession maybe my farm will crumble and you sell for 50 Grand yeah that sucks but if you ignore the yokels it's irrelevant and in the same vein we all own houses and the houses the values fluctuate constantly but we don't feel that right because you don't see a ticker or if you own the hustle there was times where if the hustle had been publicly traded it would have been worth next to nothing and then there are other times where it would be worth crazy numbers right and and you at the end of the day you know your business you know what it's worth yeah Dharma said this thing he goes valuation oscillates around value and I just had this image so you know so imagine you're creating value in this business the line is going up and it's pretty steady it's really it's quite hard actually to have like dramatic jumps in the value of your business or dramatic downs and then dramatic highs again it's like that's not really how values created in most businesses and um and he's like but then value is this like crazy Moody line that's swinging up and down on like higher and lower than the value at any given time and if you have to be able to differentiate between the value of a business and the valuation of a business and that's I think what you're what you're talking about totally you want to talk about some of these uh what do you want to go to now Sean well I was gonna say uh I have the opposite strategy as Andrew as I often tend to do with most of my friends I have the the opposite strategy Not By Design I wish that was not true but uh like for example right now I'm doing more I'm putting more attention and energy and doing more deals in Venture than I did in the past year the past two years really because with your personal money uh well no the fun money but I'm you know I'm the steward of that Capital right so and it's and the the returns of that my I have personal money in there as well but like the returns of that I think are going to be pretty meaningful personally but um this amazing thing has happened which is that all the founders have just read bad news for like six months straight and this has done two things one a bunch of like nuts a bunch of people who would have quit later quit now which is fantastic because picking is really hard in startups and so like you know thanks for making it easy we're like you meet a Founder who's just sort of like yeah so what like okay okay who you know who cares about what's going on in the world I'm still gonna do this thing I was obsessed with it before just because there's a war in Ukraine and a pandemic and the stock market's down and crypto is down doesn't change my interest in this like Niche thing so you see that person you're like okay great they're they're in it for the long haul you see other people who are pivoting like crazy and you're like okay they're not really in it for the Long Haul the second thing is that they've cut all their valuations by like 40 to 60 percent or more the same deal yeah or more uh so the same deal you could get you know for 10 million you're now getting for four or five million right 20 million you're now getting for 10 million and so but but the reality is that that same business was gonna exit seven to ten years from now where like the market like they're reacting they're changing their valuation based on today's data but they're you're gonna get paid out so you get to buy cheaper but you get to sell seven to ten years from now when the market conditions are going to be dramatically different than today and likely a lot better than whatever this next you know kind of down cycle of the market looks like over this year next year whatever however long my Worry My worry is Anchor bias right so I mean it if you think about it everyone was saying Venture evaluations were crazy in 2019 right let's say the average seed and you know or or sorry Angel uh valuation was say 5 million in 2019 which was much higher than it was in 2016. in 2016 I would see deals for one to 3 million so then it goes to 5 and then in 2020 2021 let's say it goes to 20 million right and then it comes back down to five and we all go oh wow it's a crazy deal right so My worry is that these businesses should actually be valued at one to three million because if anyone came to me with most of these businesses uh you know as a as a cash flow real world investor it just looks insane yeah but you send me a way to get your money back is to have a massive exit right for Venture right a venture deal will look horrible to any private Equity type of buyer and in the same way a private Equity deal to a venture capitalist will look also horrible because their their criteria and their lens and their model they're based on fundament like totally different factors and Andrew on this yeah you said I didn't invest in slack when I had the opportunity I didn't invest in this or that or this and you've made I don't know dozens or maybe even hundreds of Investments so you you walk the walk as well but you you said I wish I could have done this I wish I would have done that I made a huge mistake to do that an exercise that I do all the time that I try to do all the time is I try to ask myself what like you know like we constantly say like oh I wish I would have known that this company was going to be as big as it was and I wish I would have pounced it on that and I had that opportunity or there was this opportunity that I had and I missed it and I always ask myself what is happening this second this week this month where I'm gonna look back and there's a chance that it's gonna say I really just screwed that up like that was a like for example for me it was when I was running the hustle Facebook ads I could buy users for a dollar and they were worth ten dollars to me so like I knew at the present this is a good deal and I didn't go harder on that and I'm missed that opportunity and so right now I'm wondering you know I about eight months ago Sean and I were like dude we're never gonna make money on Angel Investing because like the valuations are 20 million dollars when a company should be five million dollars and like these whole this whole like idea of like a Tim Ferriss investing fifteen thousand dollars into Uber and making 50 million dollars that can never happen with us the numbers just don't work now I'm seeing these numbers and I'm like is that happening right now is this opportunity does this exist the second I would say you guys have a very unique opportunity because of your profile now right I think like Tim Ferriss was able to get into the best deals because people wanted him in them and you guys are going to have that same opportunity but I guess the question is foreign are you playing um are you playing roulette are you playing poker I play poker right I want to play with very good odds in my favor and I want to know the odds I don't want to play roulette where it's almost totally random I still think Venture is totally random I do it for fun off the side of my desk and don't get me wrong when I see I look back and go I could have predicted maybe not slack but certainly there's some of the businesses where I could see it was quite obvious that they were going to be winners and I could have pushed harder to invest in them but I still look at that as kind of random because I've had that feeling on businesses where I've lost everything so for me what I'm saying is you're about to enter an environment where anyone with cash who has a large sum of cash is going to be able to buy a business at say a 20 or a 30 earnings yield meaning you can buy a business and pay yourself back in two or three years maybe five years and you can buy good businesses right because everyone's gonna be panicking and wanting to sell there's going to be great opportunities to me I'd just rather play that poker game than Venture right now and I'm focused on it it's not to say I'm not going to do Venture Long Term and if a friend of mine who's amazing comes to me and says hey I need a hundred thousand dollars for my company I will invest all day still I'm just saying I'm not focusing any energy there right now what's an example of a company that you tried to buy recently and they wouldn't sell or an example of a company that you can you can reveal now and it's no big deal because it just it won't happen but is there any companies that you that that are good examples of this uh well there's one really weird one um bridgebase.com I started playing bridge like five years ago and it's kind of like chess.com there's all these nerds that play the website isn't particularly good but I was quite impressed by you know all the numbers behind it I think it ended up selling to someone else we looked at chess.com uh that ended up obviously blowing up with everything that happened with Queen's Gambit um I mean there's all sorts of businesses I I won't kiss and tell um because you know we still might look at some of them um but we've looked at a lot of kind of off the beaten path interesting businesses like that where you find like a nerdy cohort of people that have a dedicated place where they all gather how much you think bridgebase.com sold for I'm looking at now it looks like it has like I don't know eight million monthly unique visitors it's it's pretty huge yeah I think my mom uses this um by the way that little kiss and tell line I have this sheet on my phone where I just save a little throwaway lines that like I call them get out of jail free phrases or it's basically like how do you use a phrase in certain specific situations I'll give you another example so Andrew just did one where it's like you get kind of put on the spot and you don't really want to share so you have a phrase that gets you out of it smoothly safely securely and like no damage done versus um you know what there were many other things that he could have said in response that just would have been like sort of awkward and another one my uh my uncle uh told me this once he goes he was like trying to do this deal and it wasn't really working and I kind of we all kind of felt like I feel like this deal is doable but we're just not there yet and like maybe we just need to like you know if you just wind a dime this guy a little bit like I think it would happen but you can't just tell somebody I'd like to you know want to die in you that doesn't really work and he's just like you know my mentor told me you got to meet someone belly to belly if you're really ever gonna do a deal with them and like whether it happens or not you never regret meeting another man belly to belly the guy laughs he said okay yeah sure and and he used that as the to get what he wanted which is I'd like to meet you in person in a kind of informal way and I have no agenda like I can't come up with a new agenda to do it I'm just telling you that this is something I believe fundamentally that that two people need to be belly belly if they wanted if they ever want to do it you have an entire folder dedicated to these phrases what other folders do you have and what other words are in that folder like you use one all the time like don't don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining um yeah like it's like how do I how do I get my point across you know with a little bit of humor a little bit of geometric and a little bit of like uh ambiguity versus just speaking so [ __ ] like because I have this problem I'm really direct so I kind of needed these tools in order to do stuff and I stole this actually from Neville Neville in his copywriting course when I was creating my copywriting course I had taken other people's to see what do they know that I don't know what are some useful things they've taught and one of the things he teaches in there is he goes um what is he called like he's like transition well he has this long list of like transition phrases and it's like or like it calls it like slippery transitions or something like that and basically it's like we all know that you should kind of start with small talk and then get to the beat if you just go straight to the meat it's a little bit like aggressive and up front uh but also it's hard to be like you know Small Talk Small Talk small talk so anywho um do you want to do that you know like would you like to buy my product and it's like oh damn like you know awkward and so he uh he has a long list of like his little connector phrases and I was like oh that's really useful actually like this is a useful thing to get out of a course so when I created my course I started creating like these Banks of like phrases headline formulas transition words like different things and I'm like this is your go-to when you need to sign off or something like say hello in a fun way sign off in a fun way give a you know transition or like you know give somebody something that's direct you know and I saw I started creating those for myself dude belly to belly is a good one yeah it's a good one right like face to face doesn't have the same touch gets a chuckle and you're like okay I understand what you're trying to do Andrea are you doing any writing at the moment you're all you've always been a great writer but you have it doesn't seem like you're really producing a lot are you writing for your companies or anything yeah I'm working on a book actually what really on what yeah yeah just about um the story of building our business and just yeah like the experience that I've had over the last 15 years What's it gonna be called I don't know yet I'm still figuring it out I just signed like a book agent and uh I think I I think I sold it but yeah we'll see it's fun I mean it's funny it goes back to like um I think I've spent so many years frantically writing like Twitter threads that disappeared to The Ether and I love I love the idea of actually building a narrative story and writing something more substantial and I'm really enjoying that process um and it's just it's a new thing right it's a totally new thing to learn I'll share some stuff with you let me tell you a little book story that will give you so somebody when you tweeted out you're coming on you're like oh what should we talk about there's a bunch of questions a bunch of good ones honestly but uh one that stood out to me was this guy goes give us can you guys each tell us like an example of a butterfly effect moment in your life meaning a chance encounter you had with somebody uh or somebody or something that like just like nudge you in a different trajectory that kind of changed your thing and at the time it didn't seem like this Monumental decision or event it just seemed like this kind of harmless chance encounter and um and your book thing reminded me of my answer to that which is that Once Upon I think I've told the story before Once Upon a Time my dad uh was supposed to come to this meeting and he's like he's supposed to go to this meeting in San Diego he's like oh you should come with me I was a college kid at the time I think a junior or senior in college and um he said come with me and I was like okay I guess like I'll just tag along I'll shatter you for this I've never done that before so it's kind of a random thing that my dad tried to do and then my dad's flight gets canceled my dad's coming from Indonesia at the time so his flight gets canceled and I'm like oh shoot I'm already at my connecting stop like I'm like wherever Kansas City and like should I what should I do he's like oh just go do the meeting I'm like I don't even know the context like I don't even know what you do for a living how am I gonna talk to this guy he's like don't worry this guy's great um and I told him you'll be there and he he just said come hang out with me so I go to San Diego I meet this guy and the guy comes in as like a ball of energy and he's got Neil Centuria he comes in as this ball of energy Charisma he's immediately cracking jokes he's telling me a story he walks in and he's late like 25 minutes late I'm just sitting in this room and he goes he goes ah man I'm sorry I just got off the phone with Kyle whoever Comcast he's like let me tell you one thing you got a pen get out your pen write this down and I'm like I I just met this guy he haven't even said hello yet he doesn't know my name and I like go get my pen because like I'm the little [ __ ] that I am and he's like um he's like write this down if you have great customer service you can run the world you hear me run the world and I was like and so he's like this character and it turns out this guy at this crazy career where he he built like skyscraper in San Diego because he's like oh real estate's where I'm gonna make my money then he's like you got into Hollywood he wrote two like you know like scripts for films or something like that he was a showrunner for for a bit and so he thought that's how we would make it then he started tech companies with the internet boom and then he married the woman who started 100 flowers and he's like just had this crazy career he invested he bumped into a guy in an elevator invested his company and it ended up becoming like Chegg or something like that like it's a big multi-billion dollar thing so he had this crazy like he's just wowing me with all this like this like afternoon basically he takes me to this restaurant to go eat they have a special table for him and the tablecloth is all made out of paper it's a high-end restaurant but his was made out of paper like a kid's table and they had crayons that he would just draw diagrams and like cut deals at this table and he didn't he never had to order they would just bring out loads of food and then he'd walk away at the end like an Uber he'd never had to pay and I was like I don't know who this guy is but like that's what I want to be in life I I want to be this ball of energy who's just cutting deals drawn on tables and like you know has had five different arcs of his career in these different spaces and he's still like I don't know this guy's like 65 70 years old he still seems to have all the energy in the world so and then I just like went back to school and like but if I hadn't had that I don't think I would have had this blueprint that like being a entrepreneur could be cool and it could have like more variety and I didn't have to like choose one thing I like I just saw this one example for one day and it was like a dream basically then it was done I never talked to this guy now he's still there he's still in San Diego and he's like guest teaches at some school there and he's got this mega mansion on the top of the hill and uh that's what he does that's awesome that was a good story but oh sorry the book part on the way out he's like um so I'm with this guy for two and a half hours and then I'm just like whoa I don't know what the hell I just saw I'm 21 years old I've never I've never like in college don't meet people like this I didn't at least so this is the first time I ever met somebody like Dynamic like this and somebody who had made their own path and didn't just like follow their major into some career and um on the way out he just shoves a book in my hand and it's his book and uh it's called I'm there for your baby and if you want to read this guy's book it never sold a lot of copies I don't think but he wrote he wrote a note to me in it handed me this book look and then on my plane right out of there I sure enough read the book cover to cover and by the I like the guy by the time I was done with the book I loved the guy and so I always I remember that because I was like oh I've always thought of books in one way as this like I don't know Mass Market you're trying to become a best seller or something like that and then I realized a book is just a tool that like anybody can use like some people use their book to get public speaking gigs but this guy used it for a different thing which was he could turn a like it into a love it uh just by handing this book it's like cool I met you for two hours or an hour I'm not gonna talk to you anymore but this book will sell you on me and like what I'm all about through entertaining stories and whatever and um and I was just remember thinking oh that's a great idea to do so that every person you meet for the rest of your life you can convert them into being a a Believer and a buyer and a fan of what you do and that's actually how I want to use my book when I write a book foreign I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets serve dueling databases HubSpot grow better I did this um like personal values exercise like six months ago or so and when I thought about what do I actually want what do I actually like why do I do business it's I want to meet interesting people and one of the great things about being on Twitter or coming on this podcast is that I'll randomly bump into people in a coffee shop so I'll be sitting there and some guy I'll walk up and say hey I heard you on my first million I want to tell you about my business and I ended up making all these new friends so I've probably made like 20 new friends from this podcast I've had random lunches with people uh literally like I've been in line for lunch and someone's been like hey want to have lunch and I have and so the next level of that is yeah like a book you get to exist when you're in line for lunch like if you can't say no well yeah sure totally but it was great the guy with the guy was super interesting he had like an airplane leasing business it was it was crazy but um but I think a book you get to exist in someone's brain for like 20 25 hours sense exactly that right you can actually get someone to truly understand who you are and then when you meet them you don't have to do your Preamble you don't have to do your pitch you don't have to do what that guy did with you you don't have to sell you can just be yourself and they already know the deal and I think there's something really cool about that so speaking of meeting interesting people let me ask you guys if you would do this so I was talking to Nathan Berry the other day Nathan Berry you know he owns convertkit or he owns the most all of it he's probably worth two or three hundred million dollars he's worth a lot and he told me how when he travels sometimes he'll organize like he'll stay like if he wants to go somewhere for seven days he'll play in an eighth day that's dedicated to work and what he'll do is he'll do like a six hour meeting where he'll let like 20 or 30 people all come and hang out with him but he charges them and it's almost like a very miniature conference and I could maybe I'm butchering a little bit about what he does but basically he's like I got the inspiration because base camp Jason fried and those guys used to do these things where they would charge 200 to two thousand dollars and um you can come hang out at their office and I thought uh you know I should do this when I travel and it will pay for my trip and also I can meet interesting people and I thought about this and the cons are it could feel like Sleazy and weird to like well I'm charging money for my time but I think he actually said Andrew he went to one of your things and you gave the money away I think uh like you yeah and I was like yeah that is the sleazy part but it is kind of a cool way to like meet people that cross a certain threshold and it could if it could like pay for your trip and even though it's like well I don't I don't I have enough money that I could pay for my trip there's something about it that I find so intoxicating to do this have you ever thought about it would you do this Sean and Andrew yeah what are we gonna say I was going to say I really struggle with this so like you guys are I think one of you guys is on intro I'm on intro because listen I'm friends with the founder this I don't even have any I don't even think I have well I don't have that many dates available but my friend started it and he's like hey use this I was like fine I started using it then he puts my ad everywhere on on Facebook and so I only make like an hour or two available a month and it's just crazy it's just a service that lets you meet Sam Parr that's I'm pretty sure that's what intro is based on the ads that I've seen that's oh my God they are killing me with all these ads well it's a terrible way to use your time right like what we did we did a um a charity ask me anything so we're like okay anyone who pays whatever you donate will double it and um I think we like suggested the donation or whatever but with Nathan and about 20 other entrepreneurs we did like a zoom spent two or three hours answering all their questions I think we raised like 50 grand for a charity which was pretty cool um but I really struggle with this kind of stuff because at the end of the day you're selling your hours and I don't want to be in that business um but it's fun it's a fun way to do it and but I feel like it compromises the it like people expect value right so if you're on day eight of your trip and you're exhausted you now have to dial it up like that guy that met you in San Diego you have to be like histrionic you have to wear a mask you have to like pump yourself up and I find that one of the things I've realized is I'm very capable of doing that like I can I can be miserable and I can pump myself up like Tony Robbins style like jump on the trampoline and all that crap but it makes me miserable and so I just don't want to do that would you do it Sean I would not charge um for that mostly because if I'm doing that it's because I want to meet interesting people so I'd rather say filtered or I have the right to just stop talking to your boot you out and like the next fight like I can make these meetings 10 minutes right so Brad fell did this in bradfield's a VC in Boulder he's probably like one of the main most well-known Venture capitalists in Boulder Colorado and he used to have this one day on his calendar every month called the random random day or something like that he would just let you book a 15 or 20 minute meeting with him he'd just sit in a coffee shop and he'd sit there for four or five hours and he'd just try to meet as many people as he could and he had no filter there he's like you don't need a warm intro you don't need this you don't need that and first that was great branding for him of like I'm a man of the people uh you know it's like when garyvee does these tick tocks and it's like it's just some you know somebody who comes up to them and they look like you know they're like Haggard and they're they're like Gary can I just get a minute of your time he's like of course I'm anything for my my fans and he's like he said Gary you know how do I um I don't have enough money for dinner he's like here's what you're gonna do you're gonna take that guy's dinner and sell it now you got two dinners give him back one and you got one for yourself it's like he gives them this like pump up thing and the guy's like thank you so much and they hug and they Embrace and I'm like wow I don't want to touch anyone who listens to the podcast you know it was like I just here's a rule we're not touching like touching is not happening you know like that's just not a thing but he does it gives a a brand Vibe of like Gary's one of the people he's a man a man of the fans and so um similarly Brad would do this and I thought there was immense brand value for him doing this and then the second thing was I'm sure there is some when I met him I was like why do you do these uh because I went to one and he goes um he goes you know you have to create a landing spot for luck and other people call this a surface area for Serendipity but like you want to give in your schedule someplace first of all those are both both of those phrases Sean gold a landing area for luck and surface area for Serendipity sorry go ahead those are both beautiful yeah future book titles uh so so basically you wanna you wanna create like intentionally create space because the more successful you get the busier you typically will get by default and the less space goes on your calendar Buffett and others like you know Andrew you do this too where you just carve out space I'm gonna think I'm gonna read I'm gonna walk I don't need to have meetings after meetings after meetings because guess what if I let that happen that's exactly what's going to happen to my calendar and what this guy did I thought was interesting was cool if I just stay in my bubble and I only admit people who on the surface like are you know worthy of my time or whatever then I'm just gonna miss out on a whole bunch of other things and so how do I carve out you know what's the one percent of my time or two percent of my time that I'm willing to allocate towards Randomness luck Serendipity just so I can like have that in my in my mix it's amazing how that goes away like I remember when people would email me early in my career I would be so flattered like they'd write me like four paragraphs I'd write them a really thoughtful response and get on the phone with them and then you know you just get more and more of those and you waste your time like they're only interesting maybe like one out of five times the rest of the time you want to offer yourself and so I basically stopped and then it was like oh [ __ ] how do I get that Serendipity and to be honest going on here is a great form of serendipity because of those random uh meetings and introductions and stuff but most the time if someone emails me I honestly I delete it unless it's like one line and super clear if it's a pitch or anything I just delete it I I found my my most navalism Naval thing that I can't my original Duval quote where I realized like the point of this podcast is not to be well known I'm putting point of creating content is not to be well known meaning known by like a lot of people but rather to be known well so like what's happening now is in my inbox or my DMs people are sending me stuff that is so interesting to me or they're making intros that are so on point and the reason they can do that is because if they listen to the podcast they know exactly the type of [ __ ] I'm into and that Sam's into and so we get this like amazing inflow of just dope stuff that we didn't have the eyes and ears out there to go see and um that's when you know it's working like for anyone out there who wants to create content don't make your goal well known make it known well and you'll know it's working because you'll start getting more than your your you're being asked for in these emails or DMS and Andrew I'm sure you you get the same which is like people send you either interesting companies or deals or they want to come you know work for you and they want to help you solve specific problems because they know you well they know what you're what you're interested in what you're what you're looking for more of dude I had a guy just recently send me so he goes hey my website does this much revenue and this much profit and he told me all about it and I didn't reply and he goes what you don't believe me and he sent me a Google drive with his tax returns like had his that is social and everything and it was 100 his tax return I mean I guess it could have been photoshopped but and he goes and then his reply was like see told you I didn't say anything small boy stuff that is absolutely stuff the tax returns it was like 17 million dollars of income and and he sent me multiple years uh and it was hilarious it was one of the best things and I was like you know instead of like uh Casey neistat and Dave Portnoy used to do these awesome videos where they would unbox all the fan mail that they got and it was actually really fun content I'm like we need to have like an unboxing our inbox you unbox your tax returns people just send us their tax returns and we didn't open it up and we react we created a YouTube React channel just to your income and your business to your piano is that guy want to does does he want to sell or get you to invest or what was it supposed to be friends he was just wanted to be friends you know Joe Rogan Rogan has this like famous YouTube clip where he reads some quote from some guy which is like most someone famous but it's like most men lead lives of you know quiet despair or something like that and he's like so true you know most people walking around that just have this this the sadness in them and there's a version of that for rich people which is if you are rich but unacknowledged there's something in you that just kills you and I mean we get this a lot for for the podcast so much where people are just like hey I just need to like it's like you go park at a mall or whatever you're like can you validate my parking that's how I feel it's like can you validate my my wealth can you validate my career it's like yep here let me give you the punch hole like this is amazing you're you are way wealthier than me you're way more successful than me you're probably smarter than me but they haven't they don't have the platform or the audience where they get that sort of congratulatory thing like maybe the people in their life they can't brag to they can't tell their employees how well they're doing you know there's no need to go do a press tour about it so it's like that would be uncomfortable but so then they just sort of like damn nobody nobody I won the game and nobody knows dude we've had so many people Sean who we've mentioned and they've reached out to me and I noticed that that just that mention it's they now view themselves as like a public figure they start creating content and things like that and I want to tell them like hey just so you know you've already won and it's like everybody's asking me about my skincare routine and it's like oh yeah it's like you know they get that little taste of that that Fame that hit those likes and they're like I guess I should abandon this working formula that's generating mounds of wealth in order to write some threads baby what's that what's that quote it's like would you rather be the world's greatest lover and have nobody know or be the world's worst lover but have everyone think you're the world's greatest lover right there's so many of these uh world's greatest lovers walking around dude speaking of being a lover Andrew you have like a little bit of a five o'clock shadow right now and your jaw is looking chiseled you look this is the best I've ever seen what's going on have you been getting some work done what's going on here yeah extensive facial reconstruction no I've just been powerlifting for the last six or eight months it's working awesome they're coming through the Riverside to Sam right now anyone who power lifts is just like automatically turned Sam on yeah I'm not the Sam par shirtless photos on Instagram level but I'm getting there okay so that's another example that's if you get there let's say let's say when you get there and you're just you're so proud of yourself but now nobody knows everyone still thinks you're just a normal looking dude but now you know the truth are you gonna get your parking validated are you gonna post something but maybe like you know uh you gotta like you know do the fake uh fake like humble thing where it's like you know I gotta be honest I'm so proud of myself I was really depressed about my body and nobody talks about this so that's why I'm coming forward with these selfies just I needed to be vulnerable here guys check this out who's the um who's the guy he was on Silicon Valley the Indian guy and he got jacked what's the mail on Johnny a comedian yeah like like think about that experience for him right because he had the biggest version of that uh yeah I don't I've done that I've I personally have like progress photos and stuff and I showed my friends but I would never I don't think I would ever post I've seen them online I can't do it I think they look great I've seen them are you sure less ripped than uh chamoth who's you're he's an investor in your thing right do you guys exchange you know I definitely am less definitely less ripped than Jamal no no no no no no no no I don't think so you guys you guys are you guys are right around the same area he's just dark so so you know darker always looks more uh cut you know what I'm saying yeah my problem is I've got a hardcore Farmer's hand so my arms get dark and then my entire body is basically translucent you can see my heart beating through my chest so it's not the best for a six-pack that's amazing yeah you're like what white privilege have you ever seen a man's heartbeat so um all right let's do some more I wanted to say one thing real quick you had said something that I thought was I want to say this because um this is one of the most interesting observations I had about my own like investing misses that I like made a firm note to change um so you talked about creating businesses off your off your p l so you look at your expenses and you say oh we spend money you know on SAS fees what if we could create a business is it by the way is the new one called buyer or is it called something else now no we actually started one gun deal maker and because buyer did software we sold it to ramp they're doing that we have to do something different right so basically the story there was we Chris and I were maniacal about negotiation in the early days right when you're the owner of a business say you saved 30 bucks that's 30 bucks in your pocket directly and what we noticed was as we as we got bigger and bigger and bigger we had managers and CEOs running the businesses their comp based on hitting a very large number and so if you know 30 grand or 30 bucks doesn't really matter anymore but to us the owners that really matters and so we were like okay how can we make this easy for the CEO because nobody likes the discomfort of negotiation I hate it and so the idea it's it's very uncomfortable I I don't like it either right I know all the tricks I've done it now I just don't enjoy doing it but if I can Outsource it to some Scrappy person who loves to negotiate a car or a house or a lease or whatever it is I'll do that all day long and so we created this business called dealmaker dealmaker dot Co and instead of doing software we're doing like office leases Furniture Insurance like all the random stuff in your p l and basically just CC them and they take a cut of whatever the savings are um and I just this is something I wanted myself because I was going oh my God like I had the experience of um you know when you're when you're rich or people know you're rich they will rip you off if they can right so a recent example is I got Wi-Fi installed in my house and they had to wire the house and do some stuff it was tens of thousands of dollars and I was like holy [ __ ] it's too late now I could have just had like an arrow installed in a mesh Network or whatever but instead I did like the You Know Rich fancy thing and got it all custom wired right or another one is in our office we got drapes and we got a quote and it was twenty thousand dollars for some white drapes I looked at Ikea we could buy them for like two thousand dollars right so I've just realizing that we have a Target on our back I think anyone who runs a business does especially when times are good and so I think having someone to negotiate on your behalf is a very good idea how did you how much did you fund this business with it it looks cool the site looks good yeah I think it may be like 50k like like I said we don't put large sums of money into this stuff we basically find really Scrappy operators where we can basically say look we've got all the back office all the structuring legal it's ready to go we'll build the website for you you just need to take it and run with it and we go typically like 50 50 or 70 30 depending on the amount of capital we have is it working yeah so far I mean I think it's profitable you said it's pretty you said you didn't need much to be you just CC deal maker so you're like when you're talking to your vendors or whatever you just CCD maker deal maker in and it's like basically like hey you know here's my brother who's gonna beat you up it's like think of it as like procurement Department right so like if you go to Walmart like we used to work with Walmart uh at metalab and it would be like okay here here's what we want we'd say like this is the number and then they send you to procurement and procurement is a guy who's literally a professional negotiator who crushes you and they Crush you in so many different ways right it's like your hourly rate is too high your payment terms you know you said 15 days we want 45. and so it's just about getting the most in my head I'm just imagining like a bunch of like young guys like like shaking in their boots like oh we gotta meet Mr picker and he's like this scary guy and you walk in it's just this like dork with like a horrible like half beard with like mustard on his white shirt that short sleeve it buttoned up like looking like Dwight and and it's just like the nerdiest guy ever and he just like starts rubbing his nipples like thinking about a good deal like oh yeah there's a great there's a great book called I will teach you to be rich by ramit Safi and I read it like 15 years ago and he makes a really good point he goes look you're not you don't get rich by paying attention to like lattes and like building budgets and like not buying lunch out you get rich by paying attention to these macro big things in your life so for example when you buy a house there's a massive difference between getting a three percent interest rate and a two percent interest rate but no one thinks like that and so this is the stuff you want to Outsource to someone else and have them do it you know you buy your car you buy your house you get it off how does this business buy twenty thousand dollars of furniture how are you actually pulling this off like how how what's the what's the what's the work behind the scenes to to to do this deal it's literally an army of guys who love to negotiate and we train them up we you know we give them all the books that we read and we have a process and you know they get cc'd and they go for it and they basically say look you know your first quote was X we saved you why give us the cut of the savings and and go for it in some instances they'll retain us so like for example let's say there's a company and they're like we want to do a super thorough review of everything then you know they might pay a retainer or something but usually it's just being cc'd my dad should work for you my dad is incredible at this he will like but he's very unorthodox you can't train those well it takes time here's the thing is like you and I like if we were I remember I walked into a car dealership and I go to the guy and I say I have two hours and if you can get me the car in two hours I will just sign whatever you want but I need it in two hours right that's the worst possible negotiating thing but I value my time and I don't want to sign documents I have a friend who will literally go to five of the same dealerships gets quote from all them name drop them to one another walk out five times do like 10 test drives show the guy how rich he is in a variety of ways to know so he knows he's serious and then finally his he'll save you know ten thousand dollars right I'm just too lazy but there's other people that where it's totally worth it and the numbers are here picks up the phone oh yeah Derek I'll be there shortly I'm just finishing up here I don't think I'm getting what I want here so I might go over there oh you have it ready for it well that's great I'm just gonna hang out here for 10 more minutes in case something changes my dude my dad will be on the phone with some company like but he does it for petty [ __ ] like he'll just try to get like you know you know like you know when you it's like dad you can't negotiate with the grocery store yeah no no literally he'll he'll call like the airline and just be like you know why is it why did you charge me for my seat they're like that's how planes work and he's like and then he'll be like you know I've been a customer for a long time and Palazzo just most people will just bail because it's too awkward he'll just sit in that [ __ ] he'll just be like and then they'll be like oh that's you know we've loved having you sir and he'll be like long time just very nasty behavior and he's like he's like whoa nasty Behavior what are you talking about like nothing is happening we just did the normal thing here we just charged you for the product and he's like yeah this is It's just upsetting okay well sir we gotta go now we need like a I want a text folder of all these phrases Trump will be like you know people are saying people are saying it's great they said it's great you know people are saying that they're saying that and he's just like keeps going with this statement that's my dad dude instead of so often so often it's just silence just being silent saying like you said throwing out one of those open-ended statements and then just staying silent and holding the discomfort and then often they will start to you know give on the price or whatever and you just realize like most people will just avoid social awkwardness dude you need instead of deal maker you need to have like comp maker or salary maker so many people myself include news for salary when I was negotiating my salary for HubSpot when we sold the company they I remember my wife was in the room but she was like on the other side of the computer screen so they couldn't see and they're like telling me a number and they told me a number and I was like yeah whatever you know whatever whatever's cool my wife was on the other end like what the [ __ ] shut up it's all good I remember that's actually a really good business idea maybe we should is that like a coach where it's like a coach so it like you know you don't because it'd be weird if it was like a third hey I'm doing a comp review this is Jerry from my procurement team Well here here's how you could but if you had that guy telling you like do this do this do this dude listen here's why it could be cool is because I remember I got a speeding ticket recently during the pandemic in like rural Kansas when I was driving across country and they were doing Zoom things so like Zoom I and I was like oh I'll fight the ticket because I actually think it's nonsense and so I had a lawyer I don't know if I'm breaking any laws here but I had a friend lawyer and I would be like hey I'm gonna put you on speakerphone so you could hear what they're saying and then just text me what you think I should say in court so I could fight this ticket and try to get off of it and she was on the phone like listening like all right ask them this and I asked them this so they'd ask them this and the lawyer or the the judge was like wow you really know what you're talking about I was like oh yeah you know like I just I really didn't think I did anything wrong and you really just need that for like when someone's just CC all emails part of the salary negotiation negotiation or have them there like listening to the zoom and like all right now say this now say this and then just give me half of the earnings that you you just got gone up by when I was at twitch they were like um yeah the salary uh is this and I was like oh um I just let him sit in that and I was like and they're like you know they're like uh sorry did you say something and I was like oh no just lower than I thought um and it was just like I don't know buying time and they're like well you know I was like can you explain how the process works I just so instead of like saying I want more here's a different number I was like can you explain how you guys get to a number like this where does this number come from and like you know where do babies come from they're like they don't know and then they're like and then they said the magic word they're like there's a we have these bands which is like a band is like code for like a range which is code for like we're trying to see how much of a sucker you really are like basically I was like oh so you're telling me for my role uh there is a specific minimum and a maximum band of compensation that I could get and you're offering me anything but the absolute top of the band or pay better yet have you ever gone out of band and gone higher what situations would cause that to occur they're like well somebody needs to vouch for it like they have to go to bat they have to write a memo I'm like cool all right now I know what I'm gonna go ask for and I basically just like work through the system but once you realize that these are all a negotiable and B like there's actually it's like playing a a like a a robot you know like that can only make certain moves on the board and you're like oh you can only go forward and backwards oh great so I'm just gonna go around you over here because you're bound by these rules of like this is how the process has to work and and um and so you know most companies you can get a lot more than you're currently getting what have you guys ever like thought about this when like you know my wife works at a big company she's been offered jobs at other big ten thousand twenty thousand person companies a hundred thousand person companies and I'm like Sarah what would happen if you just told the interviewer like hey look like uh let's let's screw this place a little like just tell me the most amount that you can give me yeah like no I mean not really excuse me but like what like what's stopping they're like look I don't give a [ __ ] it's not my money I'll yeah let's just like let's let's let's let's Rob this place if we can so let's just like I'm just gonna tell you across the table Yeah write down a number here why is this like 100 000th person employee who has the power to allocate certain dollars like they don't care you know it's not the company's money and I just has always shocked me that the culture is such that like they are actually being honest in many cases to the employer when they could be like look I like you you like me here's the rules I need you to tell me this and I can then give you this you know what I mean like what they don't have enough I can't believe they're not your friend they don't care their incentive is to just do the basement I don't cover their ass like I guess people in big companies um let's do uh let's do can we do one other topic yeah and you're picking the one that you had prepped that you're like you'd feel like ah man we need to get to that so pick that one and let's do that okay well let me do one that's applicable we were talking about winter coming and I had a story I wanted to tell so one of the other things um you know obviously were like you know stress testing all the businesses we're dialing in our P L's we're pulling excess cash into head office we're you know loading the elephant gun so to say we want to get ready for a big acquisition and winter and two two like kind of interesting things we're doing one you know this is very obvious if you have debt you know lock in right even at a higher rate I think a lot of people are doing this thing where they're going well it was you know interest rates were at three percent I could have locked in then now they're at you know five percent I don't want to lock in and they're kind of anchored to that three percent thing to me it's about certainty I want to know that when I build a model when I stress test the business that I know that my interest is going to be at five percent or whatever even if you know they go up or down or whatever I just want that certainty the other kind of weird thing we're doing we've done this once before is we're buying um we're buying options on the stock market so this is and this is kind of speculative but I look at it as an insurance policy so here's an example of what we did in 2020 so um we started freaking out about covet we're a little bit early on it Chris and I locked down kind of like late January or early February and if you remember everyone was kind of saying like oh this might be a bit of a nothing Burger up until March 1st or second or third kind of in that zone and so what we ended up doing is we're looking we're doing these stress tests and we're looking across all of our businesses and at the time a lot of our Revenue came from our agency businesses and we had these large Fortune 500 customers but we're going okay what's the first thing all the fortune 500s do they pay everyone late and so we're looking at okay we're going to get some late payments that's going to cause cash flow issues we might also have some of our startup clients go out of business and they may just not pay us and so we started looking at what is the number there that we want to ensure and it was like five or ten million bucks where we were like okay these are all companies that may just not pay us we might you know lose that revenue and if that's the case we're going to have a bad year we're not going to have liquidity and so what we did is we basically said okay in late February we said okay if this if the S P 500 the index of the 500 largest companies in America goes down by 20 we will get a big payout and so we bought for five hundred thousand dollars put options that were went out about a year so if any time in the next year uh the market dropped that much we would get a large payout and the idea is it's kind of like buying an insurance policy on your house right you pay this premium you put the money out and you hope that you just pay that premium and nothing bad happens but if your house burns down they'll give you five million dollars to rebuild it and so what ended up happening is we bought these put options they went from being worth five hundred thousand dollars to seven million dollars all of a sudden and Chris and I are like laughing our asses off never had you know never bought put options never been through this or whatever so they go to seven million dollars and we're like holy [ __ ] this is amazing let's sell them right and so we sell them we cash in we take seven million dollars onto our balance sheet and then we look at each other and we go well this could be the worst recession of all time uh you know are we are we the guys who just sold our insurance policy like should we keep holding this you know what if what if this is 1929 and the stock market's really going to go down 50 and the whole point of this is to have this insurance policy and sleep well at night now we don't have it and so we take all the money except for 500 Grand we we took 500 grand out we took all the money and we re-bed it and we lost everything came in and the markets rebounded now there's two ways to look at that story you know one is we we uh got hit with gambler's fallacy you know let's go in we'll do one last uh roll at the roulette table uh the way that I think about it is I go I lost my premium right I I paid for insurance and the bad thing didn't happen therefore I didn't deserve to get the seven million dollar payout and the fact that we sold it is just a you know that's yeah it sucks that we had that money in our bank account for five days or whatever but it really is irrelevant and so the way to think about this let's say that you own a SAS business and your entire net worth is in the SAS business and you currently uh you know you've raised money at 20 times revenue or something you might want to find a SAS business that's publicly traded that is a comp to you and you might want to buy out of the money put options or buy a basket of those and basically say if the market gets crushed that's probably an indication that the larger economy got crushed too or my part of the world got crushed and businesses like mine are doing badly and so it's kind of an interesting way to buy an insurance policy it is certainly a little bit gambly right but it is an interesting way to sleep where'd you come up with the math of like all right 500k well you can model these out there's a website called options profit calculator and you basically say this is the stock and it'll show you in a variety of scenarios and so for example in that one I just said okay in previous recessions you know a recession is defined as what you know more than four quarters 15 yeah draw down over two quarters or whatever I just said look if that happens over the next year I will get a payout and I could look at the different payouts based on where it went are you buying any real estate right now no I hate real estate uh are you Sean buying real estate no not at the moment I I hate real estate so much that I don't build equity in my own houses so I do interest only mortgages because I want everything in businesses because businesses a business can earn a million dollars of Revenue and then the next year do a hundred million dollars using creativity there's no uh apartment building you can buy that'll do a million dollars of Revenue and do a hundred million dollars next year that's just not how do you qualify for an interest only loan you just gotta make a lot of money you I think I think you can do it via most banks um generally it might be the sort of thing where you have to have some sort of collateral or other assets or be at a larger scale are you fixed or effectively yeah I I'm fixed yes so then you you got locked in at what what rate like to two when it was back I think I locked in at five right I'm one of those people where I was like you know hey let's lock in at three didn't do it let it go too long ended up blocking at 5 live but it goes back to I want to sleep at night it's possible interest rates go back down to two percent and I feel like an idiot but I want to sleep at night I just want if if interest rates go to eight percent ten percent which is you know maybe not high probability but it's certainly possible historically I don't want to deal with that Sean are you buying a house now no I just rented this place so it's like a two two year three year rental um yeah I like renting I like renting the place I live me too I love it for multiple reasons but like basically uh buying your buying the house you own is not a great investment doesn't there's no yield right you're you are the tenant um so so it's not like I think people conflate those two things like if you buy property that pays you okay that's an asset if you buy property you live in and it costs you money that's a liability in my opinion so so I think that's the the first piece second piece is picking the place you like to live is not always the best investment like what are the odds that the best investment of a pretty significant amount of capital is the place my wife really likes the countertops like it's just like it's not gonna be the place like well that's not where the value and I'll see you trust me yeah you have people people that put like 50 or even 90 of their personal net worth into a single investment which is a house and then they go oh it you know doubled in value over 15 years and you're going yeah if you just bought an ETF you would have had the same result and if you bought an individual stock you probably could have done way way better so to me it's like if someone's completely if they're not an investor at all then sure go buy a house all day whatever so say it's a reasonably okay investment but if you're even remotely smart and you know how to read and you go and read investing books and stuff I think it's crazy I mean I would I would just rent a house all day and put everything into equities and businesses where ending too I I own a house in Austin um because uh I I wanted that to be my residence and whatever we did and I actually rent that house out now and I'm not there I would much rather in the future for like the next 10 years Sarah and I even when we have kids we're renting for sure and I want to go a step further I want to rent all my furniture too so there's a company called feather have you guys heard of feather you can rent furniture on that website but it's only in certain cities and I intend to rent a place and I'll and I'll get a nice place and it'll cost me 10 to 15 grand a month and I'll spend another two to three thousand dollars a month and rent all my furniture I want to own nothing I love it it's so much it feels so much better not owning uh stuff I was I'm on my way back now to Austin and I was in Brooklyn for four months and I rented a furnished place and it was sick it made me so much happier I I'm realizing like so over the last couple years like I bought like a I have a house at a lake locally uh I've got a place in Vancouver I've got a house here and then the stuff and the management like just I have to have a staff that now manage all the houses right and I own them I you know I do this interest only thing but I do own them and I am responsible for them and there's just constant you know stuff breaking new furniture hiring designers doing Renos all this stuff and so you realize pretty quickly like everyone thinks they want to have you know 10 palatial Estates all over the world but no like you're running it becomes yet another business to manage yet another p l yet another group of people who you have to give opportunity to and have HR around and everything it's it's uh you know don't cry any tears for me but yeah it's it's really annoying yeah I think everybody uh ends up a prisoner of a prison of their own making and so you know you want to design that prison to be what are you going to be a prisoner to is it your stuff is it your properties right like if I bought a fancy car and I lived in San Francisco I just be stressed all the time that it's gonna get scratched or it's gonna get broken into and like you know I it would net make me less happy and less free and so it's like where do I want to like optimize for is like more free and more happy and um so you know cool I need to do some things to make that happen like maybe exercise is part of the prison I want to design right it's like cool I know that if I do this all the time and I make this a part of my routine and it's important to me and I don't miss it and I make time for it all the time it cost me money and it's like hard it's hard effort but it has this payoff of how I get to feel at the end how much more healthy I can be how much more mobile I can be et cetera et cetera and so I think it's not people think like you got to choose what you want or you got to choose what you want to do I think it's also you got to choose the like you know choose the constraints you're going to put on your body and your your time and your yourself and your psyche because you will have some and like whether you chose them or not that's up to to you totally I mean you look at like any of these there's all those sayings around if it floats or flies or other things you know rent it uh and I think that should be applied to to most things frankly and it's just a matter of can you get the things you want my for the issue for me is being in Canada in a small City we don't have furniture rental there's not a lot of great high-end rental homes and stuff but I'd be all over that if I could well dude thank you uh this is awesome I I loved seeing you I love uh seeing your face again it's not like being belly to belly I'll tell you that it's not like being belly to belly but dude his face your face has become a better face in the last six months your face is yeah dude you're looking full thick tight strong thanks guys yeah what's going on you you guys talked about um I know you did Camp MFM or whatever are you gonna do more of that how would you really regret not going you got the invite you blew it bro I know I know I hate basketball no one played dude it was like like Sean was the best player there which like we you know we weren't no no one was that amazing right now yeah no Ben on the Pod was like dunking on people uh Nick Huber was great Sean's really really good but besides that ever we were all just like a bunch of more event it's something I suck at like you know Sam's Camp MFM is gonna be like running the 200 meter sprint it's like oh I just happened to be amazing at this oh you know guys there's a track down the street [Laughter] oh look a squat rack Andrew what would be the version of that that you would do where it's like it's all right with just the two Staples are trying to have great interesting people that are you know curated set of people coming but the other is we're not just sitting in a room you know looking at a whiteboard or a presentation it's not a conference so it's like doing something that's a passion that we that we like and then the networking fills in the gaps in between that like the ins and outs the bus ride there the food the whatever but like the focus is on some activity what would yours be that you're like really interested in doing I don't I honestly I'm not I'm not a big hobby person I mean like like most entrepreneurs I get obsessed with business and stuff and it's been a real challenge for me to find those things I just did um like a I do these Forum groups where I've been in some of these groups for like 10 years five or six guys we go into a room once a month talk about everything that's going on in our business we do uh I do I used to be an EO and then I just started doing it myself and we just did a forum Retreat and we went to Whistler so you know beautiful mountain and we all went hiking we'd go hiking all day go do cold plunges exercise during the day so there's activities and there's something about being in a group specifically with other dudes where you're sweating and your heart rate is going and you're talking about what's going on in life that feels really good dude ass whipping actually yes yes we went to a spa and someone got ass whips yeah I bet they did but but we didn't this thing where we we would like do dinners and we'd have this pack of cards and we would just pull random cards and be really [ __ ] up questions like what's a what's a rude word your parents would use to describe you or like how have you let someone down in life and I just love that kind of stuff right so for me it's about how do you create things that facilitate deep interest in conversations ideally with people you have something in common with so there's a shared Bond but uh I mean I'd be down old car or whatever your deck and you're like all right guys I have a question should we kiss right now oh my God the deck said it not me the deck said it written and Sharpie that Retreat that was too easy sorry I'm working on my dad humor all right I gotta go this is great guys all right guys okay guys [Music]

and then I Googled like Mark Manson house because that's always like to tell I'm like is someone like crushing it because you can't really like it's hard to get a mortgage for a 15 million dollars unless you're actually raking it in and it said like you know Mark Manson sells Tribeca condo for 14 million dollars and I'm like damn like I thought book the book business was a bad business he must have crushed it he must be making millions [Music] my man Ryan holiday are you done I said nice to talk to you it's good to talk to you too um so you you asked to come here and I'll just because I just want to get out of the way I want to give you the love you asked to come on here because hey we're homies and I love you yeah and also because B you have a book coming out discipline is Destiny this is the new one for the series uh yeah it came out yesterday oh and how's it going so far really good really good it should be significantly higher it's already significantly higher than the last one and then you're so I I know where the numbers are but I'm waiting the one thing you don't know until the end of the second week is audiobook numbers and uh where it may or may not land on the bestseller list what do you think there's the outcome of this one's going to be um we'll probably come in a bit above 40 000 copies the first week I would I would venture to guess uh could be higher if they keep trending this way so because I have my own bookstore and I did the sales through my own bookstore I probably won't hit the Wall Street journalist uh they've they uh they skunked me last time and then the New York Times list is let's say 50 50. all of which my publisher is very concerned about and I've decided that I don't care about at all anymore because if you own your own bookstore that means that and you sell 20 000 copies do they not count all twenty thousands in in the rankings yeah so I mean just generally if you sold 20 000 copies of a book through One Bookstore they would find that to be suspicious uh uh or or unrepresentative and there's a chance it could get tossed if you ever look at the at the best seller list and you see like a little they call it a dagger it's like a little cross next to certain books that means that there was a lot of bulk purchases um or like suspicious activity so there could be that um but uh the The Wall Street Journal or book scan which is owned by Nielsen just flat out told me they just don't include uh sales from uh stores owned by the author anymore uh which doesn't strike me as that being a big enough category to have a rule about but um I guess it there's the potential for fraud like I guess theoretically I could have just you know inflated the numbers or something so so there's a chance it could get tossed but as I have gone on as an author I've cared once you get it once I feel like you have it and then you also realize like kind of how meaningless things are uh so I care a lot less about sort of the status or the recognition of sales and I care a lot more about you know did I sell as many copies as possible uh to as many people as possible right um because the whole place for people to read it does being on that list and when you say the best seller list are you meaning just the New York Times is that considered like the list and just being on that there's help sales there's there's sort of three lists there's New York Times which you probably rank is number one Wall Street Journal which you'd probably rank as number two and then USA Today those are the three uh what you have to hit one of those three lists to be called the national bestseller those are the three National lists um there is I think people tell themselves a story about how being on the list helps them sell more copies but as someone who buys a lot of books and talks to a lot of people who buy a lot of books I have never once heard of someone buying a book because they saw it on a list most people don't even know where they would find such a list dude I was reading um uh is it News Corp or I forget the company the the it's Rupert Murdock's company but he has two of them I forget which one is uh that owns I think penguin and they did this whole I was reading their annual report and they were doing this entire section on Mark Manson and basically saying like this has been like a breakthrough hit and like this is uh you know the company's like a 20 or 40 billion dollar company and they're referencing Mark Manson I'm like oh wow that's that must be a huge book uh in order for them to like discuss this in a six pages of a hundred page document and then I Googled like Mark Manson house because that's always like to tell I'm like is someone like crushing it because you can't really like it's hard to get a mortgage for 15 million dollar house unless you're actually raking it in and it said like you know Mark Manson sells Tribeca condo for 14 million dollars and I'm like damn like I thought book the book business was a bad business he must have crushed it he must be making millions it's actually a great business so the the publishing industry I think is about a 40 billion dollar industry uh News Corp owns harpercollins harpercollins publishes uh Mark uh penguin random house which is my publisher is the biggest publisher in the world and they are themselves let's look uh penguin Random House I think they're owned by a parent company I forget the parent company they're owned by bertelsman or something like that yeah yeah that's right but um here let's uh revenues their revenues I bet I uh 4 billion Euro for for penguin random house so it's a it's a very big business um uh and and always has been and there are multi multiple multi-billion dollar you know businesses inside that business even even Ingram which is the distributor that sells books to most independent retail is like a seven or eight billion dollar business but Mark's probably sold I think um I think uh subtle art of not giving a [ __ ] sold like 10 or 15 million copies and what do they cost 20 bucks yeah so so if you think about like my books I've sold 5 million copies if you said 20 that's that's a hundred million dollars in gross revenues right there right now now obviously there's a lot of middlemen even before it gets to the publisher right the publisher is selling the book at wholesale so right there uh that's you know cuts it in half uh and then you know it goes down but but there are V if you think about uh how much a book sells for and the quantities of which successful authors sell a lot of books that that number gets very very high this is why JK Rowling is is a billionaire right she's probably sold 100 200 million Harry Potter books not including licensing and all the other things you know uh different the the different formats whether it's audio or ebook or physical or hardcover even hardcover and paperback is a big thing like one of the I bet Mark for instance said I I know Mark and he's amazing the distinction the decision to put your book in paperback is actually a multi-million dollar decision for authors and and most authors have never even thought about this so for instance on a hardcover book um the the standard publishing contract and pretty much everyone including the authors that are uh household names are on the same contract it's just this is what it is is uh 15 on hardcover price so uh an author makes you know 15 of 27 whether you as the customer get that book for 17 on Amazon or for 27 at an independent bookstore you're making the same amount right your your royalty is on MSRP but 15 of hardcover right a paperback sells for about 10 to 15 dollars less than a hardcover right but and your royalty is 12 and a half percent so my my agent very early who was in publishing he was like he was like uh I will never let your books go into paperback um he's like you have to sell about as third you have to sell a third more books to make the same amount of money that you've sold in hardcover and this is why Tim ferriss's books are not widely available in paperback good to Great by Jim Collins which has sold tens of you know probably 10 million copies still in hardcover even though it's a 20 year old book so there's lots of little decisions so audible you make uh I think it's the same as I I think Audible and ebook are 25 of list price so you make it it's a higher royalty but on a lower price point audiobooks are like 15 bucks or nine bucks uh for for ebooks a lot of times uh so so somewhere between two and three bucks a book you make across formats so if you're in hardcover ebook and so you think Mark's book has sold 200 is I think did you say 200 million in sales so no no 20. he's probably sold 20 million books oh sorry in gross revenue oh uh was it 20 million books times hardcover price or you know it it there's gonna be a a blend there of the price the only the only thing that's worth pointing out this isn't a criticism it's a it's just a quirk of the business Mark has sold a Mark's books are very big internationally right his books are big in Brazil his books are big in India uh I I've experienced the same thing but as soon as you start like so as soon as you start selling lots of copies internationally let's just say you start seeing a lot less money for those titles right like for instance uh somebody sent me a copy of one of my books in uh from Iran recently and I emailed my agent and I said oh I didn't know we did like a Persian translation and he said we didn't he said Iran doesn't recognize uh copyright they just do whatever they want he's like you'll never see a penny from these books so the point is like if uh if you sell a million books in Russia right you're not getting your standard royalty rate you may never see a penny of that you might get an initial advance but you'll you know it's you start to get into uh let's say less transparency in the accounting as you sell so you can't you can't simply go well what's the total number of copies sold by a person and then times that by a number you're probably going to be overstating the cash they have on hand so you've sold 100 million in books so then like the estimate based off of the numbers you said would be like around 13 14 15 take home I mean how many authors are doing that selling five million books very very few I mean definitely there are a lot there are lots of people who have done it and there are people who have done much much higher than that but like as far as people who write about philosophy I mean I'm not sure it's been done ever uh certainly not in in in like the modern world so you know when I went to my publisher and I you know uh offered them an obscure book about ancient philosophy in 2011 2012 for for the stock but the first joke book you know they offered me my Advance on the obstacles away was 75 000 they were not they were not thinking you know that series would sell three or four million copies do you think that your life has or will become so we were talking about Tim Ferriss and we're like you know however much he's made on books it probably pales in comparison he's arguably like just guessing maybe he's worth 150 to 250 million dollars based off of his Shopify and Uber and Seed Investments and who he probably has done so many more things that I don't even know about do you think that your business is going to be a similar thing where it's almost like the books are awesome but they're going to be tiny compared to the other uh revenue streams I don't know I don't I don't do that many Investments but it is weird like I I um I was an advisor early on to like butcherbox and they've done a few sort of private transactions that I took part in and it is both humbling and surreal to be like to get a check and be like [ __ ] I would have had to sell a lot of books to get this same amount of money and this amount of money was you know a lot less work so I think for someone like Tim you know when when you can when you can invest in something that scales at that level it I I do think it makes you a little disinterested in the economics of publishing even though they are quite they are quite good I yeah I mean I was like and everyone talks about in writing a book and they say I think he's the one who told me this he's like it sucks he's like it just it stinks he he says he goes I love it kind of but I also really hate it it's very uncomfortable and it's a lot of hard work and I was like yeah I don't know why you'd write a book then when you if if you don't have if you don't if you don't truly truly love it I have no idea if he does or does not but it's very hard it seems it's almost impossible it is super weird though because uh like a lot wealthy people read books right there the the the interesting thing about books is that they sort of punch above their weight culturally it's like the Opera or something right and so uh like you could be very famous on YouTube and your average billionaire might not know who you are but if you write like a business book uh or a political book that sells reasonably well you're gonna you're gonna have some name recognition in an elite group and so I've gotten to meet like a number of very successful business people over the years and like as a rule they all want to write books or all want to talk about whether they should write a book or not and it was actually very helpful for me to learn that early on because like every author I knew was trying to start a business or follow in Tim ferriss's footsteps and invest in these companies to get really really rich and then I would meet really really rich people and they wanted to write books and it was a reminder to me that like uh doing stuff that's cool that you like that means something to you is what people do with their money when they have it and so they're like like I met this guy uh you actually probably know him but I won't put him on the spot but anyways he'd written a couple books and then he started a VC uh company uh he raised a fund he raised like a hundred million dollars and uh she had to put writing on the side to raise this fund and I asked him you know um like why are you doing this like what are you gonna I was like let's say you really succeed like let's say your fund crashes and you walk away with like 20 million dollars um what would you do with it right and he was like he's like do you know who Elan de baton is he's an author who's started this company called School of Life uh he was like I think I would do something like that and I was just I just burst into laughter because like let's do it now was it yeah he was it's like that that story about the you know the fisherman uh who meets that Western businessman who tells him like you know if you really scale up your company you know one day you can sit on a beach somewhere and it's like that's what I do now and so there is kind of this weirdness where people think Financial Freedom is this kind of abstract good and then you meet people who have it and they still have to wake up and figure out what they're gonna do all day dude I listen to your I want to talk about the YouTube thing in a second but I listen to your YouTube videos every single morning when I take a walk and like it makes me feel so good about myself not maybe not good about myself but I feel like I'm getting so much from it whether it's education whether it's just like you're helping me think differently I don't know what it is but I get so much from it when you you're the one creating all this stuff or at least you're paraphrasing like interesting people do you think that you are absorbing these lessons better than most others like you know like are you you just told this very simple story of like well why would you go and do this this and this when you're already doing that now are you motivated by like are you motivated by money are you motivated by all these things that you talk about like look this in this and this may not make you happy I think uh I I certainly struggle with it like every you know single person does because it's not like just knowing it doesn't magically make it easy but I would say like like a big lesson like that like why are you trying to make all this money to get somewhere you're already you already could be I feel like I do a better job learning those those big philosophical lessons like sort of where do you Reign ambition in you know sort of how do you define meaning or happiness or contentment in your life I probably am better at that than I am at some of the more basic stuff like you don't have to be anxious about this or like why are you letting this person get under your skin or why are you losing their temper about X Y or Z so like I feel like the bigger stuff the the stoicism or the philosophy sort of uh connects with me and and by the way that story that about the fishermen actually traces back to like the 14th century about uh it's his story about a prince uh advising a king or an advisor advising of Prince so the story goes way back I feel like I get that better than I do stuff that might be seem really easy for most people which is just like you know sort of day-to-day emotional management how you said something really cool on the I was listening to this the other day there's two things that stuck out but the first one is with Matthew McConaughey you're talking about content and you're asking him about how what he chooses like which projects he chooses and apparently he there was the whole part of the episode was talking about how he had like 10 or 20 million dollar offer and he was like nah I don't want to do this this doesn't this doesn't speak to me this is not how I want to spend my time and he was like he felt guilt over that and you guys were talking about Bob Dylan and I think it was you who said I want to make content like Bob Dylan which is quality and quantity don't necessarily have to be at odds with each other like I can output lots of really cool great stuff and you do do that and the daily stoic is an email then you have the daily dad another email and then you have the books which is you have dozens of them or a dozen of them plus and then you have uh the podcast and then you have the YouTube channel and I'm like how on Earth are you how are you outputting all this stuff it's always awesome I love all your [ __ ] well thank you I'm mean I I think I actually like I actually like doing it right so there's there's some people who they don't like doing it and so to do it because you think it'll make money or it's what you have to do um that would be not a reason to do it but like I like this morning I I got up and I wrote and yesterday when the book came out I was excited not to come into the office to see how you know the the discipline did but like I had saved like a really good chapter uh for what is the sequel because I'm doing this four book series like I was just [ __ ] pumped to do that like that that's really what gets me excited is doing the stuff so I've always I I think I tend to have uh uh more energy to make stuff than there actually is like pipes to put stuff out that's just like how it shook out um and I I agree like I I agree with the sentiment re Bob Dylan and that that like quantity and quality don't have to be opposed to each other and in fact uh the more you do chances are you'll you'll sort of get something magical or important I mean like I I really admire people who are wired differently and they are sort of painstakingly uh put uh you know put lots of years into something although like if you um you know I bet if you asked Mark uh he would and actually I have asked him but like following up a massive massive hit is really hard and I've been lucky in that my books have done well but they haven't done so well that like my whole world's changed like when the obstacle is the way it came out so obstacles the way it came out they didn't offer me very much money it sold well at first but it it took yeah and and not even slow but just steady like it probably didn't cross the one million copies sold Mark I know across the hundred thousand copies Mark within the first year because there was a bonus attached to it so it took you know 12 months to sell a hundred thousand copies but it probably took an additional four to five years before it crossed the 1 million copy Mark so like for someone like Mark or James clear or other other people like it would they they hit the 1 million Mark in like a number of months and when you start to do that everything changes expectations change uh you know inbound inquiries change um and I think I think it becomes hard to just like do the thing so I I feel like kind of lucky to be like to have a niche but to to have a big Niche but for it still to very much be a niche right like uh there's just more people haven't heard of me than have heard of me and that is a nice place to operate in dude so many people so the hustle we were a daily email and then me and Sean do this thing three days a week and people are like hey how are you doing quantity I want to get started but like you know I'm like banking 21 episodes before I start or I'm like perfecting like this blog post and you know I'm going more for quality versus quantity and in my head or sometimes I'll tell them I'm like no that's a false dichotomy that's not true like the quality is the quantity uh like you know you like the the output here or like the If This Were uh like quality plus quantity equals it would be like uh you know like the total reach and how impactful they are and the types of people you're impacting and to do that you have to have like something in there for quantity and it's really just kind of an excuse to procrastinate further that you're making up for yourself but hey it gets easier as you get into it's Unique quantity you need the swings to get better and B if you treat it like a job you could have way more output than you think yeah I have a couple thoughts there so one it's like try to apply that logic to like any other thing like imagine if you met a comedian and they were like I'm really focused on quality instead of quantity so I don't do a lot of stage time like I just don't go up very often you'd be like you're a shitty stand-up comic like the way you get good at it is by doing it a lot right and it's very hard to get to Quality without years of uh back and forth with an audience right like it's just really hard and so especially online where you're giving the thing away for free like you should be focused on quantity because quantity is how you get to a place where what you do is worth paying for at a premium level like with a book or something so I like I I've done a free email every day for six years right um that that's built a business but are you writing that I read it every day I mean every once in a while like like let's say 10 of them are you know hey I'll work with someone on my team be like hey I already wrote about this can you work this into a draft for me to approve or rewrite but like the vast majority of those daily emails were like a hundred percent original ideas that I put out a hundred percent of the dads that make it easier both both you're writing both of those every day yeah well I don't write it I mean I write every day but I don't write the email every day right so like I'm currently let's say like I could pull this up let me I have a document um where I I have someone track them like I am I'm scheduled out on daily stoic through and daily dad through October 14th and then I have 10 written that are ready to record 16 that are recorded but not unscheduled and then nine on daily dad that are ready to record and eight that are recorded but not scheduled so like and that's your system yeah so I'm just do like I might sit down today like I have I don't know where my to-do list is but on my to-do list I have three sort of one sentence ideas for daily dad emails and I might bust that out in 30 minutes and then that's you know almost a week worth of content right there are you uh writing the scripts to your YouTube videos I think you're only doing one or two a week right yes uh so YouTube uh I have a I have a I have a actually wait let me I'll come back to that in a sec the other thing I would say about the people who are like oh I really want to get to Quality that's why I take so long when I look at what those people make I very rarely see the quality right like they're like oh you know what this book it took me five years and I'm like where show me five years of work in this thing right I'm I'm not arguing with you that it it transpired over five years but I don't think you showed up and worked on this as you said like a job every day for five years I think it either it because if that were true I think it would either be a lot better or I think it would have come out a lot faster right so I think a lot of people are baking in a lot of inefficiencies and a lot of uh procrastination inside that and then patting themselves on the back and saying that they're doing a thing that they're really focused on quality so that's just like a dispute I have I think a lot of people take way too long to do things um when when I see like a Robert Greene or Robert Carro or you know one of these greats I'm like I see the I see the five years like it's obvious like you were like Robert Greene was telling me the other day he's like seven months into a chapter on this book that he's writing right now and when I read that chapter I'll see every [ __ ] day right because like that he's not lying dude when I read Robert Greene and um the uh what's his uh what's Carol's book Moses um yeah the Robert Moses book Robert Moses and then I just got done reading the rise of the Third Reich which is like which is like a 1500 or 1300 word like epic and then it pretty much like Titan is like this too anything Ron chernow does yes every sentence ha like to me it's like a life's work and if they're lucky they can maybe get three of them yes and I read those things and they make me depressed because I just think like I I can never do anything this detailed oriented this beautiful like it it those history it's I think it's mostly history books every single sentence is amazing and I don't understand how you could do that for so long yeah this is the William Manchester series on Churchill which I would highly recommend this is the Taylor Branch series on Martin Luther King also incredible in the acknowledgments of the last book in uh the the King series Taylor Branch talks about how his youngest son was born like the day he started the series and then took a break from college to help him finish the last book that's crazy man this is so nuts those are really like life's work they are and it's not just that every sentence is perfect but like we don't see that if you think about the iceberg we don't see the research the interviews right the on like location observing that went into forming one of those those sentences so yeah like there's definitely people who there's a reason they only do two or three things in their lifetime and then there's everybody else and chances are like you're everybody else uh and so uh there's that and then as far as the YouTube videos go I do a couple different ones like uh one the I think the easiest YouTube videos we do are like compilations of like reels or Instagram clips that I do so there's not a lot of script there it's just the intro it's like piecing together sort of uh meditations on a larger idea but if it is a like you know how to read Marcus Aurelius how to read Seneca um or you know let me tell you the biography of this stoic or I have one coming out next week that's about the relationship between Marcus Aurelius and antoninus Pius his stepfather that's a combination between like having somebody give me an outline and then me usually drawing on something that I wrote somewhere else so for me the writing particularly of the books is what generates the vast majority of the content and then I have people who help me just just in the way that I don't do the Spanish edition of my books I have people who help translate what I've done into different mediums are you using Google Docs yeah for them for the most part yeah and how big is the team uh like 10 people now probably yeah that includes the bookstore and also Does it include daily stoic and uh uh a daily Dad yeah yeah I'm saying that I probably have 10 employees maybe maybe 11 or 12 but but less than 15. dude that is crazy man the output is just awesome I I think that's amazing [Music] our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better I was messaging you the other day because um someone was like hey you should start a book club to me and I'm like well I read a lot but like you Ryan should really start it like someone like that and I looked a while ago I looked in the book of the month business the book it's called book of the month and it's like a company that's been around for like 50 60 maybe even 100 years it's been around for a long time and it's traded hands a ton I think right now last I heard they're in the 70 million range of Revenue um which is a big business but I don't know if it's growing and I don't know if that makes a profit I don't know what the situation is but have you looked into these book of the month businesses I think Reese Witherspoon had one too that I think was profitable yeah there's a there's a couple different ones there's another company called Literati uh book of the month the book of the month concept definitely goes back uh quite a bit and that used to be like a way that you would guarantee a book success would be if you were selected to one of those clubs because they might buy a hundred thousand copies or something um there's and then there's uh what is it called the next big idea book club uh which I think Malcolm Gladwell is an investor in there's there's a there's a handful of them um the problem with the business is first off not that many people read right uh unfortunately um second uh the logistics of it are what is tough right so like at the very best you're gonna be able to get those books from like let's say you're doing physical right at the very very best you're going to be able to get those books at 50 off from the publisher so if you start to get into uh you know like it it drives the subscription like already your subscription is more than Netflix which gets you unlimited of the best most entertaining content in the world right so the the really tough part is get into a place where you can move a lot of books and the revenue is high so I I started this newsletter like 15 years ago where I just recommend books uh what do you have like 250 000 people now on it something like that yeah and and I just prefer to like look if you want to buy the book from my bookstore I make a little bit of money doing that if you buy it from Amazon I get the commission but I'd much rather just have that list in that audience than try to monetize a book club itself because the bundle of including the book plus fulfilling the book Plus customer service and all that other stuff it I think I think it's just hard to make the business itself work how much revenue can you make on one send uh from from the reading list newsletter I don't know um I don't know uh uh I actually 10 or 20 grand maybe yeah that would be that would be a lot uh because the the other thing that I found is that the people who read the most uh who like real like like the kind or at least the kind of readers that I attract are like I don't want to say they're lone wolves but they're more like uh like I don't know about you but like the way I read is I just have at all times a long list of like books I'm going to get around to reading I'm not like oh you're reading this book right now I have space for you in my life so like like if I think about the impact that the list has had as far as moving copies for books it's not like oh we sold this many copies of this book this month it's more over a Time although I did invest in this company do you know the company vinyl me I think I introduce you to them Matt Fiedler the founder is mine that was my high school he was my or my cup my very very very close college friend and for those listening finally pleases awesome I don't know how many I don't remember how many people they have 20 30 000 subscribers and they send out a record a vinyl of a piece of vinyl and I remember he was uh like complaining to me he was like man the the like we whenever someone gets selected for our vinyl uh like when we pick an album it becomes the best-selling vinyl in the country because we're the biggest but but now they're not counting it anymore and uh right it's the same thing we're talking about with the best seller list they they would be the number one vinyl album in the country each month but but they just get skunked from the Billboard charts yeah and I I haven't asked Matt about the business lately but it's been around for 10 years now and it seems to be doing good I I but that's a different experience right and so I I'm one I was I guess I'm an advisor so I got some early shares in vital me when it came out so and that's been a surprisingly big business like I I when I see the numbers I'm always like whoa that's bigger than I would have guessed right you wouldn't you'd think like oh maybe a thousand people a month not 20 000 people a month yeah that's a lot of people but but I think and music is people consume more music than they do books right and you can do it over and over again with a bunch of people it's a passive experience and the the art of Discovery is different right like you want to be suggested random things on a regular basis and I think with a book like people have so little room to read in their lives that I I don't know I just I I I like the idea of the business and it would be amazing to make it work I have struggled to actually see it work and I think uh there's probably just ultimately better ways to monetize that attention than uh then then a list of subscribers you have to service each month for a specific kind of book you said something earlier about like you get access to all these amazing people and I follow you on Instagram and I've talked to you a bit and I follow your content and you are hanging out with like all these athletes you're hanging out with billionaires and business people and celebrities and all these interesting people who are some of the people who you've met where you said I want to emulate this particular attribute or the way that they've done this this and this I admire so much or this person is just wildly impressive who do you admire or uh of all the people you've met oh that's a good question um you know I actually talk about this in the in the end of uh of discipline uh as I was sort of struggling with the book kind of early in the process like one I was just [ __ ] tired because I've done a lot of books in a very short amount of time and like the idea it just I don't know it just wasn't gelling and um I had lunch with uh with Manu Ginobili uh who just got inducted in the Hall of Fame uh this month um and we were having lunch at the at the bookstore he he'd come out and we were hanging out and it just sort of struck me like this dude has four rings like his four championship rings and he has two gold medals uh and is a Hall of Famer and he was like I don't want to say he's a regular person because that sounds like uh that almost minimizes it but the point is when you think about someone who has four rings I think you think more of like a Jordan character who is fundamentally out of balance right like so there's no disputing Jordan is Jordan is like one of the greats if not the greatest like basketball player maybe athlete as a as a whole right um but but we tend to think that that to be that good requires like fundamentally some fundamental trade-offs about what kind of person you are and what your day-to-day life looks like like um Tom Brady right uh Comes Back to Football he can't walk away and it may well cost him his marriage right and and people see that and they go that's what it takes right um I'm not sure that that is what it takes that might be you know what it took in that specific scenario but like I the more I meet really successful people I become less impressed by like how much money they've made or like you know whether they have the most rings or the second most rings or whatever it is and I go like um is this person like a good parent do they seem like they live in reality you know um or or are they like are they actually able to wake up and enjoy like what they have today or is it like they're traveling here and there and they're just always doing stuff right um I I think like to me what the the the journey that I've tried to go on inspired by people like that is I want to be world class at what I do and and like be a somewhat of a normal person like who else it's almost easier to be great than it is to be good if that makes sense yeah that's awesome who who else have you uh who have you met so I you know him and Chris Bosh are interesting I've I listened to a bunch of content that you made with those guys I felt the same way about Chris Bosh when I was listening to him I'm like oh man this dude's like kinda yeah maybe normal's insulting but like that's what I was like you're I'm never gonna be seven feet tall but like you know like your mentality is achievable you know what I mean it's kind of funny as CR I do feel the same way about Chris uh and and his wife and and my wife and friends um but like uh every once in a while I'll mention one one of them to the other and then I forget that they it Chris said something to me actually when I had him on the daily Stoke podcast he's like you know he's elbowed me in the face like a lot like like it was like realizing like like their best and worst moments came like the the moment in both of their careers came at each other's expense right like like uh Manu goes up for a rebound that that Chris gets that Chris tips back to Ray Allen who makes a three-pointer to win to basically win the series right like it is also weird to think like yeah here are these like kind of two people that I admire and then they're on like uh their careers were like on a collision course with each other are they buddies now I don't think so no I don't think so even though they like they live not far from each other right the ones in San Antonio one's in Austin and I I do not think that they uh see each other socially now it might take some time like maybe maybe in 20 years uh the that rivalry Fades away is there anyone else who you've met and you're like man the way that you're pulling this off or the way that you're playing life I just admire so much well you know it was I had a weird one a couple weeks ago I I um I don't want to say who it is not because I it I feel weird uh dropping the name but anyways let's just say I met this musician and uh he'd read the books and he reached out to me through someone we know and he was like Hey you know next time you're in New York uh you should come see me or let me know I'd love to have dinner with you so I was like hey I'm actually going to be in New York like next week and he's like oh all right my assistant will like send you the details and um the details were uh like go to this helipad and then the helicopter took me uh and his son and uh our mutual friend to their house in the Hamptons where we had dinner and then it flew us back to Manhattan after dinner uh what yeah it was [ __ ] nuts uh it was super nuts but like talking to this person um he was like I was like so what's going on with you and he's like well you know my youngest just went away to college so we're empty nesters like we're gonna spend an extra couple weeks here in the Hamptons and it was like um again I think at the end of your life and when you reflect on whether you were successful or not you're going to think like what is do my kids want to spend time with me or not like am I what am I on my fourth marriage or am I my first marriage and he's he's been he's still with his high school sweetheart right despite selling a hundred million albums in between meeting and like the day that I was there he has a business that he founded with his son like I I like to me when I see stuff like that I'm like okay this is fundamentally not normal and that like we just flew on a helicopter to have dinner and that was like you know like a wave of the hand for you but that fundamentally you still worked very hard to remain rooted in some semblance of normalcy where your kids are not monsters and uh you're you like spending time together you uh one of my favorite books is conspiracy which is uh Nick Deton I believe is that his name Nick Denton yeah yeah Nick Denton the founder of Gawker and Peter Thiel and there's just so many moments in that book where I've been like oh my God I cannot believe that that's true and basically like the fact that like Peter Thiel plotted and had people on staff for like some amount of years five or ten years like a long time in order to like hey when you see Gawker screw up you tell me and we're gonna pounce and we're gonna sue them because they outed me out as being gay or you also told another story about how Peter Thiel had a Mercedes uh a black Mercedes everywhere he went that was just ready to roll in case anything bad happened and I don't know if this was in the book or if I'm making this up but I'm almost positive there was like a plane to New Zealand that like you he knew about or something like that is that true or am I making that up the Mercedes thing is in the book The New Zealand plane thing that sounds true uh but it that I think his New Zealand citizenship came after I finished the book yeah just like all this crazy stuff what um sure what was it like uh getting to know that guy I mean he he's one of those guys where like I actually don't think there is I don't know him but where there actually is no balance and he is just really quirky well I think uh it's it's both it's both very understandable and then very inexplicable right like if you had made billions of dollars and you were very powerful I don't think you would like to be picked on right like I think people were like why would he do this and it's like this this bully came along and humiliated him in his eyes like I I don't like not being a gay man I I can't really fully understand what what the reaction would be to being outed and and the a number of people that I that I interviewed for the book who were gay like they didn't even understand so like let's just let's just stipulate that his explanation of his experience was that this was humiliating and he uh found it to be very frustrating uh I think when you're at that level one of the feelings that you don't sit that doesn't sit well with you is impotence right like so when people were like Peter there's just nothing you can do about it he was like then what the [ __ ] is the point of everything I've done right and so so in that sense I think it's very understandable I think that the problem is if you're the kind of person who it's like I'm gonna spend 10 years uh chasing down this media Outlet when everyone is telling me not to do that you're also the kind of person who can get sucked into other things that I think are going to pay off less well whether it's backing JD Vance or Blake Masters or some of the other political bets that he's made um you know I I find this sort of anger and the resentment of what it seems to be driving that I've I have trouble I have trouble understanding it dude I don't have trouble understanding that I get so I I don't it comes from a at least for me like I would have done the same thing if I if like if you're if you have that money in power and someone wrongs you I wanna I I have that same mentality when I'm like I want to crush them typically I've got my wife saying like dude chill you're this isn't worth it and so like I listen to her but if I didn't have her I'd be like no no we're gonna let's destroy them and it comes with that I get that that I understand that's The Count of Monte Cristo that's the oldest Revenge story of of History I'm saying more the other thing like the problem is uh when you sort of start to feel like you can bend the world to your will that you can do anything and everything I think you get sucked down other avenues and I think some of the political bets he's made uh you know even even Trump himself like the fact that it worked uh doesn't mean that it made rational sense but how do you not feel like that I mean with my very very small amount of internet Fame and my mediocre to small financial success I'm like oh like I just I bent you know in in a I'm a big fish sometimes in a small pond and I'm a small fish in a big pond but I'll be like oh sick I just I bent though that's I say it all the time I bent the world to my reality like I just made my my true the thing I want to be true I made it true and that is incredibly intoxicating I think that there's lots of ways to do that there's a lot if you wrote a book and millions of people read it there's a way to do that if you become powerful in politics there's a way to do that if view the easiest and most practical way for most people is if you learn how to make money on your own then you're like oh like whatever I want I turn into reality I have a joke I call myself a manifest Cowboy like I just make I make the things that I want the things I think of I am not a business person I am an expert at making things that I think of be real and even at a small scale I get intoxicated like that and by I get Intoxicated by it do not I I've seen up close I I feel like very lucky that up close and personal multiple times particularly early on in my career I saw people who who had the ability to do that um also destroy themselves right so like I I Dr Doug Charney was my direct boss right like he would call me five times a day and I watched a guy who built a multi-billion dollar company that made 50 million t-shirts a year uh you know start something I mean I didn't start it but I let let's put it this way the The Arc of the entrepreneurial Journey the the Beauty and the danger of it is that you have an idea for something that is insane right like people are like that will never work here's all the reasons you will fail do not do that you will regret it right and then you do it and it works right that's that's the definition of what entrepreneurship does if everyone knew how to do it or if it was easy it would have already been done you were able to create something from nothing I you know that violates everyone else's conception of what's possible the dangerous thing you take from that is you now as you said see yourself as a person who does that and you see people who tell you that you can't do it or shouldn't do it or criticize you for doing it you see them as the enemy right so when Doug Turner is like I'm gonna start a made in USA Sweatshop free fashion company company that doesn't print its brand on things doesn't use professional models and owns all of its own stores and I'm gonna sell all those products for an enormous premium like that's that's [ __ ] nuts right like no part of that should work so then he does it and then people are like okay you did it but you should really have seasoned operators around you you know you really shouldn't over expand too quickly you know by the way it's not proper to have sexual relations with your employees right all these things that they told him he was like [ __ ] you who are you to tell me look at what I've done right and so he crashes and burns as a result of this exactly what you said like I'm a manifest Cowboy the rules don't apply to me I can bend reality to my will like do you ever you ever heard that expression the political expression about the reality-based community do you know that no no what's that so so as as George as George Bush was contemplating the invasion of Iraq I think it was Karl Rove but I one of one of the officials in the Bush Administration you know is responding to all the people who are like it's going to be an enormous Quagmire you're not going to get the like right now you have no international support Bob it's gonna cost this you know and they go look he's like there's two kinds of people he's like there's the people who live in the reality-based community and then the people who believe in America it basically says who believe in American exceptionalism who believes that America creates his own creates its own reality bends the rules the order of the world to its will and so they believed as they went into Iraq that yeah it was a bad idea for all these reasons but that could be changed through force of will and confidence and Firepower Etc but they're not always wrong but but it's not true maybe in that case but like that that feeling is cousins to uh cousins to the other working do you know what I mean where's Ginobili from uh Argentina like this Argentinian dude is Gonna Come and like be the boss and like kill it and like you know what I mean like that they're they're cousins yes but but here's the thing like when you look at manu's story he did not wake up one day in Argentina and go I will be a Hall of Fame NBA player right he makes his way like almost all those Journeys are much smaller and humbler than that right he makes the Argentinian team uh he's pretty good he gets you know he gets an opportunity to play in Europe where he plays he gets drafted like very late a total surprise he had not actually even entered the draft he was just drafted by the Spurs who let him play in Europe for like three years before he comes over almost nobody believed in him I mean he knew what he he knew he was good and he was confident in his abilities but there was not these delusions of great he was not Kanye West going around saying I'm Steve Jobs right like this was he he was like uh in the Churchill book they talk about this Churchill did not at the uh when when Britain is standing alone uh he does not in he does not know for certain that he will be able to bring America into the war and that you're like what what what what Churchill does is he buys some time right like all of these things start small and they build they're when when the person has this Vision that they can clearly articulate that they know to be like that to me that leads to disaster more often than the prophecy comes true dude that's crazy fascinating to me I gotta keep thinking about that but um another thing that you're associated with that I find like equally impressive even though it's much smaller now to all the other things that you've done is the ghost town Cerro Gordo which I'm a very very very small investor in but the reason why it's awesome is no you're not a small investor you're the guy uh the reason why well you're you're you're I I view you Brent and Nathan uh Nathan Berry as like uh you know the the guys but so basically like in 2015 or 14 you guys like you know got some money together and you bought this town that went viral because it was like you can buy a whole town for 1.3 million dollars a ghost town and you guys bought it and it was like doing okay whatever and then the pandemic hit and Brent spin UPS this YouTube channel and it felt like in a matter of six months it got a million subscribers and I remember being in my apartment in San Francisco miserable that I'm trapped in this place and I see these videos of him and it's like the it felt like it got me through the first like 12 months of the pandemic watching those videos like I felt so much better watching these like 20 or 30 minute videos of this charming cute dude named Brent like saying like hey so here's this old mine that I just found in my town let's just like you know walk a hundred feet into this mine and let's just see what we find and it's when you think of a mind you think of like a cave and this was like a like a crawl space and he just like is going deep in these places and that was amazing what what uh what's your feeling on how everything's going with that and like what's the plan well I mean 100 feet into mine one of the minds is 9 900 feet straight down that he regularly goes in it's [ __ ] insane it's crazy his videos are so good did you advise him or you guys were Partners on something does he did he get the content bug from you are you advising him how is this it's so good it's an amazing story it actually goes to what we were just talking about like the idea in it as an outsider or in retrospect it feels like guy makes brilliant investment buys Town turns it into a YouTube channel makes these amazing videos in this and it seems obvious now blows up yeah um but that's not how it went at all right like first time by the way what's the name of the channel uh Ghost Town living okay uh when when he first told me about it I was like dude that's a horrible idea I'm not interested at all right like I came in at a very small level at first because I didn't think it was a good idea but Brent's idea was buy this place find build a hotel on the site and make it some sort of like luxury resort thing that that they failed to do for like two years maybe even three years he had no intention of living up there it was losing money hand over fist right like he how many acres is it it's 300 acres but it backs up to like thousands of Acres of government land so it's and it's like in the mountains like four hours outside of L.A it's yeah it's about three and a half hours from La it it looks down uh on Death Valley at about 8 500 uh feet it was once the largest silver mine in the United States but there's like no water and electricity right there I was just up there he he like I took a nice warm shower there's water now oh but there wasn't I guess is what I mean there was not I mean historically there were some Springs and then those dried up and I mean it has always been a battle of the elements but it's funny that you you you bring up how you liked the videos during the pandemic my four-year-old fell in love with the videos during the pandemic and that's part of the reason I end up investing more money in it was that my son is obsessed uh like he knows he had trouble so Brent started as my intern like 12 or 13 years ago I think um and my son is met I mean is known Brent his whole life and it he's got so enthralled with the videos that he had trouble because it was the pandemic we couldn't see him he had trouble like conceiving of the fact that this was a real person that he knew that this was different than the YouTube channels of other people that he watches that he doesn't know and so he's so Charming in these videos and he's so endearing and like I don't know I've not really hung out with him I've only chatted with him a couple times it seems like he just kind of turned on this charm and Charisma and it was like intoxicating he's always been like a behind the scenes person and and I think that's what's so interesting is like yeah he didn't just randomly start a YouTube channel one day like he started the daily Stoke YouTube channel and he started the daily stroke podcast like he he was the one who who built out the systems or created the universes for me um and then that I am obviously the face of but he was the one who was like here I think we should do this and he's the one that figured like you know we probably had a hundred thousand YouTube subscribers when he went to Cerro Gordo so he had experience that he'd learned on the job so to speak uh working with me um and then the funny thing is uh we had shot some videos for daily stoic like the first week of March 2020 or maybe the last week of February um and he had taken the camera home to like upload some stuff and so when he went to Sarah Gordo he just took my camera or our camera like that Sarah Gordo was started with equipment that he had got for daily stoic and then used skills that he had developed uh with daily stoic that ultimately blew up into this thing that I don't think he definitely not I would have predicted but like people often underestimate how long you have to spend developing like a Baseline kind of skills before you know sort of the man meets the moment so to speak dude I read that in in Mastery Mastery changed my life I remember like exactly where I was where I read it and I was like oh this this is called apprenticeship like and that it totally Mastery you know I got turned on to you because I was or maybe I don't remember if you got me onto green or him to you but I remember reading Mastery and that was like a life-changing book because it talked talked about that but um Sarah Gordon you ever think about that like do you ever think about the fact that the hustle and this podcast could actually be the apprenticeship for like a company you start in your 50s that's 10 oh it's going to be it's going to be and people like yo all right so the hustle we sold for let's say tens of millions of dollars which is like I think by most people if you do I think I was 31 30 when we sold it which so like that's six that I would say it's objectively successful but compared to others like it's nothing right like sure compared to the company that bought us it's nothing yeah you know they bought us but uh and so a lot of people were like well you know like you guys only did that in four years I'm like yeah we did it in four years I also spent four years before that though uh studying writing and like blogging and reading and like being a student and I learned a skill which my skill was copywriting and that skill led me to this other thing which led me to this other thing which led me to this other thing and I often tell people I'm like everyone says overnight successes aren't true and I'm like well in a sense actually they can be like you could be a Mark Manson or something and like write a book and like it get really big really fast but it more likely than not that could happen like hitting a lottery is real like look at Instagram but learning the skill for five or ten years in advance is often necessary yeah to give Mark Credit though Mark doesn't hit the lottery I mean Mark was an online copywriter and marketer and had a platform for a decade before he writes a book right right but what I mean is like the set functions and growth are real yeah you know like it could be like it's doing okay it's going okay it's going okay and then a matter of like a month or three months it's like boom something just changed like that is real and I think people actually don't like acknowledging that because the story of like slow and steady is preferred because that like there's more character to that but like a step functions exist but you have to work a certain amount of time typically in order to get that step function that's what I mean you know I think about Michael Lewis in that regard like Michael Lewis is is a fantastic writer he's been a great writer for 40 years he wrote liars poker which is about Finance he wrote The Blind Side you know he wrote a number of these books that were that were big and he was he was a leading non-fiction author and then 2008 happens and it's the most inexplicable but widespread financial event of you know since the Great Depression and he is uniquely suited to write The Big Short which was his big transformative you know uh huge book like Moneyball The Blind Side the other movies that come out I believe they come out after the big short like Michael Lewis today looks like he's always been huge but you don't realize his career was sort of like this and then like this right like what like I I think about that I I'm very proud of all the books that I've written and I I continue to write them and work on it every day but I all I want to say I hold out hope but I I feel like there's some part of me that thinks all of this is training for like the book at the moment maybe it happens maybe it doesn't maybe it's the moment but the book only sells 10 copies but like I do feel like it's building towards whatever I'm meant to do are you not satisfied with your career now I'm very satisfied like more I was just writing about this in my journal this morning like when I'm look at the sales number of this book this isn't just like what I dreamed of this is like 10x what I even conceived of as being possible I'm just saying like uh I I I want what I'm working on to set me up for like something truly challenging so challenging that I or perfect for my skills and what I and my world view that I can't even think of it yet dude consistently I've said once I hit this wealth number I likely won't want any more and then I always do once I uh lift this much weight or do this type of athletic feat that I've been really working hard towards like I'll be happy and then I get there I'm like but we could go a little we could do a little more so like uh I think that's just unilaterally true with at least people who are driven enough to achieve anything interesting like it's just like it I've just settled with it's just never enough I mean that's okay I've never heard of someone getting to the number like like like actually getting the number because the goal posts always move so it wouldn't always hear people say it there's a number like when I when I talk to an author and they're like my goal is to sell a million copies or whatever I go like I don't have goals like why would you why would you even put a ceiling on it right like why you should just try to sell as many copies as it's capable of selling do you have um other than like be a good dad and be a good person and all this stuff do you have any professional goals for the next five 10 or 20 years where you say like this is what I want or any people who you say I I want to be I want my career to be similar to this type of person yeah I mean so like I sold this four book series so to do four like four interlocking interrelated books in ostensibly four years that that's the that's what it it could change but like that is like the mountain That I'm Climbing right now because because it was unlike the mountains that I'd done I'd done before I don't have like a certain number of books that I'm trying to write or certain number of copies that I'm trying to write but I uh I I do there's a like I I've never written one of those biographies that we were talking about and there's some part of me that thinks about maybe doing that at some point um and doing it any one place anyone in particular I do have a person but I don't want to say because uh someone might steal it but but I but I but I have thought about doing a big a big book like that and I there's a part of me that thinks being able to do it and not not care like financially like if it takes five years or takes ten years like there's a part of me that thinks about that and I I so I have a couple ideas like that where I'm like that would be a cool thing to do um but like I I have the weird sensation I'm sure you have this too of like of like very much feeling like I'm play I'm playing with house money and that's both really fun and then it's also a little it's like a little unmooring because you're like [ __ ] I thought I was running with everyone else and then now I'm just like by myself am I going fast enough am I going too fast you know did I tell you Daddy don't want to lose it it's like that's a weird feeling where you're like well I have what I wanted I thought that I'd be willing to like spend this much to invest on my idea and then it's like but I don't want to lose this and that that also exists well you you think that being successful will make you more courageous because you are more secure but it actually the the rational response to having a lot is to become more risk-averse because you know how hard it was to get it and so there's a tension there you know how do you how do you continue to push yourself without being Reckless and how do you uh protect what you've built without being complacent wait but you you just said something that reminded me of the fisherman story you started off with which was you said like I want to write this biography and I hope I'll be at a place where like financially it doesn't matter do you don't feel that you're there already no no I mean I feel like I'm there I just have to get through these two books I've or like I I'm already creatively committed to an idea it's like um like a director it's like hey I've already attached to these two movies then like I once once my plate is clear and I'm not trying to I'm not trying to put it off into the future I don't feel rushed to do it I'm just saying like when when I have a clear play or open road in front of me I think that's probably something I might [ __ ] around with any topics that we didn't cover that you think need to be covered um you know what actually yeah I mentioned it to you and text you were like well can we talk about like how much money your books have been I I I what I said was I go uh how much money have you made how big's your dick and what's your social system yeah no it's it's funny like on my first books uh like obviously books as a market are less interesting to people than like the movie business but like um uh whenever I would sell a book like the your agent or publisher they're like should we announce this deal like there's trades right and sometimes like my first book got a ton of publicity because I was like a kid who came out of nowhere and sold a book for a bunch of money I was always I was like I want a press release like I want to put this out and then probably starting I think it was with Stillness it might have been after definitely with this series I realized that there was no advantage to doing that that um when you start talking about what something is sold for or how like I've two things I thought okay so I saw this four book deal and it was a it was a very large deal at least for me and I had two thoughts I said one telling people how much money I made from it it makes you a Target makes you weird you know it it could it could somehow be seen as selling out or something but then the other part I I thought I don't want people this is an idea that's going to take me four plus years to get to the end of why would I want to give people who might be writing in the same Niche like a heads up about what I'm doing and so I don't think I've announced you know when I did a podcast deal when I've sold other projects like I I see no benefit to putting out specific figures I only see uh downsides to that I don't know would you do a podcast deal with no I I do agree with it at first you know it's like that song um uh if dammit feels good to be a gangsters they they said real gang real gangsters don't flex nuts because they know they got them but I used to feel that way where I'm like yeah like when I I mean I'm still insecure about that when I was even more insecure I would be like yeah I need to I'm gonna rub this into my high school friend's face yeah and then now I'm like I don't want to get sued I don't want to be a Target I don't want people to pretend because we I get all these fake people on Twitter or Instagram pretending to be me or like people like threaten to sue you and when you're not wrong at all like now I'm like uh I don't want any of that nonsense yeah I did I did a podcast deal with uh with Amazon wondering uh like maybe three months ago um how big is the Pod now or do you measure it in podcast downloads or YouTube views uh YouTube is it isn't wasn't included in the deal so it's separate um but uh podcast is is fantastic like I think we we crossed 100 million downloads that's crazy yeah do you should do we're getting close to being able to do that annually like not quite but like that to me that's that's where the numbers are so big we're at um our monthly downloads on the podcast our range between 1.5 and 2 or 1.3 and 2 million and then the Pod the and then the YouTube episode views are another one or two million so we're in the range of two to five on any given month and uh our next Target I'm like how do we get to that five to ten sounds like you're there dude I think YouTube is the I it's weird to say like YouTube's the big thing because it's been around for 15 years and it's already huge but like uh the growth I'm seeing on YouTube stuff especially now even with shorts it's crazy dude people are age and older they're like what YouTube I'm like no dog YouTube's TV Like it Like You Know YouTube is where it's at and it still has so much room you because I only watch YouTube as my TV uh yeah it's the best well dude you're awesome man I um I asked you like who uh you admire and who you want to steal from and I have like a short list of maybe three or five people and you are on that list uh where I just think like we're like you know I'm a family guy like you I don't have kids yet but like I see you raise your family I see you with your wife I see like you know I also bought a a kind of like a farm inspired by you I live in Austin most of the year like there's so many things that you've done where I think this guy's nailing it and I want to steal little bits and pieces of how he's doing and how he's living life and I admire your confidence your drive I mean I'm on I'm on the the Ryan holiday train I've been on it since uh since uh the first book so media media confessions well we gotta we gotta hang out when you're back man you you and I are almost a little bit similar when we have our toes in like the New York world and in the LA world but you know I lived in Tennessee for a long time I live in Texas just like you I like doing I like the bougie [ __ ] and I like the redneck [ __ ] man I like it all's so uh I'll holler at you when I get back and I appreciate you coming on man this is awesome I want to see the farm uh and uh say the book name again oh discipline is Destiny the power of self-control as part of the stoic virtue series the first one is uh courage is calling where do you make the most money where people buy it oh if you buy it from from dailystoke.com or my bookstore the painted porch awesome well I appreciate you man this is awesome thank you good thanks foreign [Music]

that is what all all of them did that's what Napoleon did that's what Hitler did uh that's what Caesar did is this like taking tons of resources and focusing them on a very small Point taking lots of gravity and to kind of narrowing the focus [Music] hey my first million fans this is producer Ben I'm subbing in this week because Sean is out with some family stuff but for one question Friday today Sam and I sat down to discuss how to take over the world some things that I have learned from studying lives of great Achievers and conquers throughout history and Sam and I just got to talking about history and great people in our own lives and what we've learned from them so um it's a little bit of a more random and less focused one question Friday but I think there's some really good stuff in it um that I think you'll really enjoy so I asked you traits of conquerors and the reason I'm thinking about that is I just finished this like Epic book it's like 1400 pages long it's called the uh what is it called the I think it's the rise and fall of the Third Reich have you heard of that yeah so it's kind of one of the seminal texts on Hitler and Nazism yes and it's crazy and I was reading it and I was like this is nuts that the reason I read it was I wanted to figure out why would why would like a country com you know be so complicit with such bad things and I was like what on Earth was about this Hitler dude that like convinced all these people to do all these these bad things and so I learned and it was wild and I started and basically it all kind of came down to like he was in prison one time because he like tried to like basically was a glorified protester like I do he kind of like stormed the it was like storming the capital kind of like type of thing and he was arrested for it and uh in prison he wrote his book called Mein Kampf and in the book he wrote like I've I've recently discovered that it is my obligation to lead the German people to Greatness and he like dedicated his life to that and it was wild that there was like a decision to be made and like it was almost perfect execution I mean you know it wasn't in the end because he uh didn't achieve his whatever he was trying to achieve but like he got so freaking far so past what like what I ever would have thought and at the time when when Nazis came to or right before they came to power they were the the freaks of Germany like at the time they were like they had a lot of homosexuals in their in in the crew which was like not looked on nicely you know at that time they had like a bunch of artists a bunch of like oddballs people who were like had a lot of anti-social Behavior like they dressed funny like people were like who these guys are a joke No One's Gonna Take these idiots seriously and it you know it changed quickly and so anyway I thought that was fascinating about conquerors and like these types of people and like how on Earth they they came to be and so I wanted to ask you like what are some common traits amongst those do you feel weird learning lessons from the life of Hitler no because I I well I'm not necessarily learning a lesson that I want to emulate like but that said I do think you can learn good lessons from bad people like that's you definitely can learn a good lesson from a bad person um that there's no doubt about that like you can look and and like I mean everyone's bad in someone's eyes but like I can read about Napoleon and learn about like war and strategy and apply that to like business so I can I can always learn good lessons from bad people but uh I do I just wanted to learn like why did we do this why did so many people go along with this crap so here's the thing here's a lesson I learned from Sean Mr Beast and Hitler okay there's your head oh my God but so here's the this is this was so fascinating to me so uh we're do this Camp MFM thing and we're at Cameron Indoor Stadium and they decide to do a half court shoot off between Sean and Mr Beast for ten thousand dollars right and it's basically Mr Beast goes Sean if you make a shot at half court I'll give you ten thousand dollars and Sean goes will you give me 10 grand in Bitcoin he goes sure let's do it so yeah I think in the end told him that he'd give him 10 grand actually in pennies uh I don't know if he ended up doing that or not but so um they're going to go start shooting at half court and Sean turns to the camera and does his cheesiest like he's joking around Mr Beast impression and he goes I'm about to shoot from half court with Mr Beast in whichever one of us makes it first is gonna make ten thousand dollars right totally Hamming it up uh kind of poking fun at himself right the funny thing is when we post a video it actually popped off it went viral on Tick Tock his little really yeah yeah that was one of our videos that is uh I think in the millions of years if not it's in the hundreds of thousands of views on uh on reels and on Tick Tock and what it realized in my mind what clicked in my mind when I saw that is oh like it's actually not that hard to figure out what you're supposed to do to be successful in this kind of stuff just very few people are willing to commit to the bit fully right like Mr Beast fully commits it a bit like he actually does that every time he looks at the camera I'm about to give a hundred thousand dollars away to these people if they eat a cockroach or whatever he says right and he fully commits to it and Hitler is the same thing like you go and you watch those speeches and he's ridiculous right he's gesticulating he's yelling he's screaming um but he like fully committed to being Hitler to like representing you know German greatness and and the Aryan race or whatever but like he didn't care he everyone thought he looked ridiculous outside of Germany right like tons of people mocked and made fun of Hitler he was very mockable very easy to make fun of and you can easily make fun of Mr Beast and think he does sorry Mr Beast for comparing you to Hitler but like that idea of just like throw away your shame and embarrassment whatever you're trying to do just fully commit to the bit and you're going to be really successful I think that's very true dude I uh and I want to talk about like other people and what they had in common but like the like I was like emotional reading this thing so basically Joseph Goebbels is is it globals gerbils he was like head of propaganda and this guy like if you Google him he looks like the most evil person on Earth and uh he he's he was a horrible guy and he wrote in a journal throughout this whole process like he was journaling like crazy so this book cited his journal and they tell the story of basically Hitler has just killed himself and Joseph Goebel Goebbels and his wife have I think five or six kids and they write in their diary and tell people they're like well we're gonna go and kill our kids right now then we're gonna kill ourselves because us and our children belong to the fuhrer to the Third Reich and if the Third Reich won't exist we do not deserve to exist either and I like I was like that's just like the worst crime I mean I don't know about the worst because they did so many horrible things but I mean they just went and killed their their children six of them all below 12 years old and I was like this is the power of that Charisma or whatever it was had over people that like they they went committed I mean all they obviously we killed or not we but they killed five or six million people there was it was horrible but like that act is even more intimate in some regards and I remember reading that I'm like holy crap I could not believe that this person this evil guy got all these people to do this crazy it was that was one of the more emotional periods uh of that book yeah that's tough that's tough okay let's talk a little bit like kind of military strategy and good strategy like let's let's pivot from the darkness a little bit um so uh common attributes of great conquerors so one of the things that I think is interesting have you heard of blitzkrieg uh it basically is a it's a German thing where it says like when they attacked they they kind of go all out for short periods right like uh the opposite of what world war one was wasn't it yes so it means lightning attacks or lightning strikes and uh the idea is it's these short quick like uh attacks uh before you know you shock the enemy and and uh go go faster than they expect what's interesting to me is that Blitzkrieg is was sort of a marketing stunt it wasn't anything that the Nazis talked about internally um it's really something of like an American invention uh to explain German success um what the Germans actually talked about uh was this word um oh I can't remember the word in German um but um it essentially means gravity uh looking it up swear punked uh it and it means gravity and so it wasn't just that the attacks were fast although they were but it was actually like massed strikes so they attacked fast yes but they were able to sustain that attack and follow up on it for a long time which is actually the same thing that Napoleon did so in the Napoleonic Wars before he came along people were stretching out their troops further and further to try and flank their enemies and then he's like well if everyone's gonna do that I'm actually just gonna pack all my troops in the middle and then like punch a hole in the middle of their lines um and I think like to go back to the Amazon example like I think that has big applications in business as well of why haven't you heard the phrase Blitz scale there you go that's Reid Hoffman right yeah yeah of uh it's not just going fast although fast is important but it's that like focusing tons of resources on a small focal point so I like to go back to the Amazon example it's starting with bookstores right starting with just books like I'm gonna take tons of resources and just focus on this tiny place and then follow up on that Victory I'm gonna win books first and then I'm going to follow up on that with with other marginal victories yeah yeah and uh so that was interesting to me that like that is what all all of them did that's what Napoleon did that's what Hitler did uh that's what Caesar did is this like taking tons of resources and focusing them on a very small Point taking lots of gravity and kind of narrowing the focus so I that was one interesting takeaway for me what else did they did they have that they did a lot of like conquerors which I don't I don't even know how we would Define a conqueror but there's like the stereotypes of like a Napoleon uh I don't know like what would a a good American uh leader example of this would be but like whoever we describe it as what what else do they have in common or even the business people like uh Edison or something yeah I mean so for me the number one you know you mentioned Edison and the one I think I think of is total Obsession right um with Edison the big thing that clicked for me was he was inventing so much that uh he was basically not eating super skinny super gaunt he wasn't washing his clothes he smelled bad he was barely sleeping he would like invent and Tinker until he fell asleep at his workbench and then he'd like wake up in the morning and like start inventing again his family was worried about him and I was like oh man like substitute inventing for meth or heroin and be very clear that this guy was an addict that he was a junkie and I that's when it clicked for me oh all of these people who are super successful have addictive personalities it just so happens that they're addicted to something that is considered positive was he born that way you think or a lot of people are they born this way I think so and if you look at the numbers people who achieve a lot CEOs uh you'd think that like they don't have problems with substance abuse right because these are highly functioning people but it actually turns out that they have higher rates of addiction and substance abuse than the general population when they study it and so I think they are born with this propensity to addiction and they're the kinds of people that like they could end up you know conquering a vast European Empire or they get hooked on a lot in them when they're like a teenager and end up a junkie on the streets right like they're gonna end up addicted to something let's just hope it's something positive dude have you read uh have you ever heard of this book called The First Rate Madness I think it's called no so this author has this premise where he was like in times of like stability um a non-mental ill mentally ill leader is needed but in times of turmoil which includes like the American Civil War or includes like someone um who's like trying to dominate and Conquer or it includes like MLK you know trying to like uh during the Civil Rights Movement is like a non or sorry a mentally ill leader during those periods is actually ideal and they tend to be better and the author explains like well first let's define mentally ill and it's like uh a propensity to like be addicted to drugs and alcohol or like huge bouts of depression or in Lincoln's case he actually tried to kill himself like two or three times before he became president or uh Churchill Churchill was like uh I've thought about killing myself a ton but I'm just too big of a in order to do it but like I I and so and he became he was an alcoholic uh and so like they basically just talk about how the great great leaders during uh troubled periods majority of them have mental illness yeah and um this is something again to go back to Mr Beast that yeah uh I actually don't know if I I'll just say this and we'll see if I should cut it or not but I was talking with him and he was like yeah I can't really gamble because I'm kind of a gambling addict and uh he talked about like um yeah I don't want to say the name of the game highly addicting uh uh crypto gambling site that he would be wagering like tens of thousands of dollars on yeah man I I well that's no secret though like people who are who get there they are and that's what I realized is that for for him YouTube is another form of gambling right because like you put out the video and who knows how it's gonna do and then you get that dopamine hit of like oh this got 50 million views like it's very similar that variability the way that the algorithm can pick it up make anything go viral um it's just it's just this gambling addiction put into something positive right and so I think that's very much exactly what you're saying that for a lot of these people in normal circumstances they can't just chill and be happy and be normal um they have to be like running at such a high uh level they have to be running at a 10 at all times and that's good I remember circumstances but not in normal circumstances I don't even want to talk about Mr Beast that much because we've like kind of like done that plenty but uh I remember at like 11 p.m at night someone mentioned basketball and how excited he was to play basketball and Jimmy he goes let's just go right now and we were like what dude it's like 11 o'clock no one goes yeah yeah let's figure it out and as he said that his assistants were calling High School gyms trying to wake up like the principals and being like hey I'll give you five grand if we can come play basketball right now and I was like what no dude I don't want to do that it sounds like hell but but he was serious he wanted to go do it yeah yeah it was weird it was crazy who who have you met besides him that you'd put in that category of these like obsessed like almost conqueror types whatever whatever we're calling this this personality type who have you met that kind of has that Gene other than him uh you I think you uh kind of have a screw loose uh in that way like look at the way you approach Fitness um like you have trouble dipping your toes into things yeah that's for sure and you've talked about you're you're you have an addictive personality as well I do but yeah I think I definitely am crazy I think though that I don't have the drive like I I am a little bit more self-aware where I'm like uh no I don't want to do that that sounds too hard uh but yeah I'm definitely crazy uh in that Obsession regard yeah yeah [Music] our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better I'll give you one yeah give me one do you know who Tucker Max is yeah so Tucker Max is this author he's my friend um I haven't talked to him in a while but I used to be buddies with them and he's an author he wrote a I hope they serve beer in hell now he has a company and lately he's taking kind of like a fairly right turn or I don't know what you wanted to call it where he like writes these articles predicting that the world's gonna end and I don't agree with anything that he says about that type of thing I mean I agree that like okay cool prepare and be like self-sufficient but I don't think the world's gonna end and I disagree with so many of his point of views but whenever I hang out with him and I hear him talk in my head I'm like I think you are wrong I think you're wrong I think you're wrong and yet I find myself buying like like fighting myself from buying into what you are saying even though logically I'm like no that's I don't believe that that's true for these following reasons but when I get around them I'm like dude you like are so confident you are such a good Storyteller you have such strong energy driving you into One Direction it's sucking me in and so I would find myself having to like pinch myself to him like like dude you gotta snap out of it and Tucker Max has that hardcore and if you read his writing it even it comes through in his writing you'll read something and you'll say oh this guy's totally right and then I gotta go and like read something that's the opposite like oh well there are counterpoints yeah yeah I so I just thought of one that's a little like uh I guess Off the Wall his name is alanay jokes uh he was uh on Circuit Court of Appeal he was one of the highest judges in the United States was on the short list to be on the Supreme Court for Reagan um but then didn't become a Supreme Court Justice ended up becoming an apostle for the church Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is now the number two person in the church uh is set to take over the church probably in a few years what I found interesting is I think that was the first time I met him when I was like 16 uh that I encountered true Charisma and it felt different than I thought it would feel because when I talked to him he talked to me for like 10 minutes unbelievably Charmed me like I couldn't believe it but the impression I had coming away was wow I'm so smart because he was so good at I don't want to say manipulating but like at playing on my feelings and just being like wow that's really interesting what you know and just kind of like getting me to feel comfortable and divulge information about myself and um like focusing all his attention on me that I came away and I was like man I'm super special and I think that's what truly charismatic people do people think that it's like inward magnetism but it almost goes the opposite direction of like somehow they're able to make you feel like you're the special one and uh and then you like get like drunk on that almost totally I've been uh I used to work for this guy named John Cobbs John Rin this company called apartment list they bought my other business and I don't know how big they are now maybe it's like 100 they've raised maybe one or 200 million dollars in funding and like they're probably gonna go public or I I met that's what they have to do and this guy I was only 22 when I worked there and he would give these talks at the office and I'm like oh my gosh I believe that I am and we weren't even doing anything interesting it was just like a Zillow competitor which was like not exactly the most sexy thing we're not saving the Earth we're not going to the moon like there's nothing like it's just a cool money making scheme and a slightly better way to maybe find an apartment in some cities and I remember like hearing him talk and I'm like I am so we are we are democratizing housing and like we are like I am so on board with this we are making people's lives so much better and like it we owe it to the world to do this and he has just shown me that it is possible and you begin to think that rules don't apply to you and you say it's US versus everyone which is a common tactic and occult and you should always do this in a good company which is you have you and then you have the enemy and everyone's out to to on the enemy side and it's US versus them and you have to create that Dynamic and also I felt with him whenever he would give these talks on a Friday we used to have this thing where Friday at four he would give a talk and I remember thinking like rules don't apply to us like what yeah and I and I've heard stories about Travis kalanick at Uber and I remember the people it was like the same thing they were like breaking laws and they're like they're it wasn't these laws we shouldn't be breaking them it was these laws shouldn't exist and they are wrong and we need to prove to them that they are wrong you know what I mean and I remember hearing that and you just get intoxicated with it yeah you know who's uh who's pretty good at this uh I found uh from Camp MFM is suely uh your friends you think so yeah just like when I was talking to him I think he kind of brain raped me a little bit like why at the end I don't know I just at the end he just was like so interested in me and then I was just like did I just tell suly like everything about my life and like everything yeah and like and he won't tell you a thing about his no yeah I was like how is it that like you're the multi-millionaire like you have the successful business that you saw like you've done all this impressive stuff and like we just spent 20 minutes talking about me and like you know everything about me and I don't know anything about you at the end of this how did this happen he's so good at it I don't know yeah he's good at it so is Ben Levy Sean's partner Sean he's really good at that man Ben I always call Ben a shark uh but he's not actually a shark because he doesn't mean he's not gonna like harm you probably well maybe I don't know I don't think so but he uh like he's so good where I'll have to stop myself I'm like dude shut the up I don't you don't need to tell this guy all this like it's good to be privates about some stuff and he's so good at getting stuff out of getting stuff out of you um he's really good at that yeah so yeah those people they they are good at that they um another guy is um who I found myself getting like intoxicated with there's a couple people uh uh Sam bankman freed you know the guy from uh uh what's his what what the the you know Bitcoin what's his company called um FTX something has another one I think uh anyway FTX when I hear him talk I just think like oh you're right about everything like I don't wanna I like I can't have and it's hard for me to understand anything than other than what you believe because you've just logically shown to me that this is all true even though I'm like you have to remind I have to remind myself like this guy's just a 29 year old smart guy which is cool and all but like he's just a guy he's just a dude he's still figuring out just like I am but I will hear him talk and I'm I buy into everything he's saying and another good person is Malcolm Gladwell if you ever read a Malcolm Gladwell Book You'll Think oh everything you're saying is facts in reality a lot of it's just theories and he'll say this is just my this is just a theory based off of the data who knows if I'm right or wrong this is just an idea but I'll read his stuff and I think oh this is this is just how the world is and my takeaway from that is storytelling is so important it's so important I I think that Malcolm Gladwell is full of crap most of his stuff is like of little to no value anyone who asked me how to do storytelling I'm like just go listen to Malcolm gladwell's podcast and analyze every single sentence like it doesn't matter what you think of what he has to say I think he's this generation's most gifted Storyteller and it's like not close dude he's so good he's so good he's unbelievable he's unbelievable he gets you intoxicated is what he does you feel like this intoxication and you feel like of course this is the answer what you're saying is true and I have to purposely go and seek out like other opinions to be like oh well you know I gotta remind myself this isn't necessarily true it might be but maybe not Ogilvy has this good quote uh David ogleby like uh very famous copywriter and Advertiser uh that the job of the first sentence is to get you to read the second sentence and the job second sentence is to get you to read the third sentence and if you read Gladwell with that lens uh that framework in mind he's such a master like the first sentence of every podcast is independently extremely engaging and interesting and it gets you to listen to the second sentence which is itself extremely engaged and like every single sentence is a masterpiece that gets you to go into the next sentence um everyone should read it um everyone should read and Listen to As Much Gladwell as as they can what's the name of his pod I forget it's called something history um revisionist history yeah it's good man and he does he does a really good job of uh voice inflections it doesn't sound like it my voice is fairly aggressive his voice is like soft and welcoming and like warming and so his inflections aren't like when Sean and I talk and then we like get down low and then we and we come right back up it's way more subtle yeah but and everything he says is like a kind of a whisper but he's but but he like knows how to use empty space and silence and then he knows how to come back in and lead you down and get you to come a little bit more and then he'll break it to you you know what I mean like he does his things and I like I'm tripping it's called a slippery slope that's what I call it the same in the slippery slope is my name for uh that copywriting concept of the first sentence to get you to read the seconds which is get you read the third that's the slippery slope I want to pull you down that slope because the further I pull you along the more more button you get and if you read like a Tony Robbins book he'll say like I'm about to tell you about one thing that's going to change your life and he'll spend the rest of that chapter saying we're we're about to get to it we're getting to it soon but before we do I need to tell you why it's important and then like there's a reveal at the end and oftentimes that reveals a little bit anticlimactic but you're so deep down this slippery slope that you just you're you're bought in and so that's what Malcolm Gladwell does wonderfully he gets me to go down this slope and he pulls me down and a lot of the great um dictators and CEOs and these like leaders both good and bad they were awesome at uh being Auditors which is something we don't really talk about anymore but like Obama was like that where I was like I heard Obama talk and I'm like dude whatever you say yes I like that it's seductive almost like it's seductive it's seductive which the root of all this is learning how to write well and how to storytell and then if possible how to speak how to speak it can can I talk about one more attribute that actually you and Sean have done a good job with recently on getting me on me about is um this idea of like bias to action so for me my favorite story about this is Napoleon comes into command of oh the French army in Italy and it's just been sitting there for months and the the reason is they have they don't have enough guns they don't have enough ammunition they don't have enough shoes they don't have enough clothes um they're like horribly undersupplied the morale is low and so the general before Napoleon is like we cannot they're fighting the austrians we cannot go give battle to the austrians like this we're in a horrible State and uh Napoleon comes in and he's like okay so today I'm going to take account of everything that's happening in this Army you're going to give me an accounting of exactly how many shoes we have the status of everything and tomorrow we're gonna march to go fight the austrians and they're like this is a horrible idea like you should not do this this Army's in no shape to fight and he's basically like yeah Isaac Newton an object at rest stays at rest an object in motion stays in motion and so like I don't care we're going to go attack and so they go out they attack they score cheap easy Victory and then they're just rolling right and then they roll through Italy and kick the crap out of the austrians in like a matter of weeks and so I you know I've been talking to you and Sean about doing better with how to take over the world and and getting bigger and I'm just like ah man I have all these problems I like I need more researchers I need more writers because I have to do all this research and both of you were just kind of like like no you don't just put stuff out like just put out more episodes what's wrong with you just put out more episodes and uh and so that's something I've been focusing on is like it's so easy to focus on all the inputs on like getting everything ready on planning on preparing and this biased action of like no no no no every single day you need to be taking steps that have measurable outcomes uh that Advance your goals forward you need to be doing and you need to have a bias towards doing those things rather than planning and preparing dude and a good example of that is like only six months ago or something so we were fairly popular Sean for some reason because he's always a little disorganized his microphone wasn't working and he's like it I'm just gonna use my airpods I'm like all right fine and he puts his airpods in and only one of them worked and the other one didn't even work it was for some reason it was out of battery he goes we're just like screw it we're going to record this shot with just your webcam at your one airpods dude that airpod is gonna be your microphone and your like how you could hear me talk he's like yeah let's do it versus waiting 20 minutes for it to get charged we're like no we can't wait we have to do it right now we have to go and uh I think that that is the way to go I think that the world wants you to be vanilla the world wants to make everyone vanilla and they want you to be safe and that means planning planning and so so many people write on their goals for the day I bet you there's a lot of people listening they have one task today which says plan workout or plan you know like business like what how I'm going to launch this like plan something it's like that's there to do and that's really just kind of a self-masturbation uh like it's a uh uh it's a way to make you think that you actually are doing something when instead you should just start and figure it out along the way because virtually everything not everything but almost everything related to a project is reversible you should always start and so you should always just like just make it happen and always have a bias to action because it also is intoxicating right right dude have you ever sold anything on the internet um no so like people talk to me about like how do I do this how do I do that I'm like dude just whatever you do build it so you can get it live tomorrow and so then you can get just one dollar in Revenue in the first five days because the second your phone goes because like I have this thing on Shopify that goes kaching every sale I get the SEC the first time you hear that you're like oh I need to feel that again let's go let's go let's go let's go like it gets you amped up when you hear that and so that's why whenever people talk to me they're like which platform should I use for my new blog I'm like it doesn't matter just go to subsec right now and make your blog post live tomorrow and then the second you see traffic on the analytics you're like oh I like that that tastes good I like how that feels I gotta do it again I need more I need to get another bite and that's why whenever people talk about anything they want to do I'm like if you're a noob launch right away immediately immediately if you're like I have this guy named Brett adecock who sold a company for two or three billion dollars and as the next company it's like a robot business and he's investing 200 million dollars in like five years of research I'm like all right that's cool you're a proven hit maker like take your time and like perfect this thing but if you're like a rookie you gotta Jump Right In and get that taste of dopamine immediately otherwise it will never happen or it just Fades and you just aren't interested anymore so it's interesting what you're saying reminds me a little bit of uh like the difference between the Greeks and the Romans so the Greeks like masters of the Mediterranean the old Greeks and Roman okay okay hear me out though because here's the thing the Greeks were like much better academics than the Romans they knew geometry they knew algebra they knew like philosophy right in the Romans were basically dumb jocks okay they didn't know any of this stuff and it turns out that Roman construction and bridges were actually much better than Greek ones why is it because the Greeks would sit down and try and figure out the geometry of the best way to build a bridge the Romans did not the Romans just went out and built a bridge and then it kind of crumbled and then they're like oh what if we did this and then they rebuilt it and then that didn't work out so well and then over the generations they just went out and did stuff until eventually they had like the perfect way to build a bridge that would stand forever did they ever know the math behind it they literally never did they just went and tried stuff until they found the thing that worked best and that was what let them take over the world and so that just like backs up what you're saying of like you actually don't need to know why this stuff is working you don't need to know the math behind it you don't need to do the research you just literally need to try stuff until you find out what works well John what I was gonna say I think you know two things I just heard was one uh and this is all kind of wrapping this back up to how this applies to like podcasting um I Heard bias towards action which is just like go go and I also heard like be very methodical with how you tell stories like Malcolm Gladwell ask so like let's just say you're starting a podcast today zero to twenty five thousand downloads buy swords action 25 to 100 000 let's just say you're really dialing in the storytelling component of it and then but it sounds like you're flipping back to okay just bias towards action go go so like I don't know I think it could be helpful to go from like at this stage you want to focus on just making happen versus being more methodical with how actually level the podcast up that kind of stuff can I use an example like Danny Miranda you were on his podcast a few days ago uh Sam and I don't think he's figured out his Niche very well um he needs to work on that he he hasn't figured out yet but guess what he's in a really good position to figure it out because he just got started he's been doing great interviews he's super action oriented and he's going to figure out the data and he's got the data right and now he can pivot and he can try different stuff he can think about different ways to position it versus the person who is just like no no Danny's not doing it the right way I need to position my podcast perfectly no just start with action you can figure out your Niche and exactly how to position your podcast later dude it's because it's way better to execute a bad plan than it is to execute no plan and because you can change it you can change a bad plate into a good plan in most cases as you go but you can't you know you're up creek if you're doing nothing all day yep [Music]

[Music] foreign we're going to talk about one thing that I think everyone will find interesting it's like inside baseball it's like behind the scenes of the Pod what our current numbers are the revenue we're making from it and like how we grew it and things like that and also yours as well because you're earlier in your journey so that'd be interesting to people we'll start with Jonathan on here too who Jonathan's our numbers was he knows all about growth and how we grew it I'll do I'll kind of say what the high level numbers are for my first million and you could do the same for your pod so I just looked in megaphone that's the software we use so this every number I'm gonna say is the trailing 30-day numbers so trailing 30 days for my first million when we say the word downloads We mean YouTube and also like podcast downloads which is basically apple and Spotify and then a much smaller percentage is like Stitcher and all the other podcast stuff and so for that for the podcast downloads we did one point uh Roundup 1.3 so 1.255 it looks like million downloads on like the podcasting platforms then our YouTube page right now has a 110 or maybe 112 000 subscribers and then the trailing 30 days we did 2.7 million views of which a lot are YouTube shorts so maybe in maybe 1 million to 1.5 million is actual episode episode views which is like any video that's more than like six or eight minutes long something like that previously not this past trailing days but the one before that I think we are at 3.6 million so we're down a little bit but because we had a few shorts go viral so 1.3 plus 2.7 that's 4 million so that's about how many people saw our stuff and then there's like all the social stuff so my personal socials have been viewed I just looked this up over the trailing 30 days on Tick Tock I think I have two or three million views and then on Instagram I have like another two or three million views so that's like the total reach right now what are you at for how to take over the world so right now monthlies are at about 70 000 uh sorry 80 000 downloads um and then my per episodes you know stuff that's mature so like a good example Walt Disney has been out uh since January it's been out for a while and that's hovering around that one's got 39 Alexander the Great has 43 so around 40 000 my biggest episode is uh now almost uh it's 54. um so like kind of 50 000-ish uh per episode and my number is like obviously the totals are way different and weird because my volume is so much lower um what's our volume what's my first Millions volume well as you mentioned so we're going three times per week um and then we've got the shorts on YouTube and then we've got the clips on YouTube which drives a lot of the volume as you were mentioning uh my first Millions downloads per episode that's the number that matters most it ranges from like 50 000 to 150 000 right that's right depending on if you include YouTube uh because if you include YouTube we have some that Pop um up to the like half million um maybe a little less um but like the darn mesh episode did really well the Peter levels episode did really well and those have hundreds of thousands of views just on YouTube alone so what are you doing to grow for me the big thing is just fixing my production process which is totally broken for how to take over the world it's it's really just a volume uh game at this point for me are you making money from it I'm making a little bit of money I'm at least I am making money um I used to I was negative for a long time and then I was neutral for a couple months now I'm positive how much do you charge for an ad about a thousand bucks per per placement so everyone asked my first million I get messages all the time saying hey can we advertise on the Pod so my first million I said we're going to talk about how much revenue it makes it makes zero Revenue because HubSpot when they so the way the our process worked with my first million was uh the hustle owned my first million so Sean actually came up with the idea and he goes hey can I do uh I want to create a podcast you guys want to be my publisher and I said yeah but we're going to own it and he said that's fine um and so we did a revenue split I don't remember what we did but I think we did 50 50. so let's say the hustle sold uh ten thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars worth of ads the hustle uh gave him 5 000 and we kept five thousand and then we also paid for it which I don't know if that's actually a good deal for him or us I don't know but when we sold the company HubSpot bought the hustle and they bought the podcast with it and now HubSpot is the only Advertiser on the Pod but we don't make any money from it so directly although they can calculate how much money they would make off of it if they had to go and buy those ads elsewhere but I think so I went and talked to a friend my friend has a podcast in the health and wellness space and I asked him how much revenue do you guys do and so they get seven million downloads a month and they are currently doing three million in ads 5 million selling like uh programs like fitness programs and then like another half a million in like merch and affiliate deals and so collectively they're doing around 10 million in Revenue with about 65 profit margin so it's quite good and so I think that rpod just off ads would maybe be in the 6 million range so it would be around 75 to 125 dollars per 1000 downloads and that would be separated in like a bunch of different thirty dollar per thousand downloads ad so we could probably charge 25 to 40 dollars per ad and then you have like two or three ads in the in each podcast and that's how you get to like that five or six million range then another like three or four million just off some like courses or paid Community yeah and that's not uh taking into account costs because if we're selling our own ads we'd probably have to get an ad guy to actually sell it and he'd take a cut correct uh and stuff like that yeah so what's our cost now for for MFM Jonathan do you know for production side you know between we got Ben you know producer we've got uh Ezra who does the video and audio cutting uh video and audio editing we have the short form Clips folks we have our YouTube producer so between that whole team it's like 25k and then a month yes and then if you include you know other ways to grow the show whether it's buying ads on other podcasts other platforms um it could be anywhere between like 25k a month to upwards of like 50 to 100. just so like our costs right now not including me and Sean it's like uh 500 000 a year roughly yeah I mean and you can scale it up and down it's just like we're being aggressive with our growth goals so we're putting a lot of investment into that and our growth is basically you buy ads on other people's podcasts and that works decent it seems but actually hard to track but that's decent and the other thing you tried like buying ads on YouTube channels and things like that right do any of them actually work you think we Ransom ads on YouTube and it definitely drives like a lot of views and some subs but it's not necessarily sustainable and you always kind of question the quality of those subs um yeah I don't know we've kind of tested everything in like the thing that we're most bullish on is obviously the short form Clips it's also not easy to tell how well those are kind of performing in terms of viewers and listeners to like the RSS feed but um you know that's just like a long-term play and as you're seeing like your growth on Instagram and Tick Tock is um largely driven by these clips from the show and so it's just like you're not gonna maybe that viewer isn't gonna convert the first time they see it the second time they see it but hopefully by the 50th time they see your face they're like [ __ ] I just need to check out what he's up to and check out the podcast Ben are you doing anything to grow no basically just working on more production that's basically it but like my organic growth has been huge like honestly as long as I produce more episodes like it's gonna keep growing I've done a little strategic uh like who I choose in order to grow a little bit like what I cover and I think probably with podcasting that's the biggest driver of growth and you are basically at how many so the way that we found Ben was I was just I was actually taking a flight at like 5 a.m and I was like exhausted and I was like I need some inspiration and I think I looked up like Napoleon or something like that and I saw your pod and at the time roughly how many downloads did you have at that point monthly downloads would have been in the like hundreds to maybe low four digits and I was getting like a couple thousand uh per episode and then we mentioned you on the Pod and is that like the thing that was like the big up like we we did this like pretty big thing about you or I was like Sean this is like the greatest intro song and pot I've ever heard of and how much did that boost so I've gone from 2K to like 40K and I would say that it's been like half and half so half of it was like a big upswing like I immediately went up to like 10 to 20 and then since then it's been steady growth from 20 up to 40. dude that's the thing about pods everyone talks to me they're like I wanna I wanna do this and I go just so you know it's very very very hard to grow so at the hustle we had maybe one point between one and 1.5 million subscribers when we launched this pod and so Sean was like Hey I want to do this thing I said all right great he goes in fact I already have like a pilot episode he sent it to me I was like oh dude this is like great as is I'll give you three weeks or four weeks to like get like ahead of the game and then we'll we're launch we'll launch one a week and basically that first week we launched I think that first episode got 50 or 60 000 downloads the next episode got like 30 or 40 and then it just like ticked down until it was like five to fifteen thousand downloads per episode because we blasted it to the hustle got traction and this is how all pods and maybe maybe like all not all but many products work your launch is like epic then you go down and then you just over a period of a couple years work slowly work your way up and then one day someone didn't appear to one of his uh to one of his uh like one of his guests didn't show up and he was like Hey you know how we do that thing so me and Sean used to meet like every two weeks and we were just like brainstorm in front of a bunch of people and be like you know the thing that we do uh can you show up in like an hour and just come do it with me the person didn't show up and I was like I guess and the results were like decent enough that we're like all right I guess we'll just make this the thing and we'll just keep trying and from there it slowly went up and when we got acquired we had acquired in February of like 18 months ago I think we are doing 600 000 downloads per month and then it like went up from there a lot and I don't actually don't know why it went up I don't know what happened that's interesting uh so like the idea for what my first million became was basically an accident is that right yeah so it was like first of all I didn't want to do a pod forever I thought it was a total waste of time I was like we have to focus and he was like I have this thing and basically Sean at the time was not a Content person he is now and he's great but at the time he was just like uh my friend who just like was you know he wasn't on I don't even think he was on Twitter he's a startup guy he's more of an operator he would yeah yeah yeah he was just he was just my buddy who had a company in the gaming space and obviously he was always charismatic and he was pretty good at storytelling although I would say that's even improved a significant amount but he was like I just interviewed my our buddy Sully here just here's the pilot and I heard it I was like oh dude this is this is baller this is awesome it wasn't actually that different than anything else it was called my first million because he was going to talk about how people got their million users or revenue or profit whatever and it was all about the early days but which frankly isn't that unique but he was pretty good at it and then like six months in or three months in someone didn't show up and he was like hey come do this and me and Sean loved this podcast called The Fighter and the kid and it was Brian Callan and Brennan chop two guys sitting on chairs just like goofing around and we're like oh that I think we could do that and so uh we just kept doing it like that's interesting to me because a little bit when I started my podcast it was the same thing of just that it was kind of an accident I was sitting there I had been reading this Napoleon biography and I thought I want to remember this like I want to retain more of this information I should create something I should make like a blog post uh or uh a a tweet storm or something and then I had all this audio equipment lying around I thought I'll just do a podcast about it um and I bet people would like to hear what I learned from reading this biography of Napoleon and I think a lot of really good podcasts start that way of is not someone sitting down and like gaming the system of like all right where's a niche that I want to make a podcast where's a niche but people who are just kind of doing stuff and uh and then it turns into a podcast and become successful do you think that's right maybe I think you could like I think there are worlds like I heart media does this nicely I think parcast which is a podcasting company does this nicely gimlet media does this nicely who else does this um there's a wondery does a decent job some are still better than others but basically where they come up with ideas and then they launch them almost like a movie where it's like planned and hopefully successful and then other times it's organic I think the the problem with podcasts there's a bunch of upside I'll talk about the upside in a second but here's the problem the problem with podcasts is the same problem that I have with copywriting and hiring writers which is everyone can talk and everyone a lot of people like talking with their friends therefore the noise to Signal ratio of people who want to do it versus who are good at doing it is like really really hard to determine who's like great and so you have a ton of people launching podcasts that are a they're not committed to like the long term like they're not committed to making this and treating it like a job or you you know me and Sean we were we record every single Monday and Wednesday and less of an emergency um so they're not committed to that b they're not actually good at they don't actually have the skill or the talent and they think they do because they talk with with their friends a lot and so there's like a lot of crap out there and see it's not really like well thought out where it's like you know Sean and I joke we're like you need some attributes man like you either have to have this like crazy like interesting Niche or and I would say this is definitely in Sean's case slightly in my case you just have to be really charismatic and good at storytelling or you have to have like some crazy experience so like you're just an expert in X Y and Z or like you know you're in the NBA for 20 years so you can talk about like what it was like being in the NBA like you have to have something that's intriguing and a weird angle or you have to be super talented like a Malcolm Gladwell or something like that do you know what I mean yeah so what you've touched on something that there's this guy Eric Newsom who's his background is in public radio and then he was kind of one of the ogs of podcasting and he's got this framework that I love for creating a hit podcast so he calls it a diamond but there's really four attributes on which you can be unique and you need to be unique on at least well really two of them in order to be a successful hit podcast so the four ways you can be unique are what the podcast is about who hosts it who it's for or the way you tell the story okay so it's who so it's how it's told what it's about who it's for or who it's by okay so basically like the concept or the person exactly and most people only do one and that's where they fail they're like oh I'm gonna make a podcast about gorillas because there are no podcasts about gorillas and it's like well are you Jane Goodall like are you an expert you need that second thing um to make it successful and you maybe you don't have to be the expert but if you're not the expert then it's like uh then you have to differentiate in terms of how you tell the story you have to give a really high production value or uh you know you mean to like have gorillas on the podcast or something like that like you but most people are just think of one new idea and stop there whereas I think my first million is successful because a what it's about is unique in that it's kind of an entrepreneurship podcast that covers everything from like little side hustles all the way to like big you know Tech ideas that could be you know hundreds of billions of dollars so it's Unique on what it's about it covers everything and then the the who you and Sean have the experience and are really funny and super engaging and it's like it's like the all-in Pod like people talk about that and I'm like you know I think that they're like pretty okay hosts themselves I think Jason's pretty great but like you're gonna listen to anything that they say because they are so successful their world view is so much grander than mine and you know they're hanging out with like ex-presidents CEOs of you know Fortune 500 companies like they've built billion dollar companies like they have access to things that I don't therefore they don't even need to be and I'm not saying they're not charismatic but I'm saying they don't even need to be that charismatic in order for it to be awesome right exactly they have that second angle the second angle doesn't have to be that you're a great Entertainer but you could have very unique insights like those guys do but you got to have something for that second angle this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated whoa I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better but let's talk about the upside so the the upsides to a pod is I have never exp I don't I'm not popular I mean I'm somewhat popular on social media but I'm not like that popular on the video or picture based social medias and so I've not experienced what it's like to have fandom there but for our pod the benefits of having a podcast and I noticed this to myself I'll listen to other people is I truly become like fans of these people because I get to know them so well and that is like a huge benefit and so like I'll mention like sometimes people will come up to me and they'll say yeah like I'm I eat this food because you talk about her I read this book and I'm like I don't even remember mentioning that like I just said I talk so much that like I don't even remember all of it but people like listen so much that they get to know you and it's like creates true fandom I think you probably could get that at other uh platforms but I think it's more so this because if they're 30 to 60 Minutes long they really get to know you and also the the hard part though is you know the best way to circumvent someone's [ __ ] detector is just not bullshitting and that's the hard part about that's the hard part about about podcasting is when you talk for 45 minutes or an hour and a half five or three days a week or whatever it is you you ha you can't lie a lot you can't lie at all because it's gonna catch up to you you have to be authentic you have to or if you're gonna play a character you gotta play that all the time I mean like you really have to be authentic the the greatest thing and the worst thing about podcasting is such an intimate medium like you're in someone's ears they're doing when they're doing the dishes when they're commuting um they feel like they're friends with you I think more so than YouTube Instagram like any other media format TV whatever people really feel like they have this relationship with you which is a little weird and like as you alluded to I think the most difficult thing about podcasting is that it's really difficult it's like hand-to-hand combat to build a big audience but the best thing about it the best thing about podcasting is that you can build uh a really valuable following with very few followers if you have 35 000 followers on YouTube you just can't do much like you're nothing and I talked with someone the other day who has 35 000 downloads per episode on his podcast and is making a half a million dollars a year from it and uh genre or category productivity yeah all right so 35 000 downloads an episode and he's doing half a million in ad Revenue yeah and then she could be doing way more off like courses or whatever else she wants to sell he could be doing three or four times as much as that yeah and he's talking about doing that stuff he's not doing it yet so like I don't even feel like that's the limit of what you could do with that many followers so um I do think that's the beauty of podcasting is if you can like grind it out to get a decent following of a few tens of thousands you can make like real money in podcasting yeah and the best way I think you do it is if you already have a business so for example I didn't know this but you know that guy Patrick David Betts I think his name is he's got that YouTube channel called valuetainment so I just thought that he was like a personality and he recently had a life insurance I think it is the company that he sold for like 300 million dollars and I didn't even know about that and that's way more valuable than I mean his YouTube channel is very valuable but not two or three hundred million dollar valuable same with Dave Ramsey Dave Ramsey I was researching him his company's worth something like seven or eight hundred million bucks and it's a collection of real estate and selling like personal finance stuff and the radio show is definitely awesome but it's not it it alone ain't worth that it's not the monetization engine and so if you already have that monetization and engine and you build a podcast I think it's lights out man I think you can crush it I uh and what's interesting is our pods not even big so let's just say we're between one and three million downloads depending on uh a combination of YouTube or not YouTube I uh and it's it's not YouTube first so like we we our faces aren't out there if I'm walking around a top 10 City so like a New York down to like a Denver I will get recognized maybe once a day and that is a very small audience that is not if there's 350 million people in America and we only reach one or three million of them a month and I get recognized probably five times a week um or like yesterday I went to Lululemon and I had to give her my email and my email is my name and I told her my name and she looked up and she goes away from my first million are you staying for my I was like yeah what's going on but she goes I thought I recognized your voice and uh like that happens all the time and that's one of my biggest surprises is that we get recognized on such a small audience and the people are like pumped they're excited which I would be too if I you know like Brennan's shop is someone I really admire and you probably have no idea who that is and he's not like famous A-list famous if I saw him I would be like dude can I get a picture you know what I mean it is so that's the interesting thing about podcasts do you get like Instagram models that slide into your DMs so that's funny uh I surveyed my Twitter audience and I said what gender are you and it was 93 dudes and if you go to our meetups we had a meet up in New York um we had uh 1500 people RSVP I don't know how many people actually showed up but let's just say 800 or 500 people showed up I'm pretty sure it was 90 men as well so my stuff is mostly all men and also on all of my social media profiles there's a picture of me and my wife is as either the main picture or the cover picture so most everyone I always talk about her so most everyone knows that I'm married um so do I get like women dming me in the in the sexual sense no but that's not really like it's happened like maybe at most once a month but like you have to remember that a this is like a tech and business podcast and B I'm like a Midwestern seven so like you know dude I'm a Missouri seven and like a New York six do you realize that like 99 of our audience if they had Instagram models sliding into their DMS once a month would not be like it's not that much they'd be like I got Instagram models standing in my DMs once a month maybe I'm rich I'm famous well I get and I get I now how many fake high uh profiles do I get sliding into my DMs once yeah or five times a day so yeah so I don't know how many of these women are actually real but I would say maybe one time a month there's someone who like I'll even I'll be sitting next to Sarah my wife and I'll be like hey this is crazy check this out and like we'll laugh about it uh and I'm like you know I ain't touching that but just so you know like this exists I was talking to someone who was more conventionally famous than either one of us and uh and they were talking about how they get like real like verified models uh sliding into their DMS all the time this person has a girlfriend and uh and is in a long distance relationship it's very hard for them they're just like all the time these people are slapping that's crazy no I I get like uh I get like the hand models I don't get the face models or the body models no I I don't exactly get that but what happens a lot is if when it's warm outside I always work out outside and I'm always shirtless uh there seems to be a like just an unlucky pattern of I get recognized shirtless a fair bit and I always put my shirt on right when I'm because like me and Sarah have been on walks where I've been shirtless and like a guy will come up with like with his like four-year-old daughter and say like what's up and I'm like oh dude I'm totally making this little girl uncomfortable being this shirtless dude right here so like that's our joke is like I try if I'm ever gonna be shirtless I'll wear like glasses or something because I don't want to be like that one time that I see someone that is like uncomfortable for them uh but that happens all the time it happened yesterday yeah you're so you're saying your body's more famous than your faces no I'm saying it's coincidence that I usually when I'm outside during the day I'm shirtless and again maybe it's not a coincidence maybe they're just like and maybe they don't recognize your face but they're like that those are sampar's packs apps I would and and like I've got like uh I've got like a New York 7.5 bod so like it's not always embarrassing but the other so the other day we released an episode that was uh about like Fitness and so people loved it people loved it yeah people loved it it was a great episode but Sam dm'd me and was like hey can we change my after pick I don't think I look ripped enough and started sending me like five to ten shirtless picks it's like dude if I'm gonna be here why does my body look best if I'm gonna be shirtless on the internet like I I would prefer like the best I hate being the best like so like that yeah but uh so anyway that's the update on the Pod do we want to talk any more about that just like one other thing I just like a couple Frameworks I think are interesting so I've been thinking this for a little bit it's interesting we do interviews and it's always surprising which episodes actually pop off like we'll get someone really really famous and their episode will do okay and then we'll get Peter levels or we'll get darmesh and the episode will go crazy we'll do super well dude because we need more unique weird people sometimes we're Cloud Chasers you need unique people and it's like when you get unique people that have a super engaged audience that want to hear from them but don't get to hear from them often then it totally blows up so I've been thinking about that recently um with my pod in terms of what I do so I could go the route of like uh doing more episodes like Julius Caesar like I could do a Charlemagne or Winston Churchill or Muhammad Ali yeah bottom line is there's actually a lot of Muhammad Ali content out there uh and you could probably finds stuff that's as good as my podcast or nearly as good as my podcast out there um and so I've pivoted to doing stuff that's a little more Niche and so I just did an episode on Brigham Young who most people don't care about but some people care about very very passionately and so it's actually on track to be my most downloaded episode and so I'm trying to like adopt that Peter levels up Peter levels darmesh like unique episode uh kind of framework of now I'm starting to think like okay Brigham Young huge in the Mormon Community like people want to hear about that that's going to down that's going to drive downloads and then those people are into my audience who else can I do like who is the greatest emperor of of Cambodia you know like cambodians probably don't get a lot of podcasts made about their Heroes right so like can I do that can I drive something for that audience and then those people become super okay have you ever looked up have you ever watched Bruno Mars YouTube videos no are they good no so that's my point so a lot like Bruno Mars is one of those guys who like everyone knows about but not that many people seek him out even though he's pretty amazing and I love his music videos and I was watching some of them and they have like one two three even four I believe billion views Bruno Mars has four billion views and you and I was wondering why and I looked it up on Wikipedia and then I looked at on the YouTube comments to see if it was like if I felt like it aligned but basically Bruno Mars uh his mother is Filipino so he's part Filipino and the Philippine I mean how many people live in the Philippines like you know a ton I think like hundreds of millions it's not exactly like a small little country but in terms of the amount of people who exist in that country compared to their cultural relevance on a global scale you know they're not they're not exactly represented a ton and so when this American Filipino guy it's kind of like Jeremy Lin in the NBA you know there there's a lot of Chinese but there weren't a lot of Chinese basketball players and so when Bruno Mars like got famous like the Filipinos were like yes one of us they're killing it and so they just like get behind that person same with Bjork from Iceland Iceland like not exactly incredibly relevant on you know they don't exactly invent a lot of things including entertainment that like it's recognized on a grand scale and when Bjork like gets a little bit of uh love from America or Europe they all pounce on that [ __ ] and they go hell yeah it's one of us it's like it's like Nelly in St Louis in St Louis where I'm from like you know my 65 year old white dad is like Nellie's the man sir Nelly like people everyone in St Louis is like Nellie's just our God he's our mayor we will do anything for Nelly because he represented us and we didn't have a lot of representation St Louis so anyway I think it's the same way with different topics where if you find that one or two things that it it's okay if it's not that many people but they're like passionate about it and they can rally behind it and they're like finally something for us that just makes it so much so much easier to get popular it's a little bit of the Amazon strategy right like so Amazon is the store for everything online right but it didn't start out that way it was a bookstore and then it was a DVD store and then it was a dog toy store and it's like actually just a collection of niches that all got bundled and that I think that works for Content as well you can just go out and collect niches and then it becomes like a big broad audience even though you don't start that way yeah and so right at this point we're a little bit more broad we're still not that broad but we're more Broad and like we make Dumber jokes and we talk about Kim Kardashian every once in a while now and uh but before it was just like this dude's making five grand a month on the internet you know what I'm saying um all right is that the pod that's a pod [Music] foreign [Music]

I saw that Roger Federer was one of he's part of the uh the Billy athlete Club so there's like Federer is five athletes who have made a billion dollars Tiger Woods Floyd Mayweather LeBron James Ronaldo and I think Michael Jordan may be messy so that might be six I think it's five um and now Federer is in that club [Music] the whole Adam Levine thing's ridiculous it's just like is that in like the Santa's fake section of the newspaper as well it's just like the most obvious like people are like acting like it's like a big deal it's like dude what do you expect look at the guy of course he cheats I don't even know the story why did he cheat oh no because why like what's the controversy like did he do something really crazy I I only read the headlines I think he just texted like texted her Instagram like his yoga trainer and said I want to roll around naked with you all day and then he texted this other lady that says like um you know like he like said like hey like I want to go out with you like why are you so hot or something like that and then later on weeks later he texts and says hey my wife's pregnant and we're gonna name the baby your name is that cool with you which is super freaking weird but uh I don't know if he did anything wrong like legally but he's just you know just doing what like guys with like body tatts who live in L.A do you know you just cheat laughs like you could he's got the face of a cheater right I mean this is obvious at the bottom of your tattoo sleeve is just a place to put your number I wouldn't have got this sleeve as a married man if I wasn't trying to you know play the game dude speaking of bros I think I've just invented something I've been doing this for the past few weeks I call it uh like Fitness dip so you know how like you know people dip like tobacco they put like uh stuff in their lip lately uh yeah you know like chewing tobacco you put it in your lips I've heard of it but you're the only guy I know who does it yeah just like a fat lip lately what I've been doing is just put in have you seen PB fit it's like powdered peanut butter yeah that stuff's great I love it dude I just get a like a tablespoon of it and I just stick it on the roof of my mouth and I'll just suck on it for like an hour and I just it's my fitness dip and it just keeps me like from like pacifier for you yeah it keeps you it's like chewing gum almost like you know you can't eat anything because you got that in the roof of your mouth and you're just sucking on it real slowly that's my new fit in this dip all right so how do you get an idea like this like I'm not saying it's I'm not saying it's probably doesn't taste good or it might be therapeutic or whatever but why are you like you know what something need to I need something on the top of my mouth what can I do what can I do what can I do a pbfit powder all right I'm gonna like I've never even wanted to put anything at the top of my mouth nor have I just taken foods and be like what if I stuck this here for an hour would that be better than just eating it because I go to the store and I just like look at all the products like looking at new stuff and it says to add water and I'm like what if I don't what if I just eat this as plain powder and I Do Without a Cause over here I don't know I just tried it it was interesting to me it it just Add Water don't tell me what to do it works it works you should try it I definitely will not uh all right so what do we got today you got ideas I've got topics I've got a ton of stuff let me uh we can start off with something one thing that's like I don't know if this is actually interesting or not you tell me but basically I'm reading this book called more money than God and it's about the history of hedge funds you know anything about hedge funds not not a lot tell me yeah well you know I'm only in the first half of the book so I can't tell you much about how they operate now but because you know we're still in like the 1980s but basically the guy who invented it was called a hedged fund and his name was Alfred Jones Alfred Winslow Jones A.W Jones is what they call them and it's kind of interesting he was a journalist for Fortune you know he was just a writer it's crazy that fortune even existed back then this was in like the 30s and 40s and for some reason for some reason hedged fund is so funny to me that's what it that's what it was called I know it's I know it's real but for some reason it just seems like something we would just say wrong trying to be smart be like yeah I'm looking at investing in some head yeah and people be like is he putting a D in here like you know go out there have fun and break an egg you know [Laughter] so it's called it was called a hedged fun and he was researching for an article stock Pickers and he found this like small group of people that were doing like some slightly different stuff with hedge funds or with stock picking and at the time like basically rich people viewed Wall Street and a lot of like Equity investing as just a way to preserve wealth not really grow wealth and this guy A.W Jones he was in his 40s journalist and he goes oh with these you know small group of people that I'm researching this like mathematical formula stuff that they're doing it's actually really really interesting and so P raises I think a hundred thousand dollars at the time and what he does is basically uh the kind of dumb way of explaining it is which is the only way I understand it uh is that he just like does a combination of longing going long on things with borrowing leverage meaning if he invests eighty thousand dollars he would borrow another fifty thousand dollars now he's a hundred and thirty thousand dollars into a stock then with the rest of his hundred thousand dollars he would buy shorts in such a combination where his upside was much higher and his downside was a little bit protected and there was like some math behind it and at the time this was revolutionary but here's where things get actually really cool that itself wasn't the Revolutionary part I mean that was one part of it but what's the main thing the really cool thing that he did which wasn't done ever before is he hired these young stock Pickers and instead of just giving them a salary he goes all right you work for me I've raised a million dollars you get fifty thousand you get fifty thousand you get fifty thousand you get fifty thousand you can go and hire two people to work with you you're your own group you're your own group you're your own group and uh get after it let's see what you can do uh the person who does the least best or the person does worst you guys are out and he created this like Cutthroat culture of these people who were just getting after it and he was the first person that made it so you they were only paid a percentage so 20 of future upside and at the time he did it because that was that just means your your tax more uh uh it was more beneficial for you it wasn't income tax it was a capital gains tax and your tax benefits were like way greater but he told his folks he goes yes the reason we're doing this is Phoenician sea captains used to keep a fifth of the profits of successful voyages and that's like how he like he didn't say hey it's uh just so we can for this tax thing but like he like Justified there's a weird reason but anyway this team structure that's what like changed everything prior to that Wall Street was just like the stodgy sleepy place of like look we're just doing 80 stocks 20 bonds and we just let it sit there but then once he changed that incentive structure everything changed and that kind of got me interested that's kind of like been sitting with me because at the hustle we used to do this too where uh for our quotas for our sales people we would say you know go out and get ad sales and you get a percentage of what you close but then they would close like dumb [ __ ] they would close like for example they're like who cares if it's a porn company if it's a weed company if it's a shitty service like it doesn't matter and then we're like well actually that's a good point we need like inverse incentives like uh you know do the readers like this is a click-through rate high do they renew and I couldn't figure out how to do that successfully I couldn't figure out because both I thought I thought for sure the story was ending with so then I created a better system and it worked beautifully you're like I I couldn't figure that [ __ ] out that's too coffee I thought so I would have bet anything that you were about to say so then we did this and pat on the back I did a great job because I'm so used to people doing that like you know in Tech nobody says you know we kind of hit this problem and we didn't solve it it just didn't solve it you know that nobody ever tells a story like that I love that you just told a story like that that's amazing well I I so with my new business I am trying to think I'm like how do I solve this you know like can I pay like 50 of the but there's like but I started researching different ways to solve this and uh I don't know have you I'll tell you a few other examples but have you had with like the milk Road or with anything that you've done have you had where you're like if I just change the incentives this other thing changed so it's like the product isn't the Revolutionary or interesting thing it's like how you operate that's what's interesting yeah um I don't think I have a great story personally off the top of my head uh like we just did one where we needed to fill all the ads for like October or something like that or like whatever some future month and we were a little light and it was like oh how do we get this up and um and Ben was just like you know if we just told our like you know salesperson we'll give him an extra 10K if they can get this to if they can get us you know to this fill rate um I think they'll do it and and I was like yeah but like that's the same thing as their quota like if they just filled it they would get that percentage he's like no I think if we just say I'll give you ten thousand dollars on top of your quota if you could do this and I was like okay I guess that makes sense and uh instantly they like way overfilled it so and I was like okay I don't think you could do that all the time uh because like you know this got them you know to get off their ass and do something but uh but yeah I thought that was interesting so what's funny is you're right that does work and you can do it all the time so I was researching like incentives and one of the there's a handful of ways to make basically I think Charlie Munger or some one of the like Rich smart guys said like you show me the incentives I'm gonna show you future results or something like that and show me your incentives and I'll show you your outcomes and there are a few successful ways to like incentivize people and so one of those ways I was reading this McKenzie study where they said you actually should give bonuses based on 105 performance not just 90 performance and research shows that if you over attain to in order to get a bonus people tend to do that versus the other way around another thing is you do um clawbacks so you get 50 of a bonus up front and if you don't achieve the goal that you said you're going to get done then I'm going to do what's called the clawback and I'm going to take that money from you so you can do this with kids where you say hey look your allowance is 100 a week or a hundred dollars a month I'm actually going to give you 50 now and the other 50 when you do your chores but if you don't do your chores you're giving me that 50 back and that lossed version is actually uh performs better than if I just say I'm going to give you a hundred dollars at the end of the month if you do x y and z uh that's that's 100 right um yeah the I think lost version is what they what they call it but basically it feels it feels worse to lose money you have than to not gain the same amount of money yeah it should be the same thing but it's it's definitely not the same thing and uh I had this when we did I did a deal once where we got a million dollar signing bonus but it was contingent that if we if we left before a year um then we wouldn't get the million dollars and uh I would uh personally I wouldn't get the million dollars if uh if I left before you and um and I think if you had just told me hey do you want to stay for a year to get this million dollars I would be like well you know that sounds good but there's other opportunities maybe I could do it this other way but once they just put the money in my account they're like that's there now go look at that okay cool if you leave early you have to pay all that back and I was like oh man I gotta pay back a million dollars and it just felt if my brain knew exactly what was going on I was like I just don't want to pay back a million dollars that sounds like uh that would be horrible I'm definitely not doing that I'm not losing a million whereas if they had just said hey if you if you stay a little longer you can get this extra bit I would have been like ah maybe I can go get that some other way and um and that's a kind of a crazy like psycho like you know psychological trick I knew what was going on and it still felt real to me well and another interesting example then we could move on but another interesting example that I was thinking about was for uh you know what's like a really [ __ ] up industry is private prisons because you're incentivized by like how many beds you fill you know and that's like you know doesn't align with what we want as a society I'm like well what it should be is you're paid a little bit of money for how many beds you fill but then if the inmate you know has a receipt if they go back to prison inside the next four years outside of being released you got to give me that money back and if they stay out I'll give you the second half of your payment and I was just like I was thinking of all these different ways that uh because I was thinking about my business I'm like how can I change my incentives around in order to get a different outcome and that was like a really good example uh but it seems the problem with incentives is that a it's like to change them you have to be kind of bold and like kind of be the first to like really try something new and B oftentimes it's not always straightforward like did you achieve this or like tracking the results is actually like a huge task in itself which is what we had at the hustle I'm like I could do this but like I gotta build all this stuff to like track all this but anyway I yeah because it's uh they call second order effects basically usually the first thing you're trying to incentivize does happen it's the second thing that goes wrong basically it's uh yeah you got your ads filled but they filled it with certain types of content which led to readers being upset which led to churn or whatever like you have to predict what would be the uh the second order effect that comes from some of this stuff there's a there's like a Farnham Street blog that I've read about this one but the Cobra thing yeah like the Cobra thing yeah go ahead sort of like incentives gone wrong I don't remember the story at this point but basically it was like in India right now like there's you know the stereotype of like a guy playing like a porn or I don't know what it's called and like the Cobra coming up and like dancing and it was like well why there's so many Cobras in India and apparently I don't remember what year it was but there there was a little bit of a cobra problem and they go hey everyone we're gonna give you 50 for every dead Cobra you bring it bring to us thinking great we're gonna have no more cobras and but in reality uh the schemers were like oh let's breed cobras and kill them and bring them to you so like oh nice it's free money this is awesome and that there was now an overpopulation problem of cobras I I actually have no idea if that's a true story but that's uh that's like one of the urban legends yeah that's one of those Malcolm Gladwell stories that just like becomes like known by everybody whether it's real or not um have you heard the one about uh him talking about David Goliath yeah that one's great basically that I'll summarize it in 10 seconds which is basically like everyone talks about David Goliath it's this Underdog versus the big shot and they're like oh no it turns out Goliath was like eight feet tall because he had a pituitary gland problem which means that he was like had low IQ meaning he like was like you know like an idiot and he was like big which means if you have that pituitary glandish or that issue you can't see and at the time The Davids of the world were like Shepherds and they had these slings which is basically like they had a rifle so basically uh this like lead BB that this guy had it was already deadly and he hit like a big guy who was stupid and blind so it's really not that like impressive yeah David's a bully yeah um all right so let me give you let me give you an idea okay so I need a name for this don't have a name uh it's a working Title Here but I think that isn't it crazy that basically uh so we're we both invest in startups now and um and I had this real one of one of those startups that I invested in is just doing absolutely amazing and I'm like wow that thing is gonna make like our little investment we put 75k in I was like I think it's currently probably at like four or five million dollars it's a value that 75k check and we're not like like it can still run like that thing can still double twice and you're not doing anything I'm not doing anything and I was like and also so that's kind of a just amazing and I'm like oh I'm excited like the fund is gonna have like like the first really really big winner because we're only two or two years in and so it's hard to know what's your what are gonna be your big Winners but I think that one's gonna be one of the really big Winners now it's it's looking like very very promising but the second part is I would have never guessed that that would be the one um what can you say what it is um no I don't want to say which one it is yet um because I don't know if they want me to say or whatever but basically I looked back at literally that that the batch of that quarter I did 10 deals and of those 10 I would have said like oh this is probably like you know somewhere in the middle uh I would not have guessed it's like the one that's the big winner and I thought wow that's crazy and I was like you know it's pretty unfair that employees at tech companies don't have this sort of portfolio approach and it got me thinking we talked about or the founder of Sarah's list or the founders we talked about Sarah's list and how you know if you could pick one of these companies that's gonna four or five x over your four year period there um you know you can become a you know a self-made millionaire without taking huge entrepreneurial risks but you got to pick right and so that got me thinking like why do you have to pick right and so I got two startup related uh Community ideas for you the first is by the way the way that you're setting this up it's like you know doesn't it suck that would you eat 4 000 calories a day you get fat why does it have to be that way it doesn't like what if ice cream I just had a bad rap yeah what if I told you that if you exhale while eating it has no effect at all yeah okay the um all right say my idea is basically this you take a job at a tech company you get your portfolio of stock options or so you get your stock options you can then click a button and you can what you can pool it if you could pull it with other companies that are like like equally risk weighted so we basically create like a um like a credit rating agency where we kind of rate stock options and we're like all right cool like you're getting it at this price at this valuation good we know that that's that's set and secondly like there's a community like uh desirability to these options like maybe everybody in the community really wants stripe options because they're like wow stripe is great but I'm not working on stripe right now I'm working at the smaller startup that I think has high upside but like I consider stripe options to be AAA stock options so you kind of get evaluation and then a trust of the evaluation but you basically put your you put your stock in and you end up with let's call it 40 your stock and sixty percent becomes a blend of other stocks that you get to either pick or index into out of the startup community and so as a as an engineer or as a designer or whoever you are you're getting to be a part of you get de-risked a little bit out of just your one thing because maybe you got a crazy CEO you got Adam Newman you thought wework was a good idea now three years later your stock options are worthless they're underwater and like you know that okay cool that's just how the game works but does it have to be that way is my question and so um Sam I have two questions for you how good of an idea on this on a scale of one to incredible and secondly we need a name for this idea uh we already know I'm not funny on the spot so the name thing I'm gonna that's just I'm already gonna share yeah it's already a swing and a mess I mean I called my company the hustle like I'm not even gonna be not on the spot uh so I mean this podcast is called my first million like we're not we're not exactly good at this uh I told Sarah I want to name my our kid buck and uh she she wasn't feeling it dude that's so funny I told my wife I've been saying this since College I wanted to name my Kid jumper and then even I was like that's a horrible name but at some point I was committed because I had told like 12 people that I was doing this and those are like my 12 friends and it made no sense but I like had to stick with it was like what are you what are you saying this is not even close to what's gonna happen yeah I've suggested Biff and buff and uh she's not into it I think these are like you know in Batman comics where they like punch and it's like pow it's like Biff first name Chuck middle name steak is not gonna pass either but but TBD so I'm not good at naming anything but yeah I mean if you could pull this off dude one thing that I learned when I was running my company was I thought like oh it's a privately held business I can do whatever I want with the shares like I could just you get a share you get a share I can give this to you I didn't realize that it's like it's not I guess it's I don't know if it would technically be considered regulated but there's like rules right like you can't for example if I give if I sell you a share for a dollar I can't then six months later and I'm like summarizing this which means I'm probably a little bit off I can't then go and give like another employee that same share for 50 cents you know that's I I guess I I don't know if that'd be considered illegal or just against like certain rules that where you can get in trouble but it's like you can't do whatever you want so yeah if you could but if you could figure out how to like operationally pull this off I think it's badass well there are like secondary markets where you actually sell them but I think this would have to be some you'd have to create some some you know Financial contract some some derivative product that basically says I pledge or assign my shares to this portfolio basically and then in return in exchange I receive shares of the portfolio and there has to be some sort of like consequence for trying to like you know renege or whatever let's say your startup hits it huge you're like oh I don't want to do that so I don't know the you know I'm gonna wave my hands in the air right now that what I'm doing right now is Legal Financial magic like all right it's done that's done now and now we just need to like you know start the company and uh have it take off yeah I mean by the way that's how I actually run my businesses I'll go talk to the lawyer or the account I'll be like I don't know we don't have the uh we don't we don't know what the contract says like you know you got it you got this give them Good Vibes and I'm like hey I already agreed to this deal you got to figure out how that works like they're like what why did you just talk to me first there's like this leadership principle that you're supposed to like give people autonomy and like let them figure out and Empower them and I always you're empowered dude I'm empowering you to figure this out you're welcome yes your Ash has gotten powered my friend congratulations yeah you're welcome thank me later Daddy's show this makes you happier yeah yeah I mean if you could figure that out I think I'm down I just empowered you yeah I just empowered your ass move on my part you like that stuck on that Harvard so sorry speaking of like investing I was uh reading about the figma thing so figma is like the design thing that just sold for 20 billion so have you heard of O'Reilly media yeah they um they publish like books in the conference right like yeah basically what's the guy's name who started I had dinner with him one time what's his first name uh O'Reilly Tim O'Reilly so he's like they call him like he had this title like the Oracle of Silicon Valley because he's been in the game since like the 70s and 80s and uh originally started writing books on programming and his mission statement for his company was actually really cool it was like uh work on interesting stuff with interesting people and he's like we'll try books for a little while and then he's like oh we'll just let's just stick with books that's fine but like he didn't actually necessarily care about books he just wanted to like fund his ability to work on cool stuff so he anyway they're famous for writing these books now they make like two or three hundred million dollars a year uh with the combination of books conferences and uh like you can pay like 50 bucks a month and like get access to like a bunch of their like technical content so it's content for engineers and [ __ ] like that anyway they started a little fun using the profits of their business and the profits of their business were was big but the fund wasn't necessarily big compared to like a a full-time you know proper fund fund and I was looking at some of the stuff that they did and they were in figma's seed round and I was doing some math and this doesn't account for dilution and if they sold early so these numbers actually could potentially be off by by a lot but assuming that isn't the case uh if they if I don't know what figma's figma's seed round was but I think they raised three million dollars so if you assume that it was around a 15 million dollar cap uh it sold for 20 billion that means it went up by around 1300 times so a 250 000 check is something like 300 million dollars and it's crazy that this is one of those examples where the main thing didn't even make the main money you know what I mean like the or sorry the main the not main thing made more than the main thing our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better dude I mean there's so many examples of that uh that actually leads me to another topic I had but like the remember that when we did Camp MFM we stayed in a house and I don't know if you saw it but did you see on the stairway up to the guest bedroom those plaques on the wall did you walk to that staircase like the back staircase by the chance yeah I thought they were just like kids trophies like basketball clubs I didn't even look at them no they were adult trophies basically what those were uh so the guy whose house we were staying in he's a venture capitalist oh and French capitalist who lives in North Carolina and that on that stairway up I was walking up there and I was like wait beyond meat and it's basically what he was framing was a share certificate it's like um this guy uh you know whatever his name was owns you know 45 000 shares priced at 0.01 you know a dollar like basically one cent a share and then it's like Beyond me going public at 11 a share and I was like wait I was just like literally took out the calculator app you know it doesn't go up to a billion or whatever I was like unless you turn like this is you got to turn the phone oh really if you turn the phone yeah that's a fun little fact wow Game Changer I've been uh just like the same I'm like what do you think foreign that's my goal not to be a billionaire to get an e in my network yeah the um the the but the guy basically had like 20 of these on his wall and they were just like yep issued shares at 22 cents a share now going public at 22 dollars a share and I'm like wow that's like yeah these are crazy run-ups and it's like okay you own 10 000 shares 20 000 shares one uh five thousand shares fifty thousand shares and you just do the math you're like this is a staggering amount of money that's being generated by this it is really mind-boggling when you get these Investments right and it is also really funny how some of the really successful people made their wealth not out of the main thing that they did but in a way out of the main thing that's it Tim Ferriss is another example somebody was asking me the other day they go how much do you think Tim Ferriss makes a year and I said I you know I don't know I don't probably keep maximizes like no what he can do like he doesn't sell out you know fully like probably just five to ten million bucks yeah I said that's exactly I said five to five to eight million dollars a year probably of just like cash flow uh at this point from you know podcasts sponsorships newsletter or whatever but uh book royalty something like that those are maybe five million dollars a year I said they're like oh okay that's that's really good but uh you know I guess that's not that big I go yeah but like he also because he was Tim Ferriss got to invest in Shopify and Uber and like probably made hundreds of millions of dollars off of his Uber investors yeah over 100 million dollars my guess I would bet that his net worth is north of 150 maybe north of 200 liquid yeah which is I mean insane and obviously like what that means is that 90 plus percent of it probably has come from not his what if he described herself you might say I'm an author I'm a self-experimenter I'm a podcaster but then all the money came from like you know four Angel Investments or whatever and um and I think that's really really uh that's like really really impressive but also more common than you'd think do you know other people who had this otherwise I have a example that I want to go into anyways yeah just like a few famous people just like you see like uh like Nas the rapper like on all these cap tables like yeah you you know the guy who started figma in one of the Articles it said that he had made 10 million dollars because he owned the most expensive crypto one of those like big ones uh and he bought it for nothing and he sold it and he had 10 million before he even sold figma but uh what are the other ones uh well I wanted to do I was thinking about okay who do I do as Billy of the week and so my Billy of the week that I came up with was Roger Federer the tennis player [Applause] [Music] a million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars [Music] so the US Open was on got me thinking about tennis and um and I saw that Roger Federer was one of he's part of the uh the Billy athlete Club so there's our Federer is five athletes who have made a billion dollars Tiger Woods Floyd Mayweather LeBron James Ronaldo and I think Michael Jordan may be messy so that might be six I think it's five um and now Federer is in that club so give him like a 300 million dollar bump though because he married Brooklyn Decker no that's not even included that's it that's just bonus points uh so how does this work so he has the same thing where okay he's had a great career right considered I think the goat in terms of tennis tennis players so he's the greatest tennis player of all time but less than basically 90 of his money came not from winning tennis tournaments so he he's made 130-ish million dollars from official prize money from tournaments um he's got 20 grand slam wins but most of the money he makes is off the court so just for example like is he retired yeah so Roger Federer who just announced literally yesterday that he's retiring you know in his last year he paid like I don't know 300 000 of prize money but 90 million from sponsorships off off the course of the Court which is kind of insane but his story is kind of cool like and when I was studying these different athletes I'm actually going to do a whole episode that's just a deep dive on each of these athletes the moves that they made that made this happen so one of Federer's big moves was that early on he was not getting paid jack [ __ ] even when he was the best player um they you know they would pay like Andy Roddick more because they're like oh Andy Roddick he's American America is a bigger Market Federer Swiss uh the Swiss market you know that's the tiny population he's kind of this like clean-cut sort of boring guy he doesn't have this big personality um and even though he's really good he's not as marketable he's not as sellable and this is what they used to tell him so he was getting like very small like Nike was paying Andy Roddick more than they were paying Roger Federer even though by the way there was no break number one that's the guy who married Brooklyn Decker oh yeah Eddie Roddick that's right damn so uh so anyway so Federer goes and he's like he's making so he's making like very little money from Nike then he you know he carries on and he goes and he gets to a 10 million dollar uh a year deal with Nike and it's sort of like well you made it you know you should be happy you got this 10 million a year deal you know you're set your family's set whatever but he made two decisions which really one decision led to two things that made him an extra 600 million dollars and here's what those two were so the first is his contract with Nike is coming up and the expectation is that he's going to uh just renew with Nike and he goes to Nike he says hey this is now or then this back then he's like I'm one of the you know I'm one of the best uh tennis players in the world like you know what can he do for me and they're like Raj we we put so much marketing behind you uh you know the reality is you can't compare yourself to basketball players or to uh or to um soccer players like you know tennis is just a different thing here's the best we could do and they gave him a deal and the deal was basically like every year that you're playing you get x amount of money and he's and you know something similar to what he was making right then but he started he decides you know what I'm gonna pause here I'm not just gonna take this deal I'm gonna go shop around a little bit more and see what I can do and then Uniqlo comes at him with this you crazy offer and so Uniqlo who's not even in the like sports apparel game really but they kind of had this like tennis vibe that they're trying to come they're trying to come to the west and um and so Uniqua comes out of it they offer him a 10-year deal worth 300 million dollars that that pays him even when he retires so this 2018 he's retired now um I think he's retired now check that he is retired now right guys um but basically he uh he signs this deal knowing that he will retire during this deal and he's gonna get paid 30 million dollars a year uh doing this he goes back to Nike he tells Nike hey guys I got this offer can you also give me an offer like this it doesn't even have to be as much and they're like uh no we'll throw in this like you know here's that extra free t-shirt but you know yeah no you're not getting a new deal give me a part so he's like all right he leaves but there's one key thing that he kind of knew here which was that Uniqlo doesn't make shoes and so he signs the Uniqlo deal he starts wearing Uniqlo but he's still wearing Nike shoes and they ask him at the press conference or like Roger I noticed you're still wearing your Nikes like are you allowed to do he's like oh yeah I don't have a deal with them um you know I'm shopping around let's see what's out there for me uh you know it's exciting I want to see see what's out there and so for three years he keeps wearing Nikes essentially for free because he's just playing in them he doesn't have a shoe deal and then finally he gets he does a shoe deal with the brand called on running which I'm guessing you know about on the the running brand there's another Swiss company yeah they they they're kind of taking the World by storm and you know what's funny is they were one of our advertisers when we first started and they started spending a little bit of money and they're spent kept going up each year and I was like you guys are killing it aren't you and they are I think they make like over a billion in Revenue now or maybe they even sold did they sell no they went public so so they went public at its peak it was like 11 billion valuation now with with Market Corrections back closer to 6 billion uh but at the you know at its peak so Roger owned three percent of the brand in exchange for he did an equity deal so he said all right I get it you guys don't have the same cash these guys can offer how about a piece of the company and so he owns three percent of the company at its peak his steak is worth 300 million dollars now so that's sort of like bet on yourself and then do an equity deal don't don't trade dollars for time you know trade your brand for shares traded for equity and that becomes for 300 million dollars and then he says all right what else can I do so he then takes matters into his own hands he cuts ties with his current representation company starts his own player management firm to represent him and other players then he starts creating his own tournament so he's got his own like you know cup that's basically like you know the equivalent of the Ryder Cup in golf where it's like Europe versus America uh so he wants to do the same thing and so now he's got his own competition thing and so he's built this whole empire made over a billion dollars total most of it 90 percent of of it off the court and I think this is kind of amazing and if you look at it there's a couple like like interesting things here so he um he goes up market so he goes basically like how do I go premium so his sponsors are Mercedes-Benz Rolex lint chocolate he didn't do what Jordan did which was Coca-Cola and McDonald's right because he's like all right where's my Niche where's my market how do I get paid let me go to these like you know go to Rolex basically um the second thing that he did was he um he uh he basically not only did he bet on himself not only to take matters into his own hands he played a very patient game and so I think most people would have been though during those three years where they don't have a shoe deal they'd just be counting the dollars that they're missing out on I make 5 million or 10 million dollars a year if I just sign this contract and this is a common trait this is great LeBron James story where LeBron is 18 years old he graduates from high school that same day you know the day the first day he's legally allowed to um Nike shows up a Nike or rebok I think Reebok shows up at his uh um at a school or whatever they take him to a meeting he's like I remember dude this is like the longest table I've ever sat at like the longest boardroom table he's sitting at one end I'm sitting at the other end and he's like he slides a check over to me and I look at it it's more money than I've ever seen in my life and LeBron comes from like single mom she had him at 16 you know couldn't pay electricity bills type of thing like came from like he was dirt poor and they basically offered him a 10 million dollar a year contract as an 18 year old kid he hasn't played a single game in the NBA yet he looks at it though he signed this now and you can become our signature athlete we will put this money behind you it's the biggest deal we've ever offered to a kid out of high school you know congratulations son and he doesn't have him he doesn't have an agent he doesn't have anything at this point and he basically just says you know appreciate the offer man I appreciate it thank you um let me get back to you did I get back to you this is 10 million dollars a year what are you thinking and he's like and he's like he tells a story later he's like in my head I'm thinking man this is more money than I've ever seen but if Reebok's offering me this much I wonder what Nike was offer I wonder what these other like he's like I must be worth something to these guys like I don't have to take this deal yet and just by being patient he ended up with a much larger deal uh out of that just for not like immediately grabbing so you know what trait that's called it's called um there's this awesome book by this woman named Angela Duckworth called grit have you ever heard that book Grit I've seen like Silicon Valley people talk about it yeah well it's like centered around this story it's like a study where they give a whole bunch of kids uh they sit them down at a table and they go hey look you can have one marshmallow now or in a couple hours I'll give you two but uh I'm gonna set this here I'm gonna go out of the room for a little while and handle some stuff when I come back I'll see if you decided to eat it or leave it there and that will kind of tell me what decision you made sound good and they leave and you know they just see who does what and they measure these kids for like 30 and 50 years like for years and years and what they found is there's a correlation between traditional financial success you know like our traditional word of success there was a correlation between how successful they were and the children that chose to not eat that one in exchange for getting two in the future and the ones who put it off you know in eight two they were more successful and what you've explained to me is like the perfect like real world but rare example of uh grit where it's like no I'm willing to like not do this thing now in exchange for a better alternative and potentially in the future yes delayed gratification and that's like the best way to describe that I'm a marshmallow eater dude like say I I would have been that first you know I would have had it in my mouth while they're explaining the instructions there's another one coming well I always got like frustrated when I talked about like you know I told you this when they talked about Warren Buffett and Jeff Bezos talking about patience and having fun I'm like dog you're way too old go have fun now like there is no there is no law there is no long term man you're a long-term is like Jeff Bezos now he's like you know he's rushing you know you know Sig app over there he's turning into a frat boy he's like he's like he wants to be single do roids you know drink beers on a boat and it's like uh all right that's cool but like not as cool when you're how old is Jeff bezel that's good you're 57 as it was when you were oh no man it looks like it works it looked like it it looks like it's working for him uh let me tell you about this thing I read right before we started so basically today I think today they're gonna announce the FED what they're uh rate raise is going to be yeah we're gonna we're gonna learn how much money we've lost today yes and uh I don't know anything about that type of stuff so I'm not gonna pretend I do but I I read this interesting article and it was about JP Morgan you know JP Morgan's is like you know amazing bank that's supposed to know what they're talking about and I was reading about what their predictions were and they had this like day of scenario where they're like here's like the three options uh or here's the three possible outcomes and you know they raise the rate by this much this much and this much and here's our prediction on what's going to happen and they weren't like being funny they weren't obviously they weren't being funny they weren't trying to be like silly or anything but I'm gonna tell you the the range of the three options so um option one well I'll just say like so what's gonna happen is if they raise it by 0.75 uh we are potentially gonna have a five percent drop uh sorry if it's a full percent full percentage Point raised we're gonna have a five percent drop in the market or if it's a point seven five percent rate days we're gonna have one of the best days on record for the S P 500 so that's basically this like the the most like one of the most prestigious banks on Earth with thousands of people studying this they say it's either gonna be the best day ever or a five percent drop which is not quite the worst day ever but it's a really bad day and it just goes to prove that even the quote experts they don't know [ __ ] we're all just floating on this rock trying to figure it out but I saw this and I was like wait are you kidding me is this a serious is this a serious prediction it's gonna be one of the best days ever or one of the worst days ever or something in between that's basically what the prediction is it reminds me of those people where you're like all right so you know what do you think of the chances that happens like it's a 50 50 man it's either gonna happen or it's not gonna happen no like just because there's only two options doesn't make it a 50 50. it's either going to be or it's not going to be and then like tomorrow the statement analyst is gonna be like well you know I saw that going one of two ways but I did not expect it going that other way and the funny thing is it's like they released like an 82-page report and it just like I don't know man at the end yeah yeah it just Trails off yeah NM not much you that's just what the whole report should be because that's basically what they just said like what's your opinion not much yeah I thought that was ridiculous that's that's J so I was reading about all these headphones that I'm like oh these guys are smart but turns out like when I was reading about these headphones these guys are smart but they're like kind of Lucky like they like just make a bunch of games other hedged funds yeah did this guy um this is a hedged opinion by the way this is the most edged opinion I've ever seen in my life the um it's like one time I was playing roulette and I was uh so down on my luck at the casino by the time I get to the roulette table that means I have like I got bored of Poker then I lost money in five minutes playing Blackjack and then I had like an absolute roller coaster at the craps table and now roulette is my like come down like my gambling addicts out there will know what I'm talking about and then at some point I'm like just betting wrong every time like what are the odds of me being wrong on red or black 12 times in a row and then I'm just betting both red and black just to feel a little bit of a win and it's like you know I'm just hoping a green doesn't show up uh but basically like there's a tweet that I saw that goes yeah I never realized my whole net worth was dependent on an interest rate like until this year did you know what the fomc committee oh did you did you know that like your entire net worth was dependent on 0.75 or one percent interest rate hikes like who where the [ __ ] did this come from and why did it turn out that they could no I remember I could just ragged all my my net worth I remember uh people talking about the fed and I was like I don't know what the FED is it's like it's like what people talk about the FBI to be honest that's a lot of like Breaking Bad and narcos I have no idea like you know like people say like well you know scientists say or you know they say this that's who I thought the feds was it was just they you know there's he him her now there's they you know I just thought it was the pro the official pronouns are they and fed yeah dude I saw a guy on Twitter and he put for his pronouns he put we Dash Damn Dash boys dude that's it's the best one it's the best one it's that guy Jack um read them boys that was his uh it's too [ __ ] good yeah that one always make me laugh um all right I have something interesting uh so in I found this video on on YouTube If you Google on YouTube like figma seed pitch so I watched that this morning dude awesome let's talk about it because basically the story is I believe it was in this video was filmed I think in 2013. so the video the video was posted in 2020 but the way looking at it he looks pretty young maybe not 2013 young but he looks young but regardless he's going through his pitch and basically so figma recap sold this week on Monday or Friday or something like that for 20 billion dollars one of the biggest exits ever for uh Venture back startup uh and the guy who ran it started the business when he was 19. and there's this video on YouTube of him pitching this guy named Daniel gross who was actually on our pod early on who had a fun and I had a few takeaways from this pitch and so it's like a 20 or 18 minute or 10 minute video of him pitching my five takeaways were a he's a kid even if it even the video is like new he looks like he looks like he's 18 but and he looks so young and he talks kind of young but he's really wise like you could you hear him speaking and you're like it's very impressive hearing him talk the second is that the pitch was basically videos of the product it was a prototype like a demo of the Prototype not as much of a deck and oftentimes throughout the pitch it was pretty fun and he like used the product to photoshop the the guy he was pitching Daniel he photoshopped his face and made it he made him look like another person and Daniel the guy being pictures like oh my God this is hilarious this is awesome and Dylan the guy pitching was just like having fun and showing him the product and that was so much better than just showing a deck and the last two things were uh Tech skills so the guy's like clearly Technical and we often talk about how like it does you don't need this stuff and technically you don't need it but God damn it helps this guy he's clearly like they built something that like was actually working and that's such an advantage I do think you need to learn that and the last thing is that it's an MVP it does not look good at all it's pretty ugly and it's and it's mildly effective but it's effective enough that you can see the future yeah exactly I watched this thing um so you can find it if you go to YouTube it says it's his name Dylan field pitches seed stage figma to Daniel gross that's the name of the the YouTube video it's got uh what 30 000 views yeah I think probably all of it's in the last two days yeah yeah yeah so he's pitching and my observation was very much like yours first of all it doesn't doesn't feel like a pitch because uh most pitches are like hey here's our company um we're going after this really big Market did you know we have a tam of you know three trillion dollars a year or spell spent on health care and they're like oh wow okay um three trillion dollars that's cool what are you doing and they're like you know uh you know we like we sell weed yeah like we help you we help you do squats with using your phone camera like with better form it's like uh I don't think that's the three trillion dollars of Health Care spend but okay yeah like I'm not sure and they always have like a stupid quadrant thing with them in the top right right everybody else you know the the y-axis is if you're you know stupid or smart and then this one is if you're hard working or or lazy it's like I don't know everybody else is lazy and dumb and we're hard working and smart 20 billion dollar company are you sure you're better than them yeah yeah they're like you know poor product it's like uh I don't know about that you're a poor product it makes me mad I feel like very irritated what they should do is put themselves in the bottom left and be like but one day this year [Laughter] six weeks ago when we met and then now we've moved up and like just imagine the trajectory like that's actually the reality that's actually what's happening we've already moved an inch on this screen imagine a few of us five years it's not the scale but so so he's doing this pitch it's basically literally the first slide it's a picture of him on a boat here's me and I used to work at Flipboard toy he goes I worked at Flipboard twice and then he goes uh yeah this is my co-founder he was my friend at school we dropped out okay he goes then he shows this video this talk he goes I was really inspired by this talk by Brett Victor inventing on principle by the way this same talk I think is the one that the webflow guy said was like his inspiration for building webflow was the same grainy ass video of this guy explaining you know like how to build like a like a real product well I think that I think the takeaway from the talk is or he says something to talk about how uh it's morally right to help people to create or something like that where he's like your goal as a business Builder is just help people create or something like that and so the webflow guy like the the demo he's doing in this is like the difference between uh like imagine you have to you have to choose a bunch of options from a menu or write a bunch of code and then push run and see how it happens versus just you see the thing and you can just edit it live like drag and drop like it is so what you see is what you get editor and how much more creative you you can be when you're doing it the what you see is what you get version because you're just shuffling things around in real time I think everybody's kind of experienced this in general um so anyways he's talking he gives a bunch of demos and all the demos are like kind of uh it's like oh look I you know I made this like airplane look at Blends in the background and then luckily I did this thing like I merged these two people's faces together it's like you don't look at this and you don't think ah 20 billion dollar company someday like it's not like you'd have to have a lot of foresight really what you see when you see this is like the only two indicators that this would be successful is this guy seems really smart and really like is a creative Builder so like I'd bet on him and to be successful in life for sure and then the second thing was and this is I think the underrated part of what people talk about for figma which is that there was a technology change there was an inflection in technology which was webgl had come out and I remember when webgl first came out I don't know I mean but I'm not technologically explain it but basically what it made what it did was it lets you do cool graphics stuff in the browser got it that you weren't going to be able to do unless you otherwise normally like normally a browser was weak and if you wanted to like play a game with cool graphics you needed to like download the game you need to have the application of the game to run on your computer's Hardware because doing it in the browser was going to be too laggy too slow to whatever and webgl was this like web framework that let people build things that were like they were like cool graphic-y stuff 3D stuff like you know Real Time stuff in the browser so that's why when figma you would see people if I'm working on the document with you I'd see your mouse moving around in real time and that was like a magic trick you had never seen that before and at the time I remember with like we were building stuff and when webgl came out all of our developers really intrigued by it there was like cool stuff you could do in webgl that you weren't other like wasn't possible before and then the question was now what's the application and then where he landed was like I think we can recreate the whole creative Adobe Creative Suite in the browser and here's how we're going to do it and like that actually made a lot of sense he didn't actually pitch it that well he like mentioned those things during the thing but like you'd have to like ignore 80 of what he said and just be like oh that's just fun experimentation this guy's smart webgl is a game changing technology and this idea of recreating the Adobe suite in a browser making it free for everybody that's a great idea and so like you had to sort of see the the great pitch through the forest here dude so the remember how I told you about this guy named Brett Adcock who's like this billionaire guy who created uh a bunch of different companies including basically a flying car business remember that guy yeah so he tweeted out the other day uh like here's what I've learned about entrepreneurship and one of the five things that he said was pick really really big Ideas because then you could attract more investors and it's easier to like uh get employees and all that and all that type of thing it's like that make no small plans thing and that thing has always made me self-conscious because like every plan I make is like pretty small like like you know I won't want marshmallow right now not too later you know what I mean like yeah I only make small plans compared to like that plan and it's kind of cool that like this figma thing it doesn't seem that grand it was but it doesn't seem that way early on and that like makes me feel better about my deficiencies so thank you Dylan you mean when people say like Grand ideas and I'm like yeah but like writing a newsletter is kind of fun right you know what I'm saying like I don't know how to make robots [Laughter] yeah but I do dream about that uh sometimes I'm like okay me too and an alternate life what am I doing right now and I'm like why am I not you know changing whatever you know building the the next big thing you know the next picks are making a flying you know car or whatever it's like I could do it I could I know that I could do it and um and I do think about doing it maybe I will end up doing it but but it is for some reason for me I sort of am like uh I don't know there's a how hard do I want to work yeah uh questions right like you know if I made my quadrants I'm putting myself in the lazy quadrant where I'm like I don't need to do the hardest thing to impress myself so I'm trying to figure out the things that I can do that impress myself um that are also like not gonna ruin my life and my lifestyle dude well but what I mean by that is just like I like being home with my kids I like that I don't have to like freak out I don't I don't have like a office of a hundred employees that are like we're hard charging and we're about to die at all times like I kind of like that I don't do that um so I just need to find a way to impress myself that fits in my framework and I think that what about right you gotta do that like who's doing his [ __ ] you know Roger Federer I was gonna ask you that like who's doing his stuff we had Mark Laurie in the podcast and I talked to a bunch of people who worked with them and they're like yeah he's really good at raising money and then he hires people and then he just kind of like they didn't it's exaggerating to say he chills that's not true but like there they kind of like said like well he wasn't doing the hard work he did a lot of the work early on but he kind of like got all the leverage by getting the money and having the idea and starting it and then like everyone else he did a really good job hiring them and letting do their thing but same with Roger Federer he ain't the one running that running a lot of that stuff I wonder how he partners with people yeah well the other one that I was looking at was Floyd Mayweather and Floyd Mayweather has kind of an amazing uh bet on himself story like this too like you probably know it but I don't know if most people know boxers in general UFC fighters make basically nothing and uh with like you know one or two exceptions and then boxers kind of make more boxers can make you know 10 million 20 million in a fight and they can do that once or twice a year that's great that seemed like the top and what Floyd Mayweather did was he was like who the hell is making all this money because I see that crowd is full of people and the pay-per-view number is huge but like where does the money go and the reality was that the money would go to the promoters it would go to the cable companies it would go to all these other people and so he decided to bet on himself so he buys out his contract he spent he takes 750 000 out of pocket and buys himself out of top rank which was the promoter that promoted Oscar De La Hoya and Manny Pacquiao all these guys and he starts you know Mayweather promotions and now his business model is like basically it's it's vertical integration right like it's to use the business school term he's like okay I'm not just going to be the talent I'm also going to be the production for the show which means that I also collect the live gate Revenue which means that I also have to pay the other fighter like I have to I have to write the check um I'm also going to own a piece of the pay-per-view I'm going to make it he's like I'm gonna make money on every hot dog sold in this venue I'm gonna make money on the merch I'm gonna make money everywhere and so because of that now when he does a fight like his um Manny Pacquiao fight his Conor McGregor fights he's pulling in somewhere between 250 and 400 million dollars that's crazy himself on those five per fight so he you know more than 10x more like 20x to what he could make by betting on himself and building that brand and then then he created all the associated Brands so then he basically created he's like why am I these sponsors are paying me to wear their [ __ ] you know why don't I just create you know The Money Team clothing line and I'm gonna like own my own clothing line rather than promoting these other clothing lines LeBron did the same thing he's like why am I promoting McDonald's he bought equity in Blaze Pizza and he's like cool I'll just own a piece of this chain rather than just be a sponsored athlete um and so there's there's basically a bunch a bunch of people do this model and then Floyd you know he did he did a couple things one was he went nuts on the self branding so he changed his brand from Pretty Boy Floyd to Floyd Money Mayweather and he knew that people were gonna hate that he knew that people were gonna hate it and he started doing hateable things like he would just post a photo of himself like at a dinner table but there's no food on the table it's just stacks of cash everywhere he's like this is how I eat or whatever or you know he would um you know just go throw like a you know a wad of cash at somebody and just like make fun of them because they're poor and like they would pick up the dollars because they're like well this is like 10 grand and so like he would do things that would get attention he would do things at Village brand but in reality he would look like this party like this party guy he owns strip clubs Never Smoke never drank you know like the guy trains at like three in the morning so you know he kind of built this brand like he's this kind of like badass or whatever but in reality he's like a he like extremely well conditioned athlete that was like extremely disciplined and never like ran into any of those problems but he hired Al Haymon who Al had run you know he's like he's like we have to do a whole episode on on this because Al Haymon is really intriguing Al Haymon if you Google his face there's like four pictures of him on the internet and he's one of these guys I think he's like famous for like you never meet him in person but he does everything on the phone and he's always in the background of the most powerful boxers and fighters in the world and before that you know what he was doing no he was doing the same thing in the music industry so he represented Janet Jackson Whitney Houston helped build their brands of their their whole business Empires then he taught Floyd how the music how musicians make their money and he's like oh I need to do that basically my fight is me on tour I need to own the tour and so I need to own the shows I need to make the money from the tickets not just be the fighter who goes on the stage and so Al became his business guy on that side and then he has Leonard Ellerbe who does it on the on the Mayweather promotion side and like the joke of course about Floyd is that he can't read and it's like he's like I can't read but I I know numbers and like you know so he's like you know he he know you know he's found a way to make a ton of money he understood like the core fundamentals of a business um and you had to put people in place and so he generates a lot of money now some people think he's going broke because he spends so much I think he might be like I totally believe that that's hard to say dude I totally believe that this podcast we we are the internet dork Renaissance we started with Adam Levine cheating on his wife and then I think we went to like uh the history of RSU option shares yeah and then rsu's options chairs then we talked about the FED at JP Morgan and then back to Mayweather and Al Haymon you can't get this anywhere else you just can't they're gonna get all this yeah yeah you know we are the Chinese buffet of podcasts yeah they say that like true wealth is created by being like a narrow uh an inch uh uh an inch wide but like a mile deep not here we are we are we are a rain puddle we are just going to cover everything just a little bit well you've built your whole life off being four inches long so it all worked out for you yeah average at Best in lots of different if you're average at best at just about everything you're kind of above average so it works out well all right that's uh that's the show I'm exhausted I gotta take a not nap after that [Music]

for Mr Beast the I think the parallels are super easy with Walt Disney the only time that Walt Disney slowed down in his career was for like a decade and it was because Walt loved to be working on a new thing but a certain point everyone convinced him like oh actually you have this enormous multi-million dollar Animation studio now you just need to be working on pumping out more full-length animations like when he did that the whole thing kind of went downhill and then he goes crazy and he starts obsessing over little toy trains and like really going off the rails but those model trains then get bigger and bigger and becomes Disneyland and that is when he comes out of his Funk and starts innovating again and so for Mr Beast it's just like the don't let anyone convince you that you need to be working on the reasonable thing like you need to follow your unreasonable Passions

like the point of business and money is like to live a really long and good life and the really the best way to do that money is maybe number two number one is just like being fit and I wanted to spend 10 minutes talking about my personal well I was like what do engineers say they say like Tech stack marketing stack let's talk about our body stack [Music] all right it's Friday and uh we're gonna do something a little different so you know people know us than it was for our brains they know us for our money but they also know us for our body me and Sam were doing an episode and for some reason we got on a 30-minute tangent about Fitness as an entrepreneur Fitness as a uh as a business person what we do uh more specifically like what's the routines what are the uh what are the things that are working for us what are the tactics what are the goals we have things like that uh so we decided to make it a separate episode so this is uh this is the body episode of my personality let us know if you like it Sam what did uh what are they gonna get by listening to this I name drop lots of products that I pay for none of these people have paid me I'm more than happy to accept payment from them so if you're yeah you know my fitness pal yeah if I use MyFitnessPal I love it so if you guys want to give me some money just put it out there if you are one of these companies or a competitor to one of these companies pay us yeah willing to be bought uh so anyway it's a 30 minute episode on or is it 30 maybe 20 on uh different Fitness stuff and the things that we spend our money on to be fit which basically is kind of more important than the whole making money thing because if you're not fit and you're not healthy you can't really do that thing so we talked about one of our friends as one of our friends who's uh you know super successful they've been a guest on the podcast before worth hundreds of millions of dollars they said this once and I can't use their name because it's a little not politically correct but they said this if you're rich there's no excuse to be fat and they said that because I was like man you spend a lot of time like working out like what are you trying to do here and they just said like look the point of having Financial Freedom is to be able to spend it on spend your time doing things that are like you know luxuries things that like make your life better and one of the things that makes your life way better is having a good like kind of Fitness routine and being a you know a healthy fit person and so that's kind of the idea Sam is extremely fit Samuel like in the top point one percent probably of like Founders who are fit well yeah I mean that's I I added the founder Venn diagram yeah give me that founder thing and yeah we'll definitely call it point one percent but you know that's like that's an easy that's an easy game to win maybe and I've been going from pretty unfit to now like you know as we say I was the before before photo and I'm getting to the after and so you get both perspectives you get the perspective of somebody who's like all about that life and somebody who is like you know doesn't come easy to them but they're they're making it happen so so yeah enjoy the episode all right we live what's going on how are you I'm sore from what so I went I went on Craigslist because I had I wanted something I think Craigslist is massively underrated Craigslist is so good there is if you want a job Craigslist if you're on a couch Craigslist if you want to learn something Craigslist if you want to hook up Craigslist whatever you want Craigslist has got the thing for you and it has the most liquidity so you go in there and I I was looking for a um a new uh new chef and so I went on there and I was like you Chef immediately started getting hit with things and I was like why don't I use Craigslist more look at these responses this is amazing so I was like what else do I want right Craigslist is my like magic lamp this the genie and I need to go and I need to make another wish and so I go oh yeah remember that video of Mark Zuckerberg and so this is the part I learned from you which is describe it like a kid with no filter so I literally just put up a video I I put up the post I go uh Hey I was watching I was on Tick Tock and I saw this video it looked awesome I want to do that so I was like I want to do that that looks fun and I was like will you come I was like will somebody come to my house to just like train me kind of like that yeah I don't I'm not I'm a beginner and I don't even really want to ever fight I just think that looks like a really fun workout so I want to do that um I don't know who I need you don't have to be an expert just like somebody who could just watch that video and if you think you could do that for me then uh just call me or maybe text me whatever so I posted that and immediately guy I got a hit from some guy who's like hey uh I did anime for 10 years I could totally trade you he's like I trained with the Diaz brothers in in Stockton and you know I'm a Caesar Gracie purple belt I'm a striker but I was like whoa okay great he's like he's like um and so he calls me and I'm like all right yeah um do I need like equipment or like how do I do this and he was just like no you he's like you don't need anything I was like what do you do during the day he's like I'm a handyman and I was like he's like oh this is cool because I'll get back into shape too and I was like all right sounds fun and he's like uh did he like fix a bunch of stuff afterwards at your house no but in my mind I was like dude I've been looking for a handyman too my wife's always on me about building and assembling things and hanging things I was like this is a two-for-one baby and so which basically means this guy is like a professor like his he's the reason he was on Craigslist he was probably looking for handyman gigs yeah exactly he just happened to see this was like oh I used to whoop ass and so he goes um I knew he would be good he goes what are you doing today and I was like uh uh uh I was like mentally not prepared to like immediately get in a fight today so I was like no but how about tomorrow he's like all right I'll be there what time I was like I don't know uh let's do the morning he goes great I'll be there at 8 A.M okay and so he came over we trained and he came over by the way looking like a handyman he comes over in his like handyman boots his like you know like those jeans that are like covered in paint and he's like rolls up he's got like a pair he's got a set of keys that has like 1400 keys on it I was like bro do you have the keys to my house what's going on here and so he just got all these Keys oh he brings his boots and he's just like so he's one of these guys that works out in his jeans or what yeah so he basically did the whole workout in his jeans which was crazy to me he's like throwing kicks in his combat boots and I was like what the hell is going on uh but he knew what he was talking about and so he trained me and I'm still super sore it was incredible my hand I had to ice my Knuckles my hand was in so much pain last night it was great I don't know if this is legit did he did some did he do a little reference checking like I don't know if that's how it works no no I don't do reference checks that's all right did you guys like Risk at all times did you like wrestle or do Jiu Jitsu like did you roll what did you do yeah well he's like all right we're gonna start with the basics he's like here's how you move your feet he's like here you say you throw a jab he said throw you across and it's like and you know you know these things but he's like you know clean it up right like let's do these right um and then but I told him I was like dude I don't want to just learn tactics like I'm not here to learn technique I'll learn just enough technique to make the session worth it I was like I was like you know that video I was like the I want the sweat that they were breaking I want the way that they were breaking that sweat a competitive sweat is what I'm looking for and then he he hits me with this he goes yeah I didn't watch the video but I I got an idea what you want I was like bro there's only one thing in that it was one video you don't even watch the video he's like no and uh but at the end we basically like sparred and so for 10 minutes we just like fought and it was amazing my brother-in-law came so uh long time this is the Pod no brother Aaron he he was there Aaron he kind of like vouched or not vouch but he kind of checked the guy out uh no not that he checked the guy out he was just like my sparring partner to do the thing dude I'm reading this is so funny you're bringing this up this morning you know I listened to like three audio books a week this because I go I like walking why why you know I like walking and uh the book that I'm listening to now is called when violence is the answer and far [Laughter] and the premises is that basically like violence is rarely the answer but when it is it's the only answer and when it is the only answer you want to act fast and as violently as possible and uh it just tells like stories and like he's like I'm not teaching you tactics well we're gonna talk principles and that the whole book is basically like when you have to be violent you want to annihilate them as fast as possible and take their mind completely out of the equation because like it's like if you ever given like punched in the balls you're like oh I can't fight like there's nothing I can think about right right or imagine like being in a fight and like just having your elbow broken you know what I mean you're like I can't do anything right now like I don't even want to think about this versus like punch in the face sometimes you could still like anyway it's so funny you're doing this now because I'll have to give you the cliff notes of when violence is the answer as soon as I dig deeper into it anyways it was an amazing workout and I think my takeaway is uh Zuck and his inner so Zuck went on Joe Rogan he was talking about it and Joe's like you're doing MMA now and he's like yeah you know uh I just whatever he gives some reason for starting he goes he goes it's not like why are you doing MMA it's more he's like now that I'm doing it I'm like why have I not been doing this my whole life because this is it's clearly the best and he says it like it's such a you know computer nerd sort of way where it's like I've found the best workout right like it's like in the office what is the best bear there is a best bear so that's how he was saying it and I was like um yeah exactly false Eminem is the best bear and so that's how I that's not when he said that I was like that's probably right and uh I like the idea of getting competitive sweat in the morning and I told the guy I go look I'm gonna sit at my keyboard all day after this but like if I could start the day with kind of like a this like very intense can't think about anything else type of workout right like extreme focus is required my mind is not going to be drifting around thinking about the to-do list and about this and about that my email no I'm gonna be locked into this it's a very primal thing I'm gonna break it huge sweat and then I can go on with my day and everything else in my day I will have uh it'll be much easier I know I'm preaching the choir with you but I I feel like that's been my uh my realization with it so I wanna and I actually I wanted to spend 10 minutes and bring this topic up because you sent me this gym picture and your gym looked sick and I and like two years ago or a year and a half ago you saw mine and you're like I'm gonna get one and you got one and it looks awesome and then like four years ago maybe you weren't in the best of shape and you've made a big difference and so have I in terms of fitness and I was thinking I saw this guy he's a picture of a 71 year old his name's Mark he started Primal or uh Primal kitchen I think it's called and it's like a sauce business that I love but he's 71 years old and he shared this picture of him and he just looks great he's not like huge muscle guy but he's like really fit ABS looks awesome and I realized this is the point of business like with the point of business and money is like hey there's like some practical reasons so providing for your your family two it's fun and fulfilling but three like the point is like to live a really long and good life and the really the best way to do that money is maybe number two number one is just like being fit and I wanted to spend 10 minutes talking about my personal well I was like what do engineers say they say like Tech stack marketing sack let's talk about our body stack our pack stack and I wanted to run run through all the things that I'm currently doing and I would put myself in the category of a weekend warrior meaning I don't have like formal education on this but I do listen to podcasts and I read books and I'm like self-educated which means you know like I'm a b maybe or not not an expert but uh I I try to read and learn and teach myself okay great go for it all right so let me walk through so what I do uh and then I want and I'll go first and then you could go because I know you didn't prepare so you can kind of like think about it as I do it so what I do I do four four days a week of strength training and then the other three days cardio those are usually lifting weights or body weight uh stuff so that you're working out every day you're doing seven days or you take a rest day some days you do two I do I do every single day the day that I want to rest is uh I'll just go for like a 15 000 step walk which is like a two hour walk um that's that's usually rust and then I sleep from 11 to seven and right now I'm around 11 or 12 body fat with and I have a background in in athletics so I'm not like a complete Noob but I basically just learned all about this in the last like six seven years I I used to just do what I was told now I kind of know why I'm doing what I'm told and my goals with with healthy eating and working out is basically uh three things one live a long and healthy life two look good naked and three uh like achieve certain like fun goals like running a certain race hitting a certain body fat percentage lifting a certain amount of weight just fun stuff but that's really the simple stuff two people don't admit that it's I just want to look good naked you know what I mean that sounds weird that's not weird you have to say that's not weird might be a little weird look I'm just saying what people think I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better so all right here's the products that I use for I spent 299 dollars a month 300 a month and I have a trainer at Central athlete uh it's a place in Austin I have an app they just tell me exactly what to do and if I have questions or an injury or I'm traveling I text my trainer Jesse and I say traveling let's adapt this workout and then we meet once a month to say all right here's the goals for the next month let's try and do this here's my goals for next year let's work backwards uh the second thing I do is I pay 600 a month for a daily call from a nutritionist with my body tutor soon I'm gonna switch to the 200 a month plan and that's going to be a once a week call I think but I spend 600 a month and basically I have someone calling me every day saying what's the plan today for your diet um let's work backwards from where you want to go whatever it's a 15 minute call the third thing is I spent around three thousand to five thousand dollars upfront cost and I built a home gym maybe it could have been 2500 but I think it was probably 3 500. uh the second thing or the the another thing is I do blood work so two to three times a year I spend on average 200 to 300 and I get I do inside tracker it's just a fun way to track your blood uh and uh and see like where you are and see if you can improve things that were not so great the the time before the next thing is I get massage massages one to two days a week at this place called run lab in Austin which basically just I have a history of calf injuries and so they massage my calf and it's covered by insurance so I pay I only pay about 20 bucks each time I go and then I do a subscription to active have you heard of active yeah it's like an audio workout thing yeah I pay a hundred dollars a year for that and so whenever I'm traveling and I need to do a body body weight workout like I did this weekend I say I want to do a 60 Minute Body Weight Workout and it's like a trainer in your ears and I find that to be fun uh the next thing is I do my fitness pal I track everything I eat and I spend 60 bucks a year on that and then I spend 100 a year for fit fitive it's called it's an whenever I do cardio I always try to keep my heart right right at like 145 beats per minute if I'm doing like a long cardio workout because that's like perfect like I think it's zone three zone two it's one of the zones that I want to like stay in uh and then I basically subscribe to Pandora I'm like the only guy ever who pays money for Pandora so I I paid money for Pandora Spotify YouTube and Audible and I listen to all those when I work out because I love doing that next I have zero budget for Whole Foods and healthy foods whatever I see and I want I get I don't question the price I just think I'm doing it no matter what and then finally I will probably spend around a thousand dollars a year on equipment so I have lifting shoes I have like a lifting belt I replace my running shoes consistently and I buy any type of equipment that I need I always uh I buy it and then finally I listen to Nick bear you know who that is remember that rip dude yeah he came on the Pod yeah he's amazing So I listened to his podcast and I listen to Mind Body Pump that's another one of my favorite Fitness podcasts and then I just follow tons of rip dudes on Instagram and you know they say you're the average of the five people you hang out with most I feel like I'm the average of like the 50 followers that I follow on Instagram so I'm just constantly like seeing like ripped dudes and like people running far and running fast I get that on Instagram so that's all my equipment I'm gonna wrap it up with here's the rules that I basically have for my fitness and my health so I always have a goal with a deadline meaning like next year my goal is going to be to run a 100 mile race this year was to hit body fat percentage so I always have a goal number two I always hire coaches if there's anything I want to learn last year I learned boxing I had a boxing coach this year I wanted to get my nutrition right I had a nutritionist I always hire a coach no matter what finally or the third one no processed foods and no sugar unless it's planned and and uh it's intentional so like I know like two weeks three weeks in advance this is a special occasion I'm on a Splurge there I don't fret over money if it makes me healthier and finally I'm not trying to be perfect I'm just trying to be the least bad most of the time and intentional about when uh I am gonna like Splurge so those that's basically my whole thing a few things in the future that I want something what does that add up to the dollar amounts that you just mentioned did you sum it up by any chance uh well so the I didn't have the exact cost in my home gym because I spent about three grand up front and then I've been like buying stuff as I've gone yeah let's call it five let's call it five grand we'll call it five then I would say I spend around fifteen thousand dollars a year and um you know like LeBron James has this like this famous stat where it's like a million dollars a year yeah he's like I spent a million dollars a year on my body and when that first came out other athletes were like whoa uh you know like other NBA guys were like I don't spend anywhere near that but you know you look at LeBron he's sort of like the Pinnacle athlete in terms of physical fitness even athletes and other sports I've heard NFL's guys reference that I've met NFL guys and they talk about yeah LeBron said he spent this that that got me thinking what am I spending on why am I not investing in my body Conor McGregor has said that he goes I heard LeBron James says he spends a million dollars a year I'm thinking I didn't spend anything he's like and so then he started like he hired it he hired like full-time staff and people and started doing the whole thing and so I think that was funny how that one person saying that um you know like triggered a kind of a chain reaction and I actually think it's smart that you're sharing this because it's not our typical thing we talk about on the Pod uh we'll joke around about it but it's not like a usual segment on the Pod but I think it is a big part of being an entrepreneur and a Founder is like dude that founder 15 is real that founder for me it was the founder 45 that was real dude I gained so much weight stressing out eating wrong sleeping shitty uh you know not work not working out because I didn't have time and that really costs you and so I think it's great that you uh that you decided to do the second and we didn't even talk about it well oh yeah yeah the other thing so we didn't even talk about mental health stuff so the mental health stuff like I try to like I just like I write every morning and it's not like dear Journal typically it's like here's what I want to get done today like I'm pretty bummed about this this and this but I'm very thankful for this so like that's my version of writing um and then like obviously like lots of therapy so those like my mental health things but all right last thing the things I want to try so one an Executive Health checkup so basically you spend some number between five and 20 grand a year or 20 grand in one turn and you go for three days to a Mayo Clinic and they just do all type of stuff to you I'm not convinced that it's entirely needed but I I test everything just mostly for fun number 2 a concierge doctor have you ever had one of those briefly I had a yeah I had a concierge doctor I had a kind of amazing yes I had one when I was one time I got really sick with lime and my face like broke uh I had like Bell's Palsy it was it was horrible so I spent 25 Grand I had a concierge doctor a doctor on call and that was awesome I want to get one of those the third thing skin stuff do you do anything for your skin like wear sunscreen no I don't do I I dude I I haven't honestly I haven't washed my face in like six years I might be a white guy you know underneath all this this might just be sit down here like people are like I want to face wash these I was like yeah my face gets wet during the shower gets wet that's that's the wash bro like there's not there's not a routine there's never left over on the towel when I wipe my face off and dried off it's the soap that I'm using dude I don't know if it's a woman thing or if it's a black woman thing because my wife like knows everything about like skin care she's like you got to use this then you gotta do this you gotta do this and I'm like dude that's just way too complicated and I'm doing any of that I'm just gonna use the hand soap but basically uh I have to use sunscreen she's telling me so I want to start doing some some skin stuff and then the last thing dude I want to do a five day fast I was pretty inspired by John Lee Dumas that's like on my bucket list it's a five day faster those are some of the things I want to try but that's my that's my body stack that's great have you heard by the way have you heard how have you heard of young people instead of saying um how many people have you slept with they say what's your body count that's so funny it's so funny he's catching bodies that's right came up with this name here's my body stack some young woman raised her hand and she goes hey teacher what's your body count and I think I've seen it in months um all right so my buddy is uh going through a company acquisition and he's like oh yeah you know I'm gonna have to earn it out there blah blah and I told him I said you know when we got acquired I did one thing really well I go I wrote down I was like all right I know what this year is all about um it's this acquisition and I know this could go many ways I talked to a bunch of people who got Acquired and for some of them they just got really depressed they were bored at the acquiring company for some people they had a great time some people it was just sort of like ah dude I don't even remember just sort of like yeah you know whatever I don't know that was years ago and I honestly I was just kind of a zombie well I was on autopilot I don't really I didn't really have much intention behind how I spent that year so I said all right I'm gonna have some intent so I wrote this document and I'm going to read part of it to you uh you tell me when this gets boring we'll switch it but I go my 2019 mindsets this is 2019 we got acquired by by twitch where'd you write this you said Google Docs and um at the top I wrote I wrote a quote time is what we want the most but we use the worst I said this document is a chance to think about how I want to spend the next year of my life time is the most precious resource here's how I'm going to invest it I go number one get fit enjoyably number two earn and learn and number three become a great person like Ramon those are my three sections our buddy Ramon is uh is the honoree so on the get fit enjoyably I go every year I'm getting fatter Less Mobile and I shorten my lifespan this is a bad trajectory I need to invest now or I'm gonna pay like I'm gonna pay later hell I'm paying right now and I go I think getting fit means dropping to 185 pounds feeling athletic and the word enjoyably is really important every time I've tried this in the past I start I get motivated I take some action get some results but it's hard I don't really like it so I slip up and eventually give up all together three weeks what did you weigh then like 230 220 225 something like that I said three weeks later I'm back on my couch and my boxers eating chips and queso again this cycle is bad long story short willpower is not the not the fuel to use if I use a willpower I fail instead I'm going to find a way to do this uh in a way that's enjoyable because when I like it I'll do it um so that means I got to figure out foods that are clean that I actually like I got to figure out exercise that's good that I actually look forward to doing here's what winning looks like I'm 185 pounds this is what I run at the time I got nowhere close to this 105 pounds by the end of 2020 and with a new set of exercise and eating habits that I enjoy and I'm not forcing myself to maintain all right so that was the the first part a little a little letter to myself I I'm proud of reading this I was like you know I did not hit that goal I'm not 185 even now I've probably 2 12 213 so it doesn't even sound like much 10 pounds but it was but I probably yeah it's a way to double that in terms of yeah muscle mass composition versus body fat dude in 185 for you A lot of people don't realize this but you're six one you think you're are you above someone yeah like you're that 185 would be pretty small yeah so I don't know I picked a number but like specifics aside I think I got the idea right and I don't want to look back so at that time I was working out zero times a week I was eating like dog [ __ ] and I was I really didn't have even a game plan and in fact I actually had very little uh evidence that like this was doable for some people if you've been in great shape before you always have that you've got that in your back pocket if I have done this before imagine never having done it right like never I never saw an app it was the Loch Ness monster of my body it was like where where is this thing and so that was where I was at now the two things that worked for me so in terms of your text in terms of your body stack I share two things uh but I do everything else differently so I also get a coach for everything that I'm doing so I have a personal trainer who I talk about a bunch I have a nutrition I use the same once you told me about my body tutor I do the 200 a month plan where I text her every day you dig it what I'm eating I dig it yeah I've I'm not the most consistent with it like I will forget to update it at night I'll update it later but like whatever just a little late um and um uh yeah so I do the coach thing that was really really important and like I was saying with the MMA thing same thing oh I want to do this let me get a coach and a coach is not because you don't know how to do it it's because it's like the real way to commit to doing it and for me I was like even better I need somebody to show up at my house so I looked at what are the things that trip me up I was like it's not like I'm going to the gym and doing a crappy workout I'm just not going to the gym and so I was like I need to find a way to go to the gym I was like all right well what if the gym came to me so I saw your home gym I got inspired I was like dude what's the flooring you used what's this that you bought what's this I asked you for every little piece and it was way easier than you thought wasn't it oh dude I copied the exact same thing I bought the same rubber band it won a lot of stuff it wasn't a lot of stuff and you know a few kettlebells this that great got it um so got a home gym and then I got a trainer to come to my house now obviously this is a luxury not everybody can afford to do this but hey that's the point of this show it's about like you know Building Wealth and then figuring out how to use it and so this is this is how to use it um secondly was nutrition so okay the coaching thing I'm right on board with you mine was remove friction find the places that like the Habit slips up and just literally try to get rid of that step so that was bringing the gym to me the last piece was basically like what is the what is the version of this I'm gonna enjoy so I had to find a trainer who I Vibe with who I actually like hanging out with them um like the conversation is fun it's not just that they're good at their job and secondly like we do workouts that are fun for me sometimes we'll just he'll come over and he'll be like let's go play basketball we'll just go to 24 Hour Fitness we'll play pick up basketball it's kind of weird it's like dude you're paying this trainer 100 to go play pick up basketball with you it's like yeah I'm actually paying for me to exercise regularly and get in great shape I'm not paying for a specific hour block of time or a specific like skill set know-how and so same thing MMA looks fun all right I'm gonna do MMA um we do training that's like about Mobility sometimes or very simple things like I'll tell them like look I told him very simple he's like what are your goals and I think for every other client of his their goals are like I want to lose weight I got a wedding coming up I gotta you know I want to look good with my shirt off blah blah blah you know some [ __ ] like that I was like when I stand up from sitting I feel like an old man I was like I don't get up like an athletic person so that's my first goal I want to be able to like we do this exercise on the ground and you say all right let's get up let's go over here I don't wanna I don't want that to be like a 18-point turn like I need to just like get up not like oh yep come in hold on this like straight I gotta get on my elbow then my knee they might put both hands on the ground too like you know tripod then I'm up like that's that's how I was moving honestly and I was like same thing when I run I was like I don't know if I run right I think my gate is all messed up and so we spent a lot of time literally fixing my walking gate or my sitting posture or you know like my habits for the morning of how to get loose those things matter to me so I would suggest also like don't make your goals the cliche think about what actually would feel good as maybe like a middle step in between you and being just like absolutely ripped because that became very motivating to me and I started to see results and all those little things first oh I'm smoother when I run I'm smoother when I walk I get up more smoothly I can Crouch down in an easier way and play with my kids that was like I mean I could just sit in a squat like those things were really important and I had to find somebody who knew how to who knew how to train in a functional way like that not just all right let's do you know three sets of 12 uh with a you know this heavy weight that's it and do you set time aside for like working out is it like everyday day at this time every day at the same time he shows up at my house I'm not going to be rude and leave him waiting I have to drop what I'm doing and I go do it and that's it and that's the whole thing so we do it at three uh 3 P.M um but it doesn't it could be any time I actually prefer to move it to the morning now but like whatever we do three at the moment dude I don't like Andrew Tate that much because I think he says some silly stuff but he says a lot of interesting stuff that I agree with and one of the things that he said that I've I've been obsessing over he goes I'm not motivated I'm disciplined and I thought that's beautiful that's a that's a really that's a beautiful idea and that has definitely that is definitely key to achieving a lot of goals whether it's work or uh Fitness it's just like no I just like I don't I I remember when I was starting my business at like two o'clock people would call I'm like hey let's go hang out I'm like dude I gotta work and they're like what are you talking about you're the boss you can do anything you want I'm like it's a and I remember I was like 23 and I would say it's a school night you know I can't go out of school night uh you know like we had these rules I was like bro I work I get there at eight and I work until six usually like I then I go to dinner like I can't do these things and I remember thinking uh I'm not motivated to do this but I'm happy that I have this routine because this is discipline whether I kind of like forced myself to do it same with Fitness same with anything it's like motivation is a really good way to get started but it's not a not the best way to maintain discipline and you can the cool thing about discipline is you can kind of force yourself into it like you like you set these things up like this guy all you did was told this dude to show up and now you're like [ __ ] I gotta do it I heard this great quote on discipline because I always thought about discipline like force being able to force yourself to do something even if you don't want to do it and that's true that does happen but that's not the definition and somebody said this beautifully they go discipline is just remembering what you really want because like in the moment you want to just sit down and rest or you just want to chill you just want to eat that bag of chips whatever but it's like okay that is something I want but what do I really want and if you remember what you really want then you'll go do that thing you'll go do the things that vote towards that outcome versus this outcome and so discipline is just remembering what you really want it felt a lot better than like that that's not that's something I wanted to do versus discipline being I forced myself to do it even when I don't want to do it appealing to me yeah it goes away like the when you wake up in the morning and you're sore yeah the the other things I say are the things I do differently than you is um I don't set the specific timeline deadlines so which is crazy to me because like in business of course I do that I will never set a goal without a timeline I was like when I'm trying to do it by if and if anyone on my team tries to do that I don't let them do it with Fitness I looked at it differently I go look I've tried that before I've tried to say I'm going to lose this by this day my trainer kind of taught me he was just like look all right how old are you and I was like uh at the time it was 32 or something like that he's like all right 32 cool so you've had 32 years to build up these habits and now you're looking for a six week you know a six week revamp like oh you need this goal done in six weeks or six months or he's like the way I look at it you spent 32 years getting here maybe it's going to take a little while to get there and that's okay right like hey what's another year you know what's what's a year or two of working at this when you spent 30 doing it the wrong way can we spend a few doing it the right way um and and he was sort of like what I don't want is you work out and blah blah then you uh you go and you doordash to Taco Bell now you're feeling guilty and you're eating the wrong thing because if you're gonna eat it eat it and enjoy it don't bring the guilt into it don't bring the shame don't don't feel bad that you're now it's a setback and have this mental baggage about how bad it's gonna be he's like just remember when you're the dude who you like who you're becoming you could eat Taco Bell it's not even gonna mess with you he said I could eat it I could eat Taco Bell every day this week I won't change a thing lift up his shirt still there right and he's like that's who you're becoming and so you just need to like focus on that and don't don't like go through this emotional up and down and up and down and I'm so proud of myself for doing it good one day and then I hate myself for for missing it the next day and I feel guilty like uh just like that's one way you could do this but like how about we just don't do it that way and so I've gone very much the the tortoise not the hair route with this which is just like cool I'm gonna put no no timelines on this I'm gonna put no I'm gonna make it where it's unfailable my only goal is to rebuild my habits of eating and exercise to be healthy and I don't care how long that takes I'm gonna do it and um and there's no setbacks everything is progress compared to how I was before even how I was a month ago and so that that has also helped me and is a very strange thing because I've never ever chased a goal doing it this way I've never let myself just do it this like infinite game style where it's like yep there's no clock you're just trying to be better today than you were yesterday and like it's okay you know even if you do something that's wrong you learn something in that process too it's all right uh you know this pat on the back style I've never never tried it but this is the first time so in other news we're going to be launching guy next door fitness plan yeah dude we should totally do that attainable attainable Fitness [Laughter] hot enough yeah we're gonna go Midwest seven a New York six yeah that's amazing [Music] questions [Music]

so he lives in India and he is a oneman company that makes something between 15 and $30 million selling simple plugins for Google Docs if you if you have $20 million a year of income that is a huge unheard of [Music] son all right we live what's going on all right I got a couple interesting things for you um I'm going to start with this oneman company so I got a I saw a tweet I got tagged in a tweet a bunch of times same the exact same one and I think we should talk about this because this is very cool is it the Google plug-in guy yes yes so all right so this guy John Davids uh tweeted out a great thread and his handle is real real John David So shout out to him for doing this and he's basically like dude I discovered this guy and let me just tell you some things about this guy so how funny is it that something like this happens and I I know exactly what you're talking about because we I got DM the amount the same people probably dm'd me well that's when you know you're doing a good job when people see something and they think of you um I tweeted this out I go people think you create content like a podcast or a YouTube channel to become well-known right oh you want fame you want to become well-known and some people want that and there is some benefits to that but that's not my goal with this stuff my goal is to be known well which means people know you really well that means when they see something they'll know to send it to you they'll show it to you they'll share it with you they'll invest it they'll tell you to come invest in this deal with them when you're known well it's because you've put your brain out there on blast people know how you think and so when they see something that they know you'll love they immediately think of you and they come share it with you and so I would say the even if you create content and you're never famous it never takes off and to become well- known you will become known well and that alone is a big enough benefit to justify uh creating content all right anyway so we were known well because these uh a bunch of people tagged Us in this this guy so this guy uh what is his name so his name is AIT agerwal so he lives in India and he is a oneman company that makes something between 15 and $30 million selling simple plugins for Google Docs and Google Drive and the Google the G Suite of apps this is crazy high that that that is that is that is sh dude making if you if you have $20 million a year of income that's like the equivalent of I would have to think about this and maybe someone who's thought about this is going to say I'm an idiot and I'm getting it wrong but making $20 million a year in income is probably the same as being worth like $500 million uh lifestyle wise it definitely is like it's a huge that is a huge unheard of sum so this guy basically he's a he goes to IIT which is like the Harvard of of India he's a computer science guy he moves back to his hometown so he goes to the big city comes back to his hometown and in 2004 he starts off as like a tech blogger he's just writing tips and tricks on how to use gep and he creates a Gmail plug-in that lets you do what's called a mail merge and mail merge is basically like you want to email a 100 people the same thing but not in one group email and not even as a BCC because you want to customize some component I'm a customer of this product and so he created a plugin that just let you do that in Gmail because there's a lot of services that will let you do that outside of Gmail but like a lot of people just want to run it inside their inbox and not like use some third party app to send send emails so he creates this thing and that's I think his biggest hit but he just starts writing go like you know how- to guides on his website his website's called digital inspiration and so it'll be like you know how to calculate the percentage score in a Google form how teachers can email your parents the uh email parents using Google forms or something like that and it's free but then he has like a paid tier $39 a year $79 a year to get rid of like The Branding and stuff like that email you know go past a limit of emails something something like that and so his main mail merge thing has been downloaded 7 and a half million times and so if you assume like a you know 5% conversion rate to paid he's doing 1.5 million in a just off of that one plugin and he's got 13 more plugins so he's got like this whole set of things he's got this document manag management app called document studio and it lets you create documents certificates invoices using Google Sheets and it's $79 million a year 6 million downloads he's got a notification app $49 a year he's got 10 million downloads he's got a YouTube app8 million downloads and then he creates one-off apps for big companies like Airbus LinkedIn Disney even the US Embassy has paid this guy to create custom Gite things just for them like if you kind of blend this all together you start doing some estimates like I I I dm' the guy I was like hey can you confirm what the numbers I don't want to say the wrong number but I'm going to tell the story on the Pod he didn't he didn't reply yet but he um it's pretty safe to say this guy's doing more than 10 million a year and it could be as high as 2530 million if you're like really aggressive with how much he's getting from the Enterprise customers and um but somewhere between 10 and I'd say 25 million is is a fairly safe bet how does he have and and I saw building simple useful things he had 100,000 followers on Instagram is he famous for some reason like what what's CU a guy like this seems under the radar I think his Blog has a good amount of uh traffic so I'm going to go open up his blog yeah so his blog gets about 150,000 hits a month uh visitors a month and so I think he probably just says hey this is made by me and then people go follow him or something what's the uh tax rate in India do you know is it comparable to America or is it way worse or way better what I don't know but I I remember hearing at one point that only 2% of the Indian population paid taxes really like the majority of the population just simply didn't pay taxes this is a big problem in India cuz they're not banked either so it's like there's no way to track anything cash economy you don't have a bank account it's like like not exist taxes no not for me yeah it's optional uh but I think that might have changed this was like 10 years ago I heard that stat and I was like what the hell uh so I'm sure that's changed over time dude what a baller you know this is so great I think that the reason it's great is because it kind of breaks your frame on what's possible because he's like when you're in Google Docs there's so many times where I'm like man I wish I just do this one thing there just this one very very specific thing and I would never think this should be a product because I'm like it's just me experiencing one tiny issue that if I learned how to program or learned how to do like uh this other thing it would work perfectly fine and this little you know thing is only going to save me 5 minutes it's not a big deal but this is a good example of that um that's sick I use some of his products they're really good by the way now that the paying rate I think is 6% of the population file the tax return in uh when was this this was 2020 so you think wow well give for this guy hopefully he's one of the 94% even if he is dude if you have like a million doar in India like you're a king um you know you don't need that much money to just ball out in small towns in India like you are set well I like this guy what's the uh who's Carl Allen all right this is my Billy of the week [Applause] [Music] million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion [Music] dollar this story is kind of incredible also came to me from a u a Twitter DM um the guy's name is kind of like hard to it's not like his real name I want to give him credit but like you know I don't know what to what to call them his his his uh Twitter handle is Euro repe re PE so Euro repe he goes I got a billy of the week for you Carl Allen he goes sold a garbage bag company for 4 this one too this is so funny I got the exact same one now a full-time treasure hunter in the Bahamas okay so who is this guy you know like the I don't know if you watch Game of Thrones but in Game of Thrones it's like um A Song of Ice and Fire this is a song of garbage and treasure this is this guy basically it's kind of an insane story I it's very hard to even find information about this guy I don't know if you looked him up but a lot the only like they didn't cover his business they covered the fact that he was buying like a huge yacht which is a great all it's about his yacht yeah so so all right so so here's what I do know all right so Carl Allen he basically he starts off working at this company called Heritage bag and Heritage bag makes plastic trash bags so like they do it not just like normal trash bags but like for medical waste or like Hospital waste but they'll make like anything that's like uh you know ice bucket liners uh you know like they'll make takeout boxes anything that's like mass production manufacturing for for like this really core utility very similar to like eggcartons.com the the story that we told on the Pod before and so medical waste bags is is their thing he actually started off just like working there he wor kind of like it's like one of those stories where he worked his way up from the mail room he had like one job then he climbed up then he got into business development then became the Director of Business Development then eventually becomes the CEO and eventually he buys the company and I don't know how he pulled this off I tried to find this I could not find how this employee ended up owning the company but he did he ends up owning the company and it's a a boring business based in Dallas you know selling trash bags and he sells it for something like 300 or $400 million to I think a private Equity Firm so they've they've got 800 employees they've been around for 30 40 years something like that and they sell and um and so they you know they do this and then he's like all right what do I do with my life now and at the age of 12 he had visited the Bahamas and he was like wow I love the Bahamas this is just a magical place he always had this idea and so he he looks at this place that um this island and he calls up the owner and he's like hey um you know are you would you ever be interested in selling they're like no we've been asked before we won't sell this thing it's a 92-year old woman she's like no we won't sell it to some big Corporation that's just going to ruin it he goes no no no ma'am I'm not a big Corporation I'm a family guy I'm a family own I'm just a rich guy I'm just a guy with a handful of yachts and I need a place to park them and basically he he convinces this woman to sell they sell 50 years after they had originally bought it he buys this island and he turns it into like his own little fishing boating and exploring place so he's got now three parts of his business he's got philanthropy he's got his family office where he invests and now he's got his Island business his yachting business is fishing business and he owns a handful of Yachts he's got like 1ot yacht an 80 foot yacht he calls it an exploration business well he's got his yeah he's got his exploration business but I think he also calls his investing his exploration business I don't know it's a little confusing but Allen expiration I think is is one of them but either way go to his YouTube channel did you watch any of his YouTube videos sick yeah the GU the guy's amazing let me tell you a story about a young man with a dream a dream of sailing the sea living life with the ones he loves discovering all the world has to offer a dream of [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] exploration it only has 40 41,000 views 41,000 views and it's basically his channel where he is he believes that there are billions of dollars of Lost Treasures in the sea he's like there have been 3 million shipwrecks he's like and when something is Lost at Sea it's not lost it's just at the bottom like he's like it's still there it didn't go anywhere it's still there and we just have to go find it and he did this because he met some guy who was a treasure hunter who had made millions of dollars finding Treasures in the ocean and he was fascinated by this guy and he's like let's do this I want to do this and so he started doing this and he's looking for like these Treasures where it's like King Phillip from Spain had this like you know Armada coming over and it got lost at sea back in the whatever you know the year 1200 or whatever and he's like we got to go find that because there were these like crazy gold things and whatever and he wants to create a museum of the things that he finds and he's found a bunch of treasures he's found this long gold chain he's found like all kinds of stuff down there and he puts it in his little Museum on his island in the Bahamas and it's just like a and it's a public it's a private island I meaning he owns it but he keeps it open to the public it's not like nobody can come and so people can come they can visit they can park their boats there all that stuff so isn't this kind of amazing like what a dope life this guy is living it's this is amazing for a couple different reasons one it's so fun to give in to these obsessions so you say like well what's the point of spending your life looking for Treasure it's like cuz it's sick cuz it's awesome right like it's exciting that's an exciting chase you should do that and it is actually I'm sure there's some like historical value uh I actually had a guy send me a pitch deck on investing in his like hunt and I was like no I'm not even going to way yeah I was like not not a chance like I I don't know anything about this this sounds like this of course this sounds intoxicating and I love it but like I I have to avoid that but number two I've been thinking about this phrase um make the make 12-year-old me make 12-year-old Sam proud and cuz I remember like making some money and I remember someone being like and I like was Fring over like doing one thing or the other thing and it was an awesome thing but I was like it cost too much and someone's like yeah but it's sick like it's awesome like what what like you know if when you were 12 this is what you always wanted to do and I'm like you're right why am I being such a boner I should just do this thing and and now like I do think that's a good life motto which is like whatever 12-year-old you wanted not all things but some things you got to give into those indulgences and this guy is awesome I'm a big fan of well we get this question a lot oh what would you go back and tell your 20-year-old self right if you were 21 again what advice would you give your 21y old self and you hate that question I know you I hate that question because I say no they say if you had to start over again what would you do and I'd be like I would have done the same thing because that's what I'm skilled at that's what I'm good at you you want you want me to give you an easy answer like I I don't know what you're good at right and so you're like that's the question people always ask but I I'm with you I I want the opposite which is what advice would your 21-year-old self give you CU it's very easy to lose the plot the older you get the more responsible you get the more um practical you get the more like you get lower energy less risk all that stuff and there's like a version of you that's like I don't know if it's 12-year-old or the 21-year old but in either case that like the goal was to have the most fun and do awesome things and it wasn't thinking about like how to save for retirement that's not that wasn't on your mind back then and so I think that for most people the risk is not that they're playing life too risky it's that they're playing life way too safe and that the 12-year-old VI or the 21-year-old view you would look at yourself and be like oh man I grew up and I got kind of lame oh damn like I'm just kind of like this out of shape guy who complains a bunch and like you know is like saving money for when they're even older like dude you're already old and so like you know I think that for most people they actually need to go the other way they need to have more fun they need to live more childlike they need to have just more silliness fun adventure in their life and they need to take a little more risk and play less safe um I would say that that is the majority of people and actually people treat it like it's the opposite they think I need to they think that the they think the advice is you need to be responsible you need to play it safer right life needs to be more serious and it's like no actually life needs to be way less serious in my have you ever seen uh that one of the very it's about 10 years old so it was one of the early viral YouTube videos and this this guy he's in his 30 at this point in his 40s he when he was 8 he recorded himself saying hey Jonah what's going on and he he's like as an 8-year-old anticipated that he wanted to make a video in his 30s where he was going to have a conversation with himself and it's you know older and his now uh at the time 30s Jonah having a conversation at Jonah he's like hey what's going on Jonah and he's like are you still playing with this and he like held up a toy and he was like and the older Jonah was like no I'm not and he's clearly sad and the younger Jonah's like because you really love doing this and we love drawing it and we love reading cartoons about this and right now I think I want to grow up and be a cartoonist where I talk about this and the older Jonah is like oh man I I kind of like quit doing that when I didn't have time but I actually still love it and it this video went viral and I believe it kind of kicked off his career where he was able to start making movies and cartoons like he used to be into and uh I when I watch that video I get inspired I'm like what would when I was eight like what would you say like whoa you said you were going to do this why aren't you right and I and I actually I don't think the answer is you do what the 12-year-old you wanted to do because maybe 12 12-year-old you just wanted certain dumb things or only knew about certain things but it's more like if I was just explaining this to the 12-year-old me would they nod and be like okay that's dope I didn't know that you know that's crazy but like that makes a lot of like that sounds awesome that sounds fun versus like just do what the 12-year-old wants and I think you're you're absolutely right that like people in general the happiest people are the ones who are most childlike what are the traits of of a child a a child is generally very curious about the world they don't just like think that they know it all right um a child is generally like looking to have fun they're looking to play not just work and grind right like you know like this I've never heard a 12-year-old on that grind set you know like TRS are looking to play they're looking to have a blast and like guess what that's what you should be trying to do too and um and so you know everything I think about like if I went back to the to the 13-year-old me and I was like dude this is our wife and they'd be like what it's like yeah like yeah we get to be with her like she she likes me and and he would be like oh dude awesome like this is wow this turned out amazing that would be like something I would brag to my 13-year-old like dude we pulled this like that would be so sick you get to have sex yeah exactly like yeah dude it it [Laughter] happened our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better you want to do this last one uh yeah okay so the last one I wanted to do was an update on Sarah's list okay so for those who are new to the Pod back I don't know how long ago was this like a year ago something only a year ago I was in New York yeah it was a year so let me go look at this video so we did a a video it's on YouTube September SE oh almost exactly September 17th 2021 is September 19th today wow so two you know basically a year to the day um we did this thing 12 startups where stock grants can make you a millionaire and this was inspired by your wife uh Sarah who basically was a self-made millionaire and we say oh how'd she do it did she invent the next big thing did she make this crazy investment that paid off and you're like no she just like worked at good companies and like a good job not she wasn't CEO or CC she was just noral job normal job at a good tech company and like yeah like think about it this way like you know they give you a a job offer that will pay you you know let's say 50k just use round numbers 50k a year in stock compensation so you maybe you make 150 then you get 50 of stock so over four years you got 200k of stock well if that company goes up 5x in value during those four years which many tech companies do it's a million dollars of stock that you got she's self million and a lot of these companies will give you like maybe $100,000 a year in stock and in airbnb's case that I don't know what it went up what I think it probably went up five or six times I don't remember and your wife had done this at Facebook she worked at Facebook she worked at Airbnb did she work at another one or were those were the she worked at everlane but I don't think they've had an exit yet and so uh she had done this and I was just like kind of and it's also like dude those were obvious it's not like she was like oh she was one of the first 10 employees at Airbnb it's like no she joined and Airbnb had how many employees it was like hundreds if not thousands right no it was I I think it was either 900 or a thousand it was six years ago maybe so they they weren't new and do you remember the valuation at that time like roughly it was I think it was 18 I think it was 18 billion and when they ipoed at the peak I think it was worth 110 million okay yeah 100 billion so so let's say 5x there um at that Peak and so anyway so she had done this and I just thought that was amazing I thought this is like the most under reported story in like you know podcast or Tech news orter you're missing talk about this you're missing one of the big Parts was the reason it's underreported is it's not that unique you know there's thousands of people who work here there's hundreds of thousands of people who collectively work at maybe it's Millions actually millions of people who work these types of gigs by the way she's not a programmer either she's not like an engineer there's not like some barrier that you needed oh I can't do it I don't know how to code I can't work at a tech company no she's a non-technical person she's skilled but she's non-technical at a tech company and so anyways we were like we basically made a list called Sarah's list which was what are the what are the Dozen companies that we would bet on today that we think if if you just went you got that job you got that stock package that's worth let's say A4 million dollars today that that can Forex it could turn into a million dollars over your fouryear vest so are we going to recap this and see how we did yes so I have the numbers I have the numbers here so I'm going to read you the companies and then I'm going to read you uh where we were right where we were wrong cuz one of the companies on here just got acquired so the reason this came up was figma just got Acquired and figma was on our list it was number seven on our list they weren't in order it was just like one of the ones we listed and figma got acquired just now for $20 billion and when we had done the the thing figma was at 2 billion so that was a 10x was it there yeah figma was at 2 billion later like uh L like 12 months later it got valued at um uh or sorry in between it had also gotten valued at 10 billion so it kind of depends on the timing but when we did the Pod the last known valuation was two billion I believe wow and so um that was their series D and so so yeah so basically that's a 10x from where we were at so you go get that $200,000 uh you know stock package you're now sitting on yeah it invest over four years so two a $200,000 stock package is $50,000 a year which is incredibly reasonable for that's like a yeah more like an entry level very Junior position there whereas you can get 100K a year so you might have had 400k in total stock that'd be 4 million that you're sitting on four it's so hard to make $4 million in cash like it is not that easy and this is one of the like you know easier ways to do it so um so I think that's kind of underrated all right so let me give you the companies on the list we had flexport zapier Unis Swap and derill the defense company repet the developer tools company or the developer um company air table figma ripling open store Fair NEX health and one trust okay so those are the companies now I'm going to read you where they were at and where they're where they are where they are now um out of the 12 I'll just tell you right now that all but two of them I believe yeah all but two of them are up um and the other two it's just they haven't raised another round so we don't know but there's reason to believe where they might be up one Unis swap might be down just because crypto has like gone down in total value um so Unis swap might be down but uh only zapier and Unis swap are not marked up so already you're up if you're if you're in any of these so is not marked up because they their whole stick is they don't want to raise they're like we bootstrapped we raise this one round of funny we're not raising anymore until we go public exactly so you're still likely up it's just not marked okay so flexport when we had done it it was at 3 billion it's now at 8 billion so almost a 3X markup um okay zapier and unisa we talked about okay andil when we talked about it was a 4.6 billion now it's at 6.6 so not not a huge markup but you're up you know whatever 50% um repet repet when we had done it um when we had talked about it I think the last known valuation at that time was 200 million it raised again at 800 million uh I invested in that round so I and and so I know that it's actually worth more today because I get emails and phone calls from these groups that are trying to buy my repet stock they're like hey we are willing to buy $5 million up to $5 million of your repet stock and so I think that repet is probably valued today on the open market more than 800 million but that's last one they they known at so at least a 4X markup likely more like 8X is my guess on repet um air table air table was at 2 billion when we did it 2.3 it's now at 11 so a 5x 5x jump on on on air table um figma we just talked about two billion now got bought for 20 so 10x um Rippling Rippling was six billion when we talked about it it's now at 11 so double open store was 250 million when we talked about and that was the only exception it was the one that was lowest when we talked about it as as a valuation it's now at $750 million what was it when we started 250 250 to 750 wow 750 um fair fair was at 7 billion it's now at 12.5 so a little under double um next Health was at 400 million now it's at a billion so a little more than double two and a half X and one trust was at 2.7 billion now at 5 billion uh 5.3 billion so another another 2x pretty good we did good yeah all right good where's my Larry David clip pretty good it's pretty pretty pretty pretty good pretty good keep in mind we made these predictions at the beginning of like the best tech bull market not of all time but a really good one so a lot of these valuations could be completely nonsense you know like at that time we could have thrown a dart board and picked 10 random startups and the likelihood that they would rais is and and now it's down but the valuations I'm giving you are The Afters are all 2022 valuations wow all right so a few takeaways one exponential growth hard to completely understand like thinking like can this two or three or 4X for most people myself included it's a it's an exercise to understand what that read read the figma read the figma revenue numbers you have those right I I don't know if I can well they're public they're publicly available they're out when this deal came out they came out all right keep talking and I'll find it okay so basically uh you're right exponential growth is is like astounding and so you look at these companies I've talked about this before where um when we were getting acquired we had a chance to get Discord stock and I was like oh Discord is valued at two billion oh it's already at two billion it's like well we we need to believe for for us to take this deal it's like well we need to think that it's going to get over six billion I don't know it's last valuation was 15 billion so even me who's in the in the industry in the space I am a tech investor it's just hard to Fathom these companies becoming worth not just billions but tens of billions not just tens of billions but even up to a 100 billion in value that is just very very hard to Fathom here's fig figma's growth and the reason why this is astounding is because I heard what their valuation was which was 10 billion I thought that is ridiculous I heard these numbers and then I thought huh that's actually not that crazy so in 2017 they started charging customers in 2018 they at 4.1 million in Revenue in 2019 23 million 2020 77 million 2021 100 million and check this out 2022 goal and they're on Pace to hit it $450 million so in the course of six years they went from zero to $450 million in recurring scky sticky Revenue like and their product does everything they they bu look at some of those jumps what what were the first jumps so it goes zero then it goes from zero to what two or four what you say four TW so here's the order four 25 75 and then this sucked 100 and then 450 100 to 450 is astronomical that is huge yeah I think there's the there's like a a thing in SAS that SAS investors look for it's called triple triple double double I don't know if you've seen this but basically they like triple triple double triple tripled well they did more than a triple they did from four to 20 something that's 5x so they did more than a triple then they did 20 20 to 75 25 to 75 or whatevers then then they did a triple so five five triple and then they did double and then they did another double then they did a another 4.5x so it's just kind of insane it's crazy so and obviously help by like you know remote work cuz like figma is basically like a tool for designers and product people to share designs um like you know a designer will send me a mockup I add my comments I can move stuff around I can see their Mouse Moving it's almost like we're working on the same thing together right next to each other even though we're miles and miles apart and U and by the way Amazing Story this is also another teal Fellowship uh win and so it's crazy this guy started this thing when he was 21 years old like 19 20 21 years old and um you know was been building this there was like a 5-year buildup where he they didn't make any Revenue he was just building the product slowly but surely and then got to a private beta and then a public beta and then finally started charging people you know I think the company was founded like 2011 and then it started making money in 2017 even if I had this idea there is no way five years later I'm still doing this idea in the middle of that by the way there was the Ico boom in in crypto in 2017 you know guess where my head would have turned i' have been like oh whoa I should be doing that over there right in between then there's like you know just waves and waves of other interesting exciting sexy things that and he just didn't take his eye off the ball they just kept going kept building and and they won so the two more things that are hard to understand the the first one I said was it's hard to understand exponential growth number two it always seems late so if I bet a lot of reactions if we go and read the comment section was this seems overvalued this is already too big you know there's no meet up left on this bone it always seems too late and that goes back to IAL growth is hard to understand so like if I told you like your home that you're in right now might be worth $10 million in 20 years you'd be like there's no way and you say well that's just like you know 4% growth for the next 20 years and it's already grown 4% for the trailing 50 years like like okay I understand logically but like when you say that number it's quite hard to understand and the last thing which is every startup we named it's not like they are unknown they it's all pretty obvious you if you Googled best startups to work at I bet you six of the 12 that we named we on some type of list um and granted we're not playing with our lives here we're just naming 12 things and we got 10 out of 12 right you know like uh if you're in that 11th or 12th one that might stink but like we're not that smart we're 75s out of 10 in terms of Industry knowledge and uh we got like it wasn't that hard yeah totally and so I think uh I I think there's a couple couple other takeaways with this too which is you said you said it right um it's really easy to think you're too late on these Tech winners and what I would say is when there's actually a tech winner when they when they actually have the fundamentals they have a great product and they're winning in the market and their growth rate is like you know real uh these things can get a lot bigger than you think I remember reading when Facebook got valued at 15 billion by Microsoft and they had like no Revenue at the time very or they had like I don't know maybe a few hundred million in Revenue but it wasn't like uh it just seemed like how big is this social network thing going to be and like if somebody at that time was saying and I'm sure there were a few people but somebody time saying yeah this going to end up being a trillion doll company I'd be like there's no you is there such a thing as a trillion dollar company that's insane right like I've told the story before one of the biggest mistakes I made one of the worst Investments I made was an investment I made right and that means I invested in Tesla when Tesla was at two billion and I put all the money I had straight out of college I put it into Tesla at 2 billion and I rode it up till it was at 7 billion or something like that and I I cashed out at a 3X and I remember at the time thinking okay General Motors and these other whoever the biggest ones at the time I think they were at 20 something billion maybe they're 25 billion I don't remember the exact numbers but something like that and I was like one day Tesla could be you know half as big or maybe even as big as those companies it just seemed like that was the roof that was the ceiling on how big these could be and then Tes Tesla went up and became at one point a trillion dollar company now it's come back down to like you know whatever half but um my two billion could have been become a trillion BAS basically in terms what would you have made you think how much did you put in 25,000 yeah I had like 25 Grand in it and um so what's that is that 100 I I can't even do that is that I I done the math at one point and this wasn't the peak but at one point it was like I would have had $6 million from that 25k it was like an great Angel investment and again this felt late like Tesla was already out successful Elon Musk was a he's not what he is today but he was a known person right like I'm talking about this was back in probably 20 13ish 2012 something like that maybe dude we should do another one of these episodes because I think there's a lot of great companies right now that valuations are low where in 10 or 15 years when there's another great Market things will be drastically different you know this will be one of those things where you say in 10 years you're going to wish you would have done what we're suggesting right and we should do another one of these we should I even had people build me like a website for this like a sick looking website I think we should do this me and you I think should own a job board called Sarah's list and we should just keep this updated and did you think that I tweeted I tweeted out I was like yeah like uh I think this is a great way to make wealth whereas like but like researching these is is a bit challenging and that tweet got seen by millions not millions of people many hundreds of thousands of people and a lot of really good replies and there were some cool things uh startups that were mentioned and different job boards but nothing where it's like perfect where where where where where I think it needs to be but yeah I agree all right I think that's it that's a wrap [Music]

here he goes seven of the eight richest people in the world right now on or in america right now are fierce nerds right so you have like zuckerberg bill gates elon musk like you have these like these jeff bezos these types of folks but also he says intelligence is part you know part of the thing but fierce nerds are not they're not winners because they're the smartest of the nerds in fact they're usually only moderately intelligent uh compared to other nerds but they are way more competitive and impatient than than the average nerd and this is the difference between basically like who becomes a professor and who becomes like a founder or a great investor or something like this [Music] all right in this episode we're talking about sam's fight with a bunch of nannies yeah it's that's a crazy story that's in the beginning uh sean just had lunch with a billionaire i had dinner with him that they actually a few days before super fascinating guy this this we're actually gonna share a couple stories that very few people get to see i think that's the most interesting part we also do a couple ideas we got a uh apple-esque apple-esque business for bathrooms and a business around the idea of an iq test so that's a little side hustle we got for you so this got everything we got frameworks we got stories we got ideas we got it all have you ever seen this meme of like a black guy with a red shirt like clasping hands with a white guy with a blue shirt and it's like we're in this together type of violence like the firm the firm handshake meme yeah it's like us versus the world race class it doesn't matter i just had a real life incident like that happened to me so i was out i'm in brooklyn right now i was out in this park in front of my house like doing push-ups and sit-ups and just like walking my dog just hanging out and i see this guy i see like these four nannies like all cicada out of like an area where they're sitting and then i see this like dude who's clearly harassing them like coming after them and i run over there and i'm like hey what's going on and they're like this guy just like spit on us he's acting crazy he's bothering us and so i give him my dog's leash uh because i had my dog man i go hey hold my dog for me and we i walked over and i start talking to the guy to get him to go away and then like it's like oh this is clearly going to become a fist fight and then like five other guys who are all around the street these guys just like basically sit on the block all day i don't know what they do but like one dude was like a dominican dude another guy was a black guy we were all and i'm sitting there shirtless and bright green running shorts with a fanny pack on with airpods still in my ear and we just like corralled these women these fours like a jamaican nanny it was like a an asian nanny an older white woman it looks like and it's like we were all just like corralling these guy or the the these these nannies in this like circle and we're just standing there like an elephant garden gets hurt you know what i'm saying and it was like it was like the real life meme of us coming together and at the end the crazy person he walked away and we just look at each other like john well done you know just like who cares about our backgrounds who cares what we look like we just we're champions of the nannies and i just got hyped over that first of all the fanny and the nannies that's an amazing combo don't don't mess with that secondly what was that analogy like an elephant guarding it's hurt i don't know i watch national geographic when the lions come like the whole community of elephants like get in a circle and they put like the babies in the middle and they're just saying like you know bring it on dog and they're just ready to fight and that's how it felt like we were just these you're like you know they call people like renaissance man like you're not a renaissance man but you do have this strange set of influences that you watch and you consume and you play with to like we need like another word you're like a redneck science man or something like that yeah i don't know what these things are you're like you know like when you're swash buckling over at the thing it's like no i don't know that like why do you know that like you know i like i'm watching cops but on commercial break i'm reading ernest hemingway you know what i'm saying like you can't stop me [Laughter] how many episodes of cops have you watched all of them jacksonville florida is my favorite part how do you think i know so much about florida what episode have i not watched i think was the first reality tv and that should start in the 80s this happened this morning for you yeah like an hour and a half ago isn't it amazing when you when something amazing happens in the morning the rest of your day you got a totally different pep in your step like i remember once i went skydiving and i did it in the morning and skydiving was okay it was it was cool whatever it's over in like five minutes right like it's like a lot of build up that it's over in five minutes it's like you know it's like your first time doing it it's like you know a lot of build up and then it's just over and the one thing i remember was cool it was like 8 30 in the morning and then i like yeah exactly i had to go on the rest of my day well i also made the same joke i said your first time doing it and you said the same joke so that's why i was like okay oh [ __ ] made but we can do it again we can do it two times well like when you make a joke the second time and someone's like you already said that one like oh i i thought i thought no one heard me i thought maybe you didn't hear it the um but the rest of your day is like you feel like a champion who could do all things that's how i felt the day after i scouted the morning after i skydived and i feel like you're you're in that mood now right you fought off the crazy guy the crazy spitting guy with a bunch of nannies you saved a bunch of nannies and by proxy their babies and so i don't know you could kind of do anything i could just tell you hey sam you know recite you know tell me the next five companies that are going to become trillion dollar companies and you could just tell me can i ask you any question right now you're good yeah dude look i i created the u.n of fighting off you know bad guys it was just a bunch of us all looking different different backgrounds it was like it was like the beginning of a 90s sitcom you know what i'm saying like yeah you know the blue collar guy the doctor you know we all came together yeah it was it was right it was like a cross between uh you know golden girls and like power rangers [Laughter] so you you can we talk about darmash because i have a lot of interesting things to talk about because i got to hang out with him can you talk about what what you all did yeah i think we both basically hung out with darmesh so darmesh is the founder of hubspot hubspot is the company that bought your company he's a billionaire hubspot is a he's been there for i don't know how many years 15 plus years now in the beginning so kind of epic founder built a 20 billion dollar company or something like that and um awesome guy really fun guy to hang out with he listens to the pod so he's kind of like like-minded and kind of knows our personalities but we had never hung out person neither had you so i think you hung out with him at the conference and then like a few days later i grabbed lunch with him because he flew to san francisco um give me your kind of initial take give me what you liked give me maybe something you didn't expect and i'll do the same so he's lovely like he's a sweetheart of a person he's um easy to talk to like he's incredibly like he seems emotionally like well balanced and like knows what he what he is and what he isn't so a lovely hang on and then the second thing and i mean this with love and i mean this as a compliment he is so odd he has done so many unique things in his life that he like you you wouldn't even know like he's odd in that he's like quirky but he's also eclectic uh incredibly eclectic so he's done so many interesting things and when he tells you the stories about his interesting things you realize oh you're like a lovely guy to be around and you have my back and we're friends but you are you're kind of a shark you will you'll you win you win at everything you do and you spot opportunities for example he just casually throws out these things and he's done this to me like eight times so i found out that when he was in his 20s he was like you know i almost didn't even and this reminds me of you he goes i almost didn't even want to start tech companies because i um was going to become a professional poker player i was like what he goes yeah basically like me and my brother we uh we were up like you know mid to high six figures over our career our short career of blackjack because we learned how to play blackjack and we learned how to do well and also we speak a language that isn't very common i actually don't know what language it is but language we're in india they don't even speak it that that much and he's like we could talk at like the tables and like discuss strategy and no one would even know and uh we just would win we i i'm up and i know how to do it the right way and i almost became a professional poker player and so we like has like all these little weird things that he'll tell stories about and i'm like oh you're you're a killer and you're also so unique yeah have you ever read that paul graham blog post called fierce nerds no what is it i mean uh years ago 10 years ago it's old right um no not that old maybe like uh let's see where did he publish this the public says 2021 one no no no no no it's an amazing post i'm gonna read you a couple pieces of it but it is it's one of those like program i think is somebody said this earlier they go uh uh what's the guy andrew tate they saw some tweet that was really funny was paul graham was my andrew tate like growing up like so funny so it's such a funny it's such a deep cut joke but if you get it you're like it just hits the spot so um all right so he wrote this post and he goes most people think of nerds as quiet you know sort of like different people right just sort of like uh you know passive and in most social situations they are they're they're quiet and you know they're not the star quarterback in the middle of the gym right they're um they're kind of a fish out of water in a bunch of different things he goes um but this is an illusion because when on that only happens when non-nerds observe them because they're observing them in non-nerdy situations so you see a nerd at prom you just see them as a quiet sort of passive nerd there's no alpha in them and he goes but in fact some nerds are quite fierce fierce nerds are a small but interesting group they are extremely competitive more competitive i would say than competitive non-nerds because the competition is more personal to them partly because they're not emotionally mature and they distance themselves from it but also because there's less randomness in the types of competition that they engage in therefore they're justified in making it more personal so this is like fierce nerds who get really into chess or a game that is less luck-based more skill-based uh this often happens with gaming or programming competitions or math competitions or spelling bees way less about luck way more about skill darmesh told me a story he was like when i was in grade school or high school i uh like i got in trouble because i just like didn't go to school or like something like that and i was like wow he goes well i had never seen a ping pong table and they had one of those in the dorm and i right when i saw it i decided i'm going to be the best at this and so i dedicated my high school years to being the best ping-pong player uh but sorry go ahead really yes that's amazing uh i love how you get these gems out of people like what question do you ask that gets that answer i uh like i'll just say like like wow you're like really unique like how are you so why are you so different no no how did you really say it wow you're so freaking weird man yeah i was like did you do stuff your whole life i was like you're a weirdo i'm like i'm kind of i'll say like i'm kind of a weirdo too but you're like extreme weird like what were you like in high school yeah yeah yeah that's that's that's the sam park question i i needed to get that out of you then those are great because i'll be honest with you i had lunch with him and super nice by the way keep reading your article okay here we go fair enough uh so he go so he goes on to talk about it he's like here's some other things about about fierce nerds one they're independent-minded they're willing to basically stand on what they believe even though it is socially awkward you know in school this becomes kind of a liability for them but as soon as they graduate they go into kind of the professional world it becomes an extreme asset for them um they're also impatient they're annoyed by rules rather than being just like you know unaware of them or passively following them and he goes i'm not because i'm not sure why fierce nerds are impatient but they most of them seem to be you'll notice at first in conversation they tend to interrupt you at first it's merely annoying but it's but the more promising fierce nerds it's connected to a deeper impatience about solving the problem they have this competitiveness and impatience right so those are two of the like characteristics and um he goes when you combine these qualities in sufficient quantity the result is quite formidable and then he gives some examples and he goes that's a beautiful sentence by the way one more part if you combine these in sufficient yeah that's a really good sentence yeah here he goes seven of the eight richest people in the world right now on or in america right now are fierce nerds right so you have like zuckerberg bill gates elon musk like you have these like these jeff bezos these types of folks um he goes the bad news he goes he goes indeed he basically but also he says intelligence is par you know part of the thing but fierce nerds are not they're not winners because they're the smartest of the nerds in fact they're usually only moderately intelligent uh compared to other nerds but they are way more competitive and impatient than than the average nerd and this is the difference between basically like who becomes a professor and who becomes like a founder or a great investor or something like this and so uh he goes he goes he goes the idea of a fierce nerd is not a common one so a lot of you might be reading this and might realize hmm that's me and he goes and now and i love this writing he goes and it is to you young fierce nerd that i now turn and he goes and he starts talking directly to the fierceness he goes i got good good news and bad news the good news is your fears is going to help you solve difficult problems so you know scientific technical problems blah blah blah you can get rich in business um in greed it is great for you know survival to be a fierce dirt he goes the bad news is that if not exercise your fierceness will turn into bitterness and you'll become an intellectual playground bully a grumpy sis admin the forum troll the hater and the shooter down of new ideas he goes how do you avoid this fate and by the way he created hacker news so i think he runs into a lot of fierce nerds on hacker news he goes how do you avoid this fate work on ambitious projects because if you succeed it brings you the kind of satisfaction that will neutralize your bitterness you don't have to succeed to feel this merely working on hard projects gives most fierce nerds a sense of satisfaction um and it and it and even if you don't succeed it'll keep you busy so you're not so bitter i thought this is an amazing blog post like what it is you you you i said literally i read this i sent it to emmett at twitch i was like hey it's you like this is you this is what i would describe you as like a fierce nerd and he went through y combinator so you know he's like you know the archetype for it so you just pulled this up by the way without having any preparation and you did a really good job by the way of like reading that i was like enthralled uh but dude paul graham very hard by the way because i read this i know a year ago and i'm like skimming it trying to cut the boring parts and also remember what the hell was this article about that was actually quite difficult i know you did a really good job i was like tell me more tell me more um paul graham's a great writer uh i lo i'm gonna go back and reread that okay and i interrupted you to i interrupted the interruption so you met with darmesh and you said to be honest he was a nice guy i forget what you said so so he's a fierce nerd that's the first thing and i think you pulled out some good stories the ping pong story the poker story this is classic fierce nerd hallmarks right all green flags uh going towards that the second part was super nice guy and our lunch is totally fine but there is a certain uh it's he's this type of person actually there's a bunch of people like this i might be like this where you're almost better to talk to online it's like you've spent more time talking to people online that your online social skill is better than your in-person social skill i felt this myself because right i left the house for the first time in many you know many days to go do a social hangout like he even texted he was like you know totally understand by the way if you don't want to come i'm like you i don't like to leave the house and you know i'm protective of my time and i was like no no i want to do this i'll i'll drive an hour let's do this um i felt rusty and i could feel almost that he was a little rusty or like but differently not rusty necessarily but his main comfort zone right his pocket his cockpit as a pilot is sitting at his desk in front of a computer and i know a bunch of people like this i have this guy we used to work with jake if you met him he's as quiet as mouse in slack he's like the class clown and i was like what who is this guy that's you dude you're like the most soft-spoken like you know that foot pedal on a piano that makes all the keys like muted he's like that for real life like somebody needs to like take the foot off the foot pedal for him and but then you get him in slack and the guy's like you know the number one troll willing to cut the edgy jokes and i was like i can't believe this is the same guy and it's like he was 21 years old he basically grew up in malaysia his only like english social interactions were online in like in chat rooms games discord that sort of thing and so you know that's just his persona and i've met so many people that are like this that i've now come to realize it's not something weird about them it's actually a completely normal thing and it's better to just figure out what's you where are you the most you is it through text messaging is it on phone calls is it through written emails is it in person is it like long form in person what is the version of you that's the most you uh like what would you say it is for you um writing like long form writing um i think that's what i prefer like these podcasts like i usually have to lay down for like 30 minutes because i'm like i'm like dead after them so no i mean i'm okay with this but like writing i prefer but listen to this so i think darm mesh would actually grow you like to elevate your legs to get the blood back to your brain yeah it's like i'm so tired i passed out what happened uh uh darmesh um i would probably agree with you i would imagine and but so listen to this so they they asked you and me to like show up so basically i was supposed to speak at this event and they're like hey uh one of the main people had to cancel because something happened can you show up like in 12 hours the next morning and come and speak in front of 10 000 people and i was like i mean i guess i could just like show up and riff in front of 10 000 people but i don't prefer that just darmesh when i like do a thing and they're like no he hates public speaking i'm like just let me ask him he'll do it so he ended up doing it but backstage i asked him about that and he's like yeah i don't i hate public speaking i'm not good at it and i go well you just did a keynote earlier today why'd you do that and he goes i'll tell you why basically for the six months or five months or whatever it was leading up to this event i had this process where i read a bunch of comedy books and i realized that the laugh per minute was the most important thing for a talk and so what i did was i got first i made a presentation i got and i created a zoom call and i got 10 hubspot employees to do it and i recorded the whole thing then i got 20 to come and then 50 to come and then 100 to come and what i did was i adapted each time and i built this python i built this python script that analyzed the audio of the call to figure out what my laugh per minute was and then each time i adapted it to get more laughs per minute so for example and he knew the exact numbers he goes i had 96 slides on this presentation and i had to click next 120 times and i know on which laugh and on which word to hit next because i practiced it so much because i'm optimizing for lap my he kept going at the the lpm wow and uh what the hell this is amazing it's amazing these types of stories it's amazing and he like he and i went back and watched his talk and he goes in fact so here's like another like side tangent have you ever been to a big conference have you noticed whether it's ted talk or even steve jobs all the big conferences that have more than a thousand people they all use the same slide clicker have you ever seen that clicker it only has two buttons a red which means a back and a right and a and a green which means next so here's the secret that clicker it doesn't actually change the slide it goes to a light like a light that says red or green and there's someone on the other end of the slide hitting left or right did you know that no yeah so that's like so it's so stupid because they do it because like the presenters or the organizers will be like well in case you could screw up someone's here and we'll do a better job but it's not automated like it this is how it works at all big conferences so it's like this clicker or whatever we have to do a talk on it actually they have they've completely monopolized it so every single big conference has this and and i told him that he goes dude trust me i know i've gotten in fights with these people for eight years because i built a device and a program to make it so that clicker could actually work directly with the computer because in order to optimize my lpm i need the click to happen faster that a human bead can see the light and click next because that's how i've set it up and every once in a while there'll be a slight delay which decreases my lpm and so this is how this guy looks at everything and he told me about his lpm like you think about your t levels he just like spends months optimizing his lpm and this is just like when i hear stories like this i think hey you're unstoppable like this is why you're successful and b i love you like i i i just you're my hero and everything you're about i'm into now and i just i love it man i love when these people are so extreme about [ __ ] it's awesome that's amazing ah that is amazing what an amazing story you've made my day um that that is really incredible i i can't even uh yeah i can't even kind of wrap my head around the level of nerdery it takes to go that deep on something like you know um i feel like i live my life in this like 80 20 way where like good enough is as good as it gets and like i just kind of good enough is as good as it gets for like almost everything in my life very rarely do i try to like take something to that like nth degree that in that olympic level of obsession and part of me is very jealous of people who do that um like we another fierce nerd we had was this guy quinn who used to work at um at our company and quinn same thing most soft-spoken guy you might have met him he had the big crazy yeah i know uh most soft-spoken guy gentle like if there was a fly that landed on his wrist he'd be like it's your wrist now fly right like this never said a bad word about anybody and um he was like a fierce nerd like we we started playing like these little word games in the office and i was like oh quinn you should play like this uh like you know like imagine like wordle but like 10 years ago and he's like oh i could see him like getting like visibly stressed about it i was like whoa like no problem man what's wrong like you you don't want to play he goes no but if i play then i'm just going to get super obsessed with it like i'm just going to take it too far and i was like what do you mean he's like he's like yeah i just have to be careful with games like this i just get like really into it i just have to win and i was like you like what do you mean like you're this ruthless competitor get out of here he goes did i ever show you the girlfriend thing and i was like what's the girlfriend thing and he goes you know that game that's like that word scramble game uh like basically it's a bunch of letters nine letters on a grid you're trying to like create as many words as you can just like dragging your finger across the line he's like yeah my girlfriend beat me in that game once and then i went to google's headquarters and i programmed the artificial robot arm to just make as many swipes as possible in like every like per second and uh like i just crushed her and i'm like i'm the world record holder now of this game like you basically like programmed the robotic arm he added a little like nerf gun tip to it so it'd be soft like a it could just scrape against the screen and then he just programmed it to move in every direction the optimal path to like create as many words as it can in like you know a minute and it's like his time is like unbelievably higher than everybody else and his girlfriend's like well this game's not fun anymore like i don't understand what's happened like what happened here and he's like i happened dude let me tell you one more last uh darmesh story so he owns like uh he has an eight-figure domain portfolio so like random things like he owns cambridge.com which he like just lets the government use um you know how i uh i have this copywriting thing i i was using try copy that and he goes hey for your birthday i bought you copythat.com and i was like what that's like he's like try not being a [ __ ] [Laughter] [Laughter] thanks dad dude that's hilarious so he owns all these domain names and i was like what okay well you have this world thing and you have all these domains any projects that interest you he goes i've been thinking really a lot about creating a venn diagram community i was like what what are you crazy he goes well i own venndiagram.com and i love communities and i'm into math and i think there's a lot of other people who are also obsessed with venn diagrams i think i'm going to build a really cool community for venn diagrams and uh i don't know because you're gonna see them having like a tattoo on their arm of just a van there's a bunch of banners yeah uh we're all just better just getting in the room i've been overlapped everywhere i don't know like what it's like there's a circle there's a circle you see how this circle i have what are they gonna just talk about it all the time i mean i i don't understand like what the like you know this circle is bigger this one's smaller i i don't know man you can't you can't help it but that's what he's going to build is a venn diagram community because he owns venndiagram.com can can i tell you five random domains that i own uh actually i'll tell you six random domains that i own i want you i'm gonna say let's play a little game i'm gonna say a domain and you're gonna just pitch me a business off off the domain off top of your head all right okay all right you froze alright there you go um okay number one excel monkeys.com a domain i own excel monkeys.com what does it do all right excel monkeys.com that's where you buy smart chimpanzees that's your best idea with excel monkeys you buy smart monkeys yeah because they accept monkey's so smart they could use excel excel monkeys it would be um that would be the name of a tax service yeah it could be a tax service it could also be like selling amazing excel templates for stuff it's like oh you need like a cash flow statement here's a great one you need like a p l here's a great excel wait did you buy excel monkeys because that's what i used to call people did you do that yeah whenever i meet these finance nerds in reality i was always jealous of them because they were making more money than me like my friends and i'd be like dude you're just an excel monkey man like they're just all you do is play and excel you don't do anything you don't create real value like me like you know i write a newsletter dude i i have so many phrases like that like um bakers who are always making powerpoints i'm like ah freaking slide jockey over here i don't know what it was i don't even know why but i'm like i want it to be derogatory or like uh the best one of all of them is the finance department that like watches the budget you have to get your expenses it's like uh yeah i gotta go talk to the bean counters i like heard some guy say this he was like in his 60s and i think it's a common phrase but i was like oh that was like a racial slur as far as i was concerned i was like wow calling someone a bean counter that sounds i like that you were allowed to say that in the office that's incredible i'm gonna use that when i was uh you know younger and i was jealous of all these bankers they'd be like oh you know i work in banking like oh no [ __ ] which branch you know like uh i go to the one in columbia is that where you are you ever been robbed has ever come in with a ski basket okay excel monkeys that's a uh uh that's a it's a website for tax experts what's the next one all right next one skillbad.com i own skillbad.com bad i don't know sounded good it's too easy to spell easy to say words put together like you're bad at something i don't know but it's ironic what what would you what like what would that be what were you thinking it's like skillshare bro it's so that's that's a layup right there it's like skillshare it's uh you're bad at a skill come to skill bad we help you go from being bad at something to being good at something that's stupid that is really stupid i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better [Music] i got um it's tummy time.com it's tummy

don't i'm not there yet and what are the last two we're gonna have to work on your improv skills you've been working on comedy but not improv i feel like uh i feel like the on the spot throw something at you i'm gonna practice i'm gonna keep doing this segment until you're dude i'm i'm still at the yes and part of the book what's the one thing everyone knows about improv yes i am it's like the number one tell that you've never done it you say you know an improv you know an improv we have this thing called yes and it means don't disagree with me in this meeting instead say yes and then make my idea better because it's bad right now have you ever gone out to dinner with a bunch of improv people dude i did improv for like you know eight weeks of my life dude i've gone out to dinner what time i wanted nothing more obnoxious than a bunch of people i'd rather be with the vendors yes i'd rather be with the venn diagram dorks and a bunch of improvers yuck they go it goes like in in in like places i don't want to be number two on top of that list is improvers number one is people who are part of acapella groups oh my god i was about to say the same thing acapella where they're just like hey yeah yeah yeah [Music] oh god here we go don't sing to me in the on the mcdonald's slide that you want a number one bruh just tell me your big back with no with no audience you know what makes any situation worse singing i cannot stand the acapella people i didn't realize that was a thing where i grew up in missouri if you were part of the acapella people would make fun of you but then i started meeting people on the east coast like these people who go to harvard and cornell and [ __ ] and they would brag about being part of like so serious about it i'd be like dude why are you telling people that what are you doing like don't be talking about doesn't bob like you don't talk about that and they're like why it's awesome i was always amazed at acapella people dude on duke's campus like who gets laid number one basketball players number two acapella and i was like what the hell what's going on it was crazy yeah i have these like dating rules by the way uh never date anybody who's into who's in a what is it called equestrian somebody who likes to ride horses never date a horseback rider never date a dancer uh never date an acapella person uh those are my three those are the three like you just never want to do it why they're obsessed with something that's by all accounts useless number two they all of their hobbies are extremely either expensive or time consuming away from you number number three half of those hobbies basically are like really intimate with other people that are not you they're just going to be doing salsa with some like you know some suave guy from latin america who doesn't speak english but is touching all over your person you don't want to do that right so these hobbies and the same and then also you can't do the thing so oh you're at a wedding great isn't it awesome you date a dancer no it's not awesome you turn into a pole while they are doing like actual dancing or oh you date a singer great why don't you just sit there and nod and like tap your foot while they who they actually know how to sing so it's like do together i never dance at weddings i just act like i have to go to the bathroom every song i freaking hate it i hate what it dances i watch like i find two bathrooms on opposite poles i just make laps between them dude i don't ever dance like i i watched a ufc fight the toilet the other day like i had a wedding i don't i didn't saturday nights i watched ufc at like three weddings already yeah i hate going to weddings and going to the dance floor i just tell sarah like don't even ask me and they're like well it's fine i'm like uh no this is the worst i don't want to do this i don't know what to do i don't like it it just it ain't for me there's a great little crystalia clip on youtube about it if you see it he goes there's no bigger dick move than inviting your friend to your wedding because if you're doing an out-of-state wedding and you invite me like you know what you just did to me you know what you just did you cost me money time i don't want to be at a wedding and i thought it was like very very true um all right new uh new segment so or a new idea so i got two ideas for you would you like to hear about i'll give you options would you like to hear about the next apple or would you like to hear about um the next the next little side hustle that i think could kind of work the next app or the next side hustle that might kind of work well the second one all right just as i expected um do you know your iq no of course not ben do you know your iq of course he does i i've done only unofficial iq tests what does that mean yeah like a banner ad on a website yeah so there's some online that's supposed to be better than others but basically in order to get your actual iq it's supposed to be like proctored and they have someone administer it but you can go take tests online i took one of the better ones um but it's still not like a totally accurate iq okay i had one of the better arby's the other day [Laughter] so it's kind of like that yeah what did you get yeah what's your iq it said 132. oh this genius level right no no but it's it's it's smart but not genius so um i think you could create a ddc iq brand uh so i think you could basically say the same playbook that everybody's using for d2c brands right uh we were just joking about banner ads but yes banner ads facebook ads taboola ads everywhere i think you could optimize a funnel that basically buys clicks for less than a dollar and then converts you know let's call it uh i don't know whatever ten percent of people uh you need to convert ten percent of people to pay you the 25 bucks that it's going to take or the you know maybe it's the maybe it's maybe it's 99 bucks or something like that you have to figure out some version of the economics that's going to make sense to make this the math work on the cac versus the the value but i feel like somebody could create a funnel that will get you in why do i think that this will work it's not really economics driven it's just work backwards from what's an ad that i think would work and i think an ad that's like only geniuses can solve this puzzle um like i i don't know if you've seen these ads on tick tock that are like people say this puzzle is impossible or this number game is impossible you can't draw a line through these four things without lifting your finger and you're like i bet i can do that that looks doable and you like click it and then now it tells you to download some game but instead of a game i think it could be basically like an iq game and i think you can basically make a monthly subscription that's like these are iq games or iq tests to get your score um for either you or maybe maybe it's maybe we're going after the baby einsteins maybe it's for your kids because i think people want to know if their kid's a genius more than as an adult it's less less important and so i think somebody could build a d2c iq test that like i don't know exactly how well it'll do but would it surprise you if i told you dude i met this guy and he runs this like facebook funnel that basically takes you down an iq test and then you pay for your results and uh and like half the people forget to cancel their subscription um and the guy makes you know 50 50 000 a month or the guy makes a hundred thousand a month doing this would you be shocked if i told you that no in fact i think you could build a company that could actually make nine figures like 100 million plus and here's why um i think i've told you about this but you have you ever heard of gallup you've definitely heard of gallup like they they're cited in service yeah they're surveys well they own this company uh called clifton strengths have you heard of clifton shrinks i i think clifton shrinks we've talked about this way we talked about it way back in the day but we should do it again because the pod was way smaller back then but yeah i've done this test the strength finder test i don't have all my research so i'm going off memory but basically strengths finders i think it was a test and then a book or a book than a test something like that it's a book that has a link to the test inside so basically the book is like you don't even need to read the book the book just has like a code so let's go to this website type in this thing now you take the test and then it gives you at the end like your six or seven strengths it's like oh you're a futurist this is like literally tarot card reading to me like it's like you're a futurist you're a determined leader you're you know problem solver or whatever i don't know what they are but like i took the test and i was like oh they just gave me seven like generically positive words like oh for sure i could identify with some of these and like great what does this do it's a horoscope but basically gallup the company gallup is a survey business they own strengths finders and gallup is privately owned but if i remember correctly four years ago maybe it's two years ago when i did research on them i think they're north of a billion dollars in revenue and clifton strengthsfinder i think what it is is um so they charge like 40 to 50 bucks for one of these simple things and but then they do like more heavy-duty consulting where they'll like put your whole company through it and during my research i'm pretty sure that that test was making hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue because they have thousands of employees in like i don't know where they're based like minnesota or like something they're just like one of these i guess they're the main thing gallup is based in dc but it's one of these companies that you like totally forget about that exists and you just don't even think about it but if you look at the traffic of their website and you look at some of the numbers based off of news articles it's like a pretty wildly huge company right is it private or is it public it's uh it's private it might have been public at one point but it's like they have on wikipedia it says they've got 50 offices and i know they have thousands and thousands of employees and it's privately owned by uh i think still just the the family wow uh yeah that's amazing yeah so i think you could do like the this is like the enterprise personality test that's what i call it uh you could do the personality tests you could do the love language uh test you could do iq i think you could do a d2c funnel that would work with these things um so i don't know i'm kind of interested in this i think this is like if you're a good internet marketer like actually not good i think you kind of need to be an amazing internet marketer yeah if you're amazing internet marketer the world is your oyster but like one fun one that i think somebody could spin up would be um these like sort of uh take a test get a score type things whether it's personality or it's iq okay so that's that's that one now let me tell you my apple idea all right i'm taking a shower today and that's nice you're welcome the my one of my favorite feelings of the day i'll give you a list of my favorite feelings most people don't have this list but i gotta i got a list of favorite feelings throughout the day in my top five two of them maybe three come in the bathroom showers wash my hands taking a poop love all three of them [Laughter] my trainer says this thing by the way do you do it in that order that'd be you'd be a freak if you did it in that order [Laughter] it's not a routine in that order we go the other way right there's a there's a method by the way my trainer has this thing he says which is like uh he's like yeah of all my clients he's like the number one thing people actually like struggle with is like stress and he goes what's the opposite of stress and it's like i don't know relief he's like yeah belief satisfaction he goes he goes think about how many things a day stress you out i was like oh that's a lot there's a bunch of things that can stress somebody out he goes think about how many things give you relief in a day he goes i was like kind of struggling to think of anything he's like he's like people usually have relief once a day it's right when they're pooping and he's like that's the only time they experience this emotion that's why they're bad at it they don't practice that emotion very much and i was like wow that's that's interesting so anyways back to my story i love having clean hands after washing my hands i love taking a shower and i love the relief all right great so but when i'm in those situations right now if i go to my shower nothing that's special i i don't know i got standard shower head shampoo body wash got a loofah in there because you know my wife hooks me up you know so this is this is like that's what i'm working with and for something that i do every day something that's like you know kind of a important part of my day why i i think somebody could make an apple for the bathroom and what what is the company that's apple for the bathroom gonna do so i don't know have you ever tried to like hack your shower experience to make it more awesome it's really really trying to do things i bought i was really interested in like different shower heads and i remember researching them on wire cutter and i bought the fanciest one and then i it wasn't even that fancy but the best one and i remember like it took forever to call handyman to install it it was i was gonna say where did you fall fall into the trap installing it right it's always the install that's like you know who's going to do that versus like a nest a nest was like easy i did that and same thing with toilets it's like you we've probably all heard that there's these japanese toilets that are amazing that will like you know give you a butt massage or whatever you know they're they're like incredible toilets but who's going to rip out their toilet and replace it with this fancy one that's a that's a big big overhaul and washing your hands nobody even touches the mirror nobody touches like there's so i think you could build a product that simply says i'm going to give people relaxation and relief i'm going to give them motivation and inspiration through products just for the bathroom and you could just nerd out about how to make the bathroom experience amazing like i bought these little eucalyptus like pods that you put in the shower and basically when hot water hits the the pod it like releases like this eucalyptus like kind of like aroma awesome right like the the thing itself is kind of janky like it's not the best product like uh you know in between it gets all soggy it's not great it's like it's only good the first time but the concept is amazing and it's like why isn't there just a better diffuser that's gonna add this like eucalyptus steam into my shower while i'm doing this why isn't there an add-on attachment that doesn't require me to replace my shower head but just makes the shower head better um why isn't there something that's on my mirror that is motivational and inspirational that's like that looks nice why isn't there a product that's like washing your hands but it's not washing your hands it's like some heat uv [ __ ] i don't know something that's gonna like make my hands feel clean and toasty um why isn't there uh eight sleep for the toilet that's a device that sits inside the toilet and measures your pee in your poo it tells you when you need to go see a doctor or you know the quality of your hydration or whatever else i think that somebody should build a company i want some somebody who is like that venn diagram between quantified self they like they want to like optimize their you know the rob deer dick i am human optimization they're that guy but they're also a hardware nerd and somebody who has that overlap i just wish that they would create apple for the bathroom so it's i think it's something i wish somebody made because i would buy hundreds of dollars worth of products from a brand that could actually do that well what do you think of this idea dude so uh i i haven't researched a ton of this but um there's two interesting players in this space right now so interestingly both of them have come from like tier one vc back businesses that they previously started in traditional like cool kid area so the first one i think is it called revolution bathrooms uh made revolution made revolution made renovation i believe it started by i think it's roger dickey i think his name is his company was called gigster successful tech guy who started like businesses i think they have sold for hundreds of millions of dollars and he like up and quit like this one like company that he had gigser that was killing it and he's like i'm going to get into the bathroom business and so a little bit different than what you're talking about but interesting but another one that's actually really cool have you heard of block renovation they do the same thing right ish yeah i believe they do the same thing but basically the coolest thing about this is if you go to the website it looks slick and cool and everything and it almost fits your venn diagram once because the guy who started it his name is luke sherwin he's the former founder of casper uh so he like took casper public and left and then he started this thing for bathrooms and i think at this point i think they've brought in 90 million in funding or 50 million in funding i forget but it's like close to 100 million and i think it's like doing really really well yeah both of these are basically how do you renovate your bathroom so that you get a like super nice looking bathroom or in their case kitchen also um like just like pick from the menu it's like here's you know here's five amazing bathroom designs pick one and then we have people that can install that bathroom in your bathroom turn key versus today the way you do a renovation is like all right what do you guys think of for tile it's like i don't know i never thought about tile uh what are the options and how much does each one of these cost and like okay then what about sinks and you just sort of have to piecemeal it whereas this was like a turnkey bathroom in a box which is a great idea this was one of the first ideas we brought up on on this show by the way was i saw this ad and i was like this made renovation idea is amazing and i should have just invested in it because back then it was like in a seed stage like it was very early and um yeah both these have done really well have you ever tried to buy a bidet so like what you can do is buy these like bidet uh covers where basically it's like this like it's basically just a sophisticated toilet seat and dude they are so janky like you have like an electric right there never installed it and in fact broke my toilet trying to install it dude they're so janky and you have like a cord going from like where your like electric razor goes and you're like what the [ __ ] why is this cord like going like across the room like running from the kitchen into my bathroom yeah and then you've got this like stupid hose that goes up to the top of the toilet it just looks like like a science experiment like it's duct taped together it sucks right but i've always wanted one you know like whenever you know you use one yeah i want a real bidet yeah that's sick that's dope so yeah i'm on board i i think this is uh the next apple that's ambitious maybe the next company that gets bought by apple i didn't say it's the next apple i said it's apple for the bathrooms meaning it's a company that just cares about the design the simplicity of use and um just making a really high quality product and people are willing to pay a premium way more than you think they're willing to pay three times more if you could actually pull that level of quality off and i think that you have this place where people go all the time you have the shower you have toilet you have a sink you have a mirror if these things to work with and then you have all the accessories oh maybe this scale that i have in my bathroom is like i don't know it's just like some random weight scale maybe there's like a really good version of that that can go with it you could just cross sell into all these different categories but you just say we're gonna own the bathroom we're gonna make the goddamn best products ever for the bathroom and i think if somebody just simply took that idea and then just decided to execute on that for like 10 years you could have a billion dollar company in the same way that like you know the nest thermostat was able to sell for a billion dollars right like i think if you can if you can actually pull off this thing that's in every home and then with a bathroom you got like three or four in every home so it's like you have this like um this thing that today everybody kind of ignores and just treats in this uh sort of like it's an afterthought type of way no i think that's dope i'm in you want to do one more or what uh i want to talk about one other concept which is uh actually do you have do you have one we could do one of yours if you want no if you want to do it all right no i gave a talk at hustle con with this phrase and in my mind i was like oh yeah we've already talked about that but i'm like wait a minute no that was just that hustle con i don't know there's like a couple hundred people in the room at my breakout talk uh so most people have not heard this concept the the one on selling a company it was the one on how to sell your company and in general it's really about like you know how to do a part of business that you don't do often and maybe you don't have the reps in so like most people who become like business owners ceos you're great at product you may be great at marketing you might be good at finance and making money but what you're not good at is stuff that you only do once in a while like fundraising or um m a or um you know things like that sort of like these large one-off transactions that are very important very expensive you don't want to get them wrong but you also don't have reps doing it and um and the other side like when you're fundraising the investor they talk to hundreds of people like you every month they're getting tons of reps so it's a very asymmetric skill set you don't really know how to negotiate like them you don't know what clauses are standard and what are not standard um so you don't have that same level of reps that the other party has same thing with m a you're going to talking to somebody who does m a for a living and um and they've done hundreds of deals and you don't know the first thing about the first thing and so here's the solution that most people have right like if you're really big you can afford a banker like uh did you guys use a banker i don't think so when you when you sold right you may have i had advisors but i had hired one and then i disliked them so i fired them so i ended up being the banker right and same thing when we sold i was the banker but i had a a i talked to a banker who could kind of give me some free advice from time to time i had a really good lawyer that was like a huge thing although i do see the value in a banker i do think that a good banker totally is worth a fee a good lawyer is 100 needed right this guy dick filipina he he he was amazing actually he was a banker that helped me but we were too small for like his normal deals right he does 100 million plus deals and we were way under that so um so basically i was like okay well i don't have i could maybe do a boutique banker but again which one i don't know who's good who's not uh you said you had a great lawyer cool i got a lawyer is my lord great are they okay are they good like how am i supposed to assess this and by the time you you figure out if your lawyer was good or not in a transaction it's too late it's too late it's done same thing with tax strategy or negotiation all these different components and so i talked about like um doing this process is like a very fundraising is usually like an intense sprint uh m a is like an intense sprint it's this couple month process that you work on really hard it becomes your main focus at the end of the day you're trying to like get to this amazing end point i was like i made the comparison i was like it's like birthing a baby and you go through this labor process and then by the end you like you have the thing you wanted at the end and so just like when you're having a baby you you might have a doula a doula somebody that kind of like they're not your doctor right this the doctor would be like your lawyer right uh they're not your nurse they should be like maybe you're your cpa um they're just somebody who's there to coach you guide you and they've been they've seen the births of hundreds of babies whereas this might be your first and i talked about you need a deal doula i was like if you're going to do a deal if you're going to do a transaction you're going to do a fundraising you need a deal it's different than a mentor a mentor is this like general thing in life that's like going to be your kind of like your you know the better version of your dad and a deal doula is specific it's for this period of time it's around one specific problem or process that you're going through and i talked about how when i when i sold my last company i had these five deal doulas i started with and eventually it ended up being these two that i was working with the most but like i talked about and uh who else yeah uh there was this guy flawed who i talked to who gave me great advice like he told me one thing like each one of them told me like one thing that was really important so that guy dick was one of them uh but like for example foreign told me he's like you need to he's like oh cool i was like so excited i was like look we got this like these guys are interested they're about to give us a term sheet tomorrow and he was like you know just sort of chuckling and he's like sure i was like oh you don't think they'll do it he's like it'll happen it's just every timeline you think of is wrong everything they say is gonna fall through and then come back and then half full through again he's like this is the normal m a process so you might have an outlier where it just all goes smoothly but like if you're gonna have a normal m a process you should expect these bumps and bruises and it's like you know going through these contractions basically these like painful ups and downs during the process he also said he's like you need to turn your company into a giant buy button i was like what do you mean he's like you know when you go to amazon it's like one click checkout he's like you think because these guys are giving your term sheet you're at the end so this is when you're gonna have to sprint the hardest he's like let me see your data room i was like oh yeah we're working on it he's like wrong answer bucko like you know that's what you shouldn't be at lunch with me you should be turning your company into a buy button you need everything so organized so precise uh ready for them answer all of their questions dude did i show you my data room you did yeah i had a fire data room me and this woman named edie this woman named edie who works with me edie's probably i think she's in her 60s and when i hired her she was great but she didn't like know how to use technology really and i would it would be like me and her on the phone with hubspot and hubspot would have like five representatives then they would have like six lawyers who were probably two grand an hour a piece then they would have like six accountants and so like this meeting cost them fifty thousand dollars it would be edie and i and they would be asking us questions about different documents and like okay we'll get it for you and i remember them like having a list and he didn't know how to take a screenshot on a computer and i just hear her constantly with her phone and everyone saw she would bring it up and their phone just taken taking pictures of the screen and i just and i would enter the messenger edie put your photo on silent i know what you're doing and she was just taking pictures and we would you know we talked about fierce nerds edie is like a fierce grandmother like i would go to your office and you'd be like oh how's you know how's your daughter like she knows her name she's like remember my daughter's name like show me pictures she was like so kind and cuddly she said she'd be like you submitted your invoice wrong [ __ ] keep this [ __ ] organized we're running a tight ship around here and i was like yeah wow this is how did you find this woman because i was like she's like the polar opposite of you but she was so needed for what you guys had as yours she was so needed i i've always been really good at finding those people because she was she worked in banking for a long time actually and she was like really successful banking a person and she comes off as this like really nice naive woman it's like not even a little bit she's like pretty sh not sharky but like she's she'll get you because she worked in banking in japan where she was like helping companies go public i think at morgan stanley so it's like she's like a shark no more yeah and then she like raised her daughter she had a daughter and decided not to work and raised her and she came to me and she was like uh i don't really need the money but i want a job to prove to my young daughter who just graduated college that uh i'm a badass and that women could be badasses and i was like oh yeah cool you're hired id like i love that and uh she ended up being amazing and i remember her i'm during the due diligence process i had a teacher how to use uh dropbox and i had a teacher like some like pretty like basic computer stuff like how to like copy and paste and then she like bought a course on udemy and stayed up all night and mastered it and she's like all right i know how to do it now but like if i didn't show her how to do something i would see her taking a screenshot like she would have her phone just up and here click and i'm like they could see this anyway sorry go ahead she's amazing i don't know what she's doing now but like i did i need to hire her she's still working with you guys yeah she's still doing that amazing i would have thought like you know normally in like these acquisitions they don't like bring on the finance team or whatever but that's that's amazing i would never let her go she's she's so good she's the most impressive honestly i i like you but she was the most impressive person at the hustle she was wonderful man people know you they know trolling that stuff she was the most impersonal impressive person there yeah she was wonderful i don't even know what we're talking about this one oh dear doula here's the here's the i don't know if it's a business idea but i hear i know that if you're gonna do a transaction you need somebody like this which is every time i've done one of these things i need this person and here's what they teach me how to do they teach me how to use the lawyers they teach me how to use the accountants they teach me how to do the negotiation because they've been through hundreds of these so they know what to expect so they can emotionally coach you when you're like yeah ups and downs they're their therapist they're your advisor on the business side of things the negotiation but that's honestly the least usually that's pretty obvious about what you should do there they're your your speechwriter and your copywriter as you uh you know prepare to like you know write a pitch deck or um you know a follow-up email or whatever it is and the most important thing is they teach you how to use expensive lawyers and accountants because if you just go to a lawyer and you say what should i do you're going to end up with a document that's basically the constitution and it's like oh great you lawyered the [ __ ] out of this but like that wasn't what we needed in our business case like you didn't a lawyer if you defer too much to the lawyer they're gonna over lawyer things if you don't if you don't listen to the lawyer you're gonna have too much liability how do you find that line that judgment is the most important thing and judgment is something you can't really hack there's no shortcuts to judgment the closest thing you can get to it is partner up or borrow somebody else's judgment one of these deal doulas so same thing on the fundraising side you see a term sheet you don't know all these terms what do they mean should i agree to this liquidation preference they oh they have this you know clawback thing what what is this should i agree a deal duel is the one who can kind of teach you how to do that or i love that you know my tax person's suggesting this and they're gonna say don't do that it's gonna over yes that saves you in taxes but it's going to add deal risk over here because it's going to introduce delays and complexity that you don't want to have that's a really good thing that's been really good to me i'm like i don't think there's a business because normally these are successful business people that's the only person you get to do this and they don't want money for this they're just doing it because they want to help you typically maybe somebody could make a business out of this but even if they don't my advice to any founder out there is if you're going through either a fundraising or an m a process make sure you have your deal duels to keep you sane and keep you smart about how you're going to go through the process dude there are so many things that i didn't even know like i didn't even know to ask for example when people talk to me about selling their companies i'll be like well you know you really want to optimize for uh time to close so you want to like close as quickly as possible because in my head i was like why does it matter they gave you a thing i'm like well just [ __ ] happens for example brian halligan the ceo of hubspot got into a near-death accident five days after the deal closed i'm like if that happened at any other point or if the economy change like just [ __ ] happens or like the person leading the deal quits like stuff changes all the time and another thing that i didn't even notice look for is like i would get these offers from these pe firms from small businesses from and then hubspot has a board a board of directors they're a huge company and they're like well we we present the loi before we gave it to you to our board of directors and i was like this isn't going to go through yada yada well once the board approves it the likelihood that it's going to get done is quite high because the employees have to look good to the board and they already like you know they can't whereas you have another guy who's just like a smaller business and it's just the founder leading the deal it's like oh he you don't give a [ __ ] he'll bail at any point like he just he's like you know it's their money they're you know what i'm saying like the dynamics are different and so there's all these things that i didn't quite understand that now i know that you really it's hard to learn unless you've been there because you don't even know what to ask with our last deal one of we took the lo we took the second highest offer like uh we turned on the top offer and we took the second offer and why was that well there was like a bunch of intangible reasons maybe we preferred one over the other but it was like you know i personally i personally left i don't know million and a half to two million dollars total on the table uh just me on taking the second deal over the first deal which is like that was a lot of money to me that wasn't small like that was that was meaningful um and the reason i did it one of one of the reasons there was a few the one was you know our team they we wanted our team to to our whole team to go with the deal then and that was only gonna happen with a second that's probably the biggest reason but there was some small reason like commute and stuff like that then the but the other one was likelihood to close uh yeah they had told me they go look yes we've been a pain in the ass in negotiation like we're sticklers about this stuff like we we don't move super fast but the good news is that means we've thought it through and we've got our approvals already once we sign this thing we will close and we will close on time and he's like that's the good news the bad news is leading up to it we're not the quickest fastest deal makers who are going to promise you everything it's like we're only going to promise you what we can deliver that's the idea that's the that's the ideal setup by the way and i didn't really know how to value it at the time like he was pitching it to me as a value and i was like yeah whatever the other guys are offering more like what do i care but in retrospect that actually was quite an important thing because it's very important a hundred percent of the second best deal is better than no deal from the from the best offer right or somebody who's gonna re try to retrade the deal in the last minute like that's one of the worst signs you can have is somebody who comes back and in the 11th hour trying to retrade the deal and they told us these guys were like we're not going to retrade the deal we are going to close and so that's the good news the bad news is it takes us longer to get to the term sheet and we're not necessarily going to be the top offer we're going to offer you the best we can and now i've learned that that's actually quite important um in this process but as a first time first time going through it i didn't know how to wait that you also gave me some good advice which was you were like tell them everything tell them up front all the reasons that they shouldn't buy you all the skeletons in the closet drag them out once okay not the very first meeting but like once they're interested and it's getting to where like hey we're gonna make an offer um or we're making an offer say before we do that i'm going to literally brainstorm and try to figure out every reason why i think you maybe shouldn't do this deal and um you know hey we don't have our ducks in a row on this this is an unknown this is like a contract dispute we're in but whatever they may be right you you have to drag those out and basically let somebody run away then because it is far less painful and less wasteful to let them run away then they're going to find it out no deal closes without the finance so they're going to find out no matter what your instinct is oh don't tell them that's that's always the first time entrepreneurs instinct it was my instinct the first time and then i somebody gave me this advice you gave it to me also which was no no don't do that um just tell them what's great what's bad about your business you're going to get in bed together they need to know both sides of it and if you lie you're getting sued anyway like you're you're on yeah you're on the phone you definitely can't lie you definitely can't lie that's obvious but you can't even just hope they don't see it or don't find it because they're going to see it or find it and you can and then they're going to say and then they'll say uh what the future is yeah what else are you telling me and so it was actually a mega trust builder to do that um you know when we sold the first company so those are some of the things that you kind of only learned through these deals you don't you don't learn that except through either experience or talking with people who are experienced so anyways that's my rant on deal duel it's a i think a very underrated thing we went we've covered it all we've this has been a this has been a roller coaster dude there was a comment on youtube about a guy unsubscribing he goes ah i'm unsubscribing last few episodes haven't been great i replied i said good yeah you said good some other guy was like man what are you talking about these guys are trying to i said over my dead body i am now i now work for you you know big booty three five seven on youtube i now work for you i dude one guy motivated beyond belief to come with a fire every time one guy wrote these guys are great comma overall and i was like oh that's a good day you got me that's that's great that's an amazing one the uh it's remember petty court it's petty court and code is in session uh that's how i feel when i read the youtube comments yeah that that was a good one the comments are actually quite good you had such a funny um such a funny joke in a group chat where it was the the no offense thing and then the uh yeah with all due respect [Laughter] you're an ugly dude with all due respect it's like when people start sentences saying i'm not racist but uh it's like oh okay and the other thing that i hate people yeah the other thing i hate what people say is well at least he's honest i'm like what but his honest opinion sucks i don't care if he's honest like i don't know he's he's a straight shooter like you shooting [ __ ] though yeah yeah like you straight shooter yeah but what you say is stupid and i just you know what i mean it's like dumb i hate it i i've always hated that excuse oh man good time all right [Music] you

[Music] all right it's one question friday where we answer one question from one of the listeners if you want to submit your question go to mfmpod is it dot com and click the little microphone to submit your question this one came in through text message somebody said hey uh hey dude i'm giving a my first talk at a conference i got invited to speak at this conference i'm giving my first talk uh i'm excited about it but a little bit nervous like he's like i know it's gonna be fine but i just don't want it to be lame he's like you and sam are really good at doing these kind of public speaking things you know what's the trick you know what do i do to make this good uh what do i do to make this not just the same old same old so i thought we would give maybe our take on what we do to make public speaking fun slash interesting um what do you got well i would say first public speaking is a skill so a lot of people think well i speak all the time and i speak in public therefore i'm probably going to be decent at public speaking it doesn't really work that way so public speaking some people are talented and they are just better gary vaynerchuk's like that i think he's just better than everyone else but for most people it's a skill so i highly recommend like reading a book on it or like googling like how to be better at this it's a skill set and so there are tricks i don't think that this is like the best time for us just to say like what all the tactics are but a few of them are just like on storytelling and it's very similar to stand-up comedy which again some people are just born better but a lot of people you just have to learn and try and so buy a book on it and i think that's actually the easiest first step is there a book you'd recommend on it or just not the top of your head yeah i think what's the one that you and i were reading on storytelling uh by the guy who like won all the muse to come story worthy i think yeah i think soy worthy was awesome that i had a bunch of takeaways from that and then speak like a ted talk or something like that it's called like the ted talker ted talk speakers guide or something like that that's quite good but the story worthy i actually thought was pretty phenomenal so i'm gonna tell you what i told him i said um uh and by the way he had also said he's like i wanna bring that showmanship that you guys talked about so they think he's picking up on on what we talked about so i said all right three things i said number one um be in peak state it's very easy when you're nervous to go kind of like inward you're kind of low energy your mouth's a little dry your shoulders hunched over um like fundamentally as soon as you walk out there people are gonna read your body language they're gonna read your energy and they'll start to respond to it when somebody comes out and they're electric you can feel that they're excited that they got a like a bounce in their step you're paying attention because you want to know what they're all about i said so just make sure before you go out there do some push-ups go run a wind sprint do some jumping jacks do whatever you got to do physically to literally just get blood flowing and be in a like more uh like high performance state i said think about it athlete doesn't go on the field until they are warmed up until they're ready a singer or a dancer a performer they're not going to go on the stage until they're warmed up and they're feeling loose and warm it's the same thing if you're going to go talk you want to feel loose and warm both in your voice but also your body so that's the first thing just do the physical get the physical part right the second is remember this is this is the first of many you'll do this 500 more times so this might feel like a big deal now but a year from now this will be an afterthought you'll just you won't even really remember how it went um just treat it as a practice rep one of 500 times you're going to do this it's a chance to experiment with some things that'll depressurize this moment for you and it'll teach you to remember that like this is just like you said it's a skill you got to get good at it to get good at any skill you need practice reps i said the last one i said storytelling i said have a back pocket story right so what's a backpacker story it's like you started the podcast uh that we just recorded with the um dude i gotta tell you this funny story on you know there's something that happened to me today before we do this i was walking through the park and these nannies were getting attacked with this guy and i'm they're in my fanny pack and me and the fanny and the nannies we all fought these guys off basically it's like this funny story and it doesn't need to be a hilarious extreme story like that it could be anything it could be like let's say you're at a conference um you might be like you know before we start i just talked to this guy in the back and he asked me a really interesting question i want to ask you guys this too because i honestly i think we might be really split on how we answer this question already you really want to know what it is and i've taken control of the scenario and i've made it already an interesting talk before we jump in and say hi my name is this i'm from this and today i'm here to talk to you about blah blah blah so have a have a story in your back pocket it could be fun interesting controversial whatever something that's going to kind of get them and the trick is i said just you need to be excited by it if you're excited by it they'll be excited by it remember the um the lesson that what's her name miss excel that like woman who's she basically teaches you how to use use excel better but somehow that's like going viral on tick tock and why is something as boring as excel tricks going viral on tick tock one of the reasons is she like comes out with this crazy energy she seems really excited by this stuff and it's just enjoyable to watch her do it even if you're not even going to use excel that day it's just enjoyable to watch somebody do that and she says this in her interview she goes content is the transfer of emotion i got to get myself into the emotion of being excited about something if i ever want you to be excited by it i have to get myself to be fascinated by something if i want you to be fascinated by it and she's like i just get myself into that state then i run to the phone click record and i start to start to do my thing and it's like that's actually what it is content is the transference of emotion and so what most people try to do is they think about what they're gonna say which is intellectual that shit's words people don't remember the words that you said um they will remember if you had some emotion some energy behind you and they'll remember the vibe they remember how you made them feel and they'll take away just a few nuggets out of what you said most of what you said 90 of what you say will go in one ear and out the other our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better and that's a thing i was i tell people all the time i told you this when you early on when i was maybe six months ahead of you in terms of content you're like i want how do i write these articles and i was like it's not really about what you want to teach it's about what you want to make someone feel and oftentimes when people give presentations they think well i'm talking about this like i'm talking about like mosquitoes and how they like cause malaria in africa and this is like a really serious thing it's like yeah it could be serious but you need to weave in some stories and you need to do some crazy and it's no different than a comedy show or a play where you capture attention yes you're doing it about something important and isn't just entertainment but you have to leave that in there one of my favorite tricks i've saw is when they brought up malaria is when steve uh bill gates or someone let uh talked about uh malaria and mosquitoes and he goes i want to show you why this is an important deal and he opens up this jar and mosquitoes fly out all over the place he goes i'm going to tell you about how many people die from malaria which comes from mosquitoes just like this and like so people like are like you know that's showmanship and so it's the same way with any talk you're doing you don't have to do something that extreme but it starts with the story it starts with an emotion and then i would say the last thing is you have to treat people your audience regardless if they're smart you kind of got to treat them dumb meaning a lot of people what they do is they put way too much emphasis on the slides and in my opinion most talks should be able to be like at least a b level without any slide the slide maybe makes it go from a nine to a ten but the slides to me um it's kind of like when you are in when you're in a band it's about how do i make this song great it's not how do i make this one little guitar solo awesome it's like no dude the guitar solo exists to make the song great the song doesn't exist to make that solo awesome it's the other way around and so it's about my my it's about my performance and it just so happens that this powerpoint is just one piece of that and i need to treat people stupid and assume that they're not going to read the small text and it's up to me to use my words my body language in order to make them feel something and the the the slides are just an extra added effect that's right uh all right i think that's great there's a ton more i feel like we could probably like there's probably 10 more things but really the reality is you don't need to know all the things if you just do the things we talked about right which is basically you know show up with energy have some showmanship through either a little magic trick or a story or something like that and treat it like practice because you're you're going to need to do this 100 times before you're you're any good at it if you just internalize those three you're going to be you know ahead of head of the curve you'll be ahead of you know 80 90 of people practice not the game we're talking about practice yeah we're talking about practice [Music] you

and what he was doing was every day he would wake up at like whatever five or six in the morning and he would go to phil's coffee and he would sit down with his laptop first he'd tweet out that he was at phil's every single day and then he would start just literally emailing and tweeting at people that they should be posting their product on product hunt or hey i posted it for you would love to hear your comment or hey i noticed this product that's a lot like yours i wonder if you know or like that's in your industry you should check this out and all he was doing was like manually being the human notification system for product time he was the he was the human invite system the notification system the retention system he was all of it [Music] i have a feeling you're coming with fire or something you seem fiery today i got some good stuff uh also i just watched do you ever watch bar stools interviews with people you watch are you talking about the caleb presley one i don't know who that is maybe that's his name it's the one with their they interviewed aaron rodgers i watched it today dude his name's caleb have you seen it so it's called uh it's called sunday what's it called like conversations and basically like ice cream yeah it's like this like chubby guy named glenny balls who's sitting in the background and then it's caleb who's like a bro but he's kind of he's actually really funny he's hilarious he's quite smart and he interviews these people he asked the best questions he's so good have you seen the past ones i've seen a few of them this one is the first one i've watched like the whole thing and uh god he's good man he that is amazing so i watched that and sometimes that's all it takes you just see someone being great at their thing and you're like i'm gonna be great today that's it i'm gonna be great today i saw great now i need now i need to be great he makes me self-conscious caleb presley is is is very very good at these funny awesome interviews he's great on the spot he's very good yeah he delivers um all right so let's do can i tell you something this is kind of amazing all right this is gonna be a little hard to share on here but i put this in to the dock so you can click the links uh ben if you can let's screen share some of this stuff that's gonna i'm gonna tell you this is i saw this ad on instagram and this is the most amazing marketing funnel i've ever seen maybe ever but definitely for a musician so check this out stop scrolling you have 24 hours we're carolunka an independent hip hop group last year we had the honor of being placed on brock hampton's official community playlist and we were also shattered out by kenny beats kira lanco go off i bet you can do it this year we're trying to grow our fan base so for the first 15 people who dm us on instagram in the next 24 hours we're going to send you a special gift swipe up the dms now so the the beginning of the the audio didn't play there but he goes do you recognize these people and it's like biggie pock whoever like just like a bunch of famous rappers it goes stop scrolling and then he basically does this little thing so i was like so so uh ben levy ben sent this to me and i was like what is this amazingness let me i i must swipe up i must know what this free gift is so i do it what does that lead you to it opens up facebook messenger with a direct message already ready for their like for their team and it just says send it automatically sends them a message from you saying send me the free gift okay so that happens and then they they respond yo what's good immediately right so you're like okay i don't know what's happening here but i'm intrigued the next thing that happens i have screenshots of the stuff um below you blow some of your research so they go yo sean what's good so they use my name in the in the thing they pull it from facebook messenger and then it says give us a little bit we'll get back to you asap with your gift and some more details thanks for your patience okay cool one day later i get a message it's an audio note from the guys who are the the rap group and it's basically like introducing themselves and and again this is kind of mass produced but it works they go yo sean and then it's the audio which is like yo here's our story where these guys blah blah here's what we're doing and then they said um you know for your gift we wrote your own custom song we personalized the lyrics just for you and um and so you know let me know what you think it's links to us to links to their soundcloud and it says sean king of the first million that's the name of the song so then [Music] now he don't message us invest your funds with the fiat get it done but i can't afford it to keep it real so they sent the song and i'm like okay well i don't know what's happening right now but like this has never happened before where you go from there's an instagram and an instagram ad about a band that you never heard of and you swipe up then they send you an audio note and a personal message then they send you a song the following day that's like got your name in it and then they followed up again and they're like yo i don't know if you're in new york i'm gonna pretend you are we're doing a show here's the here's a link to a show here's the tickets and then they send like this automated graphic using canva of you could see it there it's like me crowd surfing uh it's like down i don't know what is going on but this band is kind of genius in the way that they're promoting themselves and they're still small they're called keralanka they're still small but when i saw this i was like i don't know they may not they may or may not be the best musician but they are probably have the highest overlap of market like kind of marketing genius for a young band and they play music right it's like there's a lot of marketing geniuses out there but they don't make music there's a lot of musicians but they don't know anything about marketing these guys know enough about both to be very dangerous i just thought this is amazing is this uh effective you think i don't understand so they're basically doing all this to get you to buy tickets to their new york show is that right well it's not just that like it's not just to buy takes a specific show it's basically the way i think about it is every business you gotta find a way to get like your first hundred or first thousand customers who love you and that's like a really specific thing it's like i just need a thousand customers who love us whether it was for this podcast like we needed a thousand people to listen who actually really love the show and um and every business has this and so the question is like how do you actually do that and uh at yc they have this thing that they say do things that don't scale they talked about the early airbnb guys how they used to go and they themselves would go and call all the hosts of their new york airbnbs they would go to their houses they would take professional looking photos so that the listings looked better and people were always laughing like you know that's not going to scale and they're like well first of all it doesn't even matter if it scales because right now i don't need scale i don't have scale i just need something that's going to get a thousand people to really love us and um that's what these guys are doing i thought this is just an amazing example of like actually betting on that strategy which is that you need a small group of people to really love you and go to bat for you not a bunch of people who just kind of sort of like you or oh yeah i got you know we got 10 000 views on this thing it's like okay but those those views do they matter what are those views worth versus somebody who's got a story to tell like i'm doing right now or somebody who's really impressed by you or feels interested in you or is invested in your story actually goes and clicks and learns more about you and you know it goes deeper down your funnel so i think that this is amazing because they're showing they're brute forcing that thousand thousand fans who who really care about them dude i always hated this thing of well it doesn't scale or you got to build the scale i've always hated that conversation for a few reasons number one most people aren't going to make it to the point where they ever have to worry about that number two you can brute force it and just manually and by hand do things to a pretty large number i think the largest number that i've seen i let's see but i think mr beast uh is is his aho operation is worth hundreds of millions of dollars that's a pretty brute force not i i don't know what it looks like but just talking to him fairly unsophisticated operation i think when i talk to nerdwall you know nerdwall it's a it was a blog that was at the time making like 30 million in revenue and i i think like 15 million in profit incredibly i like saw a little bit behind the scenes super unsophisticated what what are some other things and it was basically just them just blogging what are some other examples of things that you've seen that are look like a tech or internet based company on the outside but behind the scenes are like pretty rudimentary and not even like they've not even thought like oh we need to automate or scale or whatever so our buddy ryan hoover built product hunt and um he listens to pod so he he came on the pod as well and told the story but i was there kind of like front row when he was building that thing meaning like i think i'm user number 17 in product history or something like that like very very early first dozen people or so that were on the platform and so and for some of us he was sending like updates on like literally what he was doing to build it and what he was doing was every day he would wake up at like whatever five or six in the morning and he would go to phil's coffee and he would sit down with his laptop first he'd tweet out that he was at phil's every single day and then he would start just literally emailing and tweeting at people that they should be posting their product on product hunt or hey i posted it for you would love to hear your comment or hey i noticed this product that's a lot like yours i wonder if you know or like that's in your industry you should check this out and all he was doing was like manually being the human notification system for product time he was the he was the human invite system the notification system the retention system he was all of it and at the time i was like this guy's literally like sending out like hundreds of personal welcome emails a day maybe 100 personalized tweets per day and then he would like you know sure enough by six or seven p.m he'd close up his laptop he'd go to the gym and he's a very like structured guy and he would like go home he he hits the bed early he's not like uh you know he's not like going out and socializing or doing anything like that he'd wake up again the next day and he would do the same thing and sure enough that community that we were part of i think that first group he sent it to was like maybe 25 people and it didn't even have his own website he was using this thing called linky dink at the time it's like some third-party tool to go use and every day he would send out the email more email digest in the morning of the cool stuff people posted and then he would tag each person with individualized thing oh sean i know you guys had once looked at building a product like this what do you think about this and get you to share your thoughts because he was asking in such a nice personalized way that okay i'll go ahead and reply but that generated all of the activity for that early community and why did product not work why did it sell for 20 million dollars well because at the beginning he got the right people from silicon valley to actually participate in the thing and the way he did that was like it's like when you watch somebody build a fire it's like first they're just like you know they're just hitting the flint or they're rubbing the two sticks together just to get the spark and then when it's there they're sort of covering it they're just blowing on it gently and then they're adding just the next little few pieces of sticks and they know it could go out at any moment and that's how it feels to build a community i saw you do the same thing with trends basically right like for trends when you wanted to launch that it was by no means going to be a slam dunk and i think most of us who are in trans would say the research reports you guys sent out which was the product they were cool but the real reason anybody liked trends i think was the facebook group and all it was was a facebook group there was nothing you know you didn't build that you just literally went down there and typed typed you know a title in and hit enter and then but what made the facebook group good was you picked you hand-picked who could get in and then every day i felt like you were sharing like some super high quality stuff to get a conversation started in the group chat was that intentional when you do that 100 it was intentional and so when i i did two or three interesting things so this yeah so trends right now is making many many millions of dollars in subscription revenue and it's pretty simple and there's like i think there's only five people who work on it so it's like a pretty profitable thing and we added these people to this facebook group and i would do a few things the first thing i would do is even people who didn't pay who i thought were impressive like you or some of our other friends i'd be like hey i'm adding you to this group and i would just tell them and i would manually add them and i'd be like oh look who just joined you know it's shawn shawn has done all these impressive things funny seeing you here how cool um if you have any questions for uh sean just like ask him right here in the comments and i would do that all the time so i would add these people who did that that worked by the way because i was like oh [ __ ] this group has cool people and it's in reality you added 300 paid members that i've never heard of and then you added one interesting person but you made that intro post baller you're like you ever seen a plane fly yeah that's because of this guy you know it's like it was always the most like ball or intro you're like um you know did you know they didn't have hundred dollar bills until this guy came around it's like i did that all the time and and the other thing i would do is i would just write out all these long posts of like interesting things that i was thinking about and then i would tag certain people who a either accomplished something like that and would talk about it or b i would write comments for smart people and message them and say hey do me a favor post this on there or i would write posts for other people and make them comment one time uh when hubspot was looking to buy us i saw that brian halligan the then he's the founder and then ceo of the company he joined and i messaged like 80 people and i said hey uh reply to brian here's the message to say to him and so many people commented and that he checked in like eight hours later he's like oh my god i've been overwhelmed with replies and notifications i can't believe how thriving this community is uh and i remember thinking like got him got him and that's but that like interaction is how you make all like that's that feeling you want all community members to feel we used to do that all the time but yeah ryan hoover is a good example of people who have grown without like really caring about scaring scaling we should have like a segment another time where we like actually think about like the most like thrown together duct tape [ __ ] that we've seen that has gotten quite large um and i'm gonna give you another um angle towards this so there's one which is the brute force do things that don't scale and they almost do them even longer than that they do it even past the point where you shouldn't be able to keep this up like airbnb still does that photographer thing by the way they turned that unscalable thing of them going to people's apartments taking photos for them and saying hey we'll we'll improve your listing for you and now they just have a fleet of photographers around the country that'll just come do this for your listing it's like it's that they turned it into a scalable thing and that's another thing when people talk about well that's not scalable it's like uh yeah it is like they'll talk about like an ad agency and they're like that's not scalable it's like what do you mean of course it's scalable you just hire 5 000 employees like that's scalable and maybe that's not what you want to do but like yeah everything virtually everything is scalable like you just have to add a ton of people probably most things can scale past what most people think uh like you know this also happens in engineering all the time you work with engineers and they're like well we're going to need to build it right before we launch or we're going to build it right because this won't work in production and so this won't work when it scales it's like then you hear these stories like yeah facebook was written in php why i don't know that's just the language he knew at the time and that's what he did you know it's like and yeah actually it still runs you know years later it was still running in that like way past where it was supposed to um and dude i've got friends that are early at uber and friends that are still at uber and a lot of people don't know this but i they might consider him a founder but the first or second employee was this mexican guy and you know he i think he was lived in america for a little while but at the time he was living in mexico and so the early versions of uber were written with a ton of spanish in the code and and so my friends who were earlier they told me yeah like i forget this guy's name do you know who i'm talking about i've i remember reading about him but i don't know his name topic yeah he was he was mexican and so they and he had you know his friends in mexico were like yeah well well i might i know a good agency we're going to have him do it and they said it was kind of thrown together and kind of janky and i've got friends now that still work there and they say every once tomorrow we'll find spanish in the early code base because that is you know what these guys are writing we'll find like spanish notes and things like that and that was the early version of uber and think about how many rules of uber got violated of how many rules of startups that uber violated so for example um the uber founders travis and um garrett they didn't work on it full-time uber was not a project they were willing to do they just literally tweeted out hey we need a general manager and random guy named ryan graves was like i'm a hustler i'll do it and they're like all right cool it's like they literally like delegated the ceo job then did they have a super strong technical team technical co-founder who could write the code and do this in-house nope use the third-party dev shop to build the first version of the app they outsourced the coding you mostly the investors who invested in uber would tell you if you're a product guy and you go in and you say yeah i'm gonna just use an agency to write the code for the app they'd be like uh yeah this is not yeah no go okay then what's the next thing then they literally broke the actual laws it was like running and they they got a cease and desist from san francisco saying hey for every day you're operational you owe us five thousand dollars per day and they just kept going then the next you know they just violated rule another one at the time i remember at the time when uber first came out airbnb was was popular at the time and i talked to our investor i was like should we be doing a product like this he's like oh no bits not atoms that was like a common phrase in silicon valley which is you want to do startups that are software based because they can they're the ones that can scale and have profit margins all these things with real world cars and homes and t-shirts and stuff like that like that stuff super hard to scale ends up being super super low margin and okay you know some people say oh they're right you know uber's not that profitable but the reality is that the founders and investors in uber did fantastically well um scaling this thing up and it was kind of a narrative violation there was all these narrative violations all these these general rules that were broken that like today if you said yeah i'm the i'm the founder of this thing no i'm not working on it full-time i found a guy on twitter to be the ceo and then we're using this agency in mexico to build the app yeah we're the next big thing that doesn't fly and guess what it worked dude we got to go on a quick story tangent that's kind of what this whole first half is going to be i guess but there's this guy named scott belski i'm friends with them or i used to be a little uh friends with them i haven't talked to him in a while but you do you know scott yeah i'm i like him a lot i like to think of freshers though the reality is i've talked to him twice yeah friendly with him he invested in my company and i've hung out with him once or twice he doesn't know this but he's kind of like i'm his secret admirer like he's like this like good looking handsome dude who dresses nice as nice and seems like really wealthy and rich and like i i like if i see him i'm like dude you are the best and i've talked to him if you have 10 million dollars at a jaw line guess who's all in sam is all in yeah yeah definitely all it so like i love this guy and uh he's great so basically i got to tell you a quick scott belsey story so right now he's like uh an executive at adobe but not just like an executive i'm pretty sure he's like in line to be ceo and a lot of people don't realize this adobe is one of like the 30th largest companies in the world i think their market cap is like three four hundred billion dollars and scott belski is he's pretty young he's in his early 40s and he uh i cold emailed him to invest in the hustle and that's how i became friends with him and i met with him one time and he goes yeah so like when i was 26 years old i was starting my company called behance so behance is basically it's behance and dribble or like the two companies where you go online and designers can host their portfolio and kind of talk to one another and he was like i was just starting this company and in my head i knew he worked at goldman and i knew that he was from like a wealthy like jewish family i think his fa his grandfather started like kaplan you know kaplan university uh in that way yeah and so i was like stereotyping him oh you guys just you had everything handed to you to him and like he told me a few stories where i was like oh you actually like it's not exactly how it was from the outside and he said i left goldman and i was making 90 grand a year there and when i left i had like 50 or 60 thousand dollars saved i started behance it didn't go very well and we bootstrapped it and i noticed that with behance we were getting a lot of traffic from two different websites the first was called stumbleupon and people and designers would post school designs and we would get traffic from stumbleupon and the second was a small company called pinterest and i emailed both these guys uh and this was i forget what year 2011 2010 he goes i've emailed these guys i go hey you guys are sending us like hundreds of people a day which for us at the time was a lot of people what what are these websites and this guy ben told me about this website called pinterest and then this guy named garrett told me about stumbleupon and ben was like hey i'm going to raise a little bit of money do you want to invest it's a 3 million evaluation and scott was like dude i only have like 50 grand and but i don't want to like look like a noob to this guy whatever i'll invest fifteen thousand dollars and that's a big deal to me and then garrett was like hey um my friend and i are starting this other thing none of us are gonna work there because i'm too busy running summer pond but it's basically like a car service and uh scott was like i don't wanna invest in a limo company like there's no way a limo company's going to take off uh but like i don't want to look like an idiot this guy's been sending me some traffic and i kind of want to like appear a little bit like a big shot and so he gave him fifteen thousand dollars i think at a 3.5 million valuation and he did both of these in the span i think of about two weeks so he's like i basically had like 50 or 60 grand in my checking account at the time my startup that i was bootstrapping was only doing okay it wasn't making much profit and i was doing consulting on the side to pay the bills but i did my wife was like angry at me but i gave him each fifteen thousand dollars fast forward however many years they both went public around the same ish time and i remember sending him something to his house and he sent me his address and i remember the address being this like really fancy town home because i looked it up and i was like doing the math and i'm pretty sure each of these fifteen thousand dollar checks turned into around fifty to a hundred million dollars each inside a span of like you'll have to look up when they went public but they almost went public right around the same time and they gave them money each at the same time and another thing a lot of people don't know is behance his company sold i think for 175 million dollars and i think he owned he told me around 70 of it he owned the majority of it and so this guy has just knocked it out the park over and over and over again and a lot of it came because of uber and pinterest early on and he was like i don't think these are that good of ideas but i just i don't want to look silly that's a that's an amazing story i love that story it reminds me i uh i just got a dm from this guy by the way this is nowhere near related i'm not trying to compare apples to apples here it's very hard to have a story that compares to uber and pinterest but uh there's a guy who i don't know maybe six months ago or nine months ago something like that i was like getting kind of interested in the like ai stuff about like you know this basically artificial intelligence i can create art and things like that and i said something offhand on the pod so somebody reached out and they were like hey you know heard you're interested in this i'm trying to make apps that will do this uh we just released our first one you know i want to see what you think about it and uh you know we're raising a little bit of money we'd love to see if you wanted to invest never replied i go uh i get another dm or no i uh i see somebody mention this app and i go i go click on the founder and i click the dm oh this guy dm me a while back saying i invest i should i should see how it's going so i go hey how's the biz going i'll share a screenshot of this hey how's the biz going and he goes good man good yeah that app i really ended up releasing it's been downloaded 120 million times and then i released another one and it's also been downloaded like 100 million times and um yeah it's really it's going really well man how are you i was like well uh i'm i'm currently walking off of a cliff because i never responded to that initial dm yeah everybody's like well i recently switched from trader joe's to whole foods i've been tickering with that i just did my 401k match yes fascinating um not much you uh that's great i want to share one other story that's kind of related to do things that don't scale this is something i actually learned from those guys dylan and henry so i'm a big fan of this like idea that you have to find a way to learn from three groups of people people that have done it before so people who've done it a bunch of times so that's you know people normally try to go learn from them mentor type of people people that are in the game their peers just alongside you that's kind of how we got to know each other we were in a peer group a mastermind group and no we haven't made it but like we're all trying to make it at the same time and so we can learn a lot from each other and then lastly is people who are just starting out in the game fresh they don't know any better and there is a certain tactic to like a spend time with each of those three groups and then b be humble enough and know how to ask the right question so that you know how to actually get advice from all three of those groups because if you ask the same question to all three you're not gonna get valid information you're not gonna get the right answers from all three right like the question you would ask to somebody who's been through it before and the things you should talk to them about are different than the ones that you should talk to your your buddy who's going through it right now and the 19 year old who just graduated from college you can't ask the same question so i'll tell you something that the sort of the 19 21 year old or whatever i don't know how old they were at the time maybe 21 22. uh dylan and henry they were fans of the pod then they flew they offered to come help us with our video setups at the time and previously they were fans of the pod and they would chop up clips for us and share it on social media and a lot of their videos were beautiful awesome and they just brute forced their way to having a relationship with us exactly and that became a a full-on agency that does you know pretty well they they did it for us that they did it for the all-in podcast they did it for a bunch of and so people kind of know them now um but at the time nobody really knew who they were they were just guys who just graduated from college they had their own podcast which was kind of like ours uh but no you know you can go look at the views nobody nobody watches the thing that's okay like you know it's most podcasts nobody listens to especially ones by guys who just graduated from college but they flew out to our house there and they were installing the like kind of studio setup in my garage at the time and um and i went out there i was like you guys need some water you guys are like you guys are right you guys you guys eating anything i was like kind of like parenting them i was like you know what are you guys okay what are you doing here and um and so i went out there and i started shooting the [ __ ] with them i was talking to them and i was like so what's your guys is like i was like give me advice like if i was your friend and i'm like you guys got a podcast that's pretty cool like most people you raised don't have a podcast like what do you what's your strategy what are you trying to do why are you trying to do it what are you trying to do and i was like explain it to me like i was your buddy and they're like well um you know we kind of we like podcasting it's fun so that's why we do it the second thing is um we just think that like making content like we don't have money to go advertise we don't have like we don't have connections that we could just go knock on a door and get into some get distribution somewhere so like content is our only chance so we just wanted to get good at content the best way to get good is just do it a bunch i was like all right that's another smart thing and i go but nobody's watching your [ __ ] right so like is it even working it's kind of like what you're saying about this band thing like does this even work like this is cool it's interesting but is this valuable like is this actually gonna work yeah and he goes oh i'm just wait he is nobody watches it today he goes but someday if we start to get people to watch there is now a library he goes we call it our binge bank it's a place where you can go and you can binge dylan and henry and i was like he's like yeah well basically we just want to have a rabbit hole for you to go go down because if anybody ever gets it like today nobody's interested but if people ever get interested i want to have this bank of content that they can go binge and sure enough after like you know 45 minutes down this rabbit hole you're gonna walk out being like i think i love these guys i feel like i know these guys and i want to hang out or work with these guys and i heard that i was like that's really [ __ ] smart i was like that's the way to think about content because most content doesn't just like immediately hit and blow up but you want to have this and i thought about it because i was like there are several people who i've gone down that rabbit hole with and i've come out with that same exact conclusion after a 45-minute dig you do this all the time like you discover somebody you go read everything there is about them you go read their old blog you watch their old talks and you come out you be like this guy is awesome this girl is amazing and they had to create that like library of themselves that personal library to go and let you binge and i thought about it because you know the band like the the guy macklemore the like the famous rapper guy i remember maybe 10 years ago now me and my buddy trevor we started like we like found his one of his songs and we were like oh this guy's cool who is this guy and he had a binge bank he had these vlogs he was doing on youtube of him like trying to make it as a rapper it'd be like we're going to do this show at this small college in wichita oh we like we're wait every day right now we're waking up at this time we're trying to record in the studio because we suck at creating the creative process so we're just trying to train ourselves right they were just like just kind of sharing along the way and we watched this stuff and we were like i remember these videos had less than a thousand views there were like 700 views on youtube at the time like i just went back and looked at it now those have each like millions or like close to a million views each on those videos at the time less than a thousand and we became super fans of this guy why because it's fun to be early we liked what they were all about and we felt like the quality of content was like higher than the views and so that made it for like an exciting it's like we found a treasure dude people say that in our comments on youtube like oh i'm like i'm i'm surprised this is bigger or like i'm happy to be here yeah they're like they're like i'm happy we're catching it yeah and and that that definitely gives me encouragement it makes me happy but yeah people say that in our you little do they know that like our podcast has like 10 times more download so they're like oh this little shitty podcast only has 10 000 videos on this thing or 10 000 views on this thing and i'm like yeah we suck share please share please um but i i'm a big fan of this binge bank concept i've i once i thought once they said that that clicked with me i started thinking about our stuff that way and then also i started remembering yeah there's actually a bunch of people who i've gone down their rabbit hole and like and actually there could be like a product that's like this i know youtube is kind of structured this way but i kind of wish that you could just have a thing which is like your greatest hits it's like yo if you if you're kind of interested in me this is the curated rabbit hole so this is my tweet that went viral this is this video this was the first thing i ever made this was you know this blog post i wrote back in the day it's kind of stupid but like you know it captured how i was thinking at the time i have two tools that i use regularly and i'm paying subscribers up the first any do you read a lot of biographies no none so i read about take over the world yeah i read a ton of biographies and so any biography that talks about a person who is a little bit pre-internet era i'm a subscriber of newspapers.com which has aggregated like every newspaper ever so like for example i was reading a biography about dan gilbert or something about dan gilbert the founder of rocket mortgage i think it's called the guy who owns the cleveland cavaliers or i forget he owns everything and so like his company got it was called rock financial originally his company got popular in the 90s and so i just googled rock financial dan gilbert set newspapers.com to 1985 says i knew that's when you started to 1990 uh and then went public in 92 so i was like i'm gonna find everything i read all these articles uh about him before he was like you know it was like really like he was in the making at that point and so that's like my favorite tools newspapers.com the second one for anything that's internet related is web archive so like whenever i talk to anyone who's like popular on the internet i go and look back at right when they started i like to look at their old websites and you could like see the trend and you can see the trajectory and that starts that teaches me a little bit about patterns and like all right it's okay and it also makes me feel like all right it's okay to be shitty even at this size it's okay to be only okay around this size you know what i mean totally totally yeah you go look at early startup landing pages i have a blog post about this actually like 10 throwback uh landing pages and it's like go look at the first version of airbnb of uber of snapchat of all these things and then you'll be like oh why are we trying to perfect this before lunch like if you could start there and end up where these guys did like i can start wherever the hell i am now and launch and then make it better over time um do you uh you want to go to can i let me let me bring up one so yeah this this guy dm to me and i found his youtube video and it was really amazing so basically into this has got me thinking on this whole topic but in 2014 this guy graduated from stanford and he got five job offers and he did this video that he goes here's the offers that i got in 2014 and here's what happened and here's like how like this story played out so he in the video it's really great so uh actually it looks like someone's highlighting the video what's his name how do people find this his name is rahul so if you google like rahul uh tech pond pandey yeah so you google that or just like rahul and then like tech jobs and i bet you will come up so basically i'm gonna summarize it but here the video is great but here's basically the offers that he got so the offers that he got from twitter with a combination of stock and salary was 190 000 with a combination of stock and cash his facebook offer was two hundred thousand dollars a year his microsoft one was around also two hundred thousand dollars a year his square one around 160 000 a year and this is both a combination of stock equity and sign-up bonus and his google one was 250 000 a year now fast forward eight years what would that stock plus cash be worth so basically the stock the cash is mostly stagnant i think he added like eight percent annual growth the stock he looks at what each uh what it grew since then so his twitter comp fast forward it would almost be the same because their stock hasn't grown his facebook stock it actually would have gone a lot higher but right now facebook stock is down a ton and so his facebook's uh first year comp went from 200 to 220. his microsoft comp it started at 200 if you fast forward today it would be worth around three hundred thousand dollars a year now here's where things get interesting his square stuff and and he was only 22 when he graduated or something like that and he his first year salary and comp back then would be 160 000 fast forward the stock is now worth a 580 000 and his google stuff was worth 250 000 a year now worth almost 700 000 a year and keep in mind so here's a few takeaways from this the first takeaway he said this funny thing in the video he goes square offered me something uh that i didn't think was any good because the recruiter said you know if square one day becomes a seven billion dollar company the stock that we're offering you now it's only worth a hundred thousand dollars over four years it could be worth four hundred thousand dollars but he goes i'm really doubtful that square will ever be a seven billion dollar company now it's worth 50 billion and it's down right now i think at its peak it was 70 billion uh so the thing that is really hard to understand is that everything at the time most things seem expensive and the reason why things seem expensive is because exponential growth is incredibly challenging to understand so if i tell you that something is going to grow at seven percent a year every single year that's actually kind of hard to understand but that what that means is it's going to double every 10 years if it's going to grow if it's going to grow at 30 a year which a lot of these tech companies are that means it's going to double i think every two or three years and like exponential growth is really hard to understand the another thing that is really interesting is uh leveraging offers and negotiating is very possible even if you're a 22 23 24 year old and so you always do better when you have another offer in hand and you play them uh off one another and finally the most important thing for people listening employees at tech companies 100 can get meaningfully rich and people don't talk about that enough because it's a fairly safe way if you are good enough it's a high bar if you are good enough to get but it's still like a million plus jobs if you add together fang around there and they hire tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands a year so it's not like that coveted but if you can get a job at one of these tech companies and i'm talking about a tech company that's growing quickly and has at least a thousand employees relatively safe it is such a good way to build the wealth in a low risk way and the final most important thing on top of that is now's the time so we're you're talking about square being worth like you know it might be worth seven billion dollars i i have a very small lens here but i see what the private company valuations are they have reset and even better the public companies have reset so we have square facebook twilio maybe robin hood i think like a company like hubspot or something like that a coin base all these valuations are pretty low if you ask me and i think now's the time where you can get some of these offers where you're getting paid 100 200 300 000 a year in equity and that could be worth potentially eight figures in 10 years that's really interesting and a great um ad for hubspot very well done very native i enjoyed that one this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients hold history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better the when we were selling bebo we had a bunch of conversations and then you know you sort of compare offers you're like all right we had i think at the end we ended up with three offers we had a facebook offer we had the twitch offer and we had a not papered but like only because we turned it down early but he was interested the the discord offer and and i did an exercise recently where i looked back and i said what was i thinking then because i wrote it all down and how did it actually play out and i'll be damned if i wasn't wrong on every single thing i believed yeah let's walk through this yeah let's go through each one so for example we'll start with the one that's relevant to what you're talking about which is the stock so so basically discord was like look uh we like you guys we think this is cool but we there's no way we would come up with cash like you're talking about so it would need to be just a tiny bit of cash and then mostly stock but like we think our stock is great so what would uh let's say let's say that you walked away with a million dollars of discord stock back then and back then it wasn't that long ago that was four years ago yeah less than four years three years ago three four years ago something like that so at the time i went and talked to one of discord's investors i was like what do you think about this and they were like well it's real simple like today let's say discord is valued just around two you know one and a half two billion dollars um so let's say two billion um i know i think at the time discord was valued at a billion and it was one billion then and he goes you're basically just betting that discord could be worth five billion if if it gets to five then this is the best offer and if it's not going to get to five then this is the worst offer and so you just have to like you know make an educated decision about that and i was like in my head i was like well i do like i was a big admirer of discord i was like this court is kind of amazing uh the ceo at discord jason he's kind of amazing he of all the meetings that we took i thought he was the he was actually the most impressive in there and he cut straight to the chase and was like yeah i'll do this no you know the cash is going to be small maybe one two three million dollars um and then the rest will be stock and so you know you guys have to yeah is that interesting to you and at the time i was like no because that sounds really speculative and like illiquid and like i can't go buy anything cool and i can't like i the no the total number as valued today sounds way lower yeah and in my head i was just like i can't do this fast forward discord i think is worth about 15 billion now so it would have been by far the best deal uh so we had a million dollars deal if they gave you a million dollars of stock pro and private valuations that would be worth 15 million now in four years right correct and we were getting more than a million dollars of stock if we had done that deal okay so uh so that it was it was the worst deal it would have turned out to be that so now there was one caveat which is it was going to be vested so you know i'd also have to spend you know three years earning that stock or four years earning that stock which i i didn't yeah you probably would have been fired way before that yes so yeah one of the odds i was going to capture all that i don't know but like it just shows you know uh how our brain is not really like the idea of discord becoming worth 15 billion was not really like it didn't seem very likely but in actuality the odds were probably in its favor but it seemed like a very low probability of things it just sounded big it sounded like a big jump it's like is it am i betting that discord's gonna become 15 times bigger than it is today and actually yeah i did like the user base grew by two or three x the monetization grew the the overall market grew right there's like all these different ways that you just multiply these things together and you get you arrive at this private market valuation now and also whatever private markets have corrected maybe it's not worth as much now but like you know it's hard to say it's illiquid then the next one is the facebook offer and it's like all right well facebook's offer is higher in cash higher in stock um but we don't know about this we don't know exactly which which stock's going to perform better facebook or amazon they both seem like great stocks and so then it came down to intangible factors and we ended up ruling out facebook for some intangible factors we which were in retrospect somewhat silly reasons to decide uh the first was like twitch was the leader in game streaming and facebook was like nobody watches game shooting on facebook at the time and i was like oh man this is just gonna be like another startup like they they're they're called facebook but like in this niche they're at zero and they're hoping that we can help them win and like oh man and we're gonna be pushing a boulder up a hill i was like i just want to go join the warriors and go on the winning team facebook just had decided they were gonna win yet yeah exactly and also like my mentor was like that's such a stupid way to think about this like you're gonna walk into facebook and they're gonna be like um cool game streaming's over here and you're like actually i'm gonna wander around this area over here i'm gonna go play in virtual reality i'm gonna go to ai i'm gonna go to the you know news i'm gonna he's like you can just walk into any other department you want just go do that thing he's like they'll forget you even exist after they hire you like you're worried about what your day-to-day life is going to be like there and like you have no idea what your daily life is going to be like there and he was absolutely right by the way have you ever been to the facebook campus yeah it's it's basically just like a better college the way that i describe it it's like a mall where everything's free so like they have like a food court and they don't have just one pizza place they've got many pizza places and it's one my wife worked there and i would go and i'm like oh this is the best thing ever and they have restaurants like a sushi restaurant everything's free they've got a ice cream place everything's free they've got a woodworking shop everything's free a laundry place a barber a dentist the barber that's that's the biggest one i was like food i expected but when i just saw you just walk over to this guy and get a haircut i was like damn that was like that was like a big draw for me i was like i could just i don't have to go anywhere it's just free i just walk in and get a haircut that's kind of amazing yeah they're like it's free all you have to give us is your life deal yes did you say there's two pizza shops so how much would the facebook so a million in facebook back uh four years ago would be worth what um a million in facebook stock would have been uh it's it's gone i think up 30 since then so it's like you know million would have been 1.3 right so that's the like where the stock landed at it was about double so at its peak it would have been double right so and so in that one we made the mistake of basically um optimizing for really intangible things one one that seemed really tangible was like they weren't going to take our whole team and i was like oh i don't want to like toast at the celebration party of this acquisition and be like but not you four they didn't hire you guys so like uh you know it's been awesome the rest of us we're gonna go and you guys you won't believe the recommendation letter i'm gonna write you right like that that would have been [Laughter] so that wasn't gonna feel good of course as soon as we rejected them and they were like why and i was like well the team thing they're like dude we would have just hired them a few months later we just didn't have the head count yet like he's like uh he's like that's why and i was like yeah and the commute was really far down there he's like dude we have an sf office we could have got you in i was like awesome the commute they have a bus like a bus that basically has like a restaurant cafe like toilet internet tv on the bus it's not even a real commute anymore yeah people on the bus complained that like oh my god like the the line for the pedicure on the bus was so long this morning it's like i don't know what you're complaining about anyway so we made a decision we made it it was we made a really hard decision and whatever ended up fine but i guess like my point is it's really hard to forecast and predict these things and especially hard to forecast and predict what stock is going to be worth down the road that's awesome uh wow so so i have another topic that i want to go to all right quick i two quick ideas one is around what i just talked about predictions so um there's this company that uh brandon sent me that's called pressytaste i don't even know what this is a horrible name pressytaste if you go to presleytaste.prcitase.com and it's some kind of like basically it's a prediction engine i don't even honestly know exactly how this works but basically what it's doing is it's using data like um cameras um like historical trends whatever and what it's trying to do is tell the person in the back like how many burgers to put on the stove like how many how many fries to take out of the freezer uh because it's basically like how can we help you predict demand and so this idea aside i actually think that there's like a lot of different ways where this is really valuable so for example we own an e-commerce store and we're always trying to predict like how much inventory should we order we're ordering you know six to nine months in advance sometimes and it's so hard to forecast what's the world gonna be like six months from now it's like oh yeah turns out there was a pandemic a war a war like you know stemi checks that like caused everything to go up and then like everything that could go down and then shipping broke and like it was impossible to predict but every bit like every better prediction saves us a lot of money and so i actually think that there's like a whole bunch of business problems that entrepreneurs could go after that basically just help you predict how much demand there will be there's a couple different ways you could go about this so for example for our e-com store it'd be nice to know how other e-com stores are trending are we all trending up trending down by how much percent year-over-year in our category because that would kind of tell us like where the overall market demand is uh another prediction might be you know if i'm if i'm a restaurant what is the foot traffic or the sort of drive-through traffic like this time of year right september or in this weather pattern how much traffic should i expect today that might tell me what i need for staffing and for you know food today versus any other day and if you just think about like if you can be smarter and cut waste by 10 to 15 percent in in these types of businesses and these types of industries that's probably going to add up to like the tens of billions or hundreds of billions of dollars per year of money saved and uh so i think these businesses are very interesting this whole like demand prediction uh industry is very interesting to me dude i have done a ton of research in the trends predicting business obviously like we have this thing called trends and before launching that i was like what what should we do i think i told you about this years ago but everything i'm about to say it's from years ago of research and i'm doing it mostly off memory so i'm going to be a little bit off but not totally off but have you heard of this company called wgsn i think i told you about them yeah they're the ones who like they like say like the color of the year is lavender and the smell of the year is like you know yeah lily or whatever but listen to this so they're publicly traded so these numbers are actually facts so the 2001 sorry 2021 revenue was 91 million pounds it's a british company so 91 million pounds so i don't know what that would be 130 yeah yeah like i don't know the conversion of monopoly money to real money but uh no 91 million pounds listen to their adjusted or their ebitda was 41 million so basically for every dollar they made uh 45 was like net income profit and what they do is they tell you which colors are going to be popular and i'm pretty sure the product they only have 6 500 customers so they're paying like 25 grand a year or something like that and i think the product basically is a quarterly pdf that tells you what colors they think might be popular and i'm almost positive the way that they get this is they put like tablets at fashion schools and they just ask students like what they're feeling what they're liking things like that so it's like they're asking fashion people i guess the people who are like i guess they like like are you a hipster are you a gay guy who lives in fort greene brooklyn like what like whatever you the qualifications are for like you are whatever you think is cool the normies you know like me are gonna like start wearing you know what i'm saying like what about you later ten months later yeah yeah oh do you are you an 18 year old who has 100 000 followers on tic toc check oh okay so like whatever they think there's going to be cool that's what they like what they predict is going to be cool and uh it's just a pdf and a real life use case of this is like starbucks is gonna like make a hundred thousand uniforms millennial pink is the new color so therefore let's make sure our name tags are this color so it's a no-brainer to spend 25 000 to get this like quarterly pdf as well as the ability to like dm someone who works at wgsn and say like which shade of green is like the thing that we should be using and so that's an interesting business and this trend predicting uh space i um i talked to somebody who does like a fashion company or whatever and they were like a fashion company or whatever yeah as you can tell i wear a blue shirt my fashion senses you know it's frozen in like the third grade right like i was writing cursive the last time i thought about fashion the uh and they were like lemons so in this year and i was like what like like i didn't i didn't understand what does that mean i mean a lemon like i thought they were temporary fruit and they were i thought they were talking about like literally like what you eat and they're like no as like a print or a pattern or a color and i was like okay i was like it sounds like you're just making things up they just pulled up their dashboard and they were like no like what look at the difference between like lemon and pineapple and it's like lemon juice pineapples were everywhere recently weren't they it was it was a bad example but it was like you know basically like you you guys pick is apples hot right now no apples apples are [ __ ] out dude apples are like you know they're so out right now lemons are so in pineapple what does that mean are so in it's like a picture of a lemon on a shirt yeah like a design with a lemon on it or a pattern or whatever right like all right um or or you know same thing with like scents and color palettes and things like that and so and i was like there's no way i was like this is all just like you know isn't this just you know ad agency fluff they're just fluffing each other with these like you know random ass like things and they're like no like this stuff is like the bible to us we we need to know what people are caring about in order to do that i don't know if it's this exact wsn or whatever i don't know if that's the exact one but they're like this could be a concept of like knowing which colors which sense which which styles which uh like uh dude is that our that's so exhausting yeah it sounds like a horrible business to be in like if i'm going to be in the fashion business i'm going to be in the men's tuxedo business that [ __ ] has not changed for literally a hundred years have you seen jack and titanic that's the same [ __ ] i'm going straight big and tall for men because literally the only criteria is like do you fit right you fit if you fit you're in if you don't fit you're out that's your only i was like that's what i like i like a simple yes or no when it comes to fashion it's just do you fit or not because i just can't find stuff that fits dude fashion's exhausting i i i that's not a business i want to be in although i do think like there are some brands you know what brand freaking crushes it and i never buy any other stuff though because it's just too expensive but a louis vuitton louis vuitton uh they're like suitcases louis pecan yeah lp um [Laughter] dude they've crushed it for like 150 200 years and it's the same ass logo the same colors and it's just timeless i do love those timeless things they they do there's like a little arbitrage going around i don't know if you've seen this but like with your few months ago somebody said this they're like because the dollar the euro like got to parity and the luxury stores hadn't changed the prices so basically like um things were always typically priced higher in dollars than in euros uh or whatever you might get that backwards but like you the louis vuitton bag you if you were in paris you could buy it in euros for a certain price that same bag was selling for more that same day if you just sold it in us dollars to a us customer and in paris you would also get the vat refund so you'd get you basically net getting something like 30 to 35 percent under market and that was like your spread that you could then go and sell it for in the united states it was like kind of crazy and so um there's like whole businesses that are around these like the version of a drug mule so it's like you can just pay someone who's traveling to like stuff a louis vuitton bag in their in their suitcase and bring it over for you across the border and um just because like you know going flying to europe to do this yourself is kind of inconvenient but there's already people flying from europe to the us every day and so there's whole businesses that are based around this like travel arbitrage and flying i just did research on one of these that i discovered it's called grabber so the url is g r a b r dot io so they went with like the misspelling and the dot io so you know they're really a startup but it's uh grabber.io and their whole [ __ ] is shop anywhere travel everywhere i guess that's a really bad tagline but basically what it means is it connects you with people who are with these drug mules these louis vuitton mules it connects you with people who are going to overseas places and you they'll buy [ __ ] for you and you'll give them the money and it's like a marketplace for that this i've got the stupid example of that there's this thing called a wicked laser because i'm like a grown up i'm like is the wicked part just like yourself describing a standard laser or is it actually called that how much of all of your world with money basically there's these i found this laser online this laser pointer online that's so strong that they made it illegal in america and if you shine something like a piece of paper it catches it catches fire and you can't have it because it reaches jets in the air and it's a chinese company and obviously i saw this laser and it's a 300 laser but you could only ship it to someone in canada and i'm like i want a laser that can light [ __ ] on fire like why do you not want that that will go perfect in my collection of like tasers this one laser i have a bb gun a blazer yeah a blazer from menswear so i had to find someone who would buy this in china for me and get it from canada to america for my 300 laser you should go work at grabber dot io that's what you should go do yeah we're just gonna sponsor every in cell like uh subreddit like do you like lasers you're tired of not getting your laser tired of driving to canada for your favorite lasers use grabber grab it for you bring it to you you're a 12 year old with money i saw this tick tock speaking of cool lasers i saw this tick tock a laser pointer that somebody was in their bed and they're pointing it at their light switch they go watch this they just held it on the as they go and it applied just enough pressure to turn it off and i'm like this is not real i think i don't know how this is edited but i was like the comments were like bro it's not real but like is [Laughter] because imagine not having to get out of your bed to turn your light off at night just grabbing your laser pointer off the bed stand and turning your light off that's dude so just imagine getting an instagram where you see a guy go watch this and he shines something across the room and it lights it on fire that's what i got caught with these wicked lasers wait how'd the light switch go down i don't know man i never got to the bottom of it i liked and followed to find out for part two they got me they said if i didn't forward that that tic tac to 10 people my family would die of lasers i had to do it oh my goodness that's stupid i want to tell you about another thing that's kind of interesting so you know like i think you met up with this guy i think his name he's like strip mall guy on twitter yeah yeah i know i know he's really like the same guy i'm one of those few people yeah no well sure strip ball guy is his fake name supposed to be trent uh no there's another guy who's real straight maybe they're two different guys all right i think stripper real estate trent and trip and strip mall guy yeah i met up with the strip ball guy and we became friends and so i have to make sure i don't accidentally say his name so one of those guys i forgot which one now sorry uh tweeted about private security and it caught my eye because he goes uh man private security is booming right now i know so many car like i've seen so many cops who retired and um are just doing this because it's better money and i was like what like okay tell me more and so um and so i started looking into this and basically a very very very briefly but do you know much about this like private security uh like you know like trend or industry i know that we used to hire them for our events because the insurance made you have one and you and i had a buddy who we knew who's or a friend of a friend who started a security business he started like an uber for bodyguards right like did it work he tried no he that one failed but he tried to make it like sexy it's like he just needed to do it not sexy so basically okay so there's some big players in this thing so private security so there's companies like securitas or if you just go to aus.com it's allied universal security which i think both of those are multi-billion dollar companies yeah so one's eleven billion that then seven billion i think they do everything from like mall cops to airports to events to whatever else but like it goes like smaller and smaller and more niche like down down as you go like corporate security so for example i remember when i was at at um working at a company i saw on the ceo's calendar a a meeting that was like with like the private security detail to go over like the latest updates to the private security i was like you got private security it's like well yeah like you know it's we're rich worth a lot like you know like worth a lot to this company so the company literally pays for private security for the executives um to be able to to you know to go out and do their thing and be safe and so i found this kind of interesting and it makes it like it makes sense to me and uh it makes sense to me that there's like a private world out there for kind of like retired either army military or police that might be higher paying and potentially you know an easier job um than what they're doing today who who were the executives that had security uh i don't want to say but but which company did you say the company i didn't hear you no because that would be okay to figure out at that point yeah i uh you know like zuckerberg and bezos they release what their security budget is each year and i think bezos was six million which is to me not a lot of money um right for facebook they said last year 26 million was spent on zuckerberg and his family which was six percent higher than in 2020. so that's kind of crazy right 26 million just on his personal uh security you know how many people work uh work for the secret service no 6 000 you know how many people they protect yeah you know how many people they protect 25 25 people spoken like a man who owns a taser and a laser dude i met a secret service agent at a wedding this weekend and i just asked them everything i go tell me everything and i you know they couldn't tell me anything really yeah i was gonna say a pretty shitty secret service guy and he's like big fan of the pod happy to share they just read out the wikipedia to me but like uh it was pretty interesting um that's cool no i don't know anything about security but i think it's speaking of tick tock there was a tick tock of a guy who saw jeff bezos on the corner in seattle just like waiting to cross the street and he's just like hey jeff and he like had his tick tock recording or whatever and he's like you know how's it going today whatever he's like going fantastic and he's like you know he's ready to like walk across the street and they go and somebody in the comments was like the top comment was like check out the hand of the security guy and you look and he had basically a false i think it was like a false hand and his and basically his real hand is like in his pocket like probably holding a gun or a taser of some some kind of weapon and he just had like a kind of a fake hand out and i saw that i was like that's awesome that's that's awesome dude you know what's even weirder is there was a i'm a ufc super fan there was a fight backstage amongst the ufc fighters and security got involved and i kept wondering who the [ __ ] is doing ufc security to keep the ufc fighters from not fighting each other yeah you know what i mean like what what like what type of job are they getting here too you know what i mean like they just see like something happening and like what are you going to do well you saw the the woman that dana white hired the best buy lady did you see this yeah she was a football player she like kept the woman or someone was trying to rob the best buy and she like got down low in like an o-line like it was like pushing her out of the way yeah the robber was trying to run out the store and the security guard from best buy just starts blocking this person from getting this guy from getting out and he's like he's desperately trying to get out because he can't just be like stealing and just get caught inside the store and she just ends up tackling him into like a bunch of boxes she gets fired from best buy because best buy's like hey uh liability you attacked a you attacked somebody in our store and she's like oh my god i'm doing my job i'm a security guard at best buy what did you want me to do and dana white was like that's [ __ ] like he went on instagram was like who is this woman i want to hire her and she's like now he's like personal security guard or something like that like she works for that really yeah dude i always see those guys and i'm like who like you need like an israeli trained like secret service agent to like i mean who are you gonna have to protect a ufc fighter from hitting another jerry springer uh security guards you have years of experience breaking this up this episode is really good off a tangent but do you remember how remember steve the security guard from jerry speaker probably like the top earner on cameo right now yeah it's actually kevin from the office or gilbert godfrey um oh shoot i think gilbert just died actually r.i.p but whatever uh i guess did you know that dmx died yeah dude yeah i saw that you tweeted out why didn't you tell me you knew this information you withheld it that reminds me of what david you know i don't leave my house chappelle was talking about like celebrities and now it's weird they talk to them during tragedies and he's like just imagine like 9 11 and and ja rule was like being interviewed actually and like you know we we need jaw right now to make sense of this tragedy where's his job someone go give me a job we need john to make sense of the strategy this tragedy that's what that's like you wondering like why didn't anyone fill me in that the dmx had passed uh but yeah he's by the way did you see this uh this blog post is we'll close on this little last random thing but um check out this blog post so this guy listened to the episode that we did with rob dyrdek which is probably i don't know if not the most popular episode we did one of the most popular episodes we've done uh people love that one and one of the things that rob the one of the reasons people love it is because turns out the kind of fun-loving skater guy from mtv like turns out he's like an absolute nut when it comes to personal productivity and like personal efficiency you know his quote on there was i am human optimization and one of the things he had said was that he writes his wife a handwritten note every day and so this guy wrote this blog post it was like the top post on hacker news over the weekend and it's called write a note to your spouse every day and noted a note a day keeps the divorce attorney away and he goes um you know i was listening to my first million and uh rob dierdick was on there he says that uh he writes a note to his wife every day because sometimes otherwise she would be the last person to hear from him at the end of the day about what he was working on how he was feeling he was usually tired by then and wasn't really giving it you know his a plus so he goes for the last six months i wrote an a note to my wife every single day he goes all right that's a lie you know i did it most days but like whatever here's how it went and he goes it's amazing like we're on the same page about like what's going on in our lives our kids our finances how we're spending our time we talk more than ever now um you know we have more trust we feel less stressed we're less aggravated with each other and like we're better parents because we're kind of like more in communication with ourselves um about parenting and he goes you know here's why writing is thinking so just writing helped me clear my mind it wasn't just me dumping my thoughts onto her it was me like getting my own mind clear and he gives this outline he goes here's what i write first i write gratitude like something about her you know for her for how hard she works for her looks whatever then what i'm working on today uh and like my goals or my deadlines anything i'm excited about anything that's bothering me uh any ideas i have just like random ideas on my head about parenting or fixing stuff around the house um transactional stuff like oh we need to remember to do this we have to do this don't forget that um questions like hey are we going to that thing or hey did we ever book that you know hey do we have an event coming up uh and lastly again gratitude for the life we have the the things we have the time we have the kids we have etcetera because i don't do all these sections every day but those are the general categories of things i try to write uh it takes me just about 30 minutes if i'm not distracted and uh you know turn yeah it's been a huge like win for me is it like a physical note or an email i think it's a physical note uh not 100 sure i guess i should start doing this that sounds pretty cool right and then he did this youtube video with his wife like where they both like talked about afterwards because the post blew up on hacker news it got like probably you know 100 000 views or something like that so then they like did an interview together like talking about this little habit it's pretty cool right yeah this is awesome uh i just dm'd him while you're talking saying this is uh amazing and this is a really good headline write a note write a note to your spouse every day a note a day keeps a divorce attorney away this is a really good title this is a beautiful find um i think i guess i'll start doing this right this is pretty sick it sounds smart maybe i'll start by talking to her then no that seems like a no-brainer i'm like reading this and i'm like huh all upside pretty much no downside why am i not doing this right good for me how can i wheeze a lot of doing this sorry my brain's not coming for any valid reason not to do this no like the calculations are like going in my head i'm like huh yeah you seem like a good husband do you you probably already do this you probably leave a sticky note on our pillow every morning no not at all as i was reading it same thing i was like why would i not do this it seems really obvious but apparently no one does it my first example husbands one episode at a time i feel like we had to we had to leave him with something useful because we definitely got off on like you know a tangent's tangent during this episode dude it worked for rob i mean rob is like successful have you seen his wife i mean she's very beautiful i'm pretty sure she was like a playmate uh like a like a like a i don't know what the word is playboy model or something i mean she's like uh pretty amazing i'm definitely doing this now yeah [Laughter] here's one of the ways that i knew that rob was like crazy rich if you google rob dierdick home there's like 13 different articles and it's like all about like a different like 10 million dollar house did you mean homes did you mean mansions yeah and he buys all these houses and uh he seems happy he's got his act together so yeah i'm on board i guess i guess i'll do this fine [Laughter] all right [Music] you

do you know about a certain man named gotham adani have you ever heard this name before i don't remember what what's this donnie just became this guy just became the third richest man in the world and so yes the indian guy from uh uh he's kind of like a and he owns like a huge mansion and down in downtown like mumbai where like it it's like a skyscraper yeah so he uh so he elon musk number one jeff bezos number two and now adani number three and so people they watch this list and they're like who's who is adani [Music] all right in this episode we're talking about the third richest man in the world somebody who you've never heard of we talked about team zuck so basically zuckerberg has this new video of him doing mma and we did a little recap on how we feel about it but also we kind of looked at how he makes his decisions and what our perspective is on him and i actually think it's quite interesting we broke down one of mr b's to me the most interesting business that mr beast has that nobody else is really talking about and i think is loki a star business so that's the episode give it a listen let us know what you think and write in the comments go on youtube write in the comments i'll be replying to every single comment that's in here with something that's either smart or funny i guarantee it go to the comments and leave one and i'll be back all right i have a fun one this will get us in the mood so kanye west pop culture uh do you follow kanye of course i don't really pay attention to kanye west really uh it's not really on my uh radar but he did something kind of funny and we talked about him yesterday and it's business related but basically you know he's having this like tizzy with adidas do you know about that no and nice use of tizzy you like that uh well and frankly i don't entirely know about it so i'm just gonna kind of like summarize but basically you know kanye worked with adidas to launch yeezys his line of shoes um it's collectively made like or not collectively but in 2020 easy sales were 1.17 billion dollars in revenue he made around 200 million dollars from that so he made a lot of money and basically he's having a fight with them i don't actually know what the fight is about but the backstory is that he's accused them of stealing his designs and leaving him out of meetings for their yeezy shoe collaborations sean uh combs you know diddy said he's gonna boycott because of this and kanye has said i'm gonna make things unbearable for you guys until you comply so i don't exactly know what comply means but what's kind of it's both sad because like it looks like he's going through some stuff and it is funny and he's kind of trying to be funny and it's working but he basically said i've got no chill it's going to cost you guys billions to keep me it's going to cost you billions to let me go adidas you stole my design among other things and i'll give you until tuesday not until the seven months that i told you originally i was going to give you today's the day like he like went like he's going crazy and on his twitter which he's got like i don't know how many followers tens of millions i would imagine he's posting each person's picture who's on the board of directors as well as a couple other boards like they have a board of advisories uh of adidas's people and so he posted this one woman who's also and he's like it'll say stuff about him like sometimes it's funny but sometimes it's like this woman's on the board of uh adidas she's also chairman and investment banker at jp morgan i went to jp morgan in order to raise money for my buyout and they wouldn't do it like he's going kind of bananas and i thought that that was wild and then i saw another thing that he's he's having another tizzy with uh his wife kim or ex-wife about a school and i went and looked at their school have you heard about this so he has his own school right like he has his own academy or something like that yeah so he's trying to start this thing called donda so donda.org if you go there it actually looks weird but interesting and kind of fun like it looks cool and if you go to about on how we learn you'll see like they describe the curriculum and it's like it kind of makes sense but then you see like weird things like if you look at what the daily schedule it says after school parkour well first of all i went to the site donda.org it's just like who we are how we learn admissions and choir those are the top four links which is just quiet yeah which of these does not belong i don't know why choir is up here secondly there's just like a white i don't even know what it looks like a white pigeon to be honest with you just flapping its wings in slow-mo okay it's like a fat dove though it's not it's not like a sleek graceful dub it's like a chunky guinea pig yeah it's a guinea pig with wings that's just flying up in slow motion and that's the website i'm gonna click how we learn because i can't not um okay they got less than 12 students per per class rule number one should be students should be confident in forming or forming ideas if not their writing will suffer okay so their daily schedule full school worship okay that's a good way to start the day how we similar to how we start the pod um yeah core classes lunch and recess enrichment classes including film choir and you're right parkour a bunch of singing ninjas out here just singing and flipping around so i thought this was interesting because uh it you know even though he's i don't like laughing at him a guy if he's going kind of insane but he's trying to be funny with this instagram thing and it kind of is hilarious uh like he posted like the a guy i think the ceo of sa sap uh or is it sap yeah the like the hr software that nobody actually understands what they do he like tweeted out or uh instagramed his this guy's face and goes you are a sap that's what he said and it just it's just all right he's just doing the most childish immature thing and it's so funny it is working it's awesome and then this school thing i saw because of his other little fight with kim and he's like anyway i don't know how this is related to business but i i thought that you would have know about this because you're more of a pop culture guy than i am no but let me tell you uh okay so this is here's a theme for this episode i'm gonna call it people with giant egos you know i'm going to call it because i don't actually know if these people have giant egos i'm going to say creative titans that's better creative titans so the first one is going to be my billy of the week [Music] [Applause] [Music] a million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars do you know about a certain man named gotham adani have you ever heard this name before uh um i don't remember what what's this donnie just became this guy just became the third richest man in the world and so yes the indian guy from uh uh he's kind of like a and he owns like a huge mansion and down in downtown like mumbai where like it it's like a skyscraper yeah so he uh so he elon musk number one jeff bezos number two and now adani number three and so people they watch this list and they're like who's who is adani and i actually i don't know if i met him but we definitely pitched him i think my dad pitched him a business thing many years ago my dad always kept saying oh we just need to get a donnie on board adani adani adani and so i'd heard about this guy before and i didn't you know and his net worth has just skyrocketed because his stock is up like 13x in the last item is this reliant industries no so reliance it was the top kind of like company there and the guy who runs it mukesh and bonnie was the i think he was he was the richest man in india and now adani has passed him up in the last year because his stock went up 13x so so who is this guy and what does he do okay so um what he does you'll you'll appreciate this is he a software guy is he a mark zuckerberg no no he's not is he elon musk is he trying to create the future of uh you know space travel and you know like brain computer interfaces no this guy operates at a place that sam likes power so he does coal ports plastics you know [ __ ] like that so basically this guy's like they do they do like industrial work and so he owns when so when he was he was a kid he was in school he went to go visit this port it was the largest port in the country at the time a port you know where literally like ships come in and out and um he's like inspired by it was like one day i'm going to own the biggest port ever and the biggest board in india and now he's sure enough he owns the biggest port in india he owns the most ports in india too um with the deal we were trying to do with him we were trying to get adani to come to australia to build a port for our startup that was based in australia because these guys were the kings of ports but his story is pretty cool he's a he's a college dropout so 18 drops out he becomes a diamond sorter i don't even know what that means but he became a diamond sword he got an interest in the diamond business and after a couple years of sorting diamonds he then goes and he starts his own diamond brokerage and he's like i will trade i will basically age of 20 as a diamond broker brother calls him up brother says hey brother i have a uh a small plastic factory here that i i own now i've i bought or i run and so he helps him go scale up the plastic factory and then as he's doing that he's like oh let's start importing the like the materials that come up you know upstream of plastics and so he starts doing he creates like an export company and so he just keeps creating these companies so now he has seven publicly listed companies he's got the adani group which is like the the mega one and then they'll start like adani power adani um you know like trading adani real estate or whatever they'll start all these different companies they'll take them all public and what's interesting about it is that and he's got a beautiful mustache by the way yeah you know the meme account dr park patel he looks like the meme accounts photo actually so i don't know if it's if it's him or just looks a lot like him he looks like a like an indian mario you know like mario and luigi he looks like an idiot mario like you know you look he does you know when mario does that little squat like right you know when you want to you want to do that trick or you go behind the thing you're standing on and you run and you get the magic yeah he's like squatting he's a little squatty squatty version of indian mario so anyways this guy has now become you know whatever the third person he's got these crazy stories he was i don't know if you know there was like this um sort of like an indian 911 thing where there's like a terrorist attack on a hotel he was in that hotel and he was like in the hostage group that was there wow he was also kidnapped at one point in time and taken ransom for two million dollars they paid it and got free and so this guy has just lived this like kind of crazy life and even now he's doing really well the group's doing really well he's third richest man on earth there is a set of people who are very very skeptical about what these guys are doing because they have so much debt in their companies like he is basically constantly trying to acquire companies like they just bought the largest cement producer in india but they buy these companies using debt and he's got this intricate like set of companies and so there's a big question of like is this all a house of cards that's going to fall over and you're going to see a guy go from the number three richest to like you know falling off the list completely or is he actually going to pull this off because what they'll do is they'll say okay the the parent company has some profits we'll take a loan on that and then they take like one of the new companies public like oh adani green power and they'll take the green company public because it's got the adani name stock price goes up and then he'll invest in it from the parent company and then he'll sell those shares and then he'll borrow against the stock and then he'll issue a bond and he's got like all these different debt instruments and so they have i think more debt than like any other company in india and now there's a question of is this all going to fall over is it all going to work it's pretty fascinating dude when do do you ever feel i feel self-conscious when i hear about these things because my like my thing with business is like just the very simple of buy low sell high you know like i purchase a widget for you know one dollar and i put some type of value or i just buy tons of them and so i get a discount and then i sell them for like a dollar fifty that fifty cents my profit i use a quarter a quarter of that to pay myself a quarter to go buy more and like it's like a relatively like simple straightforward process and then i hear about like you just use the word debt instruments and how he you know he like he does this thing and gets a loan across this thing and this thing and when i hear that stuff i just think like so like where's the dollar that goes into his bank account actually come from you know what i mean like right like i try to think about i'm like i don't understand how this person then eventually collects the money and how the people who are owed money where they got the money from and when they're going to get paid back like do you know what i mean it's like it's so complicated for me because i'm such a simpleton or is it just [ __ ] dude i don't think i was in seventh grade my parents got me a piano teacher and i wish that instead i just learned how to play dead instruments like that would have just been so much better than learning how to play you know what do you mean [Laughter] where do people learn this stuff where do people learn this sort of financial engineering i think that a lot of it happens if you're like on the inside so you work at a investment bank or you work somewhere there but like this guy didn't but this guy didn't do that yeah yeah so you know i think he hired people who who do that and they sort of [ __ ] say hey look here's what we're gonna do we're gonna we're gonna issue this bond and we're gonna take this company public that we're gonna like take a load pledge the shares we're gonna get a loan against the shares and basically somehow one dollar of ebitda has become eight dollars of you know cash flow for us and like we got to figure out how to do that without it all collapsing but people like when you understand financial engineering they have such an edge such an edge but when i like originally like made some money and i remember like our bankers saying like yeah you could borrow money now at one percent and i'm like yeah i don't want to go into debt and they'd be like well no sometimes it's like it could be wise for you to do that for example you have to pay taxes i'm like why he goes well because you'd have to sell this thing which then you'd take like a you know a 40 discount on that because the taxes and i'm like wait i don't understand this can you like lay this out like can you write this on a piece of paper so like it and then my banker griffin he ended up flying to new york to visit me to like he goes dude i just need to sit down with you so you understand this i swear to god i swear i go why are you coming here you got meetings he goes no i'm coming to explain this to you so he gave and he explained it to me yeah sure meetings uh yeah i've cleared my day to explain the one concept of borrowing against doc like i just didn't understand it were you the same way where you're like i just don't get this this doesn't make sense no you and others explained it to me right so like yes it's true i didn't understand i didn't know about it at first and then when i knew about it i didn't understand why it was good and then somebody's like hey so you notice why this is amazing right you could either sell your stock pay taxes and no longer own the stock or you could keep owning the stock never pay the taxes just borrow at a one percent rate against that money and like you're good and i was like okay so that's good right they're like all right you [ __ ] you didn't understand like let's do this again yeah i just like so these financial engineers you know where i learned a lot about this stuff is from ben our ben wilson his uh podcast with rothschild like i and like i started like learning about this a little bit but then i also learned that i think some people i don't know like what skill set it is i do think it's rooted in just like they're just good at math and they understand um just like complicated algebra to be honest just like exponential exponential like that that's a concept that's like it sounds like i'm joking but that's actually quite hard to understand like to understand what a seven percent or 10 or 12 growth for 50 periods what's that actually look like like i remember listening to this podcast i was like oh you're just like just like lebron it's just taller and can dunk better it doesn't matter what i do like there's some people that are just better at this and i don't know what that skill set is but there is something there there it's like you're just you're better than me well i think you just get curious about that thing which most of us who are like builders makers entrepreneurs you know like the stereotype about let's say um you know who cares what you know corporate structure uh bookkeeping taxes like you know whatever raising debt that wasn't never the reason i got into business that's not what i found interesting at the time i was like you it's like oh we could buy this thing for x and sell it for why you know that that's that's the game plan or we can make this thing that doesn't exist and wow look how cool it is look how it works that was always more fun and it's just like a level up a progression in the game to be able to understand how do i a keep more money that i make and b how do we leverage money so that we could do more interesting things you know in a less dilutive way so so i i think these people are amazing you know like xavier who who runs in during ventures he told me this once he's just he was just like you know if i died i'd be reincarnated as a cfo not a ceo and i was so funny it was like the weirdest brag i've ever heard i was i never heard somebody like bragging about wanting to be a cfo and i was like what do you mean he's like he's like i don't know i just really like learning about how to be efficient and smart on this like financial like financial engineering and he had done you know real engineering before that he built basically like he's like so he built a solar company in in africa the largest solar company in africa that's so funny that he's interested in that stuff though he's like a hippie he's totally a hippie right he did that because he's like dude there's people suffering in africa like i wanna like that seems like the problem to go fix but then along the way he's like all right well how do i create you know how do i finance all of these solar panels and battery packs without having to go raise venture capital and so in order to do that like the necessary evil was he needed to learn how to access cheat debt he needed to learn how to like issue debt and underwrite for other people because what he did was he was like you know these people should basically they don't have the 21 dollars to buy the solar panel that goes on top of their house that's going to power their fridge and like if they don't have a fridge their life really is tough and they need this but they can't afford the 21 so like let's just do it at 4 a month or whatever and like i will underwrite a loan against their like income and it's like how do you underwrite a loan for somebody who doesn't even have electricity in their house and he would figure these things out and so i think it became a necessary evil and something he got fascinated with and so now they're doing this whole holding company and so he does this this one thread he did went viral which was like how to have a holding company like warren buffett and basically like you know make a massive amount of money pay as little taxes you need to and like you know have have more and more money to do acquisitions as you go and he basically outlines warren buffett's corporate structure and why that's at why that's advantageous and uh you know i read it and i still only understand 25 of it but i'm just glad that there's people like that that i can go to whenever i have a question hilarious dude that's great well i like this guy got him i'm gonna i want to learn more about him you have more on him or you want me to go uh i have another person like this all right another person and idea like this okay so now let's switch gears another creative titan that we talked about mr beast so we hung out with mr beast i don't know if you guys are sick of us talking about that yet but you know uh producer ben is literally sitting here in a mr beast uh t-shirt so you know he's a fan uh but that's good ben because you know when we were sitting in that meeting and they brought in the swag uh jimmy who who is mr bc he goes oh man they're not like kids dude they don't they don't need the stuff like you know they're not gonna be because the guy came in was like guys i got treats for you and he's like had a bunch of swag and nobody moved and miss jimmy was like oh no they don't care about this stuff man they're they're adults and then like all of us were like the [ __ ] you talking about dude and like we're just like i just like i literally rolled my chair over to him like you know like a kid i'm like i like just rolled my rolling chair over to that part of the table because it was like a long boardroom and i was just like i'm going to get some swag and i went and got it and the other guy was like i got kids man they're gonna need like if i don't bring back swag they're gonna be pissed and so and now ben is wearing his damn i jimmy drove me like when we were going to the i took a ride with them and i found that shirt that you're wearing ben in the back of his car and i just go i'm [ __ ] taking this he's got tons of them so i stole mine from him i i didn't know that we had the opportunity to take it like ethically never considered that um so jimmy okay so i wanted to bring something up that he had talked about that we didn't mention on the podcast which to me is the most interesting business that this guy has you might be thinking is the most interesting business his youtube channel no is it his chocolate company feast named feastables no is it his shipping burger company his cloud kitchen called mr beastberger no do you know which one i'm going to talk about either you guys know give me a sam do you know which one i'm going to talk about i think ben do you have any idea which one i might be referring to uh well uh no but are you gonna talk about his burger did you guys see his restaurant just open yeah yeah but let's talk about this other thing okay okay no no no i don't know you're not like i wrote down what i think it is and then you you say all it's his like kind of translation internationalization company translation sam got it there it is this idea is amazing so when we're sitting there he's like yeah i got basically whatever the number one number two whatever biggest channel in in america and he's like pulling up his like youtube stats on he's like airplaying onto the tv like his youtube stats and then he goes um i also have this channel in portugal this my portuguese channel is growing really fast and he puts up a video it's got 20 million views in brazil and i was like and it starts talking and all of a sudden he's talking in fluent portuguese and i was like what is this he's like oh yeah like it like ai no so what they did was they were like look one of the things we already put a million and a half dollars into this video where i built this chocolate factory and i'm gonna give it away to one of these people how do we get more juice out of that fruit and so what they realized was we can go international into markets where youtube is huge like brazil um brazil's got this massive population it's huge on youtube and they don't have content like mr beast is doing like he's ahead of the game for the us he's light years ahead of the game for like brazil or the philippines or different places like this and so but the challenge is it's a language challenge so what they did was they went they basically hired somebody to create a youtube channel they said hey you're going to be our youtube channel manager for this country you're the country manager for brazil you've got to have our twitter our tick tock our youtube all of it um you know mr brazil or whatever it's called then secondly we're gonna when we have a video here you need to get it translated by a local like like a dubbing service so like a local translator and i want it translated i want the description translated i want uh all of it done and then you upload it there you respond to the comments you manage that community all of that good stuff and what they did was they would not like they didn't just go get like you know some random crappy person on fiverr to do it they got like the guy who dubbed spider-man in in brazil they got him to do the voice acting for this they paid him a lot of money they paid him like a couple hundred grand and i was like i feel like you didn't need to do that you could have just got anybody and he's like check this out like basically you don't know [ __ ] about [ __ ] sean and so he goes to the comments and every comment is oh my god mr beast is spider-man like they just thought he must be that guy like that's him that's that voice i recognize and so he got like all this extra you know social juice it was a little more remarkable and again back to our principle from last podcast which is just do the doper thing just do the dope [ __ ] instead of the lame [ __ ] yeah yeah what's cooler the cheaper guy from fiverr or all right you paid 100 or whatever you got spider-man to do it it's like yeah of course of course what what am i thinking and so that's true by the way when i listen to audio books like on audible i ever if i if i see a famous person's the author or the narrator rather i listen to it so like i'm listening to huckleberry finn not that i really care about huckleberry finn but nick offerman is the narrator you know the guy from community uh you know who that is he's like yeah is he the main guy community yeah ron swanson he plays like an angry like white country guy or like it'll be another guy like it'll be just like whenever i see an author who i write a narrator if i recognize her a famous person i listen to it so tom hanks doing divi code i didn't really want to do davinci code but tom hanks so like the whole narrator thing yeah that's pretty sick i'm on board with that i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better so so basically what he's done is he's like cool now that's okay so he was doing that for himself so he's like oh good i'm i'm blowing up in romania i'm blowing up in the philippines i'm blowing up in brazil i'm blowing up everywhere he's like i already did 80 of the work it's that last 20 that is foreign to me feels feels like a lot of work whatever but all i can hire the people to do this but the smart part was he's like this is not just a way for me to expand my brand that's already a smart business move he then created this as a service for other big youtubers so now if you're whoever you know your airac or your your you know some yes theory or something like that right you could basically just use his service he'll just go to you and be like hey do you want to be big in brazil we'll just do all the work for you and like we'll keep like 30 of their ad revenue and they're like that's crazy okay yeah like i'm not gonna hire i'm not gonna go and do this interview process to hire all these people and figure it out and manage this all myself that's kind of inefficient but what he can do is like he can have one team in brazil that's gonna manage 15 youtubers channels there and so i think this is one of the smartest businesses that he has i think it's going to be one of the most successful it's going to be pure profit essentially and um i think he's got the distribution locked down because if he goes to any youtuber and explains hey here's what i'm doing and you get access to my machine they're all going to say yes and it's a it's a good idea for them it's a win-win for them because they're just not going to capture this extra value and so he's doing this and is just another example of turning a cost center into a profit center and i actually want to talk about some examples of those so basically things where this would normally just be a cost to him to run this to have all these people on staff but once he turns it into a service for other youtubers now it becomes a profit center and so there's which bunch of pixels which i think this would make way more money than the chocolate bars like i remember i ate the chocolate the chocolate that he had and i was like well you know like hey it's good but i don't it's not like that different than any other chocolate that i've had and b it kind of sucks that i've got to feel bad about myself if i consume a lot of your product and see it's only like 40 it was 40 i think for a box like it's hard to build a big business 40 a pop you know what i'm saying at least when you're not if you got to be in walmart or something yeah which i'm sure he could do also like ben's point he he opened up a brick and mortar location for his burger joint and normally you're like ah you know opening up a restaurant a mall maybe not the best idea and then he like post this video there's like literally i don't know 50 000 people in the mall like lined up it was like people were lined up up and down each concourse just like you know the restaurants on floor one or whatever like people were on floor four just lined up in this line and it was insane so you know this guy's got pretty massive pull so what are the other examples of of turnover so the first one that came to mind for me was aws so aws today is basically amazon amazon's most of its profits come from aws and aws is basically when amazon had to have a really robust set of servers to run their own website and then they were like hey the way we use this kind of like server infrastructure and it's just like this big expense for us to have this server farm what if we just rented this out to other companies who want to have like amazon level servers without having to go rack their own servers in some data center and that became aws and basically aws spits off billions and billions in profit now what started as what would have been a billion dollar loss and so you know that's a huge swing but i have some others uh that i want to explain to you so michael gurdley who came on the pod he goes my favorite is um this company called freight alley they did what what hubspot kind of did with the hustle they basically have this thing called freight waves which is freight waves is basically a media company and freight alley is the like the sas company so basically they're a sas company that created a media arm that goes and uh normally a media companies you know has expenses but they turn it into a profit center basically that acquires customers for the sas business at a negative customer acquisition cost so the media company is profitable and brings in customers to their own sas you know at the bottom of the funnel so that's one example not exactly the full thing but dude another guy the guy who started that company his name's craig i've hung out with him a bit he um bought a big piece of property in tennessee and he's the one who's turning it into like an airport it's like a country club but instead of a golf course there's an airport so he's selling he bought a huge plot of land now he's sub-selling or he's selling smaller pots of land and there's going to be an airplane strip and a hangar that everyone has access to so if you're a flying enthusiast you buy a home there and you can use this and he bought a magazine i think it was called airplane.com or something like that he bought a magazine and he's like i'm going to buy a magazine and do the same thing that i did but instead of software we're going to do it with these houses wow that's amazing another another example so any ddc company that eventually takes their own warehouse and starts fulfilling for other customers so they turn their own warehouse which is a cost for them for fulfillment into a profit center because they're doing fulfillment for themselves and others very similar to aws okay here's another one uh this guy george on twitter just sent me this he goes ford decided to own the timber supply for their vehicles so there was lots of wood in the early cars they ended up with so much leftover wood they started selling charcoal and that's kingsford charcoal company that's my favorite man that's my favorite story that's a that's kind of amazing i didn't know that uh is there more to know about that or did we kind of nail it there no you nailed it so basically they were so ford was making frame car frames and they had to burn a whole lot of wood in order to you know bend the steel or do whatever they had to do and they had all this leftover charred wood and they're like what do we do with this and i think it was henry ford's idea i forget exactly whose idea but he goes hey let's let's start selling this let's make something out of this and that's where it kind of came from there's a bunch of entrepreneurs that have kind of like done things like this uh standard oil did something like this where they're like this gets more complicated and is less interesting but like hey this off put of kerosene is like this weird like fluid that's like really greasy is there anything we could do with that and like wd-40 or something like that right like they've like there's like stories like that with with standard oil as well and so here's a couple others so foursquare foursquare had an api for businesses because they needed all this data about businesses where they're located all that stuff and they needed that for to power their own foursquare app and foursquare kind of went up and this hype cycle that went down many years sort of forgotten sort of written off but a new ceo joined and almost oriented the company around this it was like look the more valuable thing is not people using foursquare in the app and playing the game it's all the data we've collected about businesses where they're located with like hyper precision and so we actually just need to make that api available to everybody and they productize the api and they make i think more money off the ap i think they make more money off the api than they do off the core app at this point um so so i think that's that's another great example of this amazon has a bunch like amazon was a book seller right so their main cost of goods sold was their books but then they create kindle and kindle self and the self-publishing business and the public and all that and so now kindle itself became a profit center what so it used to be a cost which was selling books now they sell ebooks that they kind of own and um you know they turn that profit same thing with payments right amazon had to pay a a merchant like a fee every time they processed a payment so they created their own payment software amazon called amazon payments and now like you know for our e-com store i just went i was like i think we take amazon payments where does that money go and i went and found an account we have with amazon payments i had like 400 grand sitting in it because we used that service amazon payments to take payments for somebody who wants to pay with amazon and so they turned it into a profit center along the way that's crazy another one is um slack so slack started out as a game and when they were working on their game they it wasn't actually doing that well but they created a way in order to communicate effectively with their with their co-workers and they said ah [ __ ] this game this thing's actually way cooler let's actually turn this internal tool into a a proper tool we thought about doing that so here's but here's the problem with this this all sounds sick a lot of people say yeah let's do this and so a lot of publishers are doing this and so they are like let's sell our cms so buzzfeed vox washington post i forget who else is like they build these custom website builders and they say let's sell this and i think oftentimes it's a distraction and they always say well amazon did it and i looked into this amazon did launch aws uh pretty early on but you know how many employees they had when they did it how many total employees are on aws yeah total employees there's about five thousand so they were already a multi-billion dollar company with it and so they the way the story is told is like oh they were just this little guy no they had about 5 000 people when they launched aws like it was like a you know it was a it was a thing it wasn't just like a scrappy startup and a lot of times people like will say well let's also sell this it's like dog we've got eight people working here like who's gonna do this uh so that's always like i've always been conflicted with this strategy yeah that's that's true uh you guys considered it you would have done it for what is it your um our email sending platform so like we built our own for a little while and then we made it really easy so like if so basically hypothetically which there aren't that many people doing this if you had a daily email it was really easy for you to talk to your advertiser make the ad and insert into the thing have them approve it and like it was simple and easy to use but the problem is is like they're not that many people doing it you know what i mean and being then but like beehive basically does that now and they're actually growing pretty well well maybe i could have been wrong but i don't think i'm gonna end up being wrong i think that i think that i'm not convinced that what they're doing at least ads for a daily email that business i don't think will be ever be that particularly big and beehive so beehive is kind of like sub stack and so it's these services that you get subscribers and they take a small amount of revenue based off of how much you're making from subscriptions or you just pay them like a fee on how many subscribers you have do you think that some of those businesses actually can become huge venture-backed sized companies so i just invested in beehive actually initially i didn't invest because i was like uh i don't know how big this gets and then two things sort of changed my mind the first is every time i needed something for beehive the founder was an absolute animal on my request like because we use it for milk road so yeah he's great his name's tyler he's awesome tyler was he's like it's already on her like he'd be like it's already on a road map the question i have is a or b there's like nuance about it that shows he's been thinking about this noodling on it and then he'd be like when do you need this buy because normally like it's scheduled to be out in three weeks but if you need three days like you know the weekend exists i might be able to you know like whatever so he was able to like rip off feature after feature after feature that we needed and everything that was like you're like hey we have this question it's like him and his team would dig in so he so i saw that he kind of had that grit that you like in an entrepreneur so i got to basically special which i normally don't get to do with most investments um you know with most investments you meet them you do a call with them they say all the right things they send you the deck you look at it you kick you look at the product and like you got to make an educated guess at that point you don't get to spend months working with the actual entrepreneur as a customer and see how quick they are with features how fast they're responding the quality of the product all that good stuff so so that was the first reason the second reason was i've come to realize that the the best investments i've made have been ones where what looks like a small market what looks niche turns out to not be niche so we got acquired by twitch and our last company twitch was a kind of the quintessential example of this right like yeah but like how many people are going to watch other people play video games on the internet like how many people are going to stream themselves playing a video game and how many people want to watch that looked niche and turned out to be a massive behavior this is also true with like you know uh now shopify seems really obvious i remember talking to the vc who led shopify's early rounds uh you know maybe six seven years ago and shopify at that point was still like legit but it's not what it is today it's not like seen as it is today is like one of the blue chip startups and it was the same thing it was like okay you know like just like etsy like you know how big do these actually get these kind of like indie maker seller type things isn't amazon and big brands just going to like dominate this like how many mom and pops are there going to be on the internet that can actually do this well and how much dude i remember that i remember tim ferriss invested in shopify and he was talking about it and i was like shopify that's so silly like you know this thing exists this exists this exists why don't you just use this thing and like you know i remember like i forget what those were like big commerce do you remember big commerce there's big commerce there's woocommerce there's magento there was all these and so that was actually a big problem which is if you looked at the existing ones that had been around for like 10 years and they were kind of like like those are pretty like uh they're cheaper they're harder they're more flexible but they're way harder to use and they were kind of like from a different era so they kind of like peaked at a certain point and you look at those and they're like peaking back then yeah you're like how big does this get look that's how big it gets not very big and the same thing happened with airbnb i remember when airbnb was like coming out and i was like uh well it's couch surfing but better right like i don't know if people remember couchsurfing.com was like one of the early oh that's a cool idea but it never made a bunch of money never got huge because again how many people really want to go live sleep on a you know someone's couch or extra bedroom in uh in some city okay yeah it's this kind of vagabond hippie traveling [ __ ] but like that's not mainstream and so if you looked at couchsurfing to see how big airbnb could get you're like well sit very very similar idea been around for longer seems to have plateaued around this size not that big and like you would have been wrong and so i guess i've kind of learned that like the absolute biggest wins in venture come when you find something non-obvious and the non-obvious non-obvious to me typically is like just fundamentally like product categories or markets people aren't going after or markets that other people think are small that actually are going to turn out to be very big there's this really great story with sam altman who at the time was the president of uh what's it called y combinator and brian chesky and brian chesky is getting or maybe he was just worked at y combinator and brian chesky in 2005 must have been 2011 was getting ready to pitch you know so yc you go through this 8 or 12 week incubator at the end you pitch a bunch of venture capitalists and yc helps you a bunch of ways including getting your pitch right brian chesky's with sam going over his pitch he goes this company one day is gonna make a hundred million dollars a year and sam was like brian like can you just do me a favor anywhere in this presentation where you have like a number could you do me a favor and add a zero behind it at the end of it guys change all the m's to bs investors that's what he does yeah he goes anything that you have an m i want to see a b change it all right and i i don't remember exactly how the story goes but it was paraphrased in such words like brian goes like but that's lying like there's no way that we're going to do that like it's just impossible no one has done this before he goes yeah but you know it seems like a big market and here's my reasoning like logically it makes sense there's so many people who stay at hotels like of course you can do this i mean someone can do it i bet and she'll just do me a favor and change all those m's to bees and even brian chesky didn't believe it and there's another story by the way where i remember um what was uh amazon's first vc was it madonna is that what it's called madonna it's like it looks like the word madonna they're based up in seattle and uh he's pitching and i let's do a podcast with the guy he pitched and the guy he pitched tells the story of bezos saying like look if we if we get our act together and we make this work i think we're gonna make like a hundred million bucks a year in like the next five or ten years like that was his pitch is like that's how big i think we're gonna get and the guy was like i need to get a lot bigger than that but whatever you seem really competent so it's just proof that like even the people starting things sometimes also are like i don't know how big this can get i don't know if this is going to work out yeah like there's that clip of mark zuckerberg talking out of college and he's like doing a interview campus interviews like hey we're here with the campus report and we have mark zuckerberg the founder of thefacebook.com uh which is blowing up around campus people really like your website mark um you know he's like he's basically he's wearing basketball shorts he's got a red solo cup he's drinking out of yes and he's just sitting there and they're like so you've expanded to like whatever seven colleges and where you're gonna go from here you're gonna end up going into high schools or you know you're gonna how big can this get he's like oh i don't know like right now it's facebook is cool like it's cool for colleges really really useful and sometimes if you try to make something too big like it loses what makes it cool like maybe it doesn't like why does it have to be bigger and maybe it doesn't have to be bigger he says that and then like you know sure enough fast forward 10 years he's like we need to launch a satellite to india to give these rural villagers internet more users the facebook yeah we need more and so he turns into an absolute animal by the way this mma clip of zuck awesome seen this awesome killed it he killed it he killed it so for the background on this uh zuck went on rogan and talked about a bunch of stuff it was it was actually a pretty good interview i think zucker actually kind of redeemed himself a bit but uh in in part of the interview zuck said i've been training mma and people are like afterwards yeah right okay nerd he posts this video of him training he looks really good way faster than i thought he was going to be like fighting he was fighting i was like even if he wasn't good the fact that he does this it's just like i basically this was my tipping point i already liked zuck but now i'm team zuck which there's not a lot of us here right we can't even play a game of pickup basketball there's four of us on team suck we're just still looking for a fifth and as somebody tweeted this out they were they they go jack dorsey um you know because jack dorsey uh hasn't worked in 10 years uh constantly like constantly meditating uh you know dating different models no family tries to run multiple companies at once fails twitter never makes anybody blah blah blah zuck you know begrudgingly runs a trillion dollar empire you know faithfully monogamous uh great dad uh trains mma like all these like it's like jack dorsey doesn't work out it's like sucked trains mma and it just like highlights like you know basically like why does everybody hate this guy again like what is this guy done like you know and and some people are like you he ruined democracy he's like no dude he built basically the modern telephone and you're pissed that some people make phone calls that you don't like that's that's basically what happens on facebook is that he built the app everybody uses to communicate everything stupid or amazing and sure enough some percentage of that is not content you like and it's not controllable and the guys literally built like it was at a trillion dollars at a point in time he's built a trillion dollar company and he just keeps running it he keeps trying to make it better and he keeps trying to push the envelope and he keeps trying to make like better and better products and services and do you think he really cares about like do you think he sits there being like i want to influence the election but no that's like you know that's the that's a pain in the ass he's trying to deal with it's not like his agenda people make him out to be like this evil guy and it's like dude people people don't like him because he's awkward like all right you're a bully if you don't like him because he's a hurt you know like think about who you are if you don't like mark zuckerberg you're a bully you just think he's awkward and that's how you judge him like screw you man the guy's awesome we should do we should do like an entire episode about this because there was one beautiful line that he said so rogan was like um look like you had these russians doing this and influencing the election and then the hunter biden story story came out and you guys like took it down and you told them it wasn't allowed and then and like rogan was like uh criticizing him or at least voicing all the criticisms that facebook had and marco's um yeah look like how would you handle that situation and and love to see you dude it goes i don't know and zuck's like yeah we didn't either and so our reasoning was like we like took down the hunter like i don't even remember how he explained he's like well our reasoning was this this and this well he was like did the fbi came to us told us there's about to be a story that could be massive misinformation and go viral we just basically they just got their wrist slapped because they previously let other information spread too fast that they said you should have known that was fake news you should have stopped it so now the fbi comes to you and says there's about to be a dump of fake news that's going to go viral so what do they do they're like okay we shouldn't just like i guess we shouldn't block the news but maybe we should like suppress it in the news feed so that it doesn't go super viral because of you know isn't that what we just got in trouble for i don't know he didn't say all this but like it's obvious this is obviously what what would you do the fbi comes to you and says it's about to be a misinformation leak and then it it comes out and sure enough it starts going viral you have to decide do we just let this take over the platform and like oops we did it again or like should we play it safe and like not let this spread like wildfire until we can fact check this and see if this is real or not like by the time it does one side the left or right is gonna be mad at you and it's like if you just think about this [ __ ] it's like the person who in 2016 was like the election was rigged the russians manipulated the election then he fast forward to 2020 biden wins and then the the right is now like the election was rigged biden was counting votes that didn't count you know like it's like they're both just like they just switched you're the same you're the same dude on either side of the aisle like don't you realize that you're it's like the spider-man meme they're pointing at each other yeah it's the same thing over and over and over again it's like um you know she's got you know the bad thing on her server it's like he's got the documents in mar-a-lago and it's like they just keep doing this you know left and right so how is a communication platform supposed to win because literally no matter what you do one side is going to think you're being completely unfair or the other there's no such a good job though that is such a good answer and he like humanized himself so much there and he goes we did we our reasoning was and he said exactly we said about the fbi doing this and this is what we thought seemed right at the time how would you have hated that joe and joe was like well that's a good question i guess i would call someone who i think knows the answer and just talk and listen to him he goes yeah that's what we did you know we called these people we talked to them and this is the best that we did and could it have been wrong maybe but like you know we don't really know the right answer and it kind of i realized like oh wow this guy zuck he's 38 years old he's 36 years old like he's in his thir his mid 30s been doing this since he was 21. like he's just making it up and trying to make some good decisions along the way is he maybe a little evil maybe but we all got a little bit of us in that we all have a little bit of that and like he's mostly doing a good job and it just he did a really good turn that question of well how would you have handled it that was such a beautiful way because it was like oh you're you're fallible you're just like me you know like we're not that different is he a ruthless competitor in the sport of business sure i wouldn't expect somebody who's number one in their game to not be a religious competitor at their game like i wouldn't expect them to be a softy who who doesn't care or you know what i mean like it's insane to be that people hold this like this crazy standard other reasons i'm team suck so you know about his like once a year missions that he does yeah like one year it was like travel the country in an rv uh yeah so he did he that was like when it was like election time he's like i need to i don't know i need to meet middle america uh i'm going to like you know i will visit places with walmart's like you know that's like his mission for the year that year dude by the way i respect when people do that so much i was watching this music video with mike poser you know mike posner and you probably love him you know how he walked across the country yeah so he like followed it yeah it was yeah it was awesome he got bit by rattlesnake yeah and he like he got bit by rattlesnake and he had to go home for two weeks and learn to walk again and then he shipped right back out to where he was and he went to you know he's like this guy who you imagine as being this like california cool kid guy or a new york cool kid guy and he ends up walking the country and he's like i walked around places with confederate flags i went to like rural kansas i went everywhere and i saw america and i realized that like i don't know [ __ ] about america these people are a lot different than i thought and it was really nice to get to know like other types of people i love when people do that and so i'm team zuck a little bit because he did that he so he did that but the first ones he did i feel like were things that he was actually just self-interested in so he um i remember one of his first ones was that he was going to only eat if he was going to eat meat it had to be meat that he had personally hunted so he's like i've never hunted i think he'd like never hunted before and he's like i don't really know where my food comes from or like what goes into this showing up on my plate and i want to like actually like with my hands i want to experience this entire process so he had to hunt it he had to like prep it or kill like you know clean it or whatever and cook it and then eat it and so that's what he did for one year one year he was just like i want to learn mandarin i think facebook really wanted to go into china so he's like he showed up in china to give a talk he did the whole thing in mandarin and surprised the [ __ ] out of the whole crowd they were like it was like you know the scene in eight mile where he's going off on in the rap battle it was like the whole crowd was like oh what's going on like he's just speaking fluent mandarin with like the proper tone and like dude what a machine to in his like spare time just pick up these hobbies and then do them and now he's doing like mma and biology who's a you know a friend of ours he he he tweeted this out he goes it has begun i forgot who he said he goes first uh great line it has begun we could say that for so many things that's a beautiful those are beautiful first words he called it he called it uh he goes first first bezos now zuck i'm seeing it across the board tech people starting to seriously lift and train testosterone replacement therapy quantified self optimal diet diet eventually this will be productized for all but transhumanism starts with personal chatification because personal chat if occasionally turning yourself into an absolute chad and i know you i don't know if you saw this tweet or not but every word of this you know you were just doing the the the you're at the black church saying you know you're the gospel the choir of donda academy is singing and you're like amen to this right like because you've been doing this right you've been doing you're doing this for about five years now i've been becoming chat and you want to know something it is awesome it is so awesome i i've influenced you a little bit to you've slowly become into it it's the way to live man yeah i'm not like a chad i'm like a um like i know charles right now like i need to become a chad i'm just i'm just slowly working i'm like a bret trying to get trying to get to chad right now dude just like lifting this sounds so i don't care how it sounds it is what it is lifting heavy weight and then just like eating meat and vegetables i just feel happy i feel good about my life and i look at all pictures of us when we were recording the podcast at my office and my face was so much more round and i'm disgusted i'm like you are such a [ __ ] filthy animal you are filthy you are a horrible human being and i look at myself it has made me so much happier and like i'm i'm i'm pumped that the nerves are finding out about it yeah i think balaji lifts i think he power lifts as well so uh so yeah there's just like there's so much research that shows dude like being stronger it just makes uh they say you know a strong body a strong mind like when getting stronger like there's so many benefits to living a longer life uh what's his name what's the what's the guy we like the hunk scientist yeah humor man don't act like you don't know for the record we never have referred to him like that in private which is why i was confused you acted like we always call him the hunk scientist and text message dude i have a friend that like went and got in a cold plunge with him and he goes he's ripped like he's jacked and i'm like yeah of course these guys are like made for one like how close together were they occupancy of one that's a new protocol you got to sit on top one another that's what he's telling people he's like uh hey uh you know if you uh sit right here on my lap you're gonna live like an extra hour but my dude my friend did a thing with him but he goes he's just jacked and uh uh i i don't even remember how we start talking about this but he he did a podcast the other day he talked about like living longer and he's like yeah lift weights and go for runs and you'll like and you'll live longer so i'm happy you probably do this stuff my trainer has been doing this stuff called myofascial car myofascial release or something like that do you do this like a like a massage it's basically foam rolling but on steroids i go to a doctor two days a week and get it done in my calves yeah i knew i knew you would do this as a as a as a full chad you you of course are like you know all the way in on this it's basically he has these like like these trigger point balls and like these like different like torture devices i'll call them and he's like all right so i've done foam rolling before it's it's okay it's kind of boring a little bit painful um not the most fun thing in the world and you know it was always recommended to me like hey just you know you should foam roll tomorrow morning or tonight you know that'll help you with your soreness i was like yeah you know sure right after i eat my broccoli and asparagus and like you know you know say my prayers and get to bed by 9 p.m like of course yeah i'll also foam roll why not add it to the other list of [ __ ] i'm not gonna do that i shouldn't do it and so with this we do we now he who he got me to do is like the first 25 minutes of every workout we're doing this so he'll be like all right find this spot like in your hip flexor and take this like rock hard ball and you're just gonna like put all your body weight on that thing and wherever it feels most painful that's the spot i'm like oh my god he's like he's like he'll hear me like basically wincing and groaning in pain and he's like all right cool just you found it now stay there for three and a half minutes i'm like three and a half minutes like and so this has turned out to be i bring this up because hey i find it interesting i think there's a lot of fitness movements that have a business like angle to them and i feel like you've been ahead of the curve on a lot of this like uh you were on atg or the kind of like knees over toes stuff before most people and in general like what do you call it movement therapy or something movement yeah mobility mobility training this myofascial cardio released like i think this is also like an area where the the puck is going and more people are going to be well it's like and you feel good amazing as soon as it's done right like you feel absolutely amazing um when it's done but the the part of it that i find interesting is basically i for me working out is not like i want to get as jacked and shredded as possible it's basically like i want a part of my day where i'm not at my computer sitting down i'm not on my phone i'm not even thinking about work and i know that could be other things it could be meditation or whatever but like a way a way more achievable form of meditation for me is exercise exercise where i basically i'm only focused on the thing that's right in front of me like being absolutely present because there's like a giant weight that's about to fall on my face or hurt i'll hurt my shoulder or i'll injure myself or i'm like in extreme pain doing this like trigger point massage or whatever and i'm not i can't go anywhere else i can't think about the past i can't fantasize about the future i can't worry about what notification just buzzed on my phone and i'm just like out of it for at least one hour a day and for me that became the real like benefits of this more than like oh you know i'm getting more fit or i have more energy or whatever it's like it forces me to do that like the like the real version of meditation so that's what i like about it the most dude i told you what scott galloway said right he's like what did you say the whole point he said this in an interview and i thought it was amazing as as like i've been trying to say that but you just said it so much better he said in an interview with ryan holiday he goes basically i think the whole like if you are not fit enough that you can kill and eat most people in the room or outrun them then you have a problem and you should like work he's like i pretty much just exercise just so i can kill and eat most people in a room or just be able to outrun them and he said that i was like oh yeah that's actually that's the way to go that's the way to live no that is so stupid that's the part where i'm like okay i don't even want to be a part of this movement anymore like why is that the how is that even relevant that's like saying you know i want to be fast in case an asteroid is going to hit the earth and i got to get out of the way it's like what are you talking about what is this scenario where you need to eat and kill or run away from everybody in the room has this ever no entire lifetime happen that's that's at all not like it's like it's more like why does a car need to go 120 miles an hour when the speed limit 60. like it just doesn't because it's just it doesn't know but it's awesome that it does and because it can that makes it just a little bit cooler are you ever going to drive 160 miles an hour no of course not but like i still want that ferrari just cause i want to know i can do it and like the act of training to get to be able to do it is awesome so do i intend to eat you ah tbd probably not but like it's cool that i could like if i wanted to i could do x y and z to you and just training for that i think is awesome i would taste horrible like if you're gonna eat somebody i'm not your guy you know dude i heard the best place to eat someone is there is like their thumb right here i heard that's like that does it does actually look like a chicken drumstick actually now that you think about it right like that little that little section yeah i i i heard that's the best part uh i always thought half would be the way to go because that looks like the giant like turkey leg at disneyland i thought i thought yeah that would be where i would muscular parts muscular parts aren't good you know you want fat the fatter the part is is the better your calves are pretty lean compared to the rest of your body just your butt basically then you're gonna eat your butt and your belly yeah your red pork belly man that's just good it is it's amazing salmon belly fantastic and pretty much any belly yeah i'm a belly guy all right i think we've gone off the rails we started with kanye and we ended with eating each other what part of each other would we want to eat uh [Music] you

[Music] hey sam and sean this is colby from woodbridge virginia it seems like you guys are always finding cool stuff whether that's media or cool tools so anyway my question is what have you been into recently thanks okay so the question of the the one question friday we got was basically around what are just random we seem to be into really random things what are some of these random things that we're really into right now stuff that we really like it could be a podcast it could be um a video it could be a book it could be an app or a tool anything like that what are we into it's kind of like our info diet or the tools in our tool belt that we really like right now so sam what do you got all right i'll write off all three of mine because they're all related so the first one the both of these might sound all three might sound a little obvious but hear me out so youtube premium are you a subscriber to youtube premium i am a long time youtube premium subscriber most people aren't and so i actually unsubscribed from spotify so i don't use paid spotify anymore i only use youtube and the reason being is hey i watch all my tv on there but b you can listen to any music and they make playlists for you and then you can lock your phone and put it in your pocket and you can listen to music playlists and it's way better than spotify because they have live versions and like unreleased versions and like illegal stuff you know like things that were like you know aren't copyrighted things like that so i like youtube premium the second one do you ever listen to audible i am not an audiobook guy i always found it boring and a little slow i kind of tuned it out so there's this thing called audible original so first of all there's audible plus which is if you pay for it you get all these free audio books so i'm always clicking around but they've got some that are as short as 30 minutes so like short stories or like a short like class but then they have audible originals and they'll do like courses remember youtube or itunes university it's almost like that so they like put like whole like stanford lectures so i just click on one of the lectures and listen for a few minutes on audible originals or they do this other thing where they have these like huge productions where it's an audio book but there's like famous actors and multiple of them so it's almost like a play or a movie but audible only and it's free if you're a subscriber so i like that and the last thing all related have you ever used the app libby have you heard of libby never heard of this do you have a library card no okay so if you go to your local library and you get a card which is free you can enter in your library card to this app called libby and you can access unlimited amounts of ebooks and audio books so long as the library in your town has it only only from one library no no no no from like it's like everything like in like anything you could imagine it's likely there yeah but listen there's one major downside which is some things like the popular titles they'll like or they're only allocated i don't know how they do this they're only allocated a certain amount like 10 copies so like there's this book called catch me if you can that i wanted to read it was pretty popular so i had to click request hold and then like i got it like three days later so you just request like you want like 10 20 30 50 things and like you know each thing is released like every couple of days and so it's not always instantaneous but a lot of times it is but it's it's called libby free audiobooks and free ebooks it's pretty sick that's kind of amazing i had never heard of that and i feel like nobody knows about that so they're not gonna be checked out um when i when i go do it or at least where i'm from uh okay so i'm gonna give you a few things that i'm really into right now i'm just gonna go quick because none of these are super revolutionary but they're just things i like so sending voice notes and imessage i have i went from i never sent a voice note and i was like why is this feature even here and i heard that people in china and asia love to do it because it's slow to type there i think because now i'm a dad i'm always just like on the go or not by my computer all the time i can't i'm holding a kid in one arm and i'm just trying to type in the other i have gone all in on on voice notes it's basically how i run my business now as i'm just sending voice notes all day to my team this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients hold history calls support tickets emails and here's a task from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better dude i hate voice notes i hate them well you hate receiving them you hate me i see receiving them so if we're if you and i are in friend mode i'm not listening to one if you and i are in work mode well no not even you or me if me and an employee are in work mode i expect they're going to listen to mine if i'm the boss and so i get why that's cool but if we're peers and you send me one i just automatically default to uh yeah that's the response it's definitely an fu to the receiver it's like you know sit here and listen to me talk slowly and ramble for a minute but like hey that's kind of what this podcast is too so you know whatever all right my second one um this app that's called i think it's called compounding i think you use this too compound or compounding you have this app the personal finance one yeah it's basically just one app that lets you plug in basic metrics like uh if you started with 100 grand and it's compounding at a six percent rate in 10 years it'll be here 15 years it'll be here 25 years i'll be here and the reason i do this is not because every day i need to run a compounding interest calculation but every day i should just as a reminder of the power of simple compounding i think warren buffett has said you know compounding interest is the eighth wonder of the world or something like that 100 true and i think it is very like compounding interest basically breaks your brain it's very hard to like foresee how a a simple change between five percent or eight percent will matter over a 10 year or 15 year period but it matters in a big way yeah it's really fun because i just have a compound interest one yeah this is this is that's all it does okay but it's simple and it's my reminder that slow and steady wins the race because i'm pretty add when it comes to like investments ideas things like that so i need to remind myself of the power of compound interest over a long term okay related there's a twitter account that you should follow that everybody i think should follow called i never give twitter accounts this kind of shine because we do got that influence it's gonna blow them up but this person deserves it their name is 10k diver have you ever seen this account i love them 10k diver is based is just basic uh personal finance so it's just basic or not personal finance basic financial knowledge so it'll be like hey if you're ever looking at a company have a cup of coffee and sit down because this sunday we're talking about balance sheets how to look at them what to learn in a bubble and he just breaks it down so simply so beautifully ver every like simple finance finance concept is being broken down by this person they've shot up they have like 250 000 followers now and uh after this they'll have at least 252 000 followers i believe and so that this account is to me one of my favorite high signal things i normally hate twitter threads i love this guy's twitter threads i find a lot of benefit in just re reviewing the basics or learning the basics for the first time of something that i didn't really understand or know so 10k diver's my next one there's a billion websites on chrome but most people are using it ineffectively here's the five best plugins that you need to be using right now shout out to that guy jack did you see he did a mock thread on these he goes there are 26 letters in the alphabet but most people don't know how to use them here's my favorite letters and how to use them a a is an awesome letter he did this he got like a hundred thousand i sent it to him right when he did it i go this is amazing that thread did over a hundred thousand hundred thousand likes maybe two hundred thousand that's hilarious um all right second thing the next one is um i talked about this before the trigger point massage ball so when we were at camp mfm my i had like an achilles problem you were like hey you need to use this there gun to loosen it up and uh this other guy was like yo use this he threw me like a lacrosse ball yeah and he's like use this to roll out your calf and i did and uh it like i went from i wasn't gonna be able to play to like i was able to play you know like just because that thing loosened it up so well and um i forgot to give back to the guys so i ended up bringing this lacrosse ball home and two things happen one start playing lacrosse [ __ ] love no i love just having a ball in my hand at old all times like just when i was walking through the airport i was just bouncing it around dude just i'm like a little child having a ball just makes my life 15 better i love fiddling with like you know a lacrosse ball it's amazing and so i had it through the airport the airplane i have it at home all the time now i'm playing with this thing and i'm also using it for these trigger point massages for this like uh you know uh fascia release or whatever they call it this is this thing that helps you feel more limber and loose um okay i have another fitness related one that sounds gross but for somebody out there this might be helpful goat milk you ever drink goat milk not much i i eat a lot of that goat cheese but no goat milk kind of has grossed me out oh well goat cheese is the creme de la creme we all know that milk most people are a little bit grossed out about or they just don't know about it i got put onto this by my trainer he's like hey if you want to put something in your your smoothies or shakes protein shakes or whatever instead of using normal milk used goat milk for most adults you're able to digest goat milk better and i think also like the enzymes and goat milk don't um like block the protein enzymes so if you're drinking a protein shake and you drink normal like like lactose based milk uh i think there's like some inhibition where it doesn't like work as well but tastes better but doesn't work as well so goat milk has been a little trick and my last fitness one walking backwards which is from the the knees over toes guy playbook uh i have had knee problems at both knees i've torn my mcl on both sides i've dislocated both kneecaps before i do not have good knees in general and i'm trying to work on that and one of the things that's helped me feel better and like you know run better all the stuff is doing you know what they call it like regression movements basically going in the opposite way that you normally go so let's say you always sit hunched over at a computer then you need to do specific exercise going in the opposite direction to sort of like you know counterbalance this other movement you've been habituated to most of us only run and walk forward so back pedaling is an amazing way to sort of like strengthen and push blood flow into the parts of your body that need it and i feel better doing like this like five-minute backwards walk every single day so uh looks goofy as hell walking around the neighborhood backwards but it's a thing that i'm doing that i enjoy right now chad perry you're talking about lacrosse balls and walking backwards yeah god damn okay chattington [Laughter] first name sean middle named tucker i'm here [Laughter] all right well that's one one question friday [Music] you
