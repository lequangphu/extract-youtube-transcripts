uh he was vicious in business I mean he would basically go out and buy all these small oil refineries and uh if they didn't sell he goes hey look I'm going to write you a fair deal if you don't take my offer I'm gonna trust you I'll show you all my accounting and all my Revenue so you know I'm gonna Crush you so I think you should take this deal so we can get rich together otherwise you're dead [Music] all right what's happening a lot of people have been asking me about what I've been reading lately because I've read a lot of amazing books and I want to do a quick pod a quick episode that explains what I'm reading and how it relates to business most of these books we're only going to go through three or four of them most of these books are not business related but there's a lot of learnings for business people I actually don't read business books I haven't read a business book in like five years they bore me and lately I've been reading a ton of like Adventure stuff so things about like oh when Americans expanded West or about people uh discovering uh North America or ship stories and Pirates I love that type of stuff the reason I love that type of stuff is because it basically makes my daily life it turns the volume down it's kind of like I like the box and I like to like get into adventures and things like that because it makes my day-to-day which is mostly work and business stuff it makes it way easier because I'm like damn I just read the story about Shackleton and how I got deserted on Antarctica for two years this business stuff is easy so I like things like that and so here are three or four books that I've read lately that I've had huge impacts on my day-to-day with business and I'm gonna Explain how and why they did that so the first one is called on undaunted courage it's the story of Lewis and Clark if you're an American if you're not American I actually don't know what you know about Lewis and Clark If You're an American you've heard that term Lewis and Clark and you know that they were people to guys that kind of like were sent to discover the West well this story kind of Dives deep on it and it's a story about in like I believe 1804 so is this guy named Meriwether Lewis and William Clark they were tasked by Thomas Jefferson to start in St Louis and to discover the the the west of the country at this point Jefferson had just bought a bunch of what is now the western part of America from Napoleon and of course Indians and Native Americans they knew all about it but no American had actually been really too far west of the Mississippi and so what's interesting is that Lewis who is the main guy Lewis was kind of the captain of the ship he took 30 folks so him and uh William Clark took 30 folks and they went to to California and back but no one had ever done that at the time and what's amazing is that Meriwether Lewis was only 31 years old and I thought that that was incredibly impressive and they took two years to do it so imagine going off on like a two-year hiking trip and a place you've never been not knowing what you're gonna find and hoping that you come back and I found that to be uh such a good book the first big thing that I learned is punishment is necessary and so in today's kind of like Tech culture I think I used to joke about HubSpot the company that bought mine I was like you guys are too nice man you guys are like way too friendly um and I think that that's like a common theme with like most tech companies is they're way too friendly they're way too nice and I can't stand that and I think I fall victim to that as well the reason being is when I read this book there's just some like a bunch of different stories so imagine just a 31 year old Lewis uh and only 30 guys it's easy to get like chummy with them but he was really really strict and so there's a story about how they had to set up a a fork during the winter time and they set it up along with these Native Americans who they got to know and they set up this fort and they built this wall and one of Louis's men at night time hopped over the fence after he had just gotten done hanging out with the Indians and an Indian saw him and also hopped the fence and they're like hey man you can't be here this is just our space whatever and the next morning Lewis heard about it and they whipped their guy 500 times it's called lashing so they basically tied him to a tree and whipped them 500 times and which is like a horrible punishment and that's like an extreme punishment but the reason he did it was because he's like look you just hey you broke the rule we said you can't climb this fence and B now they know that they're allowed to do that too and so he had really really strict rules but that sounds like crazy like why would you do something like that that bad but basically his point was look discipline breeds excellence and I have to have strict rules and I have to punish people in front of others when they've done something wrong so everyone knows here's the line don't cross it but also by enforcing these strict rules it's going to make people know that like what our standards are and so there's another TV show I've just started watching it's called um uh bear the bear it's about this guy who's got this uh Diner in Chicago and he basically it's kind of like a crappy Diner and he's trying to like step it up and so he sends his cousin to work at this fancy restaurant that's known for their strict discipline and the cousin gets to the restaurant that's really strict and he's like dude this is I'm not following all these rules they have all these rules about like you can't talk to you can't talk to your co-workers in front of the guest you have to be you only can pay attention to them or I don't want you um or you have to like polish the forks your first week of work and you got to spend three hours polishing the forks because the forks can't have any watermarks on them and event eventually at the end of the week he's like man I love this I wish I I crave this discipline because what this does is it lets me know where the rules are what the boundaries are and it gives me a straightforward path that I can go on and it creates this uh this this culture of discipline and excellence and I love that and so big takeaway from this book is you have to have punishment in order to create discipline I think that in our culture right now with tech we are way too forgiving about certain things and it just reminded me that like firing people and things like that I actually think it's necessary the second thing is finding your personal product Market fit so Lewis was an Outdoorsman his whole life and then he eventually had somewhat like an office job so he worked with Thomas Jefferson where he like was like his uh I don't remember what his title is but he would just be inside the house all day with Jefferson like helping him create new laws and how to be diplomatic and things like that and he has this great line in this book he says uh the the author says on his 31st birthday Lewis wrote in a famous passage the day I completed my 31st year I reflected that I had yet has done but little very little indeed to further the happiness of the human race I viewed with regret the hours that I've spent in idolence and now sorely feel that the want of that information which those hours would have given me has been judiciously expended meaning he's like I've wasted my time I have to act and I really appreciate that that he like said look I've been a total waste up until now now I'm gonna get after it and this is my mission and so finding your personal product Market fit we talk about finding your product Market fit with your company I think you have to find your personal product Market fit and so I found that to be incredibly inspiring and the last thing from this book he understood that the people that you're leading each of them have individual traits and you have to figure out those traits and use that to motivate people when I was first starting in business I did a really bad job of understanding that every person is unique and I used to think that I could just tell them what to do that's not the case and so in this book there's this great line where he says Lewis had a sense a feel for how his family was doing he knew exactly when to take a break when to issue issue a gill when to push for more when to encourage when to inspire want to tell a joke when to be tough he knew how to keep a distance from himself and the men and just how big it should be and he did a really good job of figuring out what motivated each person and that has taught me that I should probably do the same before I was like you're kind of all just a bunch of robots to me it's just human capital instead in order to be a great leader particularly like Lewis you have to do a good job of figuring out what motivates people in creating rewards creating punishment in order to fit each person and hopefully making your whole crew better the second book that I recommend it's called the operator and it's by Robert O'Neill and it's about the time when SEAL Team Six was deployed to go and kill Bin Laden and I love reading these these like Army and military books but there's this great line so basically uh Robert O'Neill and his and team SEAL Team Six they were deployed on this helicopter and they were on their way to Bin Laden's compound and he said once we get on this Mission we weren't we knew that we weren't going to see our kids again or kiss our wives we'll never eat another steak or smoke another cigar and there's this like thing about like he's going to on this helicopter and he knows or he thinks that he's never going to come back and survive or see his family again and I found that like so encouraging because sometimes I'm afraid to tweet something or I'm afraid to like start a business or I'm afraid to make a phone call when these guys are like going to like they it's a suicide mission they think that they're getting dropped off in Bin Laden's compound and they're going to kill them and but then they're gonna die and I was like man if these guys can do this I could do this other stuff that's no big deal and so I find like a lot of inspiration from Little stories like that there's this other thing in the book where this other story in the book where basically they figured out where they thought Bin Laden was and it was like this compound imagine like in a house an eight-room Mansion surrounded by a big fence and so they did this thing where they built a a model of this house and they spent weeks running through the house and like saying all right at this point you're going to run this many steps then that's when the room is going to open here you're likely going to find these people in the room but then you're going to do this and they like did it so much that they knew how many steps they were going to take they knew how many seconds each thing was going to take and they planned like crazy but here's the thing when they landed the helicopter into the compound it crashed so from the second the mission started the whole plan got thrown out the the door and everything got screwed up but there's this thing called commander's intent a commander's intent is when uh the intent of the outcome is clear so you have to verbalize it you have to write it down you have to say I'm going to or the out the desired outcome is x y and z and the reason you plan even though you know the plan is going to go to the reason you plan is because a when something does go to you have something to fall back on and B it gives your men or your your employees it gives them confidence that like look it's going to be okay uh We've we've swapped the details but when it doesn't go okay you know what the commander's intent is and I think that for me with my first business I remember starting it and I said by the age of 30 I want to have this much money great that's my commander's intent the reason I wanted this much money was I wanted like Financial Freedom and not to stress out and then once I had my commander's intent I created a plan and I created the rules I was going to follow when I created what input I needed to get to my commander's intent and as expected a lot of things changed so I said like I want this much revenue by year two this much revenue by year five which means I could probably sell I missed revenue on sometimes I uh uh exceeded Revenue other times I had to fire people I changed my values sometimes like things happened along the way but because I had my own commander's intent I said no to everything that didn't get me to my desired outcome and I had something to fall back on when I was making new decisions so I thought to myself is this going to get me closer to that particular goal if yes do it if no don't do it and avoid it and so with the operator I learned about commander's intent and uh planning our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess often actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better in the last book I lied and said it I didn't read a lot of business books this one's kind of businessy it's called Titan and it's about uh the biography of John Rockefeller John Rockefeller was a businessman in the late 1800s all the way to like 1930 or so he created Standard Oil so Standard Oil it's hard to compare to what it is nowadays because it was so big but the offshoots of Standard Oil um so Standard Oil was eventually broken up and so in the 1930s uh Teddy Roosevelt made monopolies illegal and they did it because of Standard Oil the offshoots of Standard Oil which they broke up it's like be I believe it's BP it's Exxon it's Conoco it's mobile all those companies came from Standard Oil it was as if Amazon Facebook and Google or one company basically accounted for a huge percentage of the economy and John Rockefeller though you think of this guy or you think of a business person nowadays as being this like really vicious person and he was kind of vicious but he was very interesting in that he broke a lot of stereotypes in my head a few interesting lines from that book one he said I would rather earn one percent off a hundred people's efforts than a hundred percent of my own efforts and so right now on Twitter and in my world we're seeing lots of things about solo businesses and so a lot of people take pride in Solo businesses and I think many times they're great but I have one big issue with them which is if you're a solo business that means you're the only one doing all the work and John Rockefeller in that line where he talks about one percent of other people versus 100 of his that kind of changed my thinking where it's significantly better even if someone isn't as good as you it's better to have a handful of those people doing a lot of the work versus only you doing the work that like kind of changed my thinking on on on what it means to be a sole business because I'm like I would way rather have um a bunch of people doing a little bit of work and then he has this other line that says the ability to deal with people is a per is as perchable purchasable a commodity as sugar and coffee and I pay more for that ability than any other Under the Sun and I thought that was interesting because I'm not the best manager but I can hire good managers and so that kind of like got rid of the the blocker ahead of my head of like well if he says that hiring people is good but I'm not good at managing them oh cool I can hire people to manage them so that was like really useful for me he also has this uh great learning about gaining a skill so I'm a huge fan of telling people look before you start a company or before you go and uh and try to do your own thing you need to learn a skill in my case it was copywriting I'm a big fan of copywriting but he's got this great line where he talks about his time as an accountant so from the ages of 16 to like 19 or 20 he was an accountant for a small firm that's where he learned about operations and where he learned about like where does money come from how should it be accounted for how to uh great operations look like he's got this great line where he goes oh how blessed the young men are who have struggled for a foundation in the beginning of Life I'll never cease to be grateful for the three and a half years I spent as an apprentice and so that's where he learns all about uh the the the the the the ability to overcome to adapt to get a skill and so that kind of changed my life there's this other great book called Mastery by Robert Greene and the whole book is about on how you should develop a skill because in learning that skill it teaches you and uh how to master something and it also opens doors for you and you could use that skill in other unrelated fields and that's how you become incredibly successful I'm a big fan of learning a skill and John Rockefeller is one of the guys who taught me the importance of that I used to think being a generalist was good not anymore I don't think that anymore and it's because of this book Titan and the last thing I said previously that he um was a really nice guy uh he was vicious in business I mean he would basically go out and buy all these small oil refineries and uh if they didn't sell he goes hey look I'm going to write you a fair deal if you don't take my offer I'm gonna trust you I'll show you all my accounting and all my Revenue so you know I'm gonna Crush you so I think you should take this deal so we can get rich to get rich get we can get rich together otherwise you're dead a lot of them took him up on that and they did get rich some of them they didn't and so he was pretty vicious but he was pretty much nice along the way there's this famous story about how uh once his company got big Rockefeller had this piece of exercise equipment and he was like rolling the exercise equipment into the office and this accountant who hadn't recognized Rockefeller said hey you got to get that out of here you can't have that here and so Rockefeller just looked at him and goes oh all right I'm sorry and he politely took the exercise equipment uh out of that room and moved it to another room he didn't like snap back like do you know who I am and I thought that that was really interesting and like a cool way of handling it and show that you can be a polite guy you could be kind and vicious in business they're not opposites another thing is that he was famous for like laying down during meetings and closing his eyes because he just said this is just easier for me to listen and uh they used to like uh talk about him behind his back and they would say man this guy Rockefeller it feels like he's sleeping like he doesn't even pay attention to what we're saying in the meetings and he would say no I'm I'm listening uh like I I choose to let everyone talk I want to sit back and say nothing and I'm just going to sit in silence and at the end of the meeting I'll say thank you everyone but he just would sit and listen he would barely talk and someone asked him why and he recited this poem that he would say constantly he said a wise uh a wise old owl lived in an oak the more he saw the less he spoke the less he spoke the more he heard why aren't we all like that old bird and so he would like just sit and listen and then when he had to make a decision he had all types of information that he needed in order to make that uh decision and so I used to think that when you're up this big successful businessman you got to be the one doing all the talking no it's the opposite you got to be doing all the listening and finally he did a very good job of complimenting people so whenever he saw someone who was making a mistake he was famous for complimenting them first so like for example there was this accountant uh that who he had and Rockefeller was an old uh former accountant he saw a mistake and he goes these books are very well kept very well indeed however I noticed one little small mistake right here and it was like actually a pretty big Heir but he was really good at catching the mistake complimenting him first and then uh uh getting them to correct it because they knew that the way that you motivate people is you kind of got to make them respect you a little bit you can't uh insult them in front of a bunch of people and he did a really good job of uh of handling people and I thought that that was a really fascinating uh thing for him to do as opposed to being like this guy in TV Show Who's like you made this video you're fired in front of everyone to make an ordeal out of it uh so I thought that was interesting so these are the three books Titan the operator and undaunted courage go and check him out I'm a big fan of them [Music]

and I highly highly recommend this because again judgment and decision making is the most important thing you can have people are terrible at actually honing that they always say oh yeah I learned a lesson really what what was it did you did you write down what you were thinking then and what you've learned since no like you know we put very little effort into this [Music] so I have this list of questions that I sell uh I have this document that I have I think I might have shared this once before but I call it the decision register where I basically write down every major decision that I make and so for example the very first one that I have in this list is from when I was 18 years old it says quit pre-bend and this was uh sorry I was 20 21 years old so I'm I'm a senior in college I'm pre-med I take the MCAS but I decide not to go to med school the most obvious obviously good decision you've ever made so I then I have the here's the call the worst doctor excuse me the worst doctor I'm like we could fix this the obvious way but let's try something stick out your tongue we'll use that for your ACL um all right so and then I have an X column it says did it seem big in the moment because one learning was a lot of the biggest decisions didn't actually seem big in the moment uh but turned out to be an important decision um and then I basically have like kind of the what was the one decisive reason why so if I boil down like not a long list of pros and cons like what's the one thing that like the main reason I made that decision um and then outcome and lesson learned and so I'll give you another example um a decision sell to Twitch and not to Facebook those are the two final companies that we had given us good offers that we turned out more money from Facebook to take the twitch offer did it seem big yeah felt big in the moment why because after six years of a startup I was tired and Facebook was looking at us like we were gonna save their kind of gaming initiative you know they were looking at us to like make make it happen where I was like twitch has already won I like you know I can just cruise control when I'm here like let me just go play for the winning team versus trying to like take the underdog from the bottom of the league to the top um in terms of this industry and uh you know then it's like you know one of the Lessons Learned is you know I don't know what the other side was so I know what I got out of it but so I think it was a good call I'm happy with the decision but you never know and that's how a lot of these decisions go um so I have this decision registered now a version of it would be uh like there's a bunch of investment decisions here you know like um uh not buying ethereum and Bitcoin when the smartest people I knew literally working in my office were doing it at the time didn't seem like a big decision I just kind of overlooked it I didn't even realize this was a big decision I was making seemed weird I just kind of laughed at something because it seems strange rather than leaning in and trying to understand why why are you so excited about this and like hmm could I place a small tester BET right so terrible decision bad call um you know and I didn't pay attention to a signal which is what the nerds do on the weekend we'll probably all do you know in a few years and this is what the Nerds were doing on the weekend back then they were really interested in cryptocurrencies um okay so anyways I have this like decision register now with it I have a bunch of like questions that I ask when I'm gonna make a decision let me pull that doc up real quick and you've been is this a running document that you've had for 10 years um no I started it um like four or five years ago but I back I tried to go back and figure out like do I um and it's like a Google Docs Google doc exactly and I highly highly recommend this because again judgment and decision making is the most important thing you can have people are terrible at actually honing that they always say oh yeah I learned a lesson really what what was it did you did you write down what you were thinking then and what you've learned since no like you know we put very little effort into this and so I I I've I've basically realized one Edge one source of alpha is to take a disproportionate amount of time than most people it doesn't even take that much time right it's like you know a couple hours twice a year but just doing that exercise can improve my judgment at a rate maybe two or three x what a normal person's would would do and then all of a sudden people are like man uh you know how do you you know like whatever where do you get this wisdom from God Sean you're so good at you're you're so wise yeah you're such a good at decision making like those abs you gotta do something yeah put it on me all right so here's the decisions here's the questions I asked for an investor here's what I have to run through I say um what is the decision explain why I'm doing this in a tweet length so I have to be able to explain why I'm doing the decision in a tweet length uh what alternatives did I consider did I consider any alternatives what am I feeling and I have some options uh like extreme fear pessimism neutral boredom fatigue greed extreme greed fomo right like those those are the things I could be feeling right now uh how long have I been thinking about this decision right is it a few hours few days three weeks three months a few years who and what tipped me over the edge so what is like kind of the last conversation or podcast or thing I read that like made me make take action um what are the secondary benefits of this so like can I sleep better at night because I'm not worried about a margin call or something like that um if I took away all the secondary benefits would I still make this decision yes or no what makes me think I'm right so I have to write why do I think I'm right about this what maybe what makes you think I might be wrong um upside if I'm right downside if I'm wrong so I have to define those two and I say what follow-up decision should I make to make this decision more successful um and then how do you predict that this is going to play out and I have to like answer how I predict it's going to play out and then I basically set a date it says what date will you revisit this and so I'll go revisit this um and so I did this for when I sold all my stocks I could go look at this right now and be like was I right was I wrong do I do what can I learn from how I was thinking then so that the next time I can think better basically about this like how many decisions do you have that you've documented this way I think I have done this maybe four or five times now in the last like you know two three years you know like selling you it was one for example um uh you know making a big financial decision investing in um you know a private company um you know deciding to rent instead of buy a house right now things like that do you consult your wife when you do these things as well no I probably should she wishes I did but I don't know well not necessarily like asking for permission but like getting your her perspective yeah that's the problem I want her perspective but I feel like uh there's like this the messed up psychology of me is like kind of turns into asking for permission at some point you know like you got to be aligned to do this and like what if she's not a line uh maybe I'll just do this which she hates and how much decision or how much like when you're selling the milk road yeah you sold the last company I think before you were married but when you're selling the milk Road um are you like hey just so you know this is happening or is it like hey it's happened no no I talked to her a bunch I got her opinion on it um and you know several times during the process and uh you know she's very helpful that um it's more of the like stock or startup Investments that I don't really remember because I'm like man I'll have to explain so much context because it's not an area she pays attention to she doesn't pay attention to the stock market she never bought a stock in her life she doesn't know about startup investing Angel Investing or these companies so I'm like oh man the context for that is really hard but like selling a decision to sell a company or buy a company that's much easier to explain right no I I consult my wife a ton on this stuff but I I think it's more so of like I just need to speak this and uh like I need you to just like be a brain a little bit like that that character on billions the like the office like uh Wendy yeah like mindset coach or psychologist whatever I feel like she's like Wendy like her demeanor is like so even Keel yeah she's called she's like I could see her being very like third party about it versus saying like uh like I could see her being like I'm gonna help you with this decision versus like this is our decision I'm gonna have my opinion you're gonna have your opinion then we're gonna figure out whose opinion is Right totally yes and I think that I have a history of making emotional decisions and so I A lot of times I need someone to be like hey don't be crazy don't do this right now just like sleep on it just wait just wait um dude the decision register is good I think you should I think you're very talented at these Frameworks I'm gonna probably steal that for Hampton because I think it's quite good so you have to post it on the YouTube link so yeah I can actually read it I do something similar it's different this is more organized I'll put it I'll put a link to it in the description on the show notes for YouTube and whatever and you can just I'll just make it a template people can make a copy of it for themselves um and that's on we'll we'll plug your thing small boy is it dot Co or.com dot Co yeah a boy spelled normal or like baller boy not boy small normal this is the smallboy.com uh yeah dude that thing's growing like crazy man we have like a hundred thousand people on the list now and uh it's amazing that's like in a very shorter period short period of time did you start at zero I started uh 40 38k I think um when did you start it so I had 38k from like your old email newsletter five through Tuesday type of thing and then basically at this start of this year-ish like maybe February or something six months ago yeah maybe five six months ago started any paid marketing uh yeah paid marketing on um a little bit of paid marketing you know still I think half is like organic or something like that so you know it's like half organic growth half uh paid growth there's newsletters man they're the best yeah they're the best that I take all the credit I take it 100 of the credit I get one not your effort not your day-to-day hard work it's all me of just saying newsletters are cool exactly um I'll take that I'll take 100 newsletters are awesome dude my my decision register for why to start the milk Road was like I think I know how to do this because I watched Sam do this like from scratch with the hustle and like I think if you took the hustle plus crypto that would work that was like you know the whole thing is like pretty sure hustle plus crypto would work secondary benefits dude hustle plus anything will work like just do the hustle Plus or as you say it's like you're like the milk Road of business and Tech news uh yeah you know what's the hustle it's like the milk road but for this thing um but no the milk Road the hustle plus anything it's it's all that will work for the foreseeable feature I think this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better well you know what's funny I don't know how much you get hit up by these people who are doing newsletter businesses probably all the time I ignore them you ignore them I've learned to ignore him because my friend Ramin has this great little framework he says which is every business is hard it's just hard in one of two places it's either hard zero to one or it's hard one to end and what he means by that is like it's some business are really hard to get started and get initial momentum and then some businesses are really hard like really easy to get initial momentum but then turning that into a valuable business um that's like at scale is really hard and I would say because of this podcast people basically see Sam did it newsletter Sean did it with the newsletter I too will do you know the AI version of this like you know I'll do the whatever version of this newsletters are very easy zero to one businesses they're not easy one to end and as I've talked to people that are doing this and they're asking for kind of advice or whatever I'm like talk to me in six months I told one of the I I guess straight up I go um you're gonna drive this is driving off a cliff you don't even realize it yet um and I was like he's like why and I was like you know to explain this to you we'll take like you know some time and like explain what what I think you should do instead um I don't really feel like coaching that but uh I'm just gonna tell you like please don't fall in love with this as is because I'm telling you that this isn't this isn't going to work this is not the answer to making something that's successful like because it's very easy to see just the subscriber count going up um or like if you're in a hot space like AI you'll get easy sponsorship revenue for like you know the next six to 12 months but like if you want to take this to the Finish Line where this thing is spinning off millions of dollars a year profit and you're able to sell it for maybe tens of millions of dollars which is what all these people I think would dream of doing um that's where the real skill comes in in this and I think that as a lot of these people I do not feel are equipped to do that based on what I hear their plans are the person who's done it best I think is Austin Rafe for morning yes it's um 10 years old now um I think they publicly said that revenue is in the 70 to 90 range I forget exactly what they said publicly but something like that 200 250 employees I forget I went to their office dude he's got like a tech office set up it's like a beautiful office like he's done it all the right way where I mean he's made a bunch of Errors just like everyone but that they he's done such a good job of having durability and long-term View and also short-term like moving quickly that guy's a machine he's one of the more impressive operators well the thing is people see that they see the hustle um and they see just like the tip of the iceberg right it's like this Iceberg Theory like when you see an iceberg in the water you're only seeing you know the top little bit you don't see the giant ninety percent of the mass is under the water the benefit for me with milk Road was I was there when you were doing just events and then blogs and then you pivoted to the newsletter we were in a mastermind group so we're checking in every month every month we would meet we would talk about what's going on what you're trying to do and so I got to cease The Five-Year under the water like build up and I think most people don't have that like that's a that's just luck basically for me that I had that um and that's why milk Road was able to work a lot better than if I hadn't had that most people don't have that they're just trying to copy what they see on the surface level and that'll get you kind of the zero one I don't know if that's going to get you the one to end I I think for most people not I think if you're a great entrepreneur you'll make it work no matter what uh the problem is you survey 10 entrepreneurs they all think they're a great entrepreneur but sort of by definition not everybody's above average right like you get um you know maybe one out of the 10r the problem is all 10 think that they're that one and uh you know that's gonna be yeah they're challenging what they don't see is that morning Brew at this point the hustle I don't know how many employees they have now but we don't sell ads but with morning Brew in order to make 70 or 80 million dollars a year in Revenue you need 80 sales people and if you have 80 sales people you also need 30 like people to like handle the stuff that they're selling um you also need like Evergreen content like you guys talk about what's going on in general with General business people who are doing these AI newsletters right now they're like here's the latest new demo in AI guess what 18 months from now that shit's not going to be interesting at all to anybody and the advertisers are going to realize that the type of person who just wants to like see an AI demo is not very valuable to advertise to um milk road work because people who read about crypto like what's going on in crypto we're crypto investors crypto investors are a very valuable audience segment and that and so that was very different than just like so crypto AI they're all just topics right they're all just the new thing no no because the people who write about crypto were putting tens of thousands hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars into those portfolios and we're a very valuable customer that's not true with an AI reader right but they don't see that they just see the surface level stuff they're not thinking about it critically enough to realize that they're just writing this like kind of current momentum where every day there's like a mind-blowing demo and people are curious 18 months from now that that's going to fatigue out that is not going to be the case that and then and also your Advertiser is going to realize that like cool advertising yourself a random guy who likes to see like you know the cool stuff that AI could do that's not translating into a lot of money because that's not a very valuable uh audience demo um it's not going to work and you can't be a mercenary about the content like a lot of people are like oh I just hired this person overseas and we use AI to actually make the content and uh that's really hard not impossible but it's hard at the end of the day when you have a newsletter you have to get someone to act you have to say uh I am going to be at this location at this time and if no one shows up then your [ __ ] sucks right and getting people to do that is really really really hard um it's very challenging at the end of the day it's about getting people to take an action whether it's to buy something to show up somewhere and that's really [ __ ] hard if you're a mercenary versus a missionary right and you're like all in on this [ __ ] that's why milk Road works because you said I one of the coolest things you guys did was I invested this much money into crypto here's my portfolio you can see it as we go I am yeah I'm in this [ __ ] and I'm going to talk about that and I talked about the stuff that like each day it was basically what is the thing I'm most curious about that was the only guiding principle it wasn't like news it wasn't announcements like if those were in the letter the newsletter cool that's fine but the lead story had to be the thing that I thought was most interesting which was sometimes Twitter drama which was sometimes a cool product which is sometimes a price analysis which was something whatever and um that's very different than if you hire a a journalist or an aggregator to basically like summarize headlines from from stuff and so you know that worked for us I don't think that's the only way to make it work but uh it was one of the ways where it felt very different and like you said like if we said hey we're going to be here at this time and date people would cut people would come because they were excited um and they were excited to meet us they were excited to meet other people that are like them and the brand um you know had had some influence on people which is what you need in order to do this if you just throw up a quick beehive newsletter and you get like you know 12 000 subscribers and like you know the number of subscribers is really the wrong metric I guess that's the other way of putting it um people it's the easiest metric and again the easiest metric is not the right metric necessarily it's the easiest metric to look at but I don't think it's the right metric to look at for a newsletter this is one of those episodes where we talked about stuff that I personally care about I could talk about this newsletter crap forever I can talk about personal finances forever this rate it might be a high ratio of things we love to talk about but maybe our audience doesn't all entirely love but I'm very eager to see the response to this um I could talk about this stuff forever this stuff actually interests me like totally and by the way I think that's the only way this podcast can work is uh like I was watching this thing uh Joe Rogan uh Joe Rogan doesn't go on very many other podcasts but one of the ones he goes on is like this breaking points news thing that he likes um so they interviewed him and they go they go Joe you know like everybody does podcasting everybody does interviews not not everybody's having like what's your like what you what you've created with JRE like what are you doing differently breaking points is awesome yeah I know breaking points yeah uh Sagar and I forgot what her name is uh yeah the woman there too they're they're good and so they uh and what do you say at first he just tries to brush it off he's like I don't know I don't like I don't know it's just like kind of like fake humility but also like you think he's trying to make a point which is it's not some calculated thing and um and then but the guy pushes he's like but there must be something like whether you know whether you planned it or you intuitively do it like you agree there's a difference between what you're doing and what other people are doing and there's a difference in the results you're getting like just if you had to think about it if you had to answer what would you answer it's kind of kind of pushing him and he goes he goes I think that's the thing I don't have a like I don't come in with this sort of like plan or agenda he goes look when I started this podcast I didn't think anybody listened you couldn't even tell if anybody was listening and he's like so I just really had nothing to lose and I just decided to do it the way I wanted to do it so like I just wanted like if I'm chilling with my friends or we're smoking weed and that's what the episode is great because that's what I wanted to do if I'm fascinated by this alien conspiracy and I can talk to this scientist great that's the conversation I want to have everybody told me like this needs to be one hour long it needs to be shorter three hours is just too long he's like but I didn't like how the conversation was gonna be in an hour I liked having the three-hour conversation so that's what I did even though it like you know broke the rule it wasn't like audience driven he goes and so now yeah he's like basically that's what was working so I just decided not to change it he's like basically I just this podcast is a massive education for me I have the conversations I want to have in the way that I want to have it and um you know I just don't do things that are like lean into this the audience is really responding to this he goes that's how you end up like those late night talk shows where everything is just fake like the host is fake the interactions are fake it's just like it's quote unquote professional but it's the least real thing and he's like I don't think people like that actually he goes podcasts are professionally unprofessional and he goes uh he goes I just don't read the comments and I don't try to do things based on what the ratings reviews are going to be he goes I realize the only way for this to be interesting was if I'm actually interested in it you can't fake being interested in it for very long it comes through he's like so the only way to do this is if I'm interested in it and then I'm just the audience will be what it's going to be at that point like it'll just be the other people who are interested in this and that's sustainable for like kind of forever um and I thought that that is it relates to like um uh Hassan minhaj he he said this thing to me once he goes he goes I'm not he goes I'm like why aren't you on Tick Tock bro like why aren't you more on Instagram like you could be killing it dude these are growing I'm giving all the logical reasons to be on he goes I don't want to be on because I know to do to win in those games you just have to dance for the algorithm like whatever the algorithm wants that's what you got to do and he's like I just don't want to do that I want to be an artist he goes the best he's like I come from Comedy and the best people who are the best comedians they um they're free they just do what they want and they are the judge they don't care really like they pick up on signals from how people react to it but like they are the end decision maker of if something was good or not and um he's like you see this in everything he goes he goes I love basketball you see it's on the basketball court guys like Steph Curry or Luca dances they're free they're just playing how they want to play and that's it they don't they're not like overthinking it they don't they don't they don't have this like voice in their head that's constantly judging it and thinking it they're actually free to just create their art and he's like that's what he's like that's like how the best people operate and um Rogan said the same thing about comedians he goes if you watch Dave Chappelle he'll do these shows in front of like 50 people he's done shows in front of 50 000 people but he knows it for 50 people he's having a great time he's having a great time because he's out there smoking a cigarette and chilling he's just smoking a cigarette he's talking he's not even doing planned material he's like he's having a great time because he just likes doing it this way and that happens to have gotten him a huge fan base and he's like that's kind of my like if you want to say what's your strategy he's like that's my strategy and I think that that's just like a more admirable way to approach like content creation versus this like um I'm gonna just cater to this moving Target of like what my audience what what the audience wants well there's a there's there's a way of like not truly caring but then you also like I like seeing our feedback we had a guy message us and he's like someone died in my family and I listened to you guys a ton and that and I'm like oh that's that's sick or they'll someone be like man I love when you talked about this I'm like that's awesome right I feel good about that I want to make people feel good as well while also making myself be selfish and only talking about what I want to talk about but it there is a small motivation of it feels good to make others feel good but we don't like go crazy on that yeah yeah yeah exactly and just who ultimately who's in charge right like you might have three co-founders in your business But ultimately push who makes the decision if push comes to shove obviously you all talk about it you all have a say but if a decision needs to be made who can who can make a final call in a tough to sit tough spot and I think that's in on the content side I think that who makes the tough call in the end has to be do you think it's good do you like it are you interested in it all right that's that is the highest to me that's the highest like order decision maker what do you want to wrap here yeah let's wrap it up all right we have a bunch of stuff next week but that's the pod [Music] foreign

I've lost more money than most people have ever made [Music] all right I've got a couple interesting topics today the biggest one and this is more what we're gonna do right now is I want I want to do something that I only do privately I'll do it publicly I like it yeah that could go different that could go different ways but you could critique me but basically like with some of my friends and some people in Hampton I do this thing called a portfolio review where I explain my financial portfolio and you are allowed to critique it and challenge me in order to like hopefully make me better okay uh you know you know what I'm saying I know exactly what you're saying you don't have to keep asking I know what you were saying you know what I'm saying you asked this question a lot to Our Guest I think it first started with Ryan holiday and I thought it was like just the most blunt wonderful question you go so what do you do with your money and I thought that was wonderful and so that's kind of how I like came up with the idea to do this and so I figured today we can do that does that sound interesting to you yeah let's do it all right the portfolio review and I guess I think we're going to do this like the other way I like to ask the question is if there was a pie chart you know roughly what percent are you putting over here what percent are you putting over there and why and I'm not like one of those guys so our friend Nick Huber sent an email out the other day and he put like exact numbers of everything of his net worth and there's a bunch of people who do that I'm not that transparent so I don't I don't particularly like that but I'll be very transparent about something yeah we're not going financially streaking here but um you know yeah if we can go to the beach I'll take my shirt off yeah yeah yeah we're gonna go we're gonna pop the top but we're not we're keeping the bottoms on right um okay so um first let me say my strategy for this whole thing the first thing is that a lot of this is contingent on my previous strategy which I started when I was like 21 years old was to start and sell a business by the age of 30. I thought if I did that that would give me some Financial Security which was basically rooted in like being insecure about money for a very long time and wanting to have like some type of security so that's like a lot of people listening in the YouTube comments I know they're gonna say but how did you get like blank well we talked about that a ton but anyway it was about starting and selling a company another thing unlike you Sean and I think unlike most of our listeners I would say I am incredibly conservative and so that is not the right Fit For A lot of people right the reason I'm conservative is I'm gonna break it down into four different accounts of which my big major account I consider that account my livable money so I don't actually draw off any of it but my game plan was to sell a business and have that big windfall if I wanted to it could just go into uh the stock market and the gains could pay for the rest of my life without ever having to touch the principal so that's kind of like uh the strategy on that and then also as of now I currently live off of my income so we make income from this podcast from our other companies my wife works so I live off that money so I don't actually touch anything just explains I think without numbers it's hard let's pretend for a second that when you sold the hustle you made 10 million dollars after taxes let's just pretend that's true yeah what you're saying is you put 10 million dollars in Vanguard index and that's you're basically like if I need it that's there I'm financially independent but you don't want to touch it and so you live you pay your bills off of things like this podcast or you know people buying your digital products or random stuff like that that's like kind of money and money out that's your that's how you fund your lifestyle and you can do whatever you want and then you have this Nest Egg that's there that's basically what you're saying was your kind of strategy from 20s was basically live cheap build a company sell it so you have that Nest Egg now you're like I got The Nest Egg and I have this income Source that's that's pretty strong that pays for all of my lifestyle stuff what now specifically the way that I had planned on it was let's say you had 10 million dollars you can draw out three percent of that per year and basically your nut your portfolio that 10 million dollars would hypothetically and mostly realistically based off 100 Years of data continue to grow each year some years it actually wouldn't some years avoid but it would average to uh Each decade it would grow uh yes and that number is three percent that I hypothetically would pull out of course I don't but I could and then finally my strategy is to reduce stress and to make income from my private companies and so I am not an active investor of which we are going to see and also this is not advice I don't know anything so don't actually do anything I'm saying I'm just telling you what I do all right also if this were advice this is like the financial equivalent of like try missionary right it's like you know you're not even gonna like this portfolio review is not going to be like it's some like crazy backdoor sweep that's you know it puts over here some calls over there like I'm pretty sure what you're gonna say is that by the index uh buy some bonds and then I try to build more wealth through my private businesses did I already did I spoil your portfolio review exactly let's talk about percentages and and what index are you buying is it one are you buying multiple indexes all right so I'm gonna break this down into four categories category one I'm just gonna call it the big account I'm not gonna say who I use because I don't want people looking after me or going after me the second thing so there's the big account which is the earnings from my sale there's other Liquid account which I'll talk about there's non-liquid stuff and there's private company stuff okay okay so the big the big account I have 79 of that in vti so that's just a Vanguard Total Index Fund another 15 of the pie chart is in short-term treasuries which are currently yielding I think 4.9 and I think it's like a 60-day term meaning um every 60 days as of now uh we're rebiting rebuying them they could be 90 days I forget but the short term and then six percent in a real estate fund that buys Walgreens I think it's called like Oak oak tree or I don't even know just some boring thing that like owns like either hundreds or thousands of Walgreen buildings and Walgreens releases the buildings and year to date vti up 19 one year chart 15 5-year chart 57 that's fine I'll take that all day uh what's vti historically over the last 30 years I think it's like eight percent a year maybe yeah so that it's just boring stuff and then bonds prior to like when the economy was killing it like three years ago I think Bonds were like one percent now they're like five percent and so I'll take that all day and I think like a savings account like a high yield savings account is also like three or four percent um which is where I keep cash which is basically all a way of saying wealth preservation at this point which is not where most people are at wealth creation is where most people are at wealth preservation is where you're at where you're basically like um you're just trying not to lose the nest egg the big the big account let's say it's about just keep up with inflation maybe beat it a little bit um okay the whole Market goes down I'm Diversified I will also go down but less so than somebody who was concentrated bets trying to make a bunch of money yes my opinion is that most people if they are trying to make a lot of money should try to make money through starting a company or owning equity in a company and then as their cash flow comes in as long as they don't need that to start another business they should mostly do what I'm doing which is what I've done before I did this I was just in wealth front and by the way you said this on a different podcast I think it's worth saying so you're like I wanted to be kind of like Rich by 30 ish and you're like to do that basically have to start a business uh and not only that I think you the the likelihood of selling a business and getting there is probably higher because if you start a company at the age of 21 and you want to earn 10 million dollars you could assume that more likely than not your first three years you're going to make minimum wage or in my case I made 20 grand a year uh I made two thousand dollars a month is when I paid myself for the first two years of my business so that gets you to like the age of 25 which means you have to average something like two or three million dollars a year in profit uh because you got to get taxed and that will accumulate to like 10 million dollars I think that's very very challenging and I think it's a little bit about selling yeah that's that's the differentiation here it's about selling versus uh yeah cash flowing your way there that's my opinion yes and the way that my like quote big account works is I keep roughly 100 to 200 000 in my checking account any number or savings account whatever you'll use any number above that goes straight into my investment fund this big account all right the second one I got a sugar mama have I told you that how is she what's her name her name's Sarah I've been with her for nine years and she's my sugar mama my wife actually made money before I did my wife uh went to Penn very very smart woman went to an Ivy League school got a job at Facebook and then worked at Airbnb she's been there for like six or seven years Airbnb went public in December I think of 2021 we thought that they were going to go out of business we didn't think Airbnb was going to work out turns out they did awesome I think when she started working there I think the her uh the the valuation of Airbnb was 10 billion it could have been 18. I don't remember when it iPod I think it was a hundred billion I don't know what it is today but it's tens of billions her stock did wonderful so we own a bunch of Airbnb stock of which we have sold none of it what are you looking at Airbnb stock right now 93 billion 93 billion so I think it was like 8 billion during the pandemic if I remember correctly I don't remember exactly we haven't sold a lick of that the other stock of which we own is HubSpot when I sold to HubSpot I was given a bunch of stock I have not sold any of it other than the amount that I had to take out to pay taxes uh and that's like a legal thing like they they automatically take that out my intention is to not sell any of that in the next five years um maybe I will maybe I won't as of now I don't need the money I like both Airbnb and I like HubSpot I'm not selling any of that at the moment I also have a 401k that I've always maxed out and then I have Bitcoin that I bought in 2014 that basically has just sat there dormant forever and I don't even know what it is now but right I have not sold any of it have you ever sold Bitcoin yeah I've sold Bitcoin at a couple different points each time I sold was a poor decision uh I don't know if I tell you the first time I sold so I bought Bitcoin like back was like 300 or stuff like that that's my original original buy I feel like 400 was my average and um it shot up to I don't know three thousand four thousand at one point I go to a wedding and my aunt I think I told the story before my aunt who's like you know an Indian Auntie is I'm I walk into a conversation she's having with her friends and she's she literally goes oh yeah ethereum is very good and I was like I was like my aunt's talking about ethereum and saying it's very good and I was like well how could you say it's good ethereum it used to be this price now it's despised it's very good and I was like oh it's good because the price is going up but I was like pretty sure there's bubbles I've read something about this this is I think the moment when like your Indian Auntie you know on the east coast is talking about assets that like you know are good because they go up and telling her friends they gotta buy and I'm like this is gonna be a bubble and um I was right and wrong so I immediately go and I try to liquidate everything I try to sell the whole thing everything I have coinbase limits wait was it really because of that literally because of that I so like that night I could try to sell everything coinbase is limiting me because you can't just sell like lots of lots of stuff at once they're like you can only sell like I don't know 15 grand at a time or something like that so I'm trying to Max it out every day and try to sell and um and at some point I got time by the fifth day or whatever I was like okay let me just leave whatever else is there it's fine and it kind of wore off um Bitcoin shoots up to 19 000 in like the next two months and I was like oh my God what am I doing I miss timed the bubble and then it goes back down to like whatever 3000 I was like I feel good now and I was like this is stupid I shouldn't just feel good and bad I shouldn't try to time this basically um I either believe in this or I don't in the long term and I should just dude I can't believe that you let your aunt that one story sway like change your actions oh that's happened to me multiple I told you about the Tesla one too I obviously owned a ton of like the only stock I owned early on was Tesla but back then Tesla was like very like kind of like a young stock it was like maybe like a two or three billion dollar evaluation maybe five and um what's it now like 600 billion or a trillion or something it went up to basically close to a trillion um now I don't know what it says I can't even do that math so what's a thousand dollars in Tesla that's stupid I had a very small amount of money at a college I had like made like 25k in my first job or something like that I saved enough to like invest that much 25 30k or something and I did the math once uh yeah it's at 900 billion now so it would have been basically I remember when I had done the math it was like oh that 25k would have been like six million dollars by now um if I just held and instead um I went on Reddit and there's like I don't know if you don't read it there's all these like it's called like Tesla Q it's basically like a group of people that believe that Tesla is like going to zero slash like maybe it's like fraudulent and there's like all these liposed they say that they have fake cars right like like they're Photoshop images they're not fake cars but like lots of other things like that like there would be like guys who'd be like gosh there's this Garage in Phoenix and look at this and he would go to this garage and it was only Tesla's parked on six stories that he's walking everybody he's like they're stashing them here so that you can't tell where they're like because if they just leave them in the factory lot it's clear they're not selling they're piling up he's like look at this this one has and he's like putting his finger on it's got dust he's like look at this this hasn't moved in months and I was like he's right thank you you slash 333 kitty kitty like you know and I was like just taking all these signals from people on Reddit that were like look at it and I think at one point they had had like 15 different CFOs and I was like that does seem fishy why have so many CFOs come looked at the books and left in a very short period of time that doesn't sound right and I basically took all these signals and I sold and I was like so I tripled my investment or quadrupled my investment and I was like yeah I'm getting out of the top boys and then uh you know like 100x since then so yeah it wasn't really it wasn't really and that's the second time that's happened to you the first time it happened to you was with stripe when you had a job offer I think at stripe no no I blew the the interview I didn't get the offer the guy was like um I only applied to one job it was striped back in 2011 or 12. so I would have been like employee 20 at stripe which is like a guaranteed like if you if you stick it out and you're there for four or five years or seven years and you kind of like work your way up a little bit even at a junior level entry position probably would have ended up over like a seven year period making somewhere between 10 and 20 million dollars and um my mentor is the mentor of the guy who's interviewing me that's his mentor right the mentors have a pretty big influence if the mentor says hey this person's amazing you're like oh thank you Sensei like I I'll listen I he my mentor had written a blog post saying I met this kid he's 21 years old he's an entrepreneur and he's got the highest like bias for action of anybody I've met in the last 10 years and I was like Wow glowing five-star review basically I hand it to this guy this guy's like wow if John thinks this about you let's do the interview anyways as a formality uh yeah we got to do it but like I'm so excited to talk and we talk and somehow I blew like a 30 30 30 point lead during the interview where I um he's like okay so like you know let's this is kind of like a sales position like you know sell me a piece of software that you really liked I was like I was like sell me this pen a um I was like I was like so what I would do is I would basically just ask him a bunch of questions he said no no like ring ring hello like just do it pretend and I was like and I just I don't know like I don't know what I said but whatever I said at the end he's like yeah that wasn't very good um yeah I don't think this is a sales probably not your thing you're probably not that good at this so um you know maybe there's another position we could look for and I was so embarrassed at that point or whatever I was like ah this this guy basically rejected me and said maybe there's some other role for you like you know down in the basement yeah maybe you could fold someone's laundry one of the engineers laundry and I was like all right [ __ ] it I'm gonna go for this other job instead and the inner the guy was like uh he was like so Sean what do you know about stripe and like the banking system Sean's like uh well I like money I would like I would like to have some more of it White Stripes uh Crest Whitening Stripes sorry sorry those are strips uh let's see Adidas logo you ever been Stripes comedian store love it uh that's how that interview went so that blew it you blew that one but that's okay that's okay you let emotions sway you and I'm gonna give you a a lesson here in that I never do that so it's okay your weakness is my strength so it's good because I don't sell anything as I like to say I've lost more money than most people have ever made I'm such a good investor that I've lost more money than you can dream of making I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better we uh when we sold the HubSpot I think the stock was 367 I think it went up to like 860 and it was it was amazing and then it went down to like 250 and I remember thinking like oh man is this right is this right what do I do and so like that that that definitely impacts me like I definitely want to stop by the way I literally did it with the HubSpot thing I bought HubSpot stock bring it right around when you when you sold and then it went up and it was like oh and everything was going up during that period of time and uh then when the whole Market crashed I was like you know what I don't really want to be in the stock market right now this isn't very fun I don't know like there's all these one again Tesla Q there's all these warning signs about where the economy is going um I think I have a much bigger Edge just like in my own businesses and in private businesses let me just get out of like Public Market stock picking which I'm not like I don't know if I'm very good or very bad at it but I just think generally is a bad strategy to to take to to your investing and um yeah I basically sold almost the exact bottom of the markets and there's a guy somewhere in air traffic control he's like the Bottom's in he's out he's out let's move most people only hit rock bottom once in their life that's like the point of the phrase yeah somebody was asking me this later today they were like they're like oh so what are you doing with your kind of Investments I'm explaining what I do and they're like um so what do you like you know what do you do for like your safety net or whatever like and I was like safe like you're looking at it he's like what do you mean I was like am I still me if I'm still me I'm safe like what do you I could lose all this who cares I can get I can lose all of it I'd make it all back like I have no I am the safety net I you know a bond portfolio is not my safety net my 401k that's locked up till I'm 65. I don't think of that as my safety net I am my safety net and that's uh I think that's an approach honestly uh if you're like High Caliber I see so many people that are high like really high caliber people that play it so safe with their finances I would kind of it was one of these people and you never look bad but I also think you leave so much room where like you didn't need to like have you spent a dollar or like have you spent more than 10 of the money from the hustle sale no way definitely not five percent have you even spent a dollar from that account no no I've never pulled money out of my big account the most expensive thing I bought was a hundred thousand dollar car of which I think you bought three like last month so I'm not that I'm not Persian okay I'm India you've got three all-white g-wagons that's all I'll say so so the thing uh you you know this is one way I think about it like you um worked for 10 years every day to build this company and you sold it you achieved the thing you exactly wanted and not a dollar has moved in like two years or three years or you haven't like moved a dollar from it in a way you bought you you spent 10 years to save up for this power tool and then you just leave it in the case and um and and I I don't know if like I'm not saying that my way is right but I also know that for me uh My Philosophy is money is a tool to be used to enhance your life and if you're not really using it and then you work hard to like go get more money it's like that really all compute for me what is the way you think about that to like make that feel right I think that's an incredibly Fair criticism and my joke is when Warren Buffett talks about the long-term View and I'm like dude you're [ __ ] 95. there is no long-term view like that doesn't exist right um and so it to to criticize myself I am horrible at spending money ramit safety who we have on the Pod he does a really good job of like saying like look you can earn income and you should be good at that you also have to get good at spending I'm quite bad at spending I think it's just rooted in emotional instability and being insane uh I think that these are just like personality defects and oftentimes what makes you good at saving makes you bad at spending and I think that it's uh like a therapist issue that you need to work out and so I think that's an incredibly Fair criticism I think the truth is half is is not quite halfway in the middle I think I should of what you believe in what I believe I think it's more like I should loosen up a bit right but yeah that's it I I think typically what I've seen is people who earn a lump sum like a startup where they are poor and then suddenly they're not poor those people tend to be more like me where they're really tight wide and they're Frugal and they're cheap and that causes a lots of anxiety people who earn a significant amount of cash flow throughout the years and get used to it they tend to be a little bit more offensive and a little bit less conservative but I think it's rooted definitely in like childhood trauma and [ __ ] like that like just like how you're raised you know what I mean just like you're running out of money I'm gonna share without sharing somebody's name um some a friend of ours sent me a presentation that they did um that they made kind of like about their life as part of uh like one of these like peer group things not Hampton but a different one so we don't we don't plug no other names have no other groups on this podcast that's right thank you I appreciate that so so I sent me this thing I thought it was really great basically it's like you know here's my life story and here's what I do with my money and I he had a couple slides I thought were really good so one was uh this person had sold their business for over 100 million dollars so they have like a nine figure exit of their business and the next slide is so it's like here's the picture of me the day we sold for over 100 million dollars um next day it's like I bought this bike um this bike is this two thousand dollar bike it's an awesome bike most expensive purchase uh most expensive item I've owned since it's been like 10 years or something like it's like whoa um until I recently bought a condo finally like last year uh this was the most expensive item I owned love this bike and then I was like okay interesting um and then and then uh there's another slide that I like so so it goes um yeah one slide that said top five Financial mistakes that I've learned to cope with love that title and there's five interesting ones about basically like sold this too early sold this too early was gonna buy this and talk myself out of it because there was a fee associated with it I would have made like 20 million bucks on that you know so so I think that's just a great exercise to go on which is like you could survive a bunch of bad mistakes and if you're gonna play the game any like any good startup investor has an epic anti-portfolio a bunch of businesses that they passed on that they should have invested in and um that's that is part of playing the game you can't play the you know it's like being a basketball player and you know that Michael Jordan commercial where he's like I've missed 3 000 game winning shots or whatever it's like yeah that's what happens when you're you play You're Gonna Miss shots and like you can't yeah everyone has like I literally know 15 people that have the same Uber story um like that was like that was like the famous one for years which is I passed on Uber I passed on Uber everyone said I passed on Uber um like I I know a ton of people have said that I think Gary vaynerchuk like in the beginning of his book he like gives a compliment to Travis kalanick the founder it calls him out as like you know yeah he's like dude I think my wife he's like I think my wife my children and Travis kalanick meaning I was super close with them and I still passed on that and that cost me a hundred million dollars exactly I think that's like a famous story he says so yeah everyone has that story um let me give you two other slides he says then it's there's two slides called my effed up relationship with money I think I can read this let me see so it says um I work hard to make money and I got good at it but then I hoard the money I make I put it in bank accounts I look at it constantly and besides hoarding I know money I know that money is good for one other thing making more money um you know like that's uh that's something I realize and it's like you know I really like put a lot of my own self value on money here's some things that I do that are dumb about money uh like I feel guilty spending on myself um my parents were the same way they they were spent on their kids or spend on like other things that they wouldn't spend on themselves and um that's annoying they did it and now I'm doing it um he said I bought a business that was a cash flow business and I said okay this is my cocaine fund um all the profit from this I must spend on something hedonistic unless I must spend I can't save this money didn't work still saved it um and he goes uh he goes I'm comfortable losing 500k on an investment just like that but if you said five spend 500k to improve your life and I guarantee it will improve your life I can't I can't do it I can't get myself to do it I'm the exact same way I've been looking at it I should be helping I've been looking at your company well I've been looking at your company Shepard I think it's like 3 000 a month for an assistant of which I desperately need but I'm like three thousand dollars a month but well the it's not a fee uh whatever the payment is whatever you pay 30 of their salary as a as a Headhunter Bounty once so that's it so it'll be like three it'll be like three grand for the year is for most people that's like let's say an average but I mean I have to pay the uh the the person's uh the person's salary and I'm like well that's 36 Grand a year but if you do that over five years at the rate that we're growing right now that's ninety thousand dollars like I'm ruining the compounding she might really be valuable and that might be a 15-year relationship now I'm talking about a 500 000 investment but I could also put that in vti and it would compound eight percent and now you've talked yourself out of it when I was buying my wife's wedding ring I was like oh man this is the most expensive thing I've ever bought that's a lot of money but I guess if we're married for 80 years because we might live to be like 110 that means that that's only 800 a year and that's okay do you know what I mean like there's all these weird mental gymnastics that crazy people like me have to do so this guy is he an immigrant is this guy an immigrant you're talking about it's 100 most immigrants that I've been around have or not most but this sounds like a very much an immigrant problem right uh of which I'm the exact opposite of an immigrant but that's why that's why I like those guys I identify with them um you know there's uh we had this this funny experience yesterday where um another friend who also mega mega wealthy um when we met him and we met up with this person in person they were like you know what I really want to like shift into like family mode like I'm ready to like meet somebody have a kid like you know like I want to do that part of life now and we're like that makes total sense um good on you you are you know you did the money thing the business thing you you you scratched that it you proved you could do it now you're in your 30s and you're saying you know what I'm not really I don't really have a partner I don't have kids that seems fun I do see myself as a family guy I want to do that so that was where we left a conversation and now um my business partner Ben Levy he's like the man with like checking in on people checks in on everybody and um so he's always providing me the stream of updates about like what people are up to and it's great and so he's like uh yo that friend he's like he's like doing something new and um and I'm like uh like not just doing one thing news I get these like four projects he's cooking up and I was like oh that's interesting like what happened to the whole like I want to actually focus on like like finding a partner or starting a family like whatever that he's like oh yeah he still wants to do that it's like we start in four companies I mean that doesn't seem like that's gonna be very conducive to like you know put your focus on something right and it's like yeah I agree and I go how come this keeps happening like we have so many smart friends and I said there's a big difference between smart and wise and I think that's what we're seeing is basically with a lot of smart friends that are not that wise about like decision making so they're intelligent for sure um but they make decisions don't really make sense if you zoomed out a little bit how old's this person I don't know like I don't know mid 30s or something like that I think some of that will come with age I think that we're in a weird circle of which many of the listeners listening to this they have a higher income than most people their age and I think that like sometimes maybe your earning power is ahead of your brain power or wisdom power you know what I mean that's what I'm saying like I'm not telling you you you got to go get married and have kids but if you told me you wanted to get married to have kids and then instead you're spending all your time doing these other things that are going to completely make you busy and if I asked you why didn't you why hasn't this happened already it's like oh I was so heads down in my company it's like cool so why are you getting heads down in four companies now that doesn't make sense either and I texted Ben I go man we're you know I'm guilty of this in other areas of my life right because again if you spot it you got it so anytime I noticed something to other people I'm like where in my life do I make the same stupid mistake and I was like oh it'd be like like yesterday I canceled I did something I very rarely almost never this I canceled my workout because I was like had two doctor's appointments and I was like if I if I do this workout in the middle of the day then I'm just not gonna get any work done today cancel my workout I was like but my number one goal right now in life is to get fit I would get more value out of becoming more fit than making another dollar yeah 54 days left I think right uh yeah Monday uh no I'm on 49 uh 49 days left yep um yeah 49 days left to get abs I'm eight weeks away from being that guy um so so but but I guess like the point is that's an area of my life where I make a stupid decision that's an unwise decision to say hey on one day I said this is my main goal and then three days later I'm prioritizing something else above my main goal what that doesn't make any sense and same way this person's doing that with your relationship their main goal is to get married have kids but they prioritize a bunch of other stuff and I was like that's not intelligence that's wisdom like that's basically having good judgment and um I realized that like wisdom or good judgment is the thing that's most short in Supply and the most valuable because it's like a lever you don't have to be that hard working or that smart if you have great judgment if you pick the right things to focus on pick the right people to work with uh pick the right place to live you don't have to be like 9000 IQ you don't have to know everything about everything you don't have to be the hardest worker but if you have poor judgment no amount of hard work or like intelligence really saves you you kind of screw yourself and so it just really emphasized that point to me about like you know smart does not equal wise and the goal is wise not smart I think that's a good one I like that and it's like when you're driving and you say everyone's such a horrible driver it's like dude you too uh it's like there's like some weird emotion and logic that don't make sense there um and then my final accounts of which you can these last two you're gonna have a lot of uh opinions on the last one or the second to last one is my non-liquid stuff of which it's roughly 3.8 million dollars in real estate of which I have a mortgage on my house I think my house was 950 000 that I bought I have a mortgage of like 550 left I own a ranch I own some vacant Lots in Austin and I'm a small owner in some storage deals uh a Brooklyn building and one or two small things um and the other non-liquid stuff is Angel Investing now here's what I do and you tell me if I'm wrong I reduced I value it at so the principal sum that I put in Plus I even put a large discount on that of which it's not that would be around five hundred thousand dollars of startup Investments the way that I see that is I've done roughly 50 I think 40 will probably not work 10 will work of which three might pay back everything plus a little bit and I've reduced the principle by a significant amount just in assuming future net worth and anything above that whatever maybe it will work what do you think about that yeah I think basically startup investing is uh it's so it's so long time Horizon right like you have to assume that these are going to take seven to ten years before they pay out so even if they are worth X they're not really worth X to you yet uh they're these little eggs that are that are you know going to be hatching and so I'm with you basically when I calculate I I never calculate net worth because I think that's uh kind of useless because it takes into account illiquid things that are going to either like go to zero or go way up in value like my own businesses are gonna either go to zero or go way up in value most likely and they're illiquid so what does it matter I can't do anything with them right now anyhow so I I basically only calculate liquid net worth when I calculate it and uh so that doesn't include any of my own businesses and I also don't include any startup Investments because it's not liquid yet that doesn't mean it's not valuable but it's just not liquid yet so I don't I don't even apply the discount because it doesn't matter it's not in my calculation and that's my last category which is private companies so those include like any course I do this podcast speaking fees which is like called par media I assume that has zero Equity value I live off that income and then the next big company is Hampton as of today I assume that is worth zero I've taken zero salary from it I will likely take a dividend at the end of the year but until that business hits like 40 or 50 million in Revenue in my head I assume it's worth zero and I do not include um I do not include any of the private businesses that I operate or own as part of my net worth so we are totally aligned on that part like by e-commerce I don't I don't include it in the calculation even though that business is doing great you you include that as zero still yeah well I just I don't Market at zero I just I'm not calculating total net worth I'm only calculating liquid um so if I try to calculate net worth yeah I didn't include it I'd put some conservative number there but I don't even really bother because what's the point in fact I think the whole network thing is like um not a great thing to up like I kind of in search of a better metric well there's earning so income do you measure income but then income is like only things that are you know it's gonna buy us way too hard to things that are only you know generating cash flow today um so it's not going to count really any like no I mean do you measure your income on a monthly basis I measure my every month I like do like a report where I look at like all right what was my income this month and where did it come from yeah not religiously but it's it's mostly like steady I can I kind of know the one or two things that are variable I'm like oh that's what that was at this month plus you know it's it's like in the same range roughly um so yeah I know I know what it's coming in every month I know roughly what's coming out every month I don't really keep track of spending too much um I I'll kind of calculate spending every couple months just to be like am I did I add anything significant here um what's your spend right now I think I spend maybe 25 or 30 000 a month yeah I think I'm at 30 30k a month of burn life life expenses and and I feel that that's a lot that sounds like a lot to me that sounds insane to me we have a friend who told us that they are currently spending 300 000 a month and I was like gasping I was like I can't comprehend that and then they listed it all out and I was like yeah that definitely adds up but that's just like you do need the jet I mean what are you gonna do without it it was insane to me I've got another friend that spends eighty thousand and uh I'm like gasping right but I guess like everything changed when you get when you get to different levels um uh but so anyway that's kind of like my portfolio I want to say that hey this isn't advice but also um I basically do the most simple conservative stuff I use tiller have you heard of tiller I think the website is tillerhq.com it's like a plug-in and I track this in Google Sheets what do you do you track anything like your accounts I don't understand these apps because I'm like I'm not connecting my [ __ ] to these random startup apps like you know I don't wanna I don't want to put all my stuff into these apps so I because I'm not that concerned with it in general um you know the fewer things that you're concerned about the better in general yes surely like occasional checks and balances so every three months I sit down and by hand I write down I write out where I'm at with liquid stuff where I'm at income wise and where I'm at monthly burn wise every three months I do that but there's like a there's like a logistical problem let's say your wife has a 401k from her job from like eight years ago yeah and you have one from each job that you've had and you haven't combined them that's like six accounts potentially or five accounts plus a checking plus a savings plus uh like let's say that you each have like a Robinhood account or an e-trade account plus uh her previous before you were married maybe checking your savings I mean like it kind of can accumulate whether you have money or not that you have eight or ten accounts and like what happens if you die and she doesn't know about all of them or vice versa do you know what I mean yeah we do have that problem which is if I die I don't think she's gonna be able to like know or find or access a bunch of stuff especially the crypto stuff how's it going to get to that I've told her three times and I'm like you're not really paying attention enough to remember this like nine years from now if something happens it's like I don't know what's gonna happen with that I I that I am a little bit concerned about um however the rest of the stuff again I just do it by hand and I make a day out of it I treat it like a spa day it's like right I think you talked about this concept of worry time you're like I just scheduled some worry time in the future that's what I do with this I don't call it worry time because I'm not trying to feel worried during it but same thing I just scheduled a little a day every three months I'm like oh today's the day it's basically like let's have a little Financial picnic all right let me open up some of these baskets and see what's inside and um and let me take stock of what's going on and I think once a quarter for me is the right amount of energy I'm trying to spend on on this and I just don't really want to think about it otherwise do you know anyone who's crazier than you I mean I view you as being quite crazy I've got one friend that uh made like 150 million dollars and they invested like the majority of it in only two things their next company and a house and they're like I basically don't own any like bonds equities I've got very little savings so I consider that person being crazier than you right or a similar amount of crazy but potentially at a larger scale are all of your circle of friends like you or do many of them say the same thing like I'm saying which is like man you're not conservative enough would you say crazy do you s like is this kind of like oh this bum on the streets a little crazier is it like wow that she's hot but she's crazy like which one am I my hot girl crazy or am I bum crazy more like bet it all in on black uh like like tuition money or this game of roulette right um I don't view myself as that crazy I think that uh I think I have a pretty healthy view on money I'll explain it to you in a few sentences number one money is a tool to enable a better lifestyle that's what it's for that's how I use it so that's the first thing that includes spending on lifestyle but it also includes learning things by Angel Investments I don't view as the absolute Optimum way for me personally to make money but I love them because I learned so much about where the world is going from startups and I like being around entrepreneurs that's those are my people so I'm using money as my tool to like make my life more like how I want um so I use money as a tool that's the first thing money is a tool to enable a better lifestyle I think I abide by that law the second thing is um money's no fun when you're stressed about it so there's basically like a strategy that just says I don't need to um I don't need to be stressed about this so what is my amount of money that I know is my like safety net so like you know basically can I have two to three years of expenses put away that's just in like it could be in nothing it could just be literally sitting in a bank account doing absolutely nothing but it's not doing nothing it's enabling me to be free with the rest of the money because I know that if I lost everything if somehow everything went to zero I would still have three years of Runway and again I'm me I am my own station if you give me three years of Runway I'll have it all back and more by then uh like you know if I needed to uh to make money a focus and so I do that so to me I'm like if I have three years of life expenses um put away what what am I worried about right so I do that um the third thing is I know if I'm in which gear am I in wealth creation mode or wealth preservation mode so well I view myself still as in wealth creation mode you know when I sold my company it wasn't for as much money as you sold your company for I think if I had sold my my company for as much as you did I might do things slightly differently but I still view like most of my investments as like more on the aggressive side more concentrated bets in things that I believe in and I know I'm gonna make mistakes I'm gonna have some things that go to zero I'm gonna sell some things at the wrong time I would say the only leak in my game is really just that I sell things at all I really just shouldn't sell like the the only investment mistake I've made is just selling okay but are you actually gonna you've just acknowledged and we'll go well we can make fun of me after this but you've acknowledged that so are you making that yes exactly so I made that but okay so you're not gonna sell ever or often uh I'm buying things that I basically have to uh I basically default to say this is only you have to break glass if you're going to sell this so basically like you have to really have a reason like either you need the money and you gotta sell the thing or something in the world has changed that caused you to like re-underwrite this now I would argue I kind of did that with this um the last time that I sold when basically like uh the postcovid kind of like what's going money printing is going on what's going on in the economy everything all the stocks crash I thought okay we've had a 13-year bull market um we're probably not just gonna have six months of bad times and then back to the good times again like I still kind of believe that that's true um but I should say I wasn't in a place to re-underwrite that that those Investments because I was now thinking about macro stuff where like if I'm sending 30 of my time on Wikipedia that means I'm not informed enough to be making an intelligent decision about this uh you know I'm like I'm learning about it but where do you get the information from do you get it from current people so for example I like to I prefer to get information I try to read books that are at least 30 or 40 years old and to figure out like um I try to learn about stuff what's it called like the Lindy effect where it's like I try to learn about stuff that as is has been repeated many many many times and isn't exactly new for and and the counter example that is when biology said all the crazy stuff about um what was his argument that bitcoin's going to a million because for this reason that [ __ ] scares me and I'm like I don't understand that that's so new and it legitimately scares me that's what I do I don't try to do that because um what I find happens with that is I already have an opinion in my head and then I just go find evidence of it right I already want to hold the stock forever so then I go find the Lindy effect that says Ah lindifex says that this thing's gonna stay valuable because it's been valuable and I'll like cling to that evidence but it's really just reinforcing some bias I already had in my head so instead what I do and you can't learn everything right like you can't just say I'm gonna go learn the world of like Finance like this is too broad it's impossible to do so here's what I do I go through and I say what are people that I consider to be smart saying and thinking right now and I go try to line up contenders it's like here's Theory a about where the world is going right now about what here's thesis a here's thesis B here's thesis C and then I basically say inherently does one of them just intuitively make more sense to me does it does it resonate in my gut that one of these just feels more true than the others okay that's the first test second test what evidence do they have that backs up their belief let me now stack the evidence okay now which one appears to be the strongest thesis so instead of going and trying to learn about the topic I take people who already like have strong opinions about this topic and I go try to find what is the spectrum of opinions about this so on one end you have biology who's like do you actually talk to them or just consume not always sometimes but like not always like you know like biology for example he's just very public about his thesis so you don't need to like talk to him right it's like he's publishing every day what he believes to be true he's like I moved out of America I got out of the dollar and here's the sources I'm citing that I'm tracking that basically says that the banking system is insolvent um that the you know the money printing is you know is out of control inflation is higher than they're admitting and that this is what what is the result of this it's X right then you have Ray dalio that says look I've been studying Empires and all Empires come to an end here's the cycles that they go through and I think that America's at the tail end of the cycle so you go read that book you go watch his talks you're like all right that's one another thesis you have some people who say um no you know what this is gonna bounce back because even with all the problems America has the dollar is still the best thing we got out there um and that when all the all the countries in the world get weaker they'll actually flee to the whatever this relatively strongest currency is and maybe that's the dollar and the dollar is going to drink the whole milkshake basically it's like all right cool um that I I didn't make this some something I forgot it's called like the the straw that drinks the shake or some [ __ ] like that people don't talk about it From There Will Be Blood he goes if I had a long shrug all the way over there I drink your milkshake so I drink it up so you basically line up a bunch of arguments and then you kind of like you litigate them like a lawyer you're like what evidence do you have that supports this um what examples do you have and then you basically say look okay even if I don't know what's totally true can I hedge so it's like you know what I don't think this guy's right but he might be and if he is what hedge would I wish I had in place just in case and like you know this is the most likely thing to be true so then let me like allocate things that way so that's generally how I try to approach things I do like that I would say however I know my my Achilles heel in this is that I do get drawn to the to a bit of the sexy Underdog opinion the conspiracy opinion the um to kind of like this is the country the most contrarian opinion appeals to be inside because I'm like oh [ __ ] there could be a mystery that we're on to that nobody else really fully like people don't believe it that makes me want to believe it more and I think that's led me to make too drastic of a decision in the past of like selling all of my Tesla or selling you know 70 of my stocks or whatever like you know it doesn't have to be that dramatic like I should just put into place smaller hedges in those and track them and be like cool if that's true then six months from now I might be seeing more of this so let me check in at that time and see if the signals have grown stronger or or faded right now you're in a little bit in advice giving mode because I'm asking you questions but to swap it who do you look up to where you're like I need to be more like them when it comes to personal finance I wouldn't say there's somebody on the personal finance like managing your own money but there are a lot of people that I look up to or or find I talk to to get ideas on what game are they playing to generate more money so I don't I don't really seek or I'm not that interested frankly and like well who are those people you obviously like Andrew our friend Andrew Wilkinson tiny tiny.com he took the company public so you can actually go and see the numbers so you like Andrew yeah I like Andrew like Xavier uh I like Xavier yes um side bulky I think had really I I had really interesting things to say about what he does like I'll give you just a funny example so Syed by the way he owns this thing called WP why it's called awesome Corp he started as a Blog called wpbeginner which was a Blog on how to use WordPress now he owns tons of Wordpress plugins I don't know how big it is but I bet it's worth half a billion dollars of which I bet he owns most of it and it probably does many many tens of millions in revenue and probably tens of millions in profit right yes and uh yes as in directional yes I don't know the exact numbers but um he basically has a business that's amazing that's a monopoly prints cash and then he does interesting things with his cache like he owns like I don't know 40 gas stations or some [ __ ] like that it's like why do you own gas stations dude is that a good idea bad idea does that take up a bunch of time or not he's like no these are triple net leases I just own the buildings that other people operate in and they pay for all the maintenance I was like oh okay interesting um so I did a call with him once and he's like uh he's like yeah my he said my mentor taught me one thing which was uh uh okay you wanna you don't spend it's kind of like I don't know the math I'm gonna say a math term even though I don't know math he's like you don't spend like the first derivative money he's like basically what most people do is that cash comes in from the business that they spend that money on life expenses no no you only spend the second derivative it's like cash let's say a million dollars comes in from your business you don't get to spend that million is not spendable the million has to be invested into something and that the income from that investment that's what you get to spend you do that you'll never go broke and um and I was like oh that's interesting he's like yeah so like I wanted to have a kid before we had a kid I bought a gas station gas station makes six grand a month that pays for this kid [Laughter] works I was like interesting again thesis line it up say does that does that seem like a way of life I'd like to do maybe maybe not but like I want I find it interesting because he says different things than most people he does different things than most people and how he runs his life and how he runs his businesses and what he does with the money um you know he was the one who was like you know what I love buying businesses like but there's another strategy I do where I buy these like 30 to 40 minority stakes and businesses that I can help in these two specific ways and they're they're gonna keep running it so they get a little liquidity they get to retain control and I'm gonna help them break through the plateau to get to the next level he's like I love doing that I look for those deals and so when I invested in Shepard it was exactly that was I exactly that mindset I was like what's a great business that I already believe in and I'm a customer a customer of that I can buy a minority stake let them keep running it but then help them get to the next level by doing these two things and um has your contribution to that already do you think that that your contribution has paid dividends in their business yet yeah of course yeah we're last two months have been the highest two months of the business in the history of the business so it's great um and for me that's great too right like I've already I've already paid back I don't know three three percent of my money or something like that on on that investment so like you know wow that thing's gonna you know in terms of oh could I put my money in the stock market try to get eight percent or this thing's clearly this thing's gonna do 200 a year basically um I don't know unless something bad happens so that's like you know a great use of okay yes I maybe I sold my whatever Amazon stock or whatever stock HubSpot stock whatever it is and I missed the kind of like a little bit of the bounce back but I put that money to work in a place where I felt like I had a little more control and and could see a path to a much greater return um with with more risk of course this episode is like the personal finance episode I'm very curious to see if you listeners actually enjoy this stuff next time we got to get back to like the business building stuff because I think that that is interesting to more people and it's also interesting to me and you but I'm very curious to see if this is useful for people I like it I think this is a good one what do you want to wrap here yeah let's wrap it up all right we have a bunch of stuff next week but that's the pod [Music] thank you

Twitter shoots itself in the foot a lot so Elon does a lot of dumb pisses a lot of people off he's basically pushing to like put a paywall where like you have to pay eight dollars a month in order to like have your be seen in the in the feed so that's introducing friction he added the Tweet limit not long ago which introduces friction because oh you know she's insane no more tweets for you cut off like the ability to post tweets and have them in bed in other places because he was like oh we're getting scraped too much so you basically put a login wall in front of the content like he's adding friction everywhere so this is not threads killing you this is you killing you

will bleep out every mention because this is the zero Cloud podcast zero clout chasing podcast and uh we have a no Cloud policy and we did not we did not want to do that wait but do we have to use this face on a thumbnail no we're gonna blur it out I think we have to put like his face and then Reed's face next to it and blur out Reed's face and the thumbnails like The Man Behind the Scenes or something ridiculous [Music] laughs where we got to keep this in though we're live now I would read I went and listened to a bunch of interviews I did the um I forget the guy's name I like him a lot the financial YouTuber in Vegas um and then I watched Grand Stefan yeah Graham Stefan and then I watched uh Samir and Colin and then a few others that you did including your channel and I was like Sean what if we just don't say the word the whole time because he's great but I know I I I've learned I've learned a bit about it which you know let's just not mention it once it's a bad business decision not gonna get the views you're not gonna get the clicks you're not gonna get all that stuff but I don't really care uh in fact actually it's a great business decision to not be uh chasing the algorithm so I say we just talk about whatever was actually whatever's actually interesting I think it might be no bleep so um yeah I think we might be able to go the whole episode without it let's try it's only up to you guys the con the colon and Samira video is like took off I I think we we expected it to do well I don't think I expected it to get whatever it's on 4.7 million views but yeah you're like who's counting as accurate as of today but who's counting is it accurate yeah that's that's pretty much the exact number how do you how do you describe yourself you're the founder of night media but night media has a studio division you have Knight capital I believe you have I mean night media in itself it's fairly simple it's just like an Endeavor or one of these other agencies but it's a different genre but how do you how do you kind of like describe what you do yeah we've we've started to call ourselves a Creator holding company so we at the center of the business we represent talent and that's been consistent since I started the business in 2015 but we built out these other verticals now which you mentioned we have a venture studio uh which has created things like feastables we have a studio which is like making shows on streaming services we have a venture capital fund which is called night Ventures it's a 20 million dollar fund and then we announced night Capital which is a 100 million dollar growth fecal um so for us it's like a platformized Creator holding company and yeah it's I think early on it was much easier to just say I'm a talent manager now it's it's a little more confusing when I'm like you know I can be entrepreneurial I can be an investor I'm also a talent manager so I kind of play in a lot of different spaces I think it's great because talent manager seems to be a horrible business from what I can tell I I've met a few Talent managers and basically you you're either um Talent poor in which case your business sucks or you get Talent rich but then your business always hanging on a thread of this one whale or two whale relationship and even then um the value cat you might create a lot of value but the value captures is fairly small um compared to what you're doing now where you got this investing vehicle and you got it you got all these other components you said Studio making shows for streaming what have you guys made have you guys made anything that's come out we did a lot of stuff early on with YouTube originals and that was kind of the emphasis of like why we wanted to get into it because Netflix and HBO and Hulu and all these places starting ask starting to ask us to make shows with them and so you know creator games and some of the other things that we did with YouTube Originals led us into what we're developing now which I don't know if I can technically say anything about what's coming out um I'll just say there's like there's cameras around constantly uh as well but yeah we we have a few things like within scripted one within non-scripted uh and working on a few like different uh docu uh memory type things right now so we'll we'll have like a I think a pretty decent slate by next year we'll see how the the writer strike and everything plays itself out I think that one's been a little interesting for us to get used to but yeah we'll we'll have a bunch of different things like coming out in what is it summer of 2023 so sometime in early 2024. is the agency business Sean was he was joking but he's being serious in that it's a bad business is that actually a bad business because when I would like I mean I don't I'm totally outside of Hollywood when I see like Ari Emmanuel I'm like it looks like your cat his personal cash flow was pretty decent on the rise versus a lot of like startups you know you're you're kind of in poverty until you have a some type of a liquid event it seems like you guys have some type of pool let's explain the structure right so so what is the what is the structure of a talent talent agency so uh first you basically you you recruit Talent you say okay you're uh I'm gonna help you with your business side of your operations or get you brand deals or get you things that you that you want now in the world of YouTube are those exclusive or non-exclusive like for example for an NBA player their manager their agent is their exclusive representative or they could fire them but like no you can't have multiple people bringing them deals it all has to go through that person they get a cut of everything so is it usually exclusive or non-exclusive when it comes to YouTube I think it depends on the type of management company we've always kind of sat on the fence of the exclusive and I think the interesting thing about talent management businesses is they're they generate a lot of cash and so most of the the management companies that you look at that have actually started to create things like um when you look at just the big let's just look at the big Hollywood agencies like three Arts um entertainment 360 brillstein the ones that have built some of the and launched some of the biggest shows like it's always sunny and friends and Seinfeld and some of these things that they have backend on that they will just have back end and perpetuity on which those things are ending but those businesses generate a lot of cash I think the thing that they've struggled with is like how do you build something much bigger than just this cash generating management company and so when I started night the management company was really like the wedge of access into everything else and that and that's really how I looked it's like if you could represent the biggest start with digital creators because me like starting this business by myself outside of the Hollywood System was very hard to say I'm gonna go sign an actor actress musician because that is very much dominated by the Hollywood sphere um and so I I knew that it would be much easier for me to build a wedge in digital and go represent you know I started with dude perfect in 2013 but go represent digital creators build that wedge and then use that as the access point to either continue building a bigger management company you know the verticals or to go build you know something with interventure Studio have a venture capital firm like the acts the the management company gives you access to everything else and that's how I saw this in 2015 and I think that the managers that realized that and there's some some really like good ones that have realized that map Carter I think realized that pretty early on is like the management business is kind of the means to the end to build uninterrupted and some of the other things that he's doing with LeBron I think scooters probably the best example of like what Ithaca became off the management company and so that that's really how we've thought about it is like you know management is the core of our business but it's really the like allows us to to have a wedge that gets us into everything else so that kind of proves the point right like if a business has to be a means to an end it's probably in itself not the best business to stay at um you mentioned a couple of those those sound like pretty cool businesses so Maverick Carter is LeBron's long time friend I think High School I think he's is he one of the part of the high school crew for LeBron or did he come a little later I think one of them came later I I think he was I I don't know the full story I think um Rich Paul was was came uh came later after high school I think Matt was actually a high school friend and became his manager and they went on to you know now have a production company and a few other things it seems like one of the few times that would work out well by the way like your high school buddy like taking the rain so good good for them and um and so they have a they have a a company that does you know basically production and maybe investing because I think they own a bunch of a bunch of like pizza chains and other things like that so they do investing they do production you mentioned Scooter Braun and his business and so what what what is his business is that like that sounds like that might be a fantastic business what is it well it's it started off I mean if everyone knows the story probably that he met Justin or or found Justin on YouTube when he was really young reached out you know the rest is kind of history there but he he ended up building a music management company that was really like I think the the Cash Cow of that business was more touring right with Ariana Grande Justin Bieber some of the other people and then he sold it to Hive about I want to say a year ago or 18 months ago and they started um either buying other management companies they're buying music catalogs they're doing a lot of different things right now um and he had he he did build quite a few things with some of the talent I know Justin and him built I can't remember what the clothing business is and there are some other like auxiliary businesses that came out of Ithaca and they also did a lot of investing a lot of venture investing uh and so I so he sold it for a billion dollars yeah he's he sold his uh Media Company Ithaca Holdings um to to hide for one billion and I think that's because it had those kind of like like you said like Royal royalties on on the on the music itself not just like the touring which might you know stop tomorrow and who knows what happens in the YouTube world there's no like royalties structure correct like if you're a talent manager for twitch creators or for YouTubers you get a cut of these brand deals 10 15 whatever it is but there's no like royalties you have to like build other IP to get the royalties right yeah when there's there's also no back-end deals like I said earlier where you know brillstein or some management company in Hollywood maybe helped launch it's always sunny and now they have these like residual um checks coming in every single month or every single year that also doesn't exist in the digital space and so we had to figure out like what that packaging business was for us and we ultimately landed on we think it's business building like we think some of the biggest outcomes for celebrities over the last decade have been through products right Beats by Dre probably the best example of something I mean like uh Vitamin Water was another one where it's like that um athletes and different people had equity in those businesses so we think our packaging business is essentially this business building uh which we call night Labs uh which a lot of different things have come out of now but yeah the the management company has then allowed us to build these businesses with creators where we take equity and we think think that like that business is much more interesting long term than just continuing to stack a management business which some of these companies do very well and you know they're 30 40 50 million ebitda businesses a year um I think they're now trying to figure out like what what do we either build on top of this big cash generating business or do we just keep doing it because the partners every single year are making three four five million dollars a year do you um of your of this the night night media night Studios of your holy own thing how many staff do you have at the moment I believe we're just over 60. so 63 full-time uh within the night ecosystem right now and and some of the teams are relatively lean I would say our Ventures team is is lean it's like three people our studio team is still and that's like our Venture studio is relatively lean with about six uh and the majority of the company is Talent managers and then individual like pod systems where a talent manager will have a junior manager multiple coordinators maybe an assistant under that pod and then that pod will represent anywhere between I would say five to seven creators on average and are you managing someone as well as running the 60 operation uh I just managed uh that happened about two years two to three years ago where I was like this is taking up way too much of my time and also it's like it's also the best use of my time and this was really like when we had started feastables was an idea we were you know I was you know helping him produce creator games there's just a lot going on while he was also growing doing multi-language all these other things um and so that's when I like fully just like kind of rededicated my time to everything that was going on on his end so you're able to get you know your cut from managing him as well as from owning the 60 person company um yeah so so in in that regard it seems like things are pretty good so yeah things that I think are always a little hectic and you know I'm I'm most of my focus right now is on feastables I think you guys have United I'm sure you've seen the chocolate bars that to us is like and I are probably focusing the majority of our energy on that business right now just because it's growing so quickly and you know we just launched in the UK we have other Global launches that we want to do this year and it's just building into 2024 and so I I knew this would eventually happen where you represent a Creator and then the business that you're starting becomes the big opportunity that you really want to Chase and we think festivals is really turning into that and so I've directed A lot of my energy toward that business uh and it's like slowly slowly consuming my life at the moment before you started night media what uh what interested you what what were you going to start instead of that well I grew up watching Jerry Maguire probably like everyone else and so I wanted to be a sports agent like I wanted to represent Rod Tidwell like I wanted to be that like bigger than life you know agent representing an NFL football player and so that's I what I wanted to do and I I knew that like because I played football in college and freshman year of college I realized that guys are built different um I one couldn't run a 4-3 I wasn't 225 pound wide receiver that was five or six five and so I knew like playing in the NFL was going to be very very difficult just seeing the the level of high school to division one football um that I was at and so you know I started seeing that a lot of the players that I was playing with were going to the NFL some of them were getting drafted some of them were going to have like NFL careers that lasted 10 years and so I positioned myself to to be a representative for those players and that's really what I wanted to do and then stumbled upon YouTube in 2013 and kind of just became obsessed with it and in college I didn't watch YouTube like I was so focused on football didn't really watch anything on the internet um and that changed the trajectory of my whole career I saw this uh t-shirt on Instagram yesterday it said creatives are the new athletes and somebody was wearing that and uh I thought to myself that's kind of a lame t-shirt but I see where they're coming from uh you know I I get what they're saying you know the I just I don't know if you've seen Sam these uh these deals that creators are from twitch are signing with Kik I heard you talk about it what is it it's just a twitch alternative so Kik is basically a twitch alternative but the kind of the interesting part is it started by this gambling company steak so we've talked about steak before remember um it's this company that just absolutely prints cash and one of the main ways the main way that steak was growing or one of the best growth mechanisms was they would pay streamers or give streamers money to gamble on stake live on stream and so people got to see didn't they give uh Drake like a jet yeah the grave Drake like 20 million dollars and whatever but the the issue was you couldn't do it in America right so a lot of the streamers and and they would have to go to Mexico or Canada and it's still very much like that you can't do it in America yeah you gotta get on a boat go to international waters and start your stream like basically yeah and a lot of the guys were doing this in Mexico and so now kick basically came in they started kick as like a distribution like taco funnel on top of this gambling business which who knows if it's going to be legal in the U.S in two to three years they actually have steak.us that you can play in America it's just a lot of the games that you have on state.com are not there but yeah a lot of controversy on uh on this topic because twitch banned it and that's why kickstarted is because twitch banned all gambling on their website it's like there's these stories sometimes in business where it's like um like I have a buddy who's like this uh the guys who bought milk Road uh they own uh one of them started this thing called JM uh JM Bullion which is like a gold it's the biggest website for buying and selling gold online and I was like how'd you do it what's the origin story and he's telling me the origin story and really when he started he was just trying to be a lead gen for um like somebody else would fulfill the orders he didn't have any gold inventory he wasn't shipping anything he was like dude I'm an affiliate marketer I just I get the lead from Google somebody places the order I go tell the the company who actually does this thing to go sell it to go send it to him and what happened was that they were they were kind of yanking them around changing the rates and eventually they just cut them off and he's like oh my God they just killed my business like they don't want my customers like what do I do he's like well either I take this zero or I create the whole like distribution I create the whole supply chain myself I basically go I get the physical inventory I get the warehouses and we start shipping this ourselves if that's what they did they ended up becoming bigger than the other company and I think they bought them along the way they bought that other company that had rejected them and like went on to become the number one site for this and it's kind of the same um the same thing that you're talking about here with like cake was using twitch as like a distribution platform and then when it didn't work they're like all right we'll have to make our own twitch which is kind of like a huge Endeavor but what they're doing is they're giving streamers these contracts that um I kick the tires on this to figure out if it was real because they gave xqc who's one of the top uh twitch streamers like a reported two-year 100 million dollar contract what so that means that this guy's making more than LeBron James playing for the Lakers this year like per year that would be the the deal and same thing and and crazier than that is that he doesn't have to he doesn't have to stop streaming on Twitch he could still stream on Twitch right and so when you first hear this this sounds crazy it's like you signed a non-exclusive 100 million dollar deal for some kid in his bedroom playing video games that sounds insane and then they did that with a bunch of other streamers so a bunch of other streamers are also making you know 10 million 20 million 30 million dollars a year to stream on Kik right now and the big question is will this strategy work uh you know we'll kick become a thing will it just die will this give steak a bunch of customers or is this is the website because kik.com according to similar web has like 150 million monthly uniques already yeah so this has been going for how long like six to eight months maybe yeah like within this year basically they've been they've been doing this and how do they get that much traffic that fast I mean that's one of the faster growing websites out there yeah so so what happened here was um two two Twist streamers that when they banned gambling couldn't stream on Twitch anymore because their brands were essentially built around state which one was train wrecks who had a really loyal following on Twitch and then they also then signed eight in second and so train wrecks and Aiden started streaming on Kik which drove a lot of people over to that website and then the xqc uh the mid like everyone else that they started signing was just driving more and more traffic and it started to just become a thing of like anti-twitch go to kick though also the one thing to point out is AD revenue on Twitch uh if you're if you're a partner on Twitch used to be 70 30. they brought it down to 50 50 which sparked outrage on the internet and then tick came out and said we're going to do 90 10 for everyone it doesn't matter if you're a partner or not we're going to lose an incredible amount of money on the content business and just make sure that state.com remains like the cash cow and so that's like the the big thing that they have against twitch is like they don't really care if they have a profitable streaming business or not but do they how'd they find it how'd they finance this entire thing I thought Sean that we had talked about these guys was it wasn't wasn't the founder of steak is it like a 28 or back then we're I think we were talking about a year ago it was like a 26 year old guy who bought like a 50 million dollar mansion in Australia is it still like a bunch of young guys doing this without financing I mean not without financing the financing is Stakes I mean outside finance and 800 it had like an 800 million dollar dividend last year or something like that business is just Ultra Ultra profitable and so their competitive Advantage is basically that they they're like reset their business model is not ads on Kik or subscription cut it's can we funnel these users to come gamble on our in our casino and we have a casino twitch doesn't have a casino that's the bet that they're making the other thing that I because I tweeted this out I was like I said this thing is fishy I said they're paying XTC 100 million dollars for two years of non-exclusive streaming are they a lying B is this like incentive based or some like tiered like you know some some like stock deal they're inflating the value of the stock or something like that to make the number set the headline number sound really big are they just laundering money is that what this is like what is going on here and basically it was here's the here's what the the answer was basically it's a combination of cash and Equity so their Equity part might go to zero so that that part of the deal might go to zero um or it has incentives where it's like it's based on the number of customers you bring over um and the second part is that the non-inclusive part is basically so that he could just like funnel traffic from twitch to Kik so if we just turned off like uh this is like a big deal like when Microsoft poached ninja from twitch he had to stop streaming on Twitch that day and like go stream on this other platform and so most people on Twitter just like kind of like outside out of mind yeah some people followed him over there to check it out but like ultimately their habit was still built on Twitch what these guys are doing is different he streams on Twitch and he says all right I'm gonna finish my stream or I'm gonna like play the big game over on Kik and then he just like it's like a call to action it just funnels a bunch of traffic over over and over when I was at twitch we did the same thing when we were losing foothold in one market in Brazil we acquired this huge YouTube streamer and I was like um and they were and it was an exclusive deal but he started streaming on YouTube while he was streaming on Twitch and I was like and at first people in the company were like yo what the hell man you just spent all this money millions of dollars like signing the streamer and he's still streaming on YouTube over there for free like what's the deal and I was like actually wait this is probably excellent because all we have to do is just get him to like block part of the screen or like end his like do a cliffhanger and be like I'm finishing this over at twitch and he'll just keep bringing traffic over and that's what he did we just basically let him violate his deal because we realized actually he was smarter than us that was a better funnel for us than than an exclusive deal would have been that's insane read what these I imagine you've talked to these you know these State guys well is this like a Sam bakeman free type of company where they're or an FTX company where there's like a bunch of crazy young kids or is this like a dialed in thing what are these guys like I don't know them well enough honestly to know if it's like gonna become a problem I would say that from my conversations with them they seem like they have this thing under control generating a lot of cash FTX thing I company wasn't generating any cash when Bitcoin went down it was like just completely fell apart but I don't mean is it a scam but I mean like young people just being wild uh you know like imagine a 27 year old making 800 million dividend uh just like a a wild child type of setup I haven't seen that from them but it seems like they're a little bit more laid back uh in Australia don't really communicate with a lot of people so I I haven't seen that behavior um I mean that could change I'm just I and I know I know way too much about the deal structures and everything else uh and how this stuff works but I I would I'm pretty confident in kick over at least in the next couple of years we'll see where this goes if they continue to want to do that business I I would imagine steak is going to just continue to get so big that maybe kick eventually becomes a distraction I don't know um but I I would say they'll double down on stake.us over the next like 18 months as like States open up and allow them to start doing this that's insane there was also a secondary business called rubat as well uh that was essentially the thestate.com competitor I'm not 100 sure what happened to rubat uh but it's still around and so there is other businesses like steak steak just completely won because they were able to sign the biggest creators like train they signed Drake which you guys said uh it's at the moment it's a runaway train they're kind of taking all the market share in one of your other podcasts you'd mentioned how um uh you're like well a lot of creators they think well I have an audience I'm going to launch this product and you're like well that can work for a couple months but if you do a good job this turns into a proper company and the real challenge uh you're saying the real challenge that I'm in is finding amazing Executives to actually run the companies and build these into real companies you said for feasibles I think you said you had the president of RX bar to come and be the CEO uh for uh the burger business or the restaurant business you partnered with someone and you also sounds like had a president or a CEO of that company what type of deals are you striking with some of these CEOs to make it worth their while uh to to to do this yeah thankfully a lot of them realize the opportunity when they come into these businesses they know that there's an unfair advantage in go to market because the creator has hopefully built this massive platform already that gives them instant distribution and just consumers and so a lot of the people that we interview for CEOs are actually incredibly excited about the opportunity and are willing to leave their big job at PepsiCo or wherever that is and so how the deals are really structured is very similar to any other business you you have like the a cash basis that you're paying them and then you also negotiate some piece of equity uh over of like a four-yearvesting schedule and so we've had a lot of success doing that but for the most part we usually don't have to explain the competitive advantage to the business like when we start meeting these individuals they already know they've seen it they saw it with prime they're seeing the feasibles they've seen it with happy Dad a lot of the individuals that were interviewing already know uh and so it makes it a little bit easier for us to get them to leave that specific job but it's it's structured very similar to like what a a CEO would potentially make if they came in and ramp startup and are you funding the company with a bit we fund up to a certain amount what's that amount usually it honestly depends on the business I would say it falls anywhere between the 250 250 on the low end a million on the high end so festivals you fun that that start with just a million bucks you think yeah the the the big issue with feastables was and this is the issue we're now having with some of our consumer products is retailers instead of so if you if you started a chips business or whatever and you didn't have a Creator attached to it or anyone attached to it they give you gave you an unfair advantage on go to market you would go to a retailer and they would say we want to test you in a hundred stores or we want to test you in 200 stores and from a cost per perspective to fund the PO wouldn't be that like it wouldn't put that much strain on the business the issue that we had with feastables was Walmart was willing to put us in all 2 650 store or 4650 Stores um it right when we launched and so that's becoming the issue with some of these businesses is that how do you fund the PO of six seven eight million dollars right out of the gate to meet that retail demand and so that's the one that we've we've had to either raise Capital uh go bag a bank to give us the money as like uh Pia as like a PO loan and so that that's kind of the issue that we've run into and even with feasible is like we raised a small amount of capital and it was really just to fund the 4 million chocolate bars that we ended up selling in season one that sold out in I think it was 45 days that was the biggest cash constraint to the business let's talk a little bit about prime so Prime um seems to be just taken over um I it really really impressive I don't know um how much we've talked about it on here before but can you just explain what's going on with Prime in a way that would for somebody who's kind of out of the loop or maybe you know vaguely heard of it but doesn't really truly appreciate like the the extent it's it's what it's doing yeah so if you don't know what prime is prime is a hydration drink that was started by uh Logan Paul who many people are probably familiar with and then KSI who's based out of the UK but I would say the most popular Creator to ever come out of that region and so you know they very notably like boxed against each other multiple times they were enemies and the story was that I'm coming together to start this business and the the company that they partnered with actually made an energy drink called Aulani new that's actually uh and you see it next to Prime I think in every Grocery Store retail chain I go into it's like Prime City or Lonnie news sits right next to it and so the founders of Alani knew basically created this drink that they did called Prime and Logan Paul and KSI came in really is just the marketing engine they don't do anything operationally for the business they really just Market it and it it became and look like a clout piece to hold a bottle of prime like now these 10 12 13 year old kids have to have it they have to drink it and we've seen some of the I mean I saw an article about uh people saying the FDA needs to go regulate this business because it has too much caffeine in the energy drink and so now now there's just a lot of stuff going on about the company but it's grown an incredible amount I think I I can't remember what Logan said on one of his podcasts but I think they did 45 million dollars in Revenue in January of this year and that was that was the last thing that I'd seen them say publicly about the business I think he said if I remember correctly Sean we talked about it it might have been six months ago I think he said like 200 million for the year is that right yeah that's the number that's one number we had heard but 45 million obviously would put them on a totally different trajectory than that so yeah it appears to be just an absolute monster our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better who's the who's Logan Paul's manager who's who's his name's Jeff he's he's on the podcast he's been the same manager for a long time uh Logan talks about him quite a bit and so if you if you watch some of Logan's older videos too he would periodically show up and so they've been together for a long time and Jeff put together that deal and it's been incredibly successful we'll we'll see how it ends up I I don't know I would imagine they're going to want to continue to do this thing for another couple of years and then probably sell it and those guys who created the drink you said they created a lot new but that wasn't that big uh like it seemed I remember when Prime first came out I was like who are these guys and it's I think it's two dudes right who are the founders of that yeah um and though they didn't really have a huge hit before that how did they even secure that deal and why why did they partner with them over like you know some more established thing do you know I honestly don't know I've never had that conversation with Jeff of of why did why partner with this company instead of doing it yourself I think I I would imagine what happened was this company presented them with the opportunity and it was something that really resonated with Logan and then I remember the story of him saying he called KSI and tried to get him on board which he did and so it probably is just right place right time Logan was ready to lean into something else and Logan's on a lot of different business ventures over the last five years I mean this one obviously is Far and Beyond the most successful but I again I would imagine right place right time they like the products liked the got along with the individuals who are operating the business and the the partnering with KSI um were they just actually friends the whole time and the whole boxing thing was just you know just a sort of Frenemies thing or like because that's kind of a genius move right like you kind of have to give credit to be like you know what will make this even bigger because normally let's say you're one of the biggest YouTubers those people tend to have like a bit of an ego I am distribution I don't need anybody else to do this I don't need to split the pie especially with my enemy so that's kind of interesting well what's going on there no total uh no uh they did not like each other uh the boxing beef was real they were definitely enemies and from my understanding of the story and I've only heard Logan's side of this I haven't heard KSI speak about it it took a lot of convincing for Logan to get KSI on board because there was still a lot of animosity between the relationship there I mean a lot of stuff was set a lot of personal things were said about girlfriends and parents and I mean it was a very personal beef that went on in this YouTube space for a while and so I think that's why it was so surprising when those two came together to launch Prime because it was the last two individuals you had ever thought to partner together on a hydration he said my Pokemon was a PSA eight it was it got ugly yeah yeah but now it's like for for us it's it's been helpful because you know we uh they launched in Australia and it went incredibly well for them they launched in the UK it went very well and so feasible was like we're probably six to eight months behind because they you know had a product and launched a lot sooner than we did but it's it's allowed us to then go into those conversations in Australia UK southeast Asia where and the retailers have already had massive success with prime where it's a much easier conversation for us to explain to them why they should take feasibles where I think if we were the first ones coming into the in the industry like into woolies that in Australia probably a little harder conversation pre-prime well and that Prime seems like an amazing category uh like that to me uh the drink the hydration drink water basically like fancy water is a better category than chocolate bars how do you think about categories that you're going to go into like um do you think that's a better category and also like how do you choose what category to get to is you could basically promote anything dude when we we we did the thing with Sean organized this thing and he brought a bunch of feasibles I ate about eight of those things in one night I was I felt horrible the next day I did eat dinner I just ate all this chocolate so at least for that night it felt like a good category yeah well okay see I have to back up to explain how this all started and so you know this started with my you know in a parking lot kind of brainstorming ideas while he was it was in between him filming this video that never got posted like most videos that like just got filmed and never people never saw it but anyway we we came up with this idea where we wanted to launch a snacks company and we wanted to build this constant idea around launching the snacks company and childhood bars to us felt like the right category for a couple reasons like one is it's a massive business like it's a 26 billion dollar industry it's it's very holiday seasonal dependent which if you're a parent going into a store for Halloween or for Easter or something like that it's like Hershey's is sitting here and feasible is sitting here and you have a 8 9 10 12 year old son daughter like it's a no-brainer like you're gonna buy the feasible's chocolate and so that that was one reason another thing is the 50th anniversary of Willy Wonka was uh in 2021 and so the initial idea was let's put golden tickets in chocolate bars and sell that and give away a chocolate factory which became just a thing in itself of you know buying a warehouse and turning into a chocolate factory it was no easy feat um but that that really kind of sparked the conversation of okay well if we're gonna build this on this Chocolate Factory giveaway with a chocolate bar um what are the other categories that we can eventually go into the cookie really came because you know had this joke on his channel and it's been since the beginning is you guys see it in the banner it's like subscribe and I'll give you a cookie and so we we wanted to venture into cookies next it's it's not I would say as big of a focus for us as chocolate I think we're really trying to build out seasonality and chocolate we're trying to build multi-pack and chocolate I don't think people truly understand how big Hershey's actually is uh and how dominant they are in the space like they truly dominate chocolate because they also own Reese's which is like if you walk into chocolate island Walmart Target Kroger wherever you see a giant wall of orange and a giant wall of bread it's like you very clearly uh those two businesses or those two Brands dominate the child aisle and so we thought it was a good space for us to go at because it wasn't um it wasn't so oversaturated by 20 30 40 different companies is like we really knew who we were competing against we were like we're competing against Hershey we need to be more Innovative we need to build this gamification layer we need to build a better product that has higher quality ingredients we did we knew like what the road map looked like to compete with them it's been a lot harder than we thought just Global chocolate supply chain I think was something Jimmy and I knew nothing about thank God for our team that like understands this that we've been working with but yeah I think we'll we'll definitely go I don't know if Jimmy said anything to you guys when you were in Greenville but I mean there's a road map of products that we're going to do over the next like two to three years we're trying to figure out like what the rollout strategy is going to be but for 2023 and you're going to 2024 chocolate is the main priority right and getting more space in retail I gotta take back what I said I think it's a great category you convinced me I was wrong that was great uh I actually I think what you guys are doing is really smart there by the way Hershey's makes like eight or nine billion a year in Revenue off of uh they're saying and the reason I think it's in great category actually based on what you said was the audience fit but also uh just like how old that competition is and like you know you didn't say this but like if I'm Mars or I'm Mondelez or I'm Hershey's um you know I look at my acquisition targets my m a targets there's not many and um I think this is an opportunity where I don't think the business itself is going to generate a ton of profit just because uh physical goods and you know they're like as you scale up it's like you know it's not the thickest margins but I do think this is like a business where you're going to look up and sell it for 500 million dollars or something like that someday if you wanted to you'd actually be surprised the chocolate actually is a it's a pretty good marketing business for us and I mean Hershey is still you know they probably turn off six to eight hundred million dollars in profit every single year and have been doing this for 50 plus years and so we yeah it's it's been challenging for us but we understand like what the road map is we really think that and we don't know how Hershey is going to compete with us seasonally uh that's like one thing big for us like Halloween's gonna be big for us this year uh we're doing a lot of different sweepstakes and promotional things and so you know for us if we can win those months like October then becomes 100 to 200 million dollars just in a single month and we can put our full force into just October and then into holiday and then you turn it around and you're like okay now like what are we doing for Valentine's Day what are we doing for Easter uh and so these are all like the conversations that we've been having over the last year what number would kind of cross the threshold of all right we should take this acquisition seriously if one of those guys came to you at the end of the year I don't think he takes a multi-billion dollar acquisition right now I there's just too much upside in the business right now just for feasibles yeah it's just it's the amount of opportunity for us not not only okay let's just just I'm just talking domestically so now let's just let's talk about just the world right chocolate is is popular like globally and we haven't really talked about this yet but I know he talks about on your guys podcast is we launched all these multi-language channels there's there's really a method to the madness here is like you know we now dub in I think 16 different languages uh including Japanese and French and Hindi those are all markets for us that we're pushing into over the next like 12 to 18 months and so the opportunity for us is just way too big to even look at an acquisition at the moment because for us like Asia is is a huge Market the Middle East has actually become one of our highest growing markets at the moment which we're now figuring out like what are the points of distribution and then we're eventually going to be able to just specifically Market to those regions like we're going to be able to put a video file up and it's going to be the Japanese dub but instead of being like hey go to your local Walmart and Target it's gonna be like our um our dub artists in Japanese which is uh the voice actor of naruso saying oh you can go buy it at your local 7-Eleven or other convenience stores available in Japan and so we're going to make everything very localized and so to us like we're like I haven't even rounded first base yet to what this business opportunity is and so I don't know we haven't even had like acquisition tart like isn't even a thing well when we when we all hung out with him he was talking about he was talking to the same thing uh I don't know if he was saying feasibles but just like his Enterprise you know he threw around crazy ideas of like maybe IPO maybe sell for billions of dollars I don't know like but he approached it in a this isn't an insult but it was very naive like he sounded like uh an innocent like oh I'm just gonna do this and then this and then this that's it like it's it's gonna work and I remember but but I found it to be like um believable hey like I believe that he actually could potentially do that which is crazy but B I felt like his ignorance a little bit about business was actually a massive um tool for him a little bit where I was like man that's like you'd be one of the biggest things in the world and in his brain he's like well yeah what do you what do you expect uh and I don't know if that's maybe naive is not the right word but there was almost an innocence about it uh that I I really appreciated do you think you have that same kind of mindset with this or or do are half the things that you guys are working on not just you and him but your rest your artists or the rest of your um uh folks on your team are you like I don't know if we could pull this off but whatever let's just try and get into it we'll see what happens uh I he's probably we're a little bit different in that regard I think I'm a little bit more of a realist in terms of you know knowing how hard these things are to build knowing how hard these things are to sell I said ultimately it's going to be his decision you know if he wants to sell this thing or not but I I think there there is a level of him and I are very naive to to at least when we enter the chocolate Arena we didn't really have a good understanding of what we needed to create how we needed to compete and I actually think that was an advantage for us because we were just running as fast as possible trying to get product out and we made a lot of critical um I would say decisions that were either big positives or big negatives and we were able to go change the negatives very quickly I think one is I think you said you didn't even have customer support the day you launched or something like that we didn't have customer support in which we then learned in feastables like okay in a little different business so we we had a full customer social support team when we launched feastables thankfully and you you know you've done a couple of these now and I think uh I've always been amazed like some creators are much better promoters than others and it's not just like it matters like in a couple different ways sometimes if your brand is like I'm super real and authentic anytime you say anything promotional the audience is like yo sell out you know you can't do that and other people whose brand is to be more of a spectacle or more interesting they can get away with a little more but there's also just the Creator's motivation so as Brands throw money at creators to you know tell people hey swipe up and do this hey swipe up and do this you know like at some point um I think everybody becomes a little numb to it the audience and the Creator what I've been impressed with is for something like feastable or I also felt this way with prime I felt like with prime Logan Paul is like the CMO and he's like he's looking for every Edge he's got it almost you know like I don't think they own the majority of their company I think they own a small minority in that company but he almost treats it like a majority owner I remember when he went to like he goes to like uh you know the WWE thing or UFC fight he's got his prime bottle with him and then he'll do something that he knows is gonna he'll like embarrass himself so he gets memed like a million times on Instagram but he's like yeah I got meme but I was holding I was holding Prime wasn't I he's like you know basically it was all intentional he's like looking for these little edges and that's very different than you know the old days when uh you know an influencer holds up some detox tea and just says you know hey try this um what do you think is the difference in buying and that kind of like that mindset of like I'm going to use my engine to promote this like to level 100 what have you seen is the difference there and and how does that happen yeah I mean there's also just a different level of excitement when you have ownership in the brand versus you don't whereas like there's a cash exchange for you to promote audible.com you're not going to be as excited you're not going to put as much time creatively into this let's just say add read that you will if you own the business and so I I actually first saw this when we did figure on the app I'd seen him do a lot of like we had done a lot of mobile Integrations on the channel and then when we did figure on the app it was our thing uh we owned it it was like our competition explain what it is for somebody doesn't a figure on the app was we created this mobile game where a person puts their finger on their cell phone uh and the last person to take the finger off the phone went 100 Grand and there's little bombs that would pop up so you'd have to like move your thumb around to just avoid objects that would pop on your phone it ended up lasting 72 hours and then someone won 100K but uh level of excitement and level of promotion just went to the next level uh he was you know telling people why they should download it and he was you know messaging people back on Twitter who was like Hey I just downloaded I'm ready for the game he was responding and so there's like a much more there's much more depth to the level of excitement on the Creator side and you really see that with Prime and it would do with feastfuls and you see it with also happy dad with nelk uh they're going all in on happy Dad the podcast is essentially built around you know happy Dad is everywhere for each podcast episode and I I do think the future is creators starting businesses the issue is like most of the time it's just gonna happen at the top uh where you know we are seeing some interesting businesses for like a mid-tier Creator who maybe isn't to the level of Logan Paul or nelk but they're you know cars versus bids or something like that where it's you know the channel maybe has two three million subscribers doing 500k video and they're gaining a lot of traction on that type of business what are some other examples like that um in in the Creator space in the Creator space cool Creator businesses that are not just like well I'm the most famous guy on Earth so whatever I say Works uh you know what what are some like we had Dr [ __ ] for Carson bids what are some other examples like that uh there's one called uh rare candy it's with Leon Hart who's you know he's a a relatively large Pokemon style Creator and he has a marketplace where you can buy Pokemon cards and do Pokemon unboxing so it's similar to what not and how it it works but it's you leonhardt owns a large piece of that business um I I mean to go back to the top like Emma Chamberlain coffee I think is another one it's like very organic or talks a lot about coffee and now I'm starting to see a lot of businesses pop up on the smaller end where it's maybe you have a channel that washes Windows right so it's like a tick tock Creator who maybe it does ASMR through like washing a house or washing windows and they use it as like this top of funnel in like a city where all these individual houses or all these people are not reaching out to be like oh this person's in Austin I'll pay them 400 to come pressure I've seen a lot of those for pressure washing they're they're all over the place and the grass cutting uh like lawn mowing yeah lawn mowing vending machines uh seeing a lot of like little small Niche businesses getting built but I I think these businesses are much bigger than people think they are um they're they're gaining like even in the pressure washing like meeting creators and they're making like 20 30 000 a month just from pressure washing homes and then all of a sudden you know they hire two or three other people because the demand is so high for people you know booking them out to to clean their home that they start to hire employees and then it becomes a real business that once just started as like one Tick Tock video of them pressure washing pressure washing their own house are you from the Midwest I am from North Dakota you're the first person on the Pod that says the word wash like I do with an r i I grew up 40 miles from the Canadian border so I'm probably just as Canadian as American at this point uh I get made fun of all the time for saying that word that way that I've embarrassed even say it but I just heard you say it um are there any companies uh or any Creator businesses out there that are shockingly large that many people don't know about yeah so one that I was wildly impressed by that was much bigger than I initially thought was Darman so it's the largest scripted YouTube channel on the internet and so it's it's all like it's daily uploading but it's long form scripted storytelling and so I I really didn't understand like how big of an operation that was and how many you know people and how many sets and just the sheer volume of content coming out of that business that that was one I was pretty surprised by and if you don't know what it is I remember when I first saw it I was like are people watching this and then I just have been paying attention it's slowly growing it's almost like the Hallmark or Lifetime channel but for like how do you spell it what is it he has 18.5 million subscribers it's like um it's there's like a lesson to be learned in like each episode is that right read yeah he used to do something completely different right like Dar was doing something completely different and then he's he he pivoted into this if he yeah found found his footing and scripted storytelling on YouTube uh more fast-paced a little bit more light on the scripted uh like storytelling aspect because it's like more content and volume I'm pretty sure this guy had a giant weed business before this uh makeup actually but I think he also had a weed but his wife is also an influencer I think she has a makeup business yeah I'm pretty sure this guy had a cannabis business I I don't know if I I got that right but why why funny yeah we grow he started uh he started we grow it it's sold uh hydrophonics and marketed for growing medical marijuana that's funny why uh why is this guy impressive to you read what what's the behind the scenes information just the sheer like the sheer size of the production company you know people people say it like oh you can build you know production entities on top of YouTube and creators are hiring employees you know it's like this is a good example of massive production entity built on YouTube cash flow positive making money you know I think most people thought that you know you couldn't do scripted storytelling on YouTube and actually make it a profitable business just because it didn't make sense with how the ad Revenue works and how the splits worked and he's really figured it out and it's it's hard because you have to upload daily and you have to average two three four five million views per video to start making significant amount of money but they've really figured it out on a large scale did they get the revenue up or did they get the expenses down what did they do different than you would have expected or what did they what was the trick from what from what I've seen in the scripted space on YouTube and and this is also like in the in like the streaming services scripted content is very expensive you know you you have writers on staff like it's usually long time lines they they figured out how to create content on a scripted basis much quicker and much more cost efficient where it's like dar's doing a lot of the writing they have a lot of just like part-time talent that comes in periodically and acts uh and then they also just like figure out how to do this with their own sets so they're not renting space like they actually built their own sets in uh in in LA and they're just just reusing the same sets I mean if you watch a lot of Darman videos You'll see the school you'll see the the movie theater uh there's a there's like a gas station there's a lot of like staple sets that just continue to show up and they do a really good job just repurposing those sets that's amazing I can't believe I remember seeing this guy when it was coming up I never in a million years would have bet that this would have been a good one what what are uh what are some other businesses out there that you've seen that are just shockingly interesting so this wasn't it's not a channel that's a business yet but I I stumbled upon it a couple weeks ago it's called Ryan Hall y'all and he was a former meteorologist and it's like a channel based on just uh what weather uh is happening across the country be different things that you should know about like the hurricane season and how it's going to affect the the like uh the southeast and you know it's I I'd seen channels try and do this in the past he's the first one that's gaining like tremendous traction and you can see it in the views per video you know it's like two three million views per video just on just talking about different weather patterns and this this is one that could I think become pretty interesting long term whether he decides to build something on top of that and I'm guessing it's like a very uh minimal team it's probably him plus an editor what is he doing because uh weather's so local people you know what do I care about the weather in Toledo right unless there's a natural disaster like you know what do I care so how was he how is he doing this this is incredible more of like the talking about just the whole the things that you should know about tornadoes or these are the most dangerous uh weather patterns of the year of the month so he talks more holistically about just the entire industry it's not really localized I mean I'm sure he could start localizing channels but that becomes a much smaller opportunity you have to you have to make these videos appeal to everyone and he's done such a good job at that but these type of like little niche channels that start to pull a tremendous amount of views pop up every single month on YouTube I mean the vending machine one was something that I went down that rabbit hole and farming I went down the farming Rabbit Hole what are the what's the farming and vending machine once yeah so farming Cola corn star I'll hit you with a few ones so Millennial farmer is probably the one that I watch the most and uh I grew up on a farm and so it wasn't that interesting to me because I know I know all the stuff that he's doing but for a normal person on the coast who has it doesn't know about you know cultivating or anything like that I think it's it's really interesting to them and so he's one that's it's more I think appeals more to an older crowd uh Cola corn star is another one that probably appeals to a little bit younger demographic where it's a little bit more like ranks and things like that on the farm uh and then Lauren farms uh female Channel also kind of showing like in the in the daily aspect um of just what do you do on a farm and so there really is a space for all types of content on the internet now that's why the the argument of the internet is so oversaturated it's hard to break through as a Creator like I just have never bought that argument because on Tick Tock and YouTube shorts I'm seeing things that continue to break through on a weekly basis and then people are figuring out how to turn it into an actual Channel That's profitable and we're seeing it with people like Ryan all y'all who you know nobody would have ever thought that a Channel about the weather could pull 3 million views of video but yet here he is doing it time and time again well that kind of makes sense that one of the comments on Ryan uh Ryan Hall's videos that said uh man the weather channel has really lost its way I'm so excited that Ryan is is doing it this way which is funny that someone like and that was actually the most upvoted comment which means a lot of people pay attention to the Weather Channel enough so to actually like wonder if it's lost its way or not uh so it kind of makes sense where you can just look at like what are like for example you could be like well Court TV Court TV has been around for or C-SPAN some of these things have been around forever you could go and look at what the revenue is you could see like what's interesting about them what's not interesting about them take a new spin so weather channel is owned by uh it's that um the guy in Hollywood Byron Allen I think he was an actor now he's like one of the richest black men in America he owns Weather Channel I think they still make like 500 million a year in Revenue so like great business we had um we were friends with this guy named John who who was the president of BuzzFeed and he told me he was like man if you look at CSNBC they only have like 50 000 concurrent visitors or uh viewers on their on on the channel but they make this much in Revenue I'm going to create that but for Facebook live and he ended up launching cheddar and sold it for hundreds of millions of dollars and so like this is like an interesting strategy of just like looking like which channels have lived for 50 years and are doing good but they're just kind of like been doing the same thing over and over and over again for a while so it's kind of actually an interesting strategy totally agree like building a new Weather Channel I think is incredibly complex and complicated but he definitely has the type of distribution that could start that business I think Dennis is like you would need to find a partner to help him probably execute that but yeah that that's I think why I found that the channel so interesting it's like I go to the weather channel I even have a widget on my iPhone that like pops up from it's like automated from The Weather Channel it gives me the weather every single day I was like I would much rather download a Ryan haul y'all widget that like gave me the totally much rather support that um than the Weather Channel and so yeah I think there's a much it's a pretty interesting opportunity there for him you'd made a comment you said something like you would bet that YouTube will be five times more valuable than any other platform combined in terms of value to from a Creator's point of view of the type of business you can build on top of it um you know more than I do but Sean and I had made this argument like a year and a half or two years ago where we're like man Twitter's like happening in the tech field but there's not really like a a uh what's the Kardashian lady uh the Jenner there's not like one of the gender persons who've like launched this like Instagram business that became a billion dollar company off of Twitter yet but we think that there's going to be something there and then Sean was like yeah there's like the guys on uh the guy Mafia on Twitter there's like the strip mall guy there's like the storage guy and they're actually like raising a significant amount of investor money to create some of these companies do you have you been playing around with Twitter and seen uh like some of the micro influencers and the the the the major differences instead of like um what you do which is more pop culture uh this is a little bit more B2B and and much older but have you paid attention to like Twitter and played around with the idea of one of these folks whether it's like a sweaty startup our friend in the cuber who's got like a 400 000 following about them building like pretty big companies in the back Twitter as opposed to YouTube yeah I've seen it I'm actually not surprised because I've I've been pretty outspoken of social platform where do you build the most fan loyalty across social and I've seen that Twitter is at the top of the pyramid in terms of fan loyalty like a a Twitter follower that will comment on your tweets is much more valuable than a casual viewer on Tick Tock or Instagram because usually like they actually care and so I think people are now starting to figure that out that oh Twitter is actually incredibly valuable if you can start to gain traction and start to get people that that really engage it's also it's an older demographic where I think the one thing that YouTube is really struggling with right now is you know yes there's people like Ryan Hall and there's people like Millennial farmer who are appealing to maybe a 20 to 30 year old but there it's it's much more suited for an eight-year-old uh to watch content whereas Twitter to me is like I spend most of my time on Twitter uh the people that I meet on Twitter like I would buy products from if they actually promoted something and so I just think that Twitter for me has been really interesting from just a fan royalty perspective uh it's this is the depth of the platform whereas Instagram and Tick Tock to me have been more casual I I buy things on Instagram but it's rare and Tick Tock is like my mind share it's like every single second I'm seeing a new video I don't even remember the names of the channels that I see on Tick Tock they just come and go like I and when I'm at different events and I see a lot of tick tock Traders I I recognize them because I've seen them on Tick Tock I have no idea what their Tick Tock channels are which is bad but I will remember like someone's twitter ads uh that I see and I'll be like oh my gosh that's at whatever it is I I very rarely do I say that about Tick Tock and so I just think that the depth of consumer is just much different on Twitter who would you buy a product from which are the quote Twitter creators would you buy a product from or rather who are some of your favorite follows I mean I met Blake Robbins which we've you know did a podcast together I met him on Twitter that was how he met I thought his tweets were incredibly interesting I thought as an investor he was talking about a lot of things that interest me and so if Blake would have sold anything three to four years ago before I knew him I would have instantly bought it because he had he had built up that you know loyalty I bet loyalty like I not only agreed with a lot of things he was saying I thought it was really interesting to the point where I would take time to comment or like that tweet and I I have a lot of those now just that I follow on Twitter and then you get to like the of it that are getting hundreds of thousands of likes and I think you know now then you have the Bots and you have a lot of internet trolls and stuff like that but where Blake kind of sits is in the 30 40 000 follower range and a lot of those people care about what he's saying and then the word of mouth becomes really interesting where someone says hey I used an eight sleep mattress um it's changed my life if someone Blake or you guys tweet that I'm gonna be like what is an eight-sleep mattress I should probably figure out why they like this so much but if someone on Tick Tock is like oh my eight slate matches well well I probably just scroll past it and don't even think twice about it um so that that to me is like something that I've noticed I treated out that I love Aid sleep like I don't have any affiliation with them um I just had one of their mattresses and I tweeted out how much I loved it and then right away their team reached out like hey can we do an affiliate deal or do you ever want to partner together I'm like no man I just I'm just talking about cool [ __ ] that I like and so but they said they they said they they sold a lot of mattresses from that tweet yeah the people that follow you also can't afford the product they you know probably been following you for a long time they trust what you say because you guys aren't Shilling a ton of stuff constantly so when you authentically talk about our products like people pay attention it's like Tim totally right like I I used to pay a lot of attention to what Tim Ferriss was using and talking about on Twitter are there any other good follows that that you have that uh you could see launching a business and succeeding um I mean you guys mentioned some really good ones I it's not a platform that I pay a lot of attention to in terms of individuals like that could grow businesses I think I'm much more suited for YouTube I live in the depths of YouTube Every Single Day Twitter for me is like following people I know you guys my friends like other people in the business here um but we'll see I I hope they're able to grow businesses on top of it I I have a lot of confidence in Twitter just as a platform to be a girlfriend loyalty what about threads we didn't ask you about threads all right if you guys look at the Google trends for Threads it's not looking good I also saw a graph this morning on daily active users for Threads that just like fell offline I didn't have a lot of faith in it um but we'll see I don't think that I I saw a lot of people talking about that and I think their takeaway is like oh it's not working or it failed but like that was always going to happen even whether it's going to succeed or not if they got a hundred million people to download the app any app look at the Twitter app will do the same if you get 100 million people in a day to download the thing you're going to turn like you know 80 of them won't just start using the app regularly habitually uh right away so so to me I see that and I'm like this is completely normal and like to me has no uh like that was gonna happen either way um there was no chance that 100 million people are gonna download it and 100 million people are going to keep using it next week that's no app in the history of mankind ever has worked that way and so the question is like what happens I don't know uh three months from now once they get their kind of core base of users does that start growing or not and well like yeah there's no way to know until until then yeah totally agree uh I I haven't logged on I logged on the first day I downloaded it and haven't really been on since so I I there's also like you know you tell your talent to like keep an eye on it or would you tell your talent no we honestly don't care uh it's up to them most of them will download it and we'll post on it and see if they like it I think we'll we'll wait like you said it's gonna take months to figure out if this is going to gain traction I think most of them are just going to patiently wait I don't think any of our talents are going to fully lead into threats they're they're better off putting their time into making amazing YouTube videos we did this video Sean and I did this video like two weeks ago or a week ago where we were talking about how we liked that Zuck did this and we were team Zuck and uh Sean we officially have a new nickname I don't know if you saw this in the comments of YouTube but we are officially now zuck's [ __ ] that's plural both of us Cox they call us Cox uh the t-shirts are getting printed uh we should be all right I don't know like how we are his [ __ ] does that mean we are having sex with his wife or or is he having sex with our wife it's more like the Mighty the Mighty Ducks it's like where the where the Mighty Ducks where this this this uh the small group of people who really believe in this thing that everybody else kind of uh has written off or hates yeah but we're a cuck so I don't know who's who's having sex with whose wife but something is happening there of which we are involved in uh we are officially Zex Cox which I'm okay with I I did yeah I'm a [ __ ] for sure see well it once once they box or fight MMA like I'll be in elon's side of the the Octagon so maybe will you really I think so I will bet you uh a largest a large sum of money that if that ever happens that Zuck would crush him uh yeah I guess I in terms of who would win I mean just looking at the pictures that Mark posted with Israel adesanya and uh volkanovsky it scares me a little bit if I'm Elon Musk but I still like I gotta support you so win or lose do you um uh last couple questions but what would you sell night media for right now I wouldn't I created Knight because I really enjoy it and what would I do if I sold that media I'd become an investor like I already get to do that so yeah but but there's there's always there's got to be a number what do you think it's worth um man I don't know to be honest uh it all depends on how you value the subsidiary Labs businesses I mean I could probably I know what the core management company is worth and what this subsidiary businesses are I think is like where it could Flex quite a bit but sure I enjoy it like I I think if I if I sold night the acquiring business would have to make me the CEO like if we sold it to an agency like they would they would have to make me the the CEO of that major agency or management company because I actually enjoyed doing this like it's not something like I didn't start night media to sell night media I started my media so I was like I really enjoy what I really want to do this I I find fulfillment in it I have a venture capital fund I get to invest I get to start businesses I get to be entrepreneurial I get to be a manager and I get all the perks of being a manager uh I I don't want to do anything else right now that might change in a few years who knows like what time will do but yeah I don't know I wouldn't sell we've had offers like I just wouldn't sell it so what what um hundreds of millions of dollars I would assume low low north of hundreds of millions of dollars there's no chance to know that's that's wild that's a good you're in a good position to be in right yeah I mean there's just I feel like we're I said this about feasible I I feel this about the whole company in general is we haven't even got started it'd be hard for me to to sell this thing with the amount of upside that I see over the next like five years I could see a partnership of some sort I don't think I could just fully sell it and walk away or have like an earn out over multiple years right now not yet well you raised a hundred million dollars or you received 100 million dollars from chernin in a separate fund to buy consumer businesses that you could then kind of like plug in YouTube distribution into something like that I think that's the idea can you explain it's a big idea there and what if you've done anything with that yet yeah so Labs will will start a business zero to one uh feasible was started ground level race Capital hired the CEO night capital is more fixated on finding a business that's generating cash that maybe is doing 5 10 15 million dollars a year and we think we can come in uh probably buy a majority stake in that business roll some creators or a celebrity out of the cap table and expand what that business is doing or just continue to grow that business it's it's very similar to what chernin does and is doing with cars and bids and did with Barstool and hello sunshine and all these other businesses yeah they've done that tons of times yeah a massive opportunity for us to do it as well just because we understand this Creator ecosystem and just internet pop culture so much better than anyone else and so that ideally is like why we did that Capital we're not in a hurry to do a deal I think the economy has been something that scared us a little bit and everyone that did deals in 2022 I think is really regretting a lot of those uh and so we're just patiently waiting for what that thing is going to be well dude we appreciate you doing this you're the man um it's always I like just hearing like what you're tinkering with you have a very uh interesting uh perspective on things what do you think Sean yeah this was fun um and I'm glad uh I don't know how well we stuck to our mission but I think it was pretty good yeah it was pretty good uh we'll bleep out every mention um because this is the zero Cloud podcast zero Cloud chasing podcast and uh we have a no Cloud policy and we did not we did not want to do that wait but do we have to use this face on a thumbnail no we're gonna blur it out I think we have to put like his face and then Reed's face next to it and blur out Reed's face and the thumbnails like The Man Behind the Scenes or something ridiculous I'll let you guys figure that one out I mean there's plenty of things no you got to figure it out we don't know how to do it we suck at YouTube guys are killing it so no YouTube is we have way more downloads on uh on like the actual podcast uh you know uh iTunes and stuff like that uh we suck at YouTube I mean I would argue that a listener on iTunes or Spotify is probably way more valuable than a single listener on YouTube in the podcast genre so I I think what you guys are doing is incredible um and I I would continue to focus on listens across other platforms I wouldn't like hedge too highly on YouTube at the moment I agree that we've we've we like went hard on YouTube for like the last 12 months and now it's like oh man actually the podcast number that just steadily grows every single week whereas YouTube it's a little it's a little lumpy yeah on the opposite I love YouTube I think it's great I think I just like the comments I guess I love it too but I I do think that I I consume your guys's podcast on Spotify so yeah it's I guess that's what you get used to once wherever you consume it you're like this is a good place for things and so yeah you know that's where things go all right Reed thanks for coming on man where should people uh follow you or find you a shout out wherever you want people to go I mean we spoke a lot about Twitter so let's just read JD on Twitter um and then uh I I probably am the most active on Instagram in terms of like answering messages so uh same thing read JD on Instagram so I appreciate you guys thanks for having me on see ya it is producer Ben's last day uh last day producing an episode this is it this is your uh your Michael Jordan shot against the Jazz will there be a Wizard's comeback I don't know but this might be your walk-on all right here's the rules you can't say anything about next chapter or Adventure I don't want to hear that and um you can't generically say you learned so much if you say you learn so much you better tell us exactly what you learned all right those are the rules for this speech okay great um so the next the next thing for me is basically focusing on how to take over the world getting the podcast is as big as possible speaking things taking over the world with how to take over the world speaking of like things I learned when I was here I think um people talk a lot about Focus right and focus is Maybe easier when things are not going well because if focuses about saying no the world is like saying no to you but when things start going well all of a sudden the world is like saying yes to you you have all these opportunities right and uh so that was I think one of the things that happened to me early on when I came on my first million all these people were like oh Ben Wilson the new hot thing do you want to try this do you want to do this what about YouTube or we should make some shorts you wanna do Tick Tock and I was like yes yes yes yes yes yes I want to do like all these things right and so I had all these kind of half finished projects that ended up not going anywhere because I was maybe a little too dispersed in my attention so now it's like no no just let's get the podcast to be one of the best podcasts in the world that's all I'm focusing on for the next year and then we'll see what happens after that there's nothing better quitting your job when you have the twins let alone even one baby what kind of what kind of responsible Mormon are you I mean what kind of decision was this Reckless at best well I mean it's it's not like I'm starting from zero right it's not like I have an idea for a podcast luckily uh you guys have um put me in a position where the podcast is doing pretty well right now so even if I have a bad year and and it doesn't grow that much I'll be fine and if it goes really well then things will be great so it's a little bit of a risk but not an existential risk and do you have I don't know a message to the fans how do you want to leave us here where do you want to go with this so obviously the first message is go follow how to take over the world wherever your podcasts you'll love it my man I guess um the the most important thing is thank you guys my life changed uh however a year and a half ago when uh when you guys brought me on the show and I called it the ride of a lifetime but really like I didn't know if I would be able to make a living as a Creator before you guys brought me on here now I know that I can do that at least in some capacity and so my life has completely changed so so thank you this has been amazing and I've loved doing it and uh to everyone who has like supported me been such a fan cheered for me uh on the podcast like thank you to you guys the listeners as well it's meant a ton and I've loved it so I guess that's the last thing I'm just

threads versus Twitter five days in and they've reached 100 million users making it the fastest growing product of all time Instagram has about a billion and a half users if 20 of Instagram's users come on board it's now bigger than Twitter the interesting part is Twitter is the most abandoned product ever so more than a billion people have signed up for Twitter or tried Twitter and then been like no I don't get it I'm good the big question is is that because the idea of Twitter doesn't appeal to that many people or that Twitter's execution was not good enough to hook those people and if it's the idea then those same people who try threads will eventually bounce but if it was the execution if it was that Twitter didn't hook them properly then they're screwed because if there's one thing that the Instagram and Facebook teams are going to do well is they're gonna execute

I feel that law of attraction works because I was living with my roommate and at this time my business was going pretty good and he could not raise any money at all his mindset was just stuck about feeling sorry for himself a prime example of it was like one day he called me and like really like anxious and he's like oh my God Jack a letter from the IRS arrived for you and I'm like dude I'm sure it's not that big of a deal lo and behold it actually was a refund check and at some point he basically just said like all right look what I've been doing thus far it hasn't worked I realized that I haven't been going all in because I'm scared that if I don't raise funding I'm gonna look like a failure to my network from this day forward I'm gonna go all in literally within a month or so he raised over 25 million dollars and people could tell that he had the conviction he's not feeling sorry for himself like I can't wait something he's like I'm gonna raise funding and this business is going to be huge and it was amazing to see him adopt that mindset shift that is an example for me of law of attraction

we're like yeah we're just gonna do the same thing but a little bit cheaper and we're calling it The Echelon it's pretty wild that they pulled this off I saw them originally at CES I was like oh cool a Peloton booth and it was Echelon it was it was the same thing it was the exact same thing [Music] uh what's going on uh yeah you know lots of things going on where do you want to start you drive what do you got all right I got a couple quick like random ideas for you okay so um so I'll call this um The Big Box strategy okay here's my big box strategy so I saw recently that Kevin Hart was like Hey are the thing our new thing is live at Walmart and I was like new thing what is it the list looks pretty much like athletic greens and sure enough it kind of is it's just athletic greens plus Kevin Hart going into Walmart at like lower price point basically how much is it athletic craze is like 80 bucks a month yeah athletic games is expensive uh let me see greens let me see his thing Vita hustle is his uh is the name of it oh my God um and literally it's like a picture of him drinking his greens and electrolytes on uh on the on the camera or whatever so anyways I saw going into Walmart and I had had this realization the other day when I was walking around at Costco I was walking around Costco and Costco is amazing Costco if you have a Costco deal uh if you talk to anyone who has a Costco deal they're like Costco drives insane volume it will make us as a company it also might break us as a company because they cut like pretty ruthless deals and if you ever like lose Costco or they like they don't go through with their purchase order like you might be screwed um but Picasso could drive a ton of volume and I was walking around and I basically saw in Costco if you go look every electronic like piece of equipment that's there is is like a it's not a Chinese knockoff it's like an American knockoff of an American product yeah it's like they're light years this mattress nine sleep it's like what this is this is just like it's dude I have a 300 Costco mattress in one of my rooms at my house and whenever guest stated they go where'd you get this mattress they ask about it all the time I'm like [ __ ] 280 bucks at Costco so so basically they have a lot of these like um you know blenders uh you know like fitness trackers things like that it's they have like they need kind of like they need it at a certain price point so there's a strategy which is basically you take the highly desirable thing that's kind of at a at a too high price point like athletic greens or another one or a ring uh I don't know if you've ever looked into buying an order ring but it tracks your sleep it's whatever it's cool ring that tracks your sleep and it's like it's like 700 or something like that for this ring um and maybe they've changed the pricing now but like I think when I bought it it was seven hundred dollars about 500 bucks for like the the kind of like the generation three Uber ring they they've sold like a billion dollars of uber ring so there's definitely demand for this product like oh and they're the cumulative sales is is that high but you go to Costco there's no Uber ring and there's no replacement for ordering I think you could create a company that just says I'm going to make a ring like thing for Costco and that's the entire business plan is just to do that one thing and if you do that one thing you'd be more successful than 99 of e-commerce stores you got to think smarter and not work not not like try to work so hard so like similarly I would go in I would hunt down what are the products that are not yet in Walmart or Costco places that drive insane volume Target's another one um that there is proven kind of like high-end New York La Lululemon drink it a little lemon uh Peloton type of customer that that that buys a product like that and you just bring it down market and like just make it a little worse like they're a gun and like you know they've done this with a bunch of them um and go figure out which one is not there like for example the mattress thing it's actually not there yet there is no eight Sleep mattress there there is no Uber ring there yet at least last time I walked around um and I think that's a just a simple strategy for e-commerce have you heard of echelon Echelon no you should look up Echelon so Echelon is a fitness company they started uh Peloton it looks exactly like Valentine I don't know when exactly they started but they it's it's an American company I think too so if you go to Echelon Fitness I think they maybe have changed their branding but before it was the same red dude it was a Peloton but cheaper and they now yes and they do uh the guy who started I read this interview with him so basically they have the uh the mirror the fitness mirror that was really popular called Mirror they have a smart rower which a few companies did and they did the Peloton bike now they have a smart treadmill and they just did the same thing but cheaper and at first it was all the same branding but instead of Peloton it said Echelon they're on track to do 200 million dollars a year in Revenue this year I think it's a bootstrap company like I think they just said like whatever you do so it says uh Peloton rival Echelon uh Fitness eyes uh one billion dollar valuation so maybe they oh they they recently uh raised some money uh but they we're like yeah we're just gonna do the same thing but a little bit cheaper and we're calling it The Echelon it's pretty wild that they pulled this off I saw them originally at CES and I was like oh cool a Peloton booth and it was Echelon it was it was the same thing it was the exact same thing it was pretty funny and they do they have a ride with pitbull so like Pitbull the rapper is like the guy uh that they chose they're in Walmart Costco Target things like that whereas you know Lululemon's company Mir and Peloton was like [ __ ] Walmart people not a chance like we want skinny people to get skinnier you know like it was that was their whole [ __ ] and they went the exactly like Peloton but the seat is wider yeah other sorts of people yeah yeah that's what that's what their motto is other sorts of people uh and anyway yeah we are your type yeah we're gonna make you look like the before picture instead of the way before picture uh and so anyway pretty cool that they've done exactly what you're talking about this Kevin Hart thing it's kind of stupid it's kind of cheap though right if if I'm if I'm Kevin Hart I don't know if I would be doing this it's 100 million dollars is gonna be stupid because that's what he's gonna make off this thing I have a meaty topic about your old company the milk Road and how I think that you guys have just made a huge mistake I'm going to bring that up in a minute and I want to get your opinion on it but before I do I want to talk about something that's not business related at all but it kind of is and I'm gonna get to it uh I've been working on like different body stuff like I love like experimenting with body and this is like a little uh vein of me to bring this up but I posted these pictures in our doc and they're about two months apart and basically what I've been experimenting with body wise is like getting super lean and like somewhat skinny and then like gaining weight again but without getting fat you know they call it like a like a dirty bulk that's when you eat like a ton of food and you but you get muscle and you get fat I've been experimenting with that but look at the difference of the two pictures that I shared and if this is on YouTube we'll put it on the screen I guess it seems a little weird but I guess we'll do it dude we're making this the thumbnail if you're gonna bring this up we're getting the click so uh welcome all of our thumbnail viewers who clicked because you saw a before and after of sale well it's not the the pictures aren't that shocking but here's what I've been testing just a difference of two to three hundred calories a day for two months so you go down to like 1900 to 2000 or 1900 or 2100 ish that's my window when I'm getting skinny up to like 23 2400 that's the difference 300 calories a day 200 calories a day that's the difference that's like a Twinkie or uh like a pack of M M's that's not a lot of slices of cheese or something yeah it's not a significant amount in my case it's mostly protein so it's a little bit more protein is that crazy how big of a difference that can make it is crazy um I saw you post that on IG and I was I was I had a great joke or something I remember I had a great joke and then I was like you know I'm not gonna make this joke this would be getting wiser I said I'm not gonna make this joke because some people get real sensitive about their body and they don't they don't want jokes uh like even a funny joke won't come across well so I said let me just let me just hit the like button and move on carry on here but I do have a question just say it just say it come on I don't even remember it now it was something about like you know what you know when a person's like super fit then you have to like pull them down when someone's like fat you have to like bring them up so I was I was gonna make funny in some way but you know I don't remember what it was at this point um I have a question for you or the thing that stood out was you were basically saying this is a 200 calorie difference and I was like that's kind of stunning it's stunning and by the way that's not precise so I I uh typically weigh stuff I've been traveling for the last six weeks so I don't waste stuff but I track everything so a lot of it's eyeballing so I could be give or take what are you tracking everything in my fitness pal so I use my body tutor and I meet with them weekly and we go over like the plan and they give me like the plan to use and then I have a trainer called Central athlete and they tell me what workouts to do and so I just tracked everything and they review it all right and so you um what's a typical day of eating for you right now so right now I prefer getting a lot of protein early in the day so I'll do um roughly 100 grams of protein firstly fasting are you just doing the like 30 you know 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes like which because I've heard both schools of thought intermittent fasting people like I don't fast and then Tim Ferriss in the four-hour body was like no no protein right away right when you wake up I don't fast because it uh I'm hungry in the morning so I don't fast so I get up uh around 9 30 I'll have a cup of yogurt so that's like 15 grams of protein I think uh and then I'll maybe eat like a banana and then I'll go and get a really hard workout in and then afterwards I'll do I use a Ascent or momentous protein and I do Four Scoops with just water and I drink that and then I won't eat till dinner and then of course a lot right it isn't it supposed to be like one per thing is that's like the one or a serving one or two and so each scoop's like 20 grams 25 25 yeah so you just get 100 grams right there and that can the body even absorb that much protein powder at once that's what I always wondering so I don't know I I think that the preferred method is to get that protein from food and chicken but I just like doing it so I just like drinking it at one and I feel really full and then at dinner time I eat chicken and vegetables and usually like a dessert oh wait so there's no lunch that's my lunch is like the the protein I I just feel like a banana a thing of yogurt you'd drink a shitload of protein powder and then you later for dinner like we're talking like 6 p.m now something like that right yeah yeah I'll eat like 1300 calorie meal you have a huge dinner of chicken and veggies and chicken or fish and veggies and the veggies will be something green and also like a potato and then I'll usually do like a like a piece of candy or ice cream or something like a very small serving of that like uh last night I had chocolate covered almonds like 250 calories worth and that adds up to roughly 20 23 to 2300 23 to 24 yeah that's crazy I mean that crazy like that's so different is what I should say because obviously it works so maybe I'm crazy for not doing that um but here's the thing it's like so little food it's not that much food sometimes if I have a really hard workout I'll do a banana and a bagel but I'll just do a plain bagel like 350 calories of carbs right before I go work out um I'm not like I don't know if this is the right thing to do I think I think probably the right thing to do is to get like proper food but I just don't I'm looking at this photo it looks like the right thing to do to me right like what what else what are we measuring here I I yeah I don't know Instagram likes that's how you measure your health and that is working right now so here's the thing though that I've learned and this has like changed my confidence in life and in business and everything learning how to manipulate your body because like that's what everyone wants to do is either get skinnier gain weight like everyone like wants to do something with their body once you learn yeah how many people are happy just like yeah yeah like everyone wants to improve their body in some way what I want yes but the thing is is like what I've learned so I've been going hard at this I think like it was two years ago I texted you and I go I go I'm gonna become an Instagram Fitness influencer it was a joke but not entirely a joke but I was like I want to figure this out and so I just went and learned how it worked and once I figured out that it's like a mathematical equation life became so much better and I just it was just like you do this you do this you do this and you do it for three six 12 months or whatever you likely are gonna see results and then what it did was it gave me so much confidence that it's I realized wow this is just like business business is actually the same thing you do this you do this you do this and the likelihood of getting some type of result is high hopefully you'll get your desired result but you're going to be better than when you started uh but then it's like that became the truth for me it it was as if I had bad eyesight and I put on glasses like that became the truth with so many other things you do this you do this you do this and you trust the process you hire a coach or you develop your own plan you follow the plan and you have to do it for three six 12 months whatever and it's really fun to start seeing results and then once particularly with the body I think emotions would be next but with the body it's like oh wow I could manipulate manipulate that and then also with money we do it with money I can manipulate money by doing X Y and Z then it becomes like I can do anything and so right like once I've conquered the body part it feels awesome it feels so good um that's exactly that's so on point um and by the way the opposite is true when you want something and you don't figure out how to bend reality to make it happen a little seed of Doubt gets planted in the brain that's now there that says you're like man I could do anything I put my mind to and there's a part of your head that says really or is it like that diet or is it like sleeping early or is it like you know making money like whatever the thing that you wanted to do that you didn't you didn't actualize you didn't manifest into reality by by doing it I'll tell you a little story this is very much relates to a conversation I had yesterday with my trainer so talking to my trainer and I said uh I wrote a number on the on the mirror I just went in there I wrote 53. he's like 53 what like what are we doing 53 of something 53 push-ups what is this I go about 53 days left because what do you mean I got oh I had this realization I'm eight weeks away from having the body I want that's 56 56 days where did you start and where did you you at your Peak you were like 280 no no no no I'm I'm basically the same weight I was at the start you look way different muscle and fat a little bit but like oh no 220 and I'm currently like 229 through to 30. so it's like I actually went up and wait a little bit but the composition changed a bit sorry you just looked horrible when you started now you look awesome so that's a great compliment actually uh no you can see you can see her biceps you look you look significantly different from when we first started so so I told her I said I'm I'm am I I'm eight weeks away from everything I want he's like oh that's that's great I said uh so I'm just I'm keeping track right now I'll just put I'll just keep changing this number every day that I eat exactly the way I want this number goes down and uh if I don't we go back to the beginning and uh we start I don't know if we go all the way back or if I'm just gonna like add three every time I uh if I slip but I haven't slipped yet so I haven't had to think about it all right so anyways we're talking and we have this philosophy so being my training we have this philosophy where um we both are very into mindset and what's cool is what happened what I had experienced previously in my life was I'm really into mindset things I'm basically like you know in San Francisco there's that angry Jesus guy who walks around with a megaphone yeah being like Jason lives he's alive he's alone that's like this guy just walks around so much like in the heart of like where all the startups are there's one guy that just walks around like that he's famous everybody knows him I was kind of lat with mindset stuff I'd be like life is what you responds not how you react right like there is no meaning except the meaning you're giving it your mood is your choice like you know I was just like walking around like and nobody really cared and in fact most people were generally somewhat annoyed with my uh my ongoing uh conviction in like the mind the power of the mind and how important is to master the mind your wife's like yeah I get it Sean if you think you can I think you can't you're probably right I get it just eat your [ __ ] noodles you can take out the trash like I told you too you know yeah that's kind of where she lands and I'm like but is the trash already taken out would we really think about it yeah that annoying guy and so and so then um I'm sorry I made my I made my trainer he's like like he's got his megaphone I got my megaphone and they touched we were both into the same things I've read that book I'm like in the morning do you sit down and think about these things he's like I do you're like more annoyed than like two improv kids or two vegans take it out exactly we're truly improv if you can take it out exactly right yes I am yes I am you're just constantly like trying to one-up each other so so normally that's the thing and we and to Hype ourselves up we're like dude it's so nice to talk to another black belt it's like there's a lot of white belts want to run around here and you try to help them out but they don't even really want to learn the techniques it's so nice to talk to another black belt listen you know what's nice about it I don't even have to say the thing actually I'll say two words three words about the subject enough said you actually already know you've read the thing you've actually practiced that we already agree there's no defensiveness and so we just Implement and what's your what's your workout that day just back padding yeah just like today we're working on our triceps yeah so so while we're having this conversation he's been he's been telling me this thing he's like he's like bro I like he's like I like big weights and thin books and I was like what he's like I like big weights and thin books instead we'll crack each other up about that he likes to lift weights and he's like I like thin books meaning I like to just understand the premise of the book and move on and I appreciate books that are thin and so what we've always talked about simple Simplicity how do you simplify a concept so that you understand it so that others can understand things this is something I always try to do and we've talked about like what's simpler than a book a fan book what's simpler than a thin book you know um a blog post just simply with a blog post a tweet what's simpler than a tweet a little catchphrase what's simpler than a catch phrase a gesture and so we had been playing with this idea of you're doing too much just do less we were like there uh this phrase that I've been saying on the Pod and and off the bottom the the season I'm in right now is the season of intensity is the strategy so uh for me that applies very easily with the with the body a diet thing it's like I don't need a new strategy I don't need a different workout program I don't need a new coach I don't need a new uh diet I don't need a new anything I don't need to go get a new app to track it all I simply need to do is execute the very simple plan with much higher intensity and so I just had this little thing where I just just this just if you're on YouTube you see this I'm just turning the knob up the dial and just turn the dial and now what I'm working on sometimes he'll just he'll just go hold on he'll just turn up the dial that just I know what that means I know exactly what I need to do I need to multiply the intensity I'm bringing to the current situation I'm doing the same thing whether it's on food or whatever just this is all I need to do everything I want is on the other side of this little gesture all right cool it looks like you're rubbing a nipple your neighbors are just like why is this guy doing like a necessary he's like be careful with that one and I said well I only hear there's two possible good interpretations of this and so um so the reason I'm coming from soccer Hill coming full circle to the thing you said which is what I told him I said look I want to he's like you know you got to know your why I said I know my why my why is because I know that if I could do this now there is an Unstoppable feeling that comes from knowing that you put your mind to something and you did it I said I don't really care I'm already married I got two kids I don't need to walk on a beach and like be attractive that's not a thing for me what I do care about is I can't have there be an area of my life that I wanted something in and not have that reality to my will like I can't not have done that right and so once I have done that it's just yet another yet another area of my life that I was able to to do that just dial up the intensity and get the result and that creates the Unstoppable confidence um it furthers the confidence to the point of being Unstoppable because this is the only area of my life I haven't yet done that and so um I highly recommend for anybody the area where you have struggled that's the that's the place to put the emphasis that's the place to try to overcome not even for the thing but because you want to be the type of person who could do that thing that's at least what's worked for me so far and why I have a lot more momentum than I had in the past because in the past I was like I really care if I have abs like I'm not sure that that matters to me no you definitely care but it feels good I read the stupid article on Vice and it was like gyms are built for skinny people and I can't go to the gym because I'm fat and people stare at me and I thought and this is for anyone listening who's fat right now or out of shape go to the gym you want to know why when I have never been to a gym and seen a that person and thought that person's gross I've only thought dude that's sick they're they're getting after it they're trying in fact I get inspiration when I see someone overweight because I'm like damn the first step's the hardest they're actually in a harder spot than I am so if you're listening to this [ __ ] go get fit it feels so good to like achieve a goal and to make progress it feels awesome and so I've learned a lot over these past few years like getting my stuff together and it feels amazing I I I've enjoyed this tremendously so I wanted to bring that up really quick and what's cool is like once you like basically if you're like out of shape and fat you only need to do like like for example if I if Sean you were like I just want to get strong I'll be like well just do this this and this it's really simple uh like do five reps five sets of this this and this it's quite simple and then eat this much food and then once you get like down to that like 80th or 90th percentile of Fitness then it's like all right we're gonna do really small adjust adjustments and you're gonna see like bigger changes so it's really fun to like see like all right I just need to like get to this point and that's easy and I'm gonna do a general plan that works for everyone and then as you get fitter it's like oh you're just gonna dial this a little bit dial this a little bit and that's really cool to like see those little small changes 300 calories a day what that what does that mean or eating a bagel instead of a banana for your before your workout does that change anything it's like these little small things it's been really fun to like see how that works and I think maybe just because I get older and my body doesn't respond the same so it's like these things actually matter but if you're listening to this that's what you have to look forward to if you're out of shape if you're already in shape it's really fun to test those small dials yeah I have one topic Sean so yeah last week or this week maybe milk Road your old company so Sean started a company called milk Road it was an email newsletter that was a daily news newsletter for crypto enthusiasts it was awesome still is awesome you guys you sold it and so it's not you or I don't actually know what your involvement is but you launched this thing called milk Road Pro I believe so the launch for it was cool it happened um I actually don't see the date but I'm looking at like the newsletter when you launched it and it's like 300 a year or 20 a month or sorry ten no it was ten dollars a month ten dollars a month and 150 a year whatever and what you get is you get um Market insights and deep dives from milk roads research team weekly Recaps on everything happening in the space uh quarterly funding breakdowns cool awesome first before I give my criticism I think it's sick that you guys tried this second do you know if it's working um I know a little bit so I wasn't involved in the launch of this or the um the details like what it is the price all that stuff so I wasn't really involved in that I knew they were going to do it um and I was like cool cool idea to try let's do it and um that's all I know about that part I don't know the results of it just so far so if I've been in this situation so I had the hustle I launched a 300 a year thing the biggest mistake I made or a big mistake I made was instead of charging 300 a year I should have made something that I could have charged thirty thousand dollars a year yeah and dropped to zero you oh you dropped a zero over here you wanna come get that yeah I dropped I I dropped two of them two zeros and the difference between those two price points is it it it's a ton but I actually don't think that the work is as big as a difference in price points or at least the F the at least the effort that goes into that and can I give you a few examples of what I would have done instead if I was the milk Road the first thing I and by the way I'm in the back seat here I don't know anything they probably I'm sure maybe they thought about this and there's reasons why and there's probably some strategy so this is totally a guy who doesn't know anything about the strategy the first thing I would have done or these are all different ideas of what could have worked I would have researched the first thing tell me what you think about this not a crypto job board that's that stinks been there done that I would have done a crypto job uh crypto salary benchmarking meaning as any user that signs up I would have asked them where they were what their job title is and how much money they made and then I would have took like what the benchmarks is what the Benchmark is for different salaries and I would have packaged that and try to see if I can sell that to HR departments at crypto companies which I don't know if they're actually hiring a lot right now so I'd have to do more research but I think I would have done something like that there's a few companies that have done this there's salary.com and there's pay scale I think pay scale does something like two or three hundred million dollars a year in subscription Revenue when they sell into this uh what's your what's your gut Instinct on that one and you're saying instead of milk or you're saying this is a part of it instead of these are these are things I would have done instead of what what I think that's a cool idea um I think you know the crypto the number of crypto companies that are mature enough to care about salary things I think is a little early for that I feel like something like that's going to work in a few years not not well now's a good time to start then man right yeah fair enough um and then so when I'm thinking about these new ideas I would think most of my ideas for what you guys should have launched are data related the reason I like data is a I actually think that's within the core competency of a company creating newsletters I think creating a software platform would have been a horrible idea because that's not within your core core competency I also would have looked at what data can I get from my users and what are they clicking on in order to like track different data and if possible I would have tried to make something that my advertisers would also want to buy but that's actually quite hard and that that last one I don't think I could have done the second thing I would have looked at is sentiment analysis again totally I'm a total Outsider here so but I wonder if big Banks or big buyers of crypto stuff if they would care what does the little guy think like the retail investor and what I would have done is and I think there's a few I think there's it's called San they do like four or five billion dollars a year in revenue and what they do is they look at Behavior analytics of like different crypto markets and how it works I think there's augmento there's a few more that like look at this but I would have like seen because the thing with crypto is it seems like a lot of stuff happens in Discord and if anything happens at Discord a gray hair guy is not going to be able to figure that out right yes true and so I'm wondering definitely true could could milk Road have figured out what the little guy is talking about before it kind of pops and gets sentiment analysis packaged in a more professional way than Discord what do you think about that I think that's a good idea I think there's um so we've been doing this thing called the fear and greed index from the beginning which I love which is basically a uh it's a meter that just shows what's the Market's mood it isn't kind of like based on the uh like from the stock market this has been the case for a long time which is um you know the market is very moody it gets extremely fearful it gets extremely greedy and you kind of want to be buying when it's fearful and you want to be selling when it's greedy if you wanted to time it or at least it does not buy when the market is feeling super greedy um uh but like it's good to know where where the sentiment stands because you could sort of price is very very linked to that and at the beginning we didn't have any first party data so we used an existing fear and green index and we just skinned it and designed it to fit our brand but I'm pretty sure now we have probably the biggest ability of anybody to pull for that exactly um outside of a coinbase or others could do it but they're not they're not doing it but in terms of media like we're one of the biggest I think we are the biggest newsletter for crypto so I think and we get a lot of feedback like if we say hey tell us acts they'll like we'll get tons of responses uh for every email and so I think that we could have basically built our own fear and greed index or built that out like maybe per coin or per project per nft like what is the sentiment around this what are the whales saying so like just create a cohort of whales and their sentiment that take that data and package it up for any of the financial like institutional money that's in this space um so I do think that that that has a possibility and that is a 30 000 product not a not a a 10 a month product and then what I would have done is like looked at that analysis and the data and then also had my researchers and writers give context around this and to explain their sources and why they think it means what it means and I think because the research they do in this Pro thing is actually good and the problem is when it's gonna be super low priced I think that it's really hard to go that extra mile on any one topic and because you know the the by the reader may not even be that sophisticated or have that much skin in the game and then the writer has to turn out lots of content for a wider base but if you know hey this is a narrow group of people that really care a lot about these specific things you could go be the best in the world at delivering that type of Intel and you host conferences and a handful of other things around that and that is a thirty thousand dollar a year product I think now yeah packaging all of that is challenging and pulling it off is challenging but I don't think it's like significantly more challenging than the work that they already have to do it's just packaged differently and the last two things that was the sales work is different so in this the sales work is easy you put a link in the newsletter today and you say hey you want to read this section go check out Pro Sales work is easy content work is is about the same um but the value obviously of the sale is what matters so the other case you have to basically go and meet with head of research at some some firm some blockchain investing firm or some traditional uh you know hedge fund or whatever and you have to basically do an Enterprise sale to get them on board correct the differences and this is an advantage is that milk road is small and your burn is small so you only a couple deals two sales yeah maybe it could make a meaningful difference and you just start you start small and you start slow and I think that I could pull off you're not a VC find a company that has to grow and support you know a million dollar a month team the last two things something that has always interested me is organizational charts which sounds boring but with crypto well this is combined with two ideas but with crypto you don't always know who's behind stuff because you uh like a lot of it's just like someone's face that's a nft or something like that and you're not exactly sure who's behind it uh what I would do is I would have done org charts that explains here's who's behind each thing here's the team here's their contact information and here's the story behind it as well as our prediction of like is this like interesting or not interesting should you trust it because if you're if a bank or or a buyer or a funder of some of these companies wants to know like what's the real deal behind them it's really challenging to get a surface level or even a more than surface level view on it without doing lots of your own research so if you have data that can actually pinpoint uh this is actually legitimate it's worth diving deeper into and here's some more analysis on that or this one just is nonsense run like something like that and your customer being either a someone who wants to sell into those companies or someone who wants to fund invest or purchase something from them it kind of gives you a little bit more quantitative and qualitative information on are they worth the time do you know what I mean yeah yeah I know what you mean um that one's I I like that one I like that one less than the other ones so I think these are all good ideas I like the theme of these data driven uh like basically once you acquire this Corpus of data it just simply becomes more valuable over time it has to be updated and refreshed but it's not like new it's not new content in the same way it's building a stack of content this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better I was talking to or I was reading this post about Zoom info do you know what Zoom info is yeah it's basically just like here's everyone's email address is that the like dummy version of it yeah they're publicly traded though they do like a billion dollars in Revenue I don't know what their market cap is they're big but it's what do they provide beyond that it's basically like it's for sales people right like hey sales person here's how you do your prospecting I think the high level view is basically we have mapped out every employee at every company in America and we know like what they do we know their contact information and we know a little bit of background about the company um right and the way that they started it was the two Founders they said we spent 75 percent of our time just calling the front desk of all these companies to confirm that their phone number was correct and that was how it started then we went and got a bunch of different data sources and we combined them to make it a little bit more readable so you could have more data on different companies and then finally they created a I don't know what you call it like a viral Loop whatever it's called where people could access some of the data but they had to submit their own data and so in order to get a discounted price and that kind of created this Loop where now they have so much information on different companies how they work if you Google like a company and then Revenue you might find Zoom info that will show up but it will say like their contact information where their office is and things like that and so they started just by the two guys just phone calling and so these companies data businesses can be cool because you can brute force your way to get like a nice little MVP so anyway that's my my Spiel on milk Road I I think that I don't know the background of what the owners are doing so I could be totally off that's what I would have done instead though so here's a um tool that's pretty cool that's uh related have you ever heard of particle.com no I'm gonna go to it now though so particle just without the e so it's p-a-r-t-i-c-l.com unlock the power of driven product development uh yeah what it should say is see how much any Ecommerce store does in sales because that's what it does right that's like the layman's term like again Zoom info's like hey you want to sell [ __ ] uh we'll tell you who to reach out to and here's their email address right like they have to sort of mask it and make it sound a little fancier than it is but it's very functional very useful and similarly particle is pretty cool so what they did is um for pretty much uh all the major e-commerce Stores um they what they did is they they have a way to go to any like kind of Shopify store and estimate with fairly high confidence and it's not perfect but it's directionally correct um what that store does in sales within that what each what which SKU they uh they sell like uh you know what's the top selling top selling products bottom selling products that sort of thing and so you could do really great competitive research and market research to try to figure out where are there gaps at the market oh okay this company's doing really well but there's not a lot of competitors that also sell that product there may be an opportunity to go in there or hey um you know we're doing really well with these three products but our competitor they have this other product line that we don't have that's doing really well and so it's a cool thing that they built um using basically like seems like crawlers and scrapers to go onto an e-commerce store and sort of estimate the um the volume of uh of sales for product is not perfect it's like you know because I I looked at it for like our brand and a couple other brands of people I know and so you know the sale the exact sales number like if it says 50 million they might do actually 70 million or 60 million right it's just directionally it's directional it's like it's not 500 that they do probably um but and it's not five it's more like 50 it's more like 50. and uh but the product level stuff seems to be more accurate um where you know again relatively like product a is more popular product B by by double right no okay interesting what what is that what can we learn from that how do we and they sell this thing for like I don't know 20 grand a year um to your point because if I'm a retailer and I can be smarter about my inventory purchases um I'll bake back the 20 grand and you know one or two purchases just by just by by having this in intel if I didn't have it earlier so it kind of makes sense how these companies are able to charge so much is this company big particle yeah I think they're pretty big um I don't know too much you know you can't search them on the platform unfortunately but uh it seems like there seems like they're doing pretty well who's the owner of milk road now what are their names again Mike uh Kendall and Mike Kendall and Mike uh Bravo launching us on this clip they don't listen to podcasts they don't listen to any podcasts um and so uh like in fact when we first met him I was like yeah seconds podcast blah blah and then uh he's just like wasn't really that interested in the podcast and I was like do you listen to our pod any pod you listen to podcast he's like no why would I really understand why would I do that like um he was just like I just feel like I should just work instead of listening to other people talk about work okay oh well touche absolutely right that is what a successful person would say if you guys are listening that's what I would have done this is what I learned from launching my product on I mean we were Trends were successful but I realized we could have had two zeros at the end of our Revenue probably if we would have done things differently yeah good feedback I like it um what else you got um okay well that was amazing let's just first start with that great idea next um you know with a guy with three ideas they're getting those uh backpacking uh reps in nice yeah yeah can't stop won't stop never quit no days off you said backpacking that's what I'm gonna do because I'm a nice guy so with ideas like this I think I should be in the tech All-Star Game what's the tech All-Star Game you asked it's something I wish existed so I tweeted this out and um I think that I laid out my case for why the tech industry needs its version of the NBA All-Star Game so Tech is getting pretty big in fact somebody pointed that somebody who's not in the tech industry pointed this out to me they go yes weird I feel like Tech is the new [ __ ] everyone in Hollywood's like talking about he's like you know like the Facebook movie was dope he's like and then they came out with silica Valley HBO and they have like you know they have the Wii the wework movie they got the theranos movies they got the Uber story they got the like it's making its way more into pop culture and what happens when something gets in the movies is those Heroes become Heroes so the the protagonists in these in these things becomes like a new archetype that people want to follow and so he was pointing this out he's like I think Tech has just crossed over into this thing where the cool tech people are now popular everywhere you see this with Elon Musk Mark Zuckerberg they're like how they're household names now Jeff Bezos whereas you know I couldn't have told you who the CEO of IBM was growing up like I had no idea but it's that that's changed now so he's like you still can't name the CEO of IBM like I used to not be able to name who the CEO of IBM was I still I still can't but I at least want to know I definitely used to not be able to so I think somebody should create this I think somebody should create um a weekend event that's produced like a like the NBA All-Star weekend and get the best talent in the tech industry to compete so here's how I think you see that you're gonna have like a uh like a like the layup contest or like the base the base hit Derby no no no it's gonna be a hackathon real soon so it's a hackathon that's the main that's the main attraction that's the that's the game is a hackathon and what we'll do is each so you get you only get invited if you're like a legit awesome tech company so you go from like the top like okay Facebook you get to send a team or maybe a couple teams and but so does I don't know figma you guys have made it congratulations you get to participate in the thing and so the CEO of each company gets to recruit one engineer one designer and one marketer for their squad they get to come and they're going to compete in the weekend hackathon they got to build something awesome and they have to pitch it at the end and you get to kind of see these people actually like watch them cook a little bit like let me see you actually do work like are you creative are you interesting can you build something cool um can you sell can you pitch I want to see see that in action I think it would be a phenomenal recruiting event for companies I think it would be just a great like kind of brand Builder I think it'd be fun for these people because Mo I don't know most tech CEOs jobs are actually like just dealing with problems and not even the fun types it's not even like product problems it's like people problems and lawsuit problems and and [ __ ] like that so I think it'd be a nice diversion for people who got into this because they like to build [ __ ] and that this is how they actually started their company and I think that you the way that Elon and soccer started competing now I think it's going to open the door to more direct competition friendly competition amongst tech people and then I think you do the fun gimmick games right you have the whatever the the speed typing contest or you have who can do X while they're drunk whatever you come up with like some random ass games for other people to try as well you broadcast the whole thing and I think that like you could kind of if you had the right like if I'm I was trying to think who has the incentive to do this so none of the companies have the incentive to do this only somebody who's just like stupid like me has the incentive to do this where I'm like yeah this one I'm gonna spend my time on for the year and like I don't need money so I can just like do this and like I think the whole thing it would be profitable because you could get sponsors for the whole thing and um I think either me or somebody like um Eric tornberg I thought would be great at this because he's got a lot of great connections and he he comes from the Sports World so he like appreciates that part of it and sees that it's missing here I also think that VC funds like sort of like interested Horowitz or whoever could use this as an excuse to create like a festival or a fair that's different than a traditional boring conference so nobody's gonna do this but I think this would be a fun idea I wish this existed what's your reaction do you remember the Silicon Valley Sports League listen no what is that it was awesome it was like a wreck Sports league and um we did soccer one season another season it was flag football and it was awesome it was basically different companies would pay 10 grand per season and you could have 10 players play and it was like a really fun way to like hang out and uh you know get to know your team and like play sports and it would at the time I was at apartment list it was like apartment list versus I forget whatever company was like nearby and you like it was awesome it was really yeah it was really fun and the guys who started it used the profits to bootstrap their company and it was sick and they said they made millions of dollars from it you've not heard of that no but I'm on their website right now I don't know if you've been there in a while no look at this Banner image this might be the worst Banner image I've ever seen it's two evil looking Tech Guys pretending to play football against each other the guys holding the football not like how you would hold a football when you run first of all tiny hands and can't hold a football and the other guy looks like an absolute hyena that's actually coming to take your data and sell it and not like play sports at all this is if the artist who did this hates the tech industry they like lost their their two-bedroom Loft in San Francisco because they raised the rent so that like some tech bro could live there and now he's on the street doing art like this you just have to make it boxing though you got to get you got to get to the you got to get to the boxing I mean the YouTubers are doing it now but people aren't going to do the boxing thing like even like best case scenario is this Elon Zuckerberg thing it's also not even gonna happen it's not gonna happen they have too much to lose and it's too hard to be good at boxing you've seen this with the YouTuber thing Jake Paul actually like dropped out of life and has been like trains boxing for years to look Okay and like imagine a tech an interesting Tech person is like in their 40s or 50s typically or they're like the scrottiest 25 year old that like like spent their whole life building the thing and not working out like I just don't think it's gonna look okay I think it's gonna look really bad and sad when you watch it why don't you just do this what's holding you back I mean it's fun yeah it seems fun but I think it's a you know it's a fun idea that if I knew that I could get the right people involved maybe but you need the ape you need the a players to do this I'm not interested in apartment lists head of growth versus uh you know feed finders you know customer success guy like you know we're not doing that it needs to be Zuck and his team Elon and his team and then like you know like it needs to be like top people doing this like the Airbnb founder like that's who people would want to tune in because you don't get to meet these people you definitely don't get to see them work you only see them getting rehearsed interviews about how they started something 10 years ago or like why they're not ruining the world right now like that's the only thing that's only context we see these people in you don't really get to see them in a context that makes them likable favorable and like you know admirable are you on a roll right now should we just let you rattle these off I have three like alliterations there pretty much so yeah I thought the feet together feet finder was a gem too I was just like that was on my list as an idea but I haven't researched it somebody just told me feed finder crushes it and I go what is feed finder and they go I think it's only finder for feet and I said bookmark that we'll look more at that later is that really a Thing If you find her oh my God you're right it is yeah the safest place the safest largest easiest website to view buy and sell feet content great yeah oh my god dude this is wild Paige you're right they do killer oh wow yeah that's some home page they get four million uh yeah we'll save this for another time oh my God that is a home page uh don't go to facebook.com if you're with your family uh all right let me give you another quick one so related to my only fans and now feed finder uh curiosity Okay so Ben sent me a uh link to something called onlypage.com and page as in like the girl's name page and I thought this is kind of interesting so I go to it and it's basically only fans so there's some model named Paige and she's like hey subscribe to me and you get my content and you get all the same things as only fans but she was hosting it's that golfer the what I don't know what's her full name is she a famous athlete I have no idea I think she started as like a mediocre a mediocre coffee but she's a golfer but she's really good looking and so now she's in the news and stuff all the time for just being like this hot athlete her name is Paige S I forget her last name but something like that I mean the variety of content here you scroll down it's golf instruction and it says warming up and she's just bending over on a putting green it says the mental game and she's talking about that and then there's just bra tutorial I don't know how many guys are subscribing to watch a broad tutorial for that you know that the the bra techniques but you know this is a she knows what she's doing let me just put it this way I sent you her Wikipedia it's Paige spiranac uh so I guess she was a former professional golf player she was a division one golfer and then she just got famous for being pretty good at golf and then people were like you're very attractive and she was like I guess I should I I should lean into that one she's talking to her Mentor she's like I'm I'm pretty good at golf but I'm amazing at boobs like what if I should go with this and they're like you know what you should you should focus on your strengths and and so anyways what I thought was interesting about this is this is basically a direct consumer version of only fans it's what Shopify did so like you before Shopify it's like you could list your your products on somebody else's Marketplace Amazon Walmart whatever um so that's like one alternative you could be an Amazon Seller you put your product on Amazon Amazon is the storefront people go to Amazon they find your product that's how only fans Works people go to go to your only fans it's hosted on only fans only fans is the tech platform where you make your purchases through this is interesting somebody must have created for there must be some company behind this um or she built this herself which is a shot like a Shopify version of only fan she has her own branded domain her own store and she's handling her own customer relationship with customers so when they like for example when you sign up to somebody's only fans you don't get their email address um if they turned you could never Market back to them that way but with this theoretically she could and so I thought that's kind of interesting I wonder like Shopify turned out to be a very big deal in the like kind of like Commerce landscape clearly only fans the niche is doing you know billions of dollars a year as a product like I don't know I don't know what you would call a category um Can somebody create the Shopify for that that's kind of interesting to me um so I don't know I don't know the company behind uh her page it's called you screen so uscreen.tv the letter U and then screen dot TV and it's the all-in-one membership platform for creators to light your Die Hard fans with exclusive video content in a Vibrant Community across your own mobile app and website and on their home page they list like some YouTuber with two million subscribers they lived they list a yoga company kids are is that what it is there's kids are there's yoga there's like some German guy there's like a pregnancy blog [Laughter] she's like they're big she's definitely best selling yeah so she's so it's a company that's doing it and it looks like she just found like a course creator company and was like or a Porsche platform yeah yeah yeah she's like yeah we're gonna do that we're gonna go ahead and just only pay 300 a month uh this is interesting their thing says 150 million earned by creators each year that's pretty interesting that's uh that's not like a small number they say they have nine million end users so like members on the other side of the the content yeah and so I never heard of this have you ever heard of this no I've never heard of it and it looks like they're killing it because they just made maybe some policy changes that would not allow like kajabi or something to like uh appeal to that type of creator but it's smart so if you click their leadership team they have a big team it's a it must be a big company they have got a huge team it looks like they have a 50 to 150 employees so it must be working and if you look them up you can't find any funding information about them the company might be killing it and we just dude I want to make a Chrome extension that's just called the honesty filter and it just changes the website homepage to like say what it actually does like uh you know like they should just say monetize your body yeah with less fees than only fans yeah and like you know the the zoom info get people's email address and spam them like you know these are like what these companies actually do but if you go like if I go to zoom info what does it say so the guy who started it his name's PJ it looks like he on his LinkedIn he says they're north of 20 million in an ARR they're bootstrapped and it's based out of Washington DC this is a legit company and before that he had a web hosting so uh anyway this guy this thing is bootstrapped is that what you said yeah that's what his LinkedIn says yeah so they're probably doing they probably take like I want to say five to ten percent of this so maybe something like 10 to 15 million a year in uh in revenue for them yeah and he says that he's killing it it says in his LinkedIn it's over 20 million in ARR it says fast growing and profitable bootstrap SAS business revolutionizing the way that video based entrepreneurs make men get off as it says so yeah PJ I thought you got to turn the Chrome extension off oh yeah we got you there so kudos to PJ like Chrome extension is called true that and you can find it in the Chrome Store that's a side hustle uh good job PJ at unscreen I don't see Paige on their home screen I don't know why I wouldn't see that she's it has four million followers on Instagram you got a guy on here with in the front page with 1.8 on on YouTube we got to put Paige on there but that's what she's using so her name's Paige Sarah Nick or something like well maybe with your new uh body I don't know maybe you screen ice cream we all scream for Samsung you know what I'm saying yeah and uh Paige what's up uh that's a joke my wife who's listening that's a joke uh but I do see that Paige is recently divorced according to a Wikipedia uh no I'm just joking she's like a nine I'm a four that won't ever work out unless and we could figure out a way um yeah on screen or you screen whatever it is good job kudos to you guys they're taking the business of people who don't want to uh deal with these people I don't know why more people don't do this I guess you have to have a really big uh I mean you need a big audience Pages four million uh Instagram followers but does only fans even drive audience do they drive a significant amount no they don't they intentionally don't drive Discovery so it's kind of like Shopify anyways you promote yourself they're your storefront but the thing is it'd be like if every Shopify store was on was called shopify.com store name and if you couldn't collect your you know the the the emails or phone numbers of your customers so you couldn't like you know sell more products to them or whatever it's all done through their through their platform yeah and you screen advertises that they have like a community platform I don't think I want to be part of that Community but just the paywall part might be worth it so if you're a Creator I'd be like yeah I'll accept their money but I don't want to like you know I don't want to like talk to them on a regular basis that'd be weird um yeah that's a good find Where Do We Go From Here I think that's it I think we wrap it up all right well that's their line by the way uh really quick uh that's the pod that's the Pod I know I I wanted to tell you something really quick um I just got a text while we were recording from Jason yanowitz at block work singles today I got asked to leave the bank because I was laughing so hard at the at Sean's Taco Bell story they were like sir could you please leave your call outside because I had headphones in it was laughing so loud so so loud uh I said yeah yeah no you need to listen to this podcast and they were like sir what are you talking about uh Well story everyone just taking off his airpods and played it out loud for the entire Bank to here it's like oh you got to hear the story that shot tell us about making eye contact with the guy who's farting at a Taco Bell uh and can I please deposit 500 uh no apparently that was a hit a lot of people like that Taco Bell story congratulations you should uh do more uncomfortable things I um I went and replied to a bunch of the comments on YouTube um if it comes from the the channel name that's me um so I wouldn't reply to a bunch of them because I had said like we read and reply to every comment I know people got mad at you we read all the comments now there's a lot like there's 700 comments per episode which is a lot to reply to I did it for one and I was like okay I can't go do that for the next one so I think it's going to be kind of like I reply to I read all of them and reply to I don't know a hundred each time uh because it's it's now getting I read all of them I read all of them and a lot of them they got mad at us for uh being they called us all a bunch of cucks for liking Zuck they said you're zucks [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] Army what's up we have tattoos on the inside of our wrist dude isn't it crazy that whenever whatever whatever sucks working out that Zuck is now on the liberal side of this stuff somehow we're like you know left of center because we like Zuckerberg that's so funny that he's Fawn like on that side of this argument uh yeah yeah but yeah I don't get it they got mad at us but anyway that's the Pod we'll read all the comments that's the part [Music] thank you

Mark Cuban he actually got his first like two or three million dollars of wealth when he was 31 because he started this thing called micro solution it's basically the I.T agency so like if a company was like implementing Oracle he would help install it on everyone's computer and then teach people how to use it he goes the reason my company was successful wasn't because I necessarily was an expert on this stuff I was the only one who read the manual and I would just learn how does this HP computer work and the next day I could go talk to a business owner and say yeah we can install that thing and that's all I did and it was hard work and I stayed up all night reading these things but that's how I became an expert in the stuff I just read the manual which no one does

but there's a funny tweet from um Parker I think it's Parker Thompson on Twitter he he replied to that he goes okay so for those Cupid score at home Elon Elon brought a bought a product for 44 billion and then Zuck built the same product for a thousand times less is stealing all of his users like an absolute Chad it is God willing about to choke him out in 90 seconds on a steel cage soon huh so that's what a cuff means now [Music] laughs all right what's up today's episode we're talking about threads versus Twitter the big debate and we're gonna talk about where we where we land our predictions for what you think is going to happen how it's going to play out um we told her some funny stories and then in the second half we have a uh an interview with a guy named Sam of it so Sam met Sam met this guy Sam he used to run a business called consulting.com that at its peak hit 30 million in Revenue he was all over our Facebook feeds as kind of like one of these internet marketer guys and so we were curious like who is this guy and what's he all about um definitely an interesting interview I would say uh he had some interesting stuff to say also his energy was totally different than most of the guests and also different than what you would expect out of an Internet marketer so I'm curious to see what people think of it um I would say it's you know sort of like a a different style of energy than we've done before Sam what do you think uh so for those watching on YouTube I'm sweating right now the reason I'm sweating is around minute 35. I can't stop laughing I'm still laughing about it you're gonna enjoy it the Taco Bell story let's just leave it at that oh my God it's ridiculous uh I don't know like how this story came about in a business pod I'm happy it did I'm sweating right now if you are on Spotify or apple and you're listening to this go to our YouTube page uh search my first million go to this episode let us know in the comments what you think people liked when we did that the last time Sean we got a lot of comments a lot of good feedback it's it's uh we actually it's been fun to read all the comments but let us know what you think we'll talk to you soon all right what's up um Sam we gotta talk about threads threads versus Twitter it uh threads came out a few days ago we've had a few days to play with it to sit on it to think about it and um I think everybody's given their opinion on it and why not ours I want to hear what you get what you have to say about this I have a I have a I have kind of like a way I think we could talk about this the what I'm calling the Bull and Bear case or the bull case the bear case and then where we land but I first just want to hear like I don't know when did you get on it and what was your kind of initial reaction how on your radar was this thing to begin with I had only heard about it three or four days before it launched and I heard about it because of a leak I think there was a leak right there somehow it leaked out that it was coming out so I downloaded the app like the you can download it before it launched and then I got the notification right at midnight or whenever it said it launched and I signed up I think it's pretty cool are you jealous that I already have more followers than you do on that because I was already going hard on Instagram no well yeah yeah going hard on Instagram paid off there uh you got like a like a double bonus for for growing your Instagram so so Props to you on that um I think it's great you know why I think it's great I really only think it's great for one reason which is Twitter to me is pretty great but dude my feed is just like fight videos and people getting shot and dying like it's real it's kind of become a little bit sad that's unusual I also I don't know anyone else's fault just follow button and the like button and the save button the algorithm will just give you more look here's the deal if you see like a fight video you watch it like you're not not gonna watch that it's like when you have a hot girl that like Scrolls through like you you slow you scroll slower does this get here all right yeah so it's just all these weird handles I also think that I've I've become such a stand for Zuck and this whole thing he's just proven to be like the man he's he's come off very likable and so I find myself picking sides based off of the owner of the company yeah yeah it's become it's become Sports it's become tribal whose team are you on and I don't know how the hell I ended up team Zuck but I'm like I'm on team suck it's very obvious to me it's very clear I think this guy's done an incredible Rebrand of his personality because he went from like easy to hate for a bunch of reasons one becomes rich and powerful people don't like that um two he looked like a robot talk like a robot seem to have no personality so you know that was you know again like for the people who didn't get turned off by the power and billionaire thing they got turned off by like okay this guy's a lizard or he's a robot like what's going on with this guy um and then somehow it's you know he hired the top top PR agencies in the world he hired the fixer the wolf came in and tried to fix him all he needed to do was start working out the guy guy takes 10 Jiu Jitsu classes and learns how to do a pull-up and all of a sudden idiots like us are like you know what I [ __ ] with this guy yeah he's relatable somehow yeah it totally worked on me and then to the point where you start thinking about it this happened also with LeBron James LeBron James at one point was he was super hyped then he became the guy and then people started to turn on him then he did this thing where he left his team went to Miami and everyone's like oh I hate this guy and then somebody's pointing out they're like so you're telling me this kid who had all the pressure in the world uh when he was 17 18 years old delivered on the hype lived up to it never got in trouble with the law you've never heard about this guy you know married his high school sweetheart is a good dad to his kids um you know is is one of the best players of all time and just like keeps himself in phenomenal Fitness and shape and tries as hard as he can every single year what do you have a problem with and in the same way I feel like the same that's happened for Zuck where it's like so this guy who built this company that billions of people use stuck with the company he's he works hard every single day um you know married uh you know his college sweetheart uh never been in trouble with anything doesn't tweet out offensive stuff doesn't say anything just to get a reaction uh seems like a perfectly reasonable guy works out hard is a good dad like what do you hate about this guy again what's going on do you know how old Zuck is I don't know he's like our age he's like he's a little older than us right he's like 37 38 39. yeah he's he just turned 39 you know in Lebron also 38. these guys are the same man they're the same they've been dude they were 18 yeah yeah LeBron got drafted what he was a high schooler right at high school Zach has been the man since he was 21 or 22. there's been nothing I mean there's been like if you look the grand scheme it's there's been no like human uh errors no no no no self yeah there's been like business heirs that have been cringed but there's been nothing that they've done where you're like oh that guy's a piece of [ __ ] because crime is cringe you're doing all right yes when you're the man for that long that is impossible that is so challenging to do that uh you know what I mean so we're clearly Zuck Fanboys let's talk about threads though um oh and by the way did you see what Elon posted I don't know did you see it on Twitter he goes Zuck is a [ __ ] you know what a [ __ ] is yeah yeah uh I had to look it up actually a cuck is a guy who wants his wife to sleep with other men and he like enjoys it uh and then he also goes I challenge Zuck to a dick measuring contest literally a dick measuring contest like he says stuff like that and I'm dude he says stuff like that I'm like oh my God you're he's an absolute tryhard to me uh don't don't like it it says uh whether there's a footy tweet from um Parker I think it's Parker Thompson on Twitter he he replied to that he goes okay so for those keep it score at home Elon Elon brought a bought a product for 44 billion and then Zuck built the same product for a thousand times less is stealing all of his users like an absolute Chad it is God willing about to choke them out in 90 seconds on steel cage soon huh so that's what a cuff means now [Laughter] that's great man Zuck is just looking great on this all right so by threads you have on here that they grew to 70 million it's actually 100. it's a hundred so they grew to 100 million users in a week so we'll deliver the bull case first so the bull case is this uh will and the will threads win um argument so the bull case is we're five days in and they've reached 100 million users making it the fastest growing product of all time okay um Instagram has about a billion and a half users they seem to be converting over pretty quickly to this we already got 100 million on the platform if 20 of Instagram's users come on board it's now bigger than Twitter so 20 conversion from from Instagram is what they're going to need they've done you know I don't know five percent or something like that I don't know public math something like five percent so far in five days um the next reason that this is bullish is Instagram and shared that on threads he said um he goes he said we just hit 100 million and he said we've not even really promoted it yet yeah we haven't even done our promotions yet which is yes nice it's also really cool that he's revealing some of the stuff yeah yeah he's really active on it right now he's part Victory lap part like Community engagement which is which is cool um and he tweeted for the first time in like 15 years right on the daily launch which was which was also nice and it was like the meme of the three Spidermans pointing at it it was pretty it was great he you know he's in on the gym whoever he hired like his nephew or whoever like just is like yo give me their give me your app give me your phone I'm Gonna Make You likable um like hey instead of like fighting it just post a meme it's cool don't worry but he needs a verb so there's no verd what do you say you threaded it you you posted it yeah you know what I mean yeah we're threading I don't know what's going on so the the interesting part is I'll go on threads and I expect to see the same sorts of people on as I do on Twitter and there's some but there's a whole new market of people who were basically never on Twitter just didn't like Twitter didn't work for them and so um so you know you get a whole new set of people that are going to use threads that weren't they don't have to switch off of Twitter they're just new people to a Twitter like Behavior so it can basically beat Twitter without getting people to switch because it's expanding the market Twitter is I don't know if you know this Twitter is basically the most abandoned product I think ever so more than a billion people have signed up for Twitter or tried Twitter and they've been like no I don't get it I'm good just yeah that's not for me another the big question the like sort of like the 100 billion dollar 200 billion dollar question is is that because the idea of Twitter doesn't appeal to that many people or that Twitter's execution was not good enough to hook those people and if it's the idea then those same people who try threads will eventually bounce because they're like they're just people who like to look at pictures and videos they don't want to write text and read random ass text messages from different people so if it's the idea that Twitter's safe all these people will try it and they'll bounce but if it was the execution if it was that Twitter didn't hook them properly then they're screwed because if there's one thing that that the Instagram and Facebook teams are going to do well is they're going to execute you can already see it in the small things that they're doing where they're like yeah we're just gonna make like kind of like the feed work better and blocking and muting and like all of the like all of the stuff we're just gonna do the stuff good the stuff that they've been doing for 20 years which is like hey when somebody signs up let's just make it really easy for them to find like their friends or interesting people for them and like let's just make this this feed killer like this would make this algorithm killer where you just want to keep scrolling stuff that Twitter never really did like if you go look at Twitter's ad product like have you ever run Twitter ads yeah so this is what I was gonna say this is another uh bull case which is if you if if you've never run ads before and you go talk to anyone who has run any ads Facebook is always in the top two or three parts of the conversation so normally it's number one it's usually the best platform I've spent maybe 10 plus million dollars of my own uh like me actually running ads Facebook is always number one Twitter is never part of the conversation I don't know if I don't even know if it's any I don't know if it's like that anymore because I haven't run ads I run ads on it now so I'm running ads on it literally right now and uh it works but the ad platform is so trash compared to Facebook and Google's ad platform which is so surprising because that's how they make money you would think they're highly incentivized to do it so anyways I guess my my bigger point is not really about whose ad platform's gonna be better it's just but that matters it's going to be execution on all the details on getting people linked up with the right people making the feed super interesting and you know and handling spam better and abuse better and all the things that Twitter has struggled with over over the years so the poll case is basically this 100 million users if they convert some of Instagram people they'll be bigger than Twitter they don't even need people from Twitter to switch they can just bring net new people to the market and that um and they can just continue to promote this across Instagram and WhatsApp so that's the Bold case um now I'm going to switch to the to the bear case oh also part of the bull case Twitter shoots itself in the foot a lot so Elon does a lot of dumb [ __ ] pisses a lot of people off they um he's basically pushing to like basically put a paywall where like you have to pay eight dollars a month in order to like have your [ __ ] be seen in the in the feed so that's basically introducing friction he added the Tweet limit not long ago which introduces friction because oh you know she's insane no more tweets for you uh cut off like the ability to post tweets and have them in bed in other places because he was like oh we're getting scraped too much so you basically put a login wall in front of the content like he's adding friction everywhere so these are these are footfalls these are you know nobody this is not threads killing you this is you killing you and so that's that's part of the bookcase now here's the bear case why this won't work if I was to argue why this won't work here's what I would say I'd say um hey made the last Facebook Standalone product that just worked not one that they bought the one that they made and that's where there's really a kind of a graveyard of poke and a bunch of these other apps that they tried to create they tried to create a tick tock competitor it didn't work they're trying to create a Snapchat competitor it didn't work so there is a graveyard of these things the only things that have worked up and things that they put into the Instagram app like stories and reels um because people are hooked on Instagram so the Standalone app thing hasn't really worked and this is a standalone app the next problem just because 100 million people try it doesn't mean they're actually going to stick there's going to be massive churn just like there is have you gone back yeah I I open it up right now but like I'm not like hooked on it uh completely myself yet are you I'm not hooked yet no I'm definitely not okay on Twitter but I've also built up like a big following plus a bunch of people that I follow so my feed is more interesting on Twitter yeah I was curated for 10 years I was gonna say we might be the one percent the one per percent because we make a living in part because of Twitter and so we could be like there could be a part of it of like ah [ __ ] I don't want to use this other thing because I already have this one thing that's working and this thing is just kind of like cannibalize it so I can't tell if there's that bias there or or what it is but no I'm not hooked yet but I am opening it uh maybe once a day maybe once every two days I am a little bit like [ __ ] I don't want another thing to have to use uh but I am happy that it's text based because that's where I excel because you know I'm a Missouri six but uh like nine yeah I don't want I'm not like I'm not I don't I got the I got a good face for Twitter uh so like I prefer that but yeah we we're the outliers because both of us have I know the other we probably have almost almost a million followers together on on Twitter and so going now I go to try I have three thousand followers or something I'm starting from scratch again and you know I'm like that guy who I've moved to San Francisco and I bought a house and I just redid my lawn and then everybody started moving and they started raising the prices and I'm like I'm I'm dug in I'm like yeah I'm Duggan I already paid for the Renault uh you know like I guess I'm just here what everyone else is is choosing places that might be a better fit so you know we we might be the wrong person there here's the other reasons that Twitter might win Twitter after the churn uh you know threads might have 20 million or 30 million uh active users compared to Twitter's 300 million right so I think there's gonna be so much churn that this 100 million number is a bit of Fool's Gold the next thing Twitter has key content so it has news it has Sports so it's got the journalist it's got the athletes it's got the the people that cover the NBA in the NFL like it's got famous people it's Casey got like this key like rapid breaking news and influential content um threads is gonna have new content but like the type of person who's big on IG may not be the right type of person for what works in this text Medium we don't TBD there's a TBD on that the next thing threads is just a straight up clone there are no product improvements and in fact there's some big drawbacks like they don't have DMS they don't have like you know uh dude I get DMS I've been getting DMs I think I don't know what they're called there's no inbox people have been messaging me let me pull it up but I think they're at mentioning you there's there's definitely no no maybe that's what it is I don't even know how to use it yet then yeah it's it's a it's a mention but it looks like a DM like the the thing looks like a DM all right yeah you're right so it's just they cloned the app but they left some things out now that might that might make it better but uh for the most part I would say the product strategy like if you've printed out the road map so I hear some features and you turn the page and it just says not Elon Musk not Twitter right like it's just basically here's not Twitter and like there's a bunch of people who don't like Elon don't like Twitter and they'll just try this out so I don't know if that's a great long-term product strategy um by the way speaking of mediums and leaving things out do you use Twitter on your phone or desktop both yeah I mostly use it on desktop and I use the thread app and I was like Hey when's when I need a desktop thing and that's why I prefer typing on it and people were like call me Boomer and [ __ ] and apparently that is that's some Boomer [ __ ] dude that's some Boomer [ __ ] I guess but I hate using it on my phone I want to use it on my computer so I could scroll through and click [ __ ] yeah that's like if a guy knocks on the bathroom stalls like hey I gotta take a piss sitting down and you're like what it's not illegal to do what you're saying but certainly not acceptable and that's yeah you're more of a what are you more of a P with your shorts down at your ankle type of guy while standing up so so your your desktop thing yeah it's okay to use desktop but let's not let's not get out of control I think most I not most I think a ton of people do that man I'm telling you the older guys I guess I'm old now but I need it I I need it that's who we should appeal to as a social media platform the older guys um yeah we'll call it khaki all right so here's here's a couple other things which is uh the best creators on Twitter so the people who have basically earned a 10 15 year period proven that they're really good at creating text-based content now have a big following and don't really want to start over from scratch on on Instagram aka me yeah so so I think those are some of the some of the downsides of this um but I do think you know once you take into account the bull in the bear case it's prediction time how do you think that this plays out well you have to let's do the interesting nuggets really quick if it doesn't work out Nikita our friend Nikita who is worked at meta and did all the social stuff what did he say uh he was basically like you know this thing's gonna be at 100 million users soon and if it fails after that that will sort of officially make it the biggest fail in social app history at that point which I think I don't think that really means anything to be honest I think the truth is I think it's going to end up closer to the Bowl than it is the bear I think it will it will more work than it does fail I don't think Elon would ever sell Twitter out of like Pride reasons but I think it will if it weren't run by a billionaire I think it would effectively put it out of business uh for the ad ad purposes um I think it's gonna I think it's gonna work I don't know if it will overtake but I think it's gonna work so good that it's got a cannibalize Twitter and it's they're going to be at least equal the CEO of cloudflare tweeted out a chart I don't know if you saw this of Twitter traffic because cloudflare has like Canada they run like that's [ __ ] up right in some way um it's yeah I don't know I don't know maybe they haven't paid their bill or maybe there's like a doctor that's like a doctor like revealing like your illnesses isn't it it's like it's like these two guys are making fun of each other it's like actually this guy his cholesterol is way worse than yours right yeah so like if you want to beat them up but kick them in the left knee [Laughter] yeah he did that basically he tweeted out showing that this uh that Twitter's down like five percent in overall traffic so far this week um from from thread so it's like you know he said like it's uh plummeting or something like that like dropping off a cliff which is like pretty dramatic for I don't know five percent I wouldn't call plummeting but um that's weird that he shared that that's super weird yeah uh yeah I I I I it's going to be closer to the bowl I and whatever I've learned Nikita actually would always joke about this he would say never ever ever bet against Zuck and I've heard so many people say that when I bet against Elon for sure uh not often not often I think that he follows through a lot he's just been closer to death so many times and I don't think Zuck entirely has uh I just think that Zuckerberg when it comes to this field a consumer social I just think that he's I would not bet against that person yeah exactly I think that's the that's the rub here I think that um it's not Zuck versus Elon mono imano like they are like in the same way that in the cage Zuck will probably win because he trains he's been training Jiu Jitsu for like you know a couple years so that's it gives him a little Head Start um in the same way that Zuck probably could not build a rocket company or a car company you're playing you can even build Oculus like he couldn't even like do that everywhere it's doing pretty well to be honest um it's doing okay but I think that they're gonna miss they're not gonna be like the one perhaps we'll see but I guess like it's his domain so the social app thing is is their domain they have Instagram I think I'm with you I land where I do think threads will be bigger than Twitter I don't think it kills Twitter I just think it sort of stunts whatever slow growth that Twitter has it just stunts it even further and Twitter remains this kind of niche this basically this thing that has really strong appeal to a niche and I think that threads becomes the more mainstream version of it like I think it becomes the more palatable just cool interesting thing in the same in the same way that like this happens a lot with music or with uh TV shows or with with stuff like that where something has its time and then the new thing comes out and it's just has like a little more mainstream appeal and it just becomes the default and the other thing does it die doesn't go away necessarily but um but I do think that if you fast forward two years or 18 to 24 months I think it's pretty I think my bet would be threads is bigger than Twitter and Twitter basically has now like a ceiling on its head that is bumping into it can never really grow from there it might get better at monetizing those people or preventing them from switching but the dominant place for that will be will be threads which is insane to me it seemed impossible like to Dethrone a social network like 12 months ago there's this cultural shift with young people where there's so much more kind and nicer than our generation when we were that age and you see that in Tick Tock so if you go to tick tock and you look at the comments people are so much more positive uh there's still something they're not more positive that's Tick Tock is amazing at sorted comments and hiding comments whatever whatever that is okay maybe maybe because all you build is kindness and jokes and then you're like Ah that's how I'm supposed to behave here and Twitter right it builds a culture whereas on Twitter I post something and I get made fun of so much sometimes and I always click on the accounts and it's clearly like a bot or I don't know what it is but there's this huge underground culture I have no idea how this is happening of people who all they do is make fun of make fun of people and I always it shows it to me do you get that when people are making fun of you all the time yeah yeah it just shows you everything Twitter says it shows you everything you said something here's what they said back and guess what there's always going to be people that either disagree argue or just say mean [ __ ] to you that's like you know just that's actually the way the world works the best companies have figured out how how to algorithmically like suppress that behavior yes and when the day I opened up threads it was like garyvee saying like I hope you all have such a wonderful day and it was like they like seeded it with like these positive people and it like created this weird culture where it seems significantly more positive so if you open up threads like good morning y'all yeah I have like pomp saying like I hope you have a wonderful day and get after it uh like it's just so much and I have sahil already popping up on my [ __ ] it's like all positivity whereas Twitter it's way more negative and honestly it does wear me out and by the way Zuck has sort of said this in his in his threads where he's like uh yeah that's part of our key strategy he's like he's like I always thought there should be a a sort of like this town square conversation public conversation type product that gets to a billion users Twitter for some reason never figured it out we're gonna do our best and then people are like you know uh oh I noticed this place is like you know more kind or sort of like you know much more positive energy right now and he goes yeah I think that's really important um that's what we're gonna you know that's something we're gonna really focus on and try to get right I don't think that Twitter ever got that right and um some of these features like setting the culture in that way are invisible they're not like now you can do live video now you could use Twitter spaces it's not a feature that you see it's almost what you don't see that's the feature and I think that Facebook and Instagram have a lot of experience fighting abuse spam hateful content and it's not gonna be nowhere it's not it's going to be gone like that whatever that's fine I get that but I think they're going to do a better job of it in the same way that like you remember it used to be a common thing people say which is like if you ever want to see sort of Hell on Earth go to the YouTube comments like YouTube comments were considered like an actual cesspool and now if you go to a popular YouTube video the comments are often like they add to the joke they're funny and they're positive and I don't know what they did over time but over time they fixed that problem which was that the YouTube comments were like you know where you know hope goes to die and now uh it's good it's part of the experience I'm sure there's some spam or there's still obviously like the one-off thing but it's nowhere near where it was like in the early days I went out to dinner last night I'm uh in Williamsburg I went out to dinner last night and I you know Williamsburg everything's tight in New York and I sat next to this guy who worked at meta on the threads team and I'm not going to reveal a lot because I don't want to write this guy out but me and Sarah were out to dinner and like I texted her I was like just let's just not talk and we just listened to this guy we just listened to this guy talk for two hours about launch week and like what it was like and he was like it was the most exciting time of my career this guy was so bought in to like the threads movement he even was talking about how much money he was making it was crazy man I was just a dish what'd you hear you don't have to say the person but tell us everything it was it was seven figures a year it was seven figures this guy and like I feel like I know all about this guy kind of know where he's from um or at least I know where he moved from I heard the very the very typical this is so funny you hear people say it's all the time when they first moved to New York or when they're like Tech guys they say uh San Francisco was all about what have you built lately New York it's all about how much money do you make you know you're reminded every time about how important money is San Francisco it's all about what you build like that's like such are you saying it in a positive way it's refreshing that my pay stub delivers uh but he was just talking about like he was like the launch and he was just saying like how the morale the company is really high and how everyone was pumped which is which is something Facebook needed because it was pretty shitty for a long time with all the negative PR um and he was just talking all about like the launch and like what they were doing it was so fascinating it would just sit there I'm shocked that he didn't like catch the hit that I was just like listening to this old conversation I just heard everything hey if there's one thing uh that Facebook Engineers don't have a lot of awareness dude I don't think you noticed that you weren't talking to your wife you ever um go out to dinner and like if you're with like a business associate or like a successful friend and you talk about money uh you're talking about like you know like I want to buy this house it costs as much money or like this is what I'm earning what do you think I should do with it whatever we talk about these sensitive topics whenever the waitress or waiter comes over I always quit talking about that because I'm like that's embarrassing it's tacky they didn't get that hit and so I remember them talking about I remember them they they said the seven figure thing it's like yeah it's not that big of a deal you just go get like a director or a startup and get a you know a million dollar package and that's okay but like are you really doing anything meaningful right as the woman was like waiting to see if they wanted dessert yeah and I remember seeing that I was like oh I hate that that is so [ __ ] embarrassing and obnoxious you gotta shut up at that point that's when you you know you're like you got to lower your voice you gotta whisper a million you know what I mean like that that's what you're supposed to do in that scenario but these guys did not catch that hit I hate that yeah yeah there's a little PC that dies inside every time you know who sucks at that is whenever I'm with our friends Suli Suli is horrible at that is we talk about [ __ ] yes we'll talk about like you know about like what he's investing in so loudly and I'm like dude shut the [ __ ] up this is embarrassing everyone's looking over you don't don't use that word million please I don't have any more of those conversations I haven't seen that um but I've I have another friend that does it like crazy and then I'll be like hey I'm like kicking them under the table and he'll just be like what why are you kicking me I'm like dude I'm a friend that we took to this place um in San Francisco that I guess has like the best hot chocolate if he likes Hot Chocolate so we're like dude you're a little baby for liking hot chocolate first of all but if you are a baby that likes Hot Chocolate you got to go to this place has the best hot chocolate so we go sits at the bar bartender comes up or whatever like the table whatever and it's like hey uh this guy loves hot chocolate and we told him this is the best spot so he had to he had to try it and he's like the waiter was like what are you for yeah he's like oh cool yeah yeah let me bring you one so he brings one out that takes a step uh immediately gives like an audible like Ugh what and then it doesn't like it and so we're like oh you know whatever okay guess it's not I don't know guess not your your way uh your your type and so he just puts he just he puts it down right so it's sitting in front of him uh waiter walks by and he just sh like pushes it forward towards the uh almost like he's pushing his chips all in at like a poker table and the guy's like oh are you are you done and he's like you didn't like it he goes no it's not very good oh my God that's so embarrassing accomplish here why are you doing this so I literally just fall off my stool and crawl away and die and uh you know that had to deal with this interaction but it was terrible I had a friend we went out and got dinner and afterwards they gave us coffee and we wanted decaf and the next day we texted back and forth we're like hey did you stay up all night last night and they were like yeah I was like I think they gave us regular coffee he's like I gotta call them I gotta call them and let them know and he was like insistent like he's like I gotta call them and so we like call them I'm like dude what what's what are you doing we're on vacation like we're visiting like what that's such a weird it was such a Larry David move to like call someone to tell them you made a mistake last night you gave us a normal coffee instead of decaf and I those types of people are very challenging for me it's like uh likable and adorable and uh when anybody else in real life does it it's just hateable my my mother-in-law has a version of that where anytime we're complaining about something her go-to is not even like tell them and call them she's like call the news channel five they they will investigate this it's really nice dude I can't stand that it's really not what's gonna happen here I've ordered a steak before and they've brought me pesto chicken pizza and I won't say a word I'm like so this is um this is I can't decide I wanted to do a segment called L of the week because I think we sometimes brag a lot on here if we say you know how we're so great and all these boys I think it'd be nice to share a big L that we took but I got to be honest this might actually be a dub this might not even be an L because the experience was so important all right so I go I'm feeling I'm doing something I'm working whatever and I'm feeling hungry while I was driving back from an errand and I'm like I'm hungry I'm just gonna pick up some food real quick so I go to uh Subway and I'll get a sandwich and uh I go to Subway I walk in there's like five people in line there's only one guy working and it's a black guy and there's a white guy checking out and I'm like thinking about what sandwich I'm gonna get and I kind of decide I noticed that that guy's still checking out and I look over and I'm like what's taking this guy forever and these guys are talking about like it's like so we're South Africa he's like yeah they're talking about Africa and talking about race it's about race relations and they're just talking and like zero like I'm happy that there's whatever no racism on Earth but I'd really like a sandwich right now and so with the four people about that meatball marinara yeah exactly yeah red that's the color of my meatball that I like right now um and so they're just talking and then they [ __ ] they hug and I'm like what's going on right now and when they hug I lose it I leave I walk out and I'm like I'm hungrier than ever because I've just killed nine minutes here exclusively about a sandwich and I got teased there's no sandwich coming right next to the subway is a Taco Bell and I make a business decision I say it is I guess it is what it is I'm going to Taco Bell today I haven't been to Taco Bell like 13 years going to Taco Bell so I walk into Taco Bell and I'm in line I'm and you could always I have this theory about places which is you could see your future when you go into a place because it's you're gonna end up if you go to a place regularly enough you're gonna start looking like the people that that are in that place so sometimes I'll go to a like a fitness class and I'll look around and be like all right if people who are like the clear regulars here don't look the way I want to look I'm just gonna leave now because this is this is not a good path right it's like a good life yeah would you what you see and talk about like a bunch of like Tweety Bird shirts so I go to First everybody to talk about was under 17. so I was like oh I get it their body can like still tolerate this I'm the only guy in his 30s at this place so I'm I'm and there's one guy sitting there and he's probably like 28. and he's sitting down and it's just him and he's got a feast in front of him like this guy he was like Hey Omakase Chef's Choice bring it all out so he's Omakase that Taco Bell and he's sitting there he's eating up a storm and there's only me these three teen girls who are in front of me ordering and then this guy it is kind of quiet in Taco Bell as I'm standing in line and this guy pulls a move that I I I'm still stunned just thinking about this he's sitting there in Taco Bell eating his feast and he just rips the loudest fart and we all look over I'm like wow so embarrassing this guy just farted aloud in public wow it was almost like he's sitting on one of those benches it like echoed it was like this crazy auditory experience and I look at the guy and he just stares back at all of us and he's just raised his eyebrows like what we're all here like you're also here at 3 P.M on a Tuesday and that is what it is this guy did not back down he didn't have an hour and shame he outfit us and was just he literally was like what and I was like nothing I guess just carry on you're right we're all equals here you just got Dutch oven by a Taco Bell guy it was like a l I took and a big dough for this guy but I just it's an experience when did that happen this is like five days ago I've been sitting on the store there's no one else I could really tell like uh I started to tell the story to my wife and she was like you went to Taco Bell and I was like you're missing the point of the whole story and I didn't even get to the good part and I just thought you should have farted back at him I wish I had one in the chamber I didn't I mean he really just like laid it down right there in front of us and what did the girl say the eye contact nobody said anything we all look to laugh at him and then we just got stunned by his bravado holy [ __ ] this is the biggest power moment I've ever experienced that's the past how was the food at least horrible honestly the food to talk about is phenomenal uh like the taste of Taco Bell is great it is a great taste they got like the menu I mean first of all the Innovation you've been to a Taco Bell like you know Taco Bell used to be tacos it's not like it's like this dude it's just the same [ __ ] Doritos let's become a taco now it's a taco inside of a burrito and it's like how's the taco inside the burrito and you're like that's we call it a Cheesy Gordita Crunch and then they had like this thing called the volcano right now and I was like I guess just give me the volcano because I didn't even know what to do there I was like I don't really understand what's happening I'm Still Still reeling from what just happened a few minutes ago and I I got the volcano thing it was great it was fantastic you should have brought that African guy over to get it let them sniff up America let them see what this is what we're about bro come on peace love and happiness is that hug [ __ ] that's not what it is that's not the usual experience this this is the reason this is why this is the world war back-to-back Champions because guys like that salt of the earth they don't make them like that like that anymore can you imagine a European doing that impossible no possible no from Singapore never you get arrested for that ticket for it yeah yeah that's like that's like five to twenty in Singapore that's not a chance foreign I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets serve dueling databases HubSpot grow better so Sean I've got a funny story so we have Sam Evans today I'll do a little bit of an intro but about three or four years ago I used to see Sam's ads everywhere and it was basically him in a bright blue blazer in his fancy apartment overlooking Manhattan and there was a little bit of hate in me and there was a little bit of uh you had slick back hair too I remember he had slick black hair yeah and for some reason he pissed me off and I wrote like on one of the ads like you're full of [ __ ] or something like that you did a hater comment I did a hater comment and it's sat it'd be for years and I talked to my friends who eventually bought some of his products and they're like oh no it's awesome we loved it and I started learning more and I was like I think I was wrong and so I sent Sam this message I think 18 or 24 months ago and I was like I'm sorry that was for some reason that one comment it bothered me and eventually I saw Sam four weeks ago at a party at Sophia's party and I talked to him and my wife and I talked to him for like an hour and I was like you're you're one of the more fascinating people that I've ever spoke to and I was like did you get that email where I apologize I said I got it so that's kind of like how we got here but Sam what um how do you describe yourself you had consulting.com which was like a big information business but you have a new thing uh you want to you want to tell us uh how you described yourself sure um well I'm an entrepreneur um and I have a software company called school I'm CEO of that and it's it's like a community platform for creators you're you're kind of understanding yourself there eh what do you want me to say the reason why I like to get out with you is Sean he reminds me of Jack Smith so much like it's the same type of like yeah the funny thing is like Jack um you're right uh there's like definitely like a uh an echo of Jack there but Jax I almost feel like Jack picked business models that suited his uh like personality and his like way of thinking um whereas Sam the funny thing is that when I discovered you like Sam I saw um this sort of like uh outgoing persona it's like guy who's you know recording a selfie video of himself in his fancy apartment telling me something it's sort of like oh this guy thinks he's some hot shot business guy whatever and now you talk now and I'm like this guy owns a surf shop or something why is this guy like in the like the most zen zen mode almost introverted to an extent um isn't that strange was that strange for you to have like a very public Persona even though you clearly are actually more of a of a of a laid-back maybe more introverted guy yeah I think that's why it robbed people the wrong way like Sam um because you know that's kind of the thing that I didn't like about that business like if you're selling training or coaching or whatever it's you have to be very out there you have to make content of yourself you have to you have to continuously promote yourself right and I was always very uncomfortable doing that um and I guess I I used like the New York apartment and the blue suit is like a character yeah like a character or like a crutch to help me you know what I mean yeah and it worked you built consulting.com which was like a the way I'll describe it was like sort of like training masterminds courses type of thing where you would teach people how to start their own Consulting business and people pay a few thousand dollars and you you put a bunch of free content and that would get people sort of in the funnel and then eventually they would pay you a couple thousand dollars to learn how to start their own Consulting business and uh from what I understand like you scaled it up to uh about 30 million a year at one point out of sort of the peak on on the revenue side um before being like this is too much and too crazy and we have too many people two little profits we're pushing like you know the boundary too much you sort of scaled it back down um to a more manageable level where the revenue went down but the profits went you know up or the same um and you had less headache so it definitely worked did you get where'd you get the idea for that were you just like in a basement watching Tai Lopez videos being like okay I understand I could do this now or like where why did you decide to even do that you mean like sell courses sell courses in the way that you sold them which was just like a really heavy uh paid ad strategy with you as this character or this Persona the face of it very internet marketing yeah well um I wanna to start my own business I used to have a job this is going back like 12 years um and I used to watch this this interview site called mixergy do you guys remember that yeah yeah we love Andrew yeah um and I watched an interview one day and this guy was saying that he was gonna show he had a software company his name was Dane Maxwell and then he said he was going to teach some other people how to start a software company and that was my first experience of being in a course he launched a course that was called back then the software Round Table and I learned how to start a software company in that and started a software company it was called Snap and spec and so I first experienced being in a course like from the student side and through that experience I I had a successful software company and then I was like the star student of that of that software Roundtable Foundation thing um so then I did and he made me do an interview on mixergy this is back when I was very young and then a bunch of people started emailing me and saying could I they wanted to pay me so I could help them with their software company and I would just sell like six one-hour Skype calls for one thousand dollars and then very quickly I ran out of time to sell like I sold so many of these packages and I just noticed that I was repeating myself on these calls like a lot and I was like oh this this could be a course everyone's like struggling with the same problems and so and I've run out of time right so the next guy I took through this six one hour course I recorded the calls and then I put them in a Dropbox folder and then the people that wanted to buy my coaching and from that point on I said I don't have any time left but I've got like a course that you can buy for the same price and I would just sell it for one thousand dollars and give them a login to the Dropbox and they would watch the recordings in there and they liked it and they they didn't ask for their money back and just like and that's where it started and then when I sold more and more of those I was like whoa this is I should put some more effort into this so I did and then I and then I wondered well how can I sell more of this instead of just waiting for people to come to me from my mixergy interview and ask me over email so that's when I started learning about like internet marketing um and then I remember the people back then were like Frank Kern and who else there was like ramit Sethi there was this guy called clay Collins do you remember this era of like yeah and so I just kind of got I learned how to Market from that world like that kind of underground internet marketing world and that's and then my course business started to do so good it quickly overtook the the profit of my software company and I just wasn't very passionate about property management which was the niche that my software product was for was that called Snap inspect yeah it still exists it's snapinspec.com and I just wasn't passionate about the niche um so I sold my shares of snap inspect to my co-founder and then just went all in on the course business and that's what eventually became consulting.com and in the end I was making courses showing people how to make courses I just fell in love with the craft of like finding a group of people that you care about and solving their problems and then sharing the solutions with them and turning that into a business how did you get the domain consulting.com because that's a great domain um it was I went to The Domain I went to the URL and it was there was nothing on it and then I used like MX toolbox to find out like who owned it and then I just sent him an email and I said you want to sell it and he said yes how much you pay for that one um that one was three hundred thousand just um just in the the 10 minutes that you've just given that Spiel and tell them the background and then the hour that I've hung out with you you have this trait that I love that certain people have where in your brain I could see you're the type of person that you see a challenge and you don't think of it like a lot of people think of it as an emotional thing but it's a very logical and you're like this is a puzzle I'm gonna figure out this math equation and that gives you Joy at least it seems like it um with the marketing thing it seems like the same thing where you're like well if I wear this jacket that will pop off in a thumbnail and that's important for a higher click-through rate and it's like you just read tons of books and you put together like an algorithm on what to do and it's and that's why it it didn't seem entirely authentic that that was who you were but it seemed like you were just playing a game that you wanted to win is that how you went about it and who did you what interesting people did you learn the the the algorithm from that aren't entirely popular or that are like some strange resources I guess you know there was I just looked at the people who are doing quote well like and Brenda bashard and Marie forleo this is back then um and I knew I noticed that they had like a a if you thought of their name you could quickly assign like a couple of attributes to them they had like a brand essentially and I was like this kid from New Zealand teaching people how to start a business and so I was like whatever it is it needs to if when people see my video they instantly need to think of money basically and my main Market is New York I mean my main Market is America and New York is like so iconic and it means it's like the money place right so that was why I went to New York and why I found an apartment with a view like that I heard a rumor that that apartment is almost like exactly the same apartment as something from it was it a Wolf of Wall Street or one of those like iconic money movies where they like hang a guy over the balcony I heard that that you wanted that apartment for that reason is that true that isn't true um I wanted the apartment because it had a really cool View but then we were watching that movie and we had to pause it and be like wait a second is that this building and we realized it's not the same building but it must be one of the five in that area that are all very close to each other got it and so you um you start doing this now I'm curious a lot of the names you mentioned I never hear about those people anymore uh you know I've I remember Frank Kearns I remember uh even Pagan and some of these guys that you know you could kind of go study their their content their funnels um but they're not around anymore or if they are like I don't know where they are they're not they don't seem to be like crushing it anymore like they used to um Am I Wrong are they just out there crushing and I just don't see them for some reason or why do you think that they very few kind of sustained or did they just get so rich they quit or are they like locked into one mode and they didn't evolve at the Times what do you think happened I think things have changed a lot and a lot of people didn't adapt but also I think some people just got like they're just not going as hard or they might have got burned out and they're just relaxing a little bit um it's probably a combination of all of those things how how big were some of those old school marketers well they're all cool to me how big were some of their businesses you never know like that's why it's always so interesting I I I I had no idea because they never told me they seemed to they weren't real businesses in a way because they would make a a ton of money on a launch right but then that product would kind of go away and then they might do another launch in six months and it was all based on this launch model and these launches would pull big numbers like millions of dollars but and I'm sure there was a lot of profit in that too but they weren't like these products that were Evergreen that could be sold continuously and they didn't have a team and they weren't like contributing to this body of work they weren't building on top of what they built yesterday essentially you had this interesting video where yeah there we were talking about Jack Jack's one of my best buddies and he was on the last episode and you guys are very similar but on this video you opened it up and you just looked at the camera and you go I'm back and apparently like the story of the video was consulting.com Consulting got got to like 30 million in revenue and you would hire dozens of people fancy offices you hated it you basically scale it down I think you called it a band I think it was like five or six people you were like we're gonna do 10 million in Revenue 5 million in profit everyone gets a share of the profit what uh what was like the peak of the Consulting business and then where was it when you sold it sure so the peak was it must have been around like two thousand and 17 or 2018 and it was doing 36 million a year in Revenue um but profit-wise was probably only like 5 million on there most of it was was um expenses and we had about 50 people and we were spending like 2 million a month on ads um and it was just everything was breaking I hired everyone way too fast and it was heavily dependent on ads um which I didn't like I was reading this book on my honeymoon in um toulomb in Mexico and it's called um lean thinking and apparently it's like Jeff bezos's favorite book which is why I was reading it and in there they talk about like how you should optimize a business based on customer based on value the way a customer experiences it right and you should analyze like the head count how many people are like working on how many people are actually contributing to Value the customer would experience in your head count and then your your money flows so like how are you allocating the capital where is all the money being spent and does the customer experience value from that and then your time and attention and energy right so you're just analyzing all of these flows and I realized that all of our time money attention and head count was on ads and that customers did not think ads were valuable in fact they thought what you did it actually pissed them off right so I was like oh man I've really screwed this one up um and I was like everything should be focused on the customer and so I went back after that vacation and realized that I basically had to start again and I so I just started restructuring that company um I realized that organic content was really good because that's customers find that valuable right like a good YouTube channel good email newsletter so I was like we should do that and then if we do that well we don't need to do ads and then I was like everyone on the team should be contributing value to like the customer they should be doing support or they should be account management for Mastermind clients they should be customer facing in some way and all of my time and attention and energy should be thinking about the customers problems instead of advertising problems right and so I just with that kind of mental model I just started restructuring the whole company and then so like you you've talked about Consulting uh a bunch on other pods and but the story is that you eventually and we can go back to you eventually sold it but your new company school it's uh whenever I was texting to you it always uh autocorrects the stool s-k-o-o-l you were telling me you didn't exactly say it this way but I I read it this way you were telling me that you you're like we're not taking any funding or at least you're not anytime soon because you self-funded it with 10 million and you're like I'm hiring the best people so you like went from like this like internet marketing type of culture to Startup first of all is that true and second was that number right 10 million that you're going in on this that's true yeah and why the shift from like this startup where you like have hired all the like you're you're running things very Silicon Valley esque versus what I imagine in my head a lot of uh internet marketers are not like well I started in software remember the first company I ever did was snap inspect so I've always had a love for software the problem back then though was I didn't love my market like property managers and I we were constantly have limited by our money like you know software Engineers are expensive subscription Revenue has a cash flow trough in it um and so we were limited by money and I didn't love my market but I did love software and I also hated like having to Market I swore I was never going to touch software again unless it had Network effects because I wanted it to grow itself basically like a platform instead of a software tool um so then I fell in love with courses and that the beauty of that was like I was able to save a lot of money um and then I came back to software because I now was building software for the market that I loved which was like online creators and I had money this time so I wouldn't be limited by that I could get the best engineers and not cut corners on anything and take a more long-term View um and this was a platform opportunity instead of like a software tool so we didn't have to have a marketing or sales team um and we had no like CAC um and how is this growing because I see the traffic is like I don't know eight million visits a month or something insane like that um looks like you got an affiliate program here if you're not running marketing where's the growth coming from because I get that there's Network effects but um that's way more than like Circle Doc is it called Circle that's way more than a lot of like High VC competitors the traffic I believe yeah so I don't know if the number's right but let's say it's more than double circle yeah um how are you getting so much traffic it's a community platform so you know once you once you start a community and you add some content to it the first thing you do is you invite members right and then what happens is roughly one percent of members create their own community so they're like oh this platform's cool I want to make one of these and then they create their own and then they invite their members and then that there's a there's a loop there or a network effect when you were doing your content stuff um your ads I had read stuff like you um did some interesting things like you we talked about like the apartment and the suit and I don't know like a motorcycle in the middle of the room and stuff like that what were some interesting experiments that you ran that um that either worked or didn't work that sort of taught you something about you know human psychology or the way that people's what gets people's attention what people what gets people interested what gets them hooked what are some learnings from all those different kind of content experiments you did when you were doing uh when you're making you know when when you're your content your face was the was the driver well a lot of people just want to make money like that one was annoying so if you just put a jet in something or a fancy car or a New York apartment like it works so well that it's it's annoying because you're like oh do I have to do that [ __ ] aren't people just won't they just listen to the value of the idea but that's what I learned back then when I was doing those experiments I think now people are looking for like longer form real stuff that like a podcast podcasts are really taking off right um so I think the people that are doing a good job now is like what you guys are doing I think having a podcast in an email newsletter that's what I would do if I was starting again right now um that those two work really well together we have this friend Rebecca zamalo who um has tens of millions or maybe 15 or something million YouTube subscribers and she only launched it in like 2017 not that long ago and I was like Rebecca why did you get so big and she goes I took it like a job so like I got laid off or I quit I forget what happened with her other job and she goes this is now my thing so it was like a 40-hour work week it's like this is all I'm doing and I was like well doesn't everyone do that she said no shockingly no most of a lot of popular YouTubers it starts with a side Hobby and even when they're like fairly big it's still not full time but she's like I just treat this sumbitch like a company like I just ran it like a company and it worked out so I think that like that Focus thing no no chance he said some [ __ ] maybe it was like you know I took this wonderful thing very seriously uh yeah yeah you've been you've been pretty good with Focus I mean that's why you've been self-consulting.com if it's like doing well and you're not working on it I mean you're about you seem like you're you're very very very focused on [ __ ] I mean just to go 10 million on that on school is that a was that a significant chunk for you to do that and was that like a verbal commitment like I'm willing to do up to X or did you literally wire into a bank account so that's now in the company that's being used for this company it's we're burned in that that yeah that like I bought a house because you know I've got a wife and family so I've bought a house and I left some money in the personal account for like family and then I was like everything else I'm just I'm betting on this company so not no other portfolio nothing how big do you think school's gonna be what that's hard to answer there's what I would like it to be which is what I've always wanted to build something that a billion people use what are you how are you sleeping at night knowing that your whole or a lot of your nut is in there that's a very stressful thing quite well at the moment but because things are going really well um you know what the growth is compounding pretty fast and top tier VCS email us every week so I like and they I've had to just stop talking to them um and a lot of people want to give us money but we're not taking it and so I think the fact that a lot of people want to give me money is allowed me to calm down quite a lot that I'm not that we're not going to run out of money um also just the grow what is it profitable no it's not but deliberately so okay fair enough and um where'd you base the company uh is it remote or people in uh in America in New Zealand where you where are your people um everyone's in LA and San Fran okay okay and do you um you like when we when Sam says you remind him of Jack Smith one of the cool things about Jack Smith is that while he's clever and interesting on the business side he's also clever and weird and does crazy experiments also in his personal life uh whether it's like sort of biohacking or uh lifestyle choice or not naming his child until she was one years old like whatever apparent parenting everything he takes sort of like a novel approach to each thing I'm curious are you weird in other areas of your life do you do anything that's sort of non-standard that to you makes sense but maybe to other people sounds a little strange I'm sure would you like to say any examples since this is a podcast um I mean I slipped on a futon for like three years and I loved it and then when my wife got pregnant she she made me give it up but I really missed that futon you know a Japanese futon yeah um I love that thing um I just like to keep things very simple and minimal like I only have one pair of shoes and I only have like the same type of socks and the same kind of like underwear in the same t-shirts and then like three wool jumpers and that's all I have and then I have the same soap like this tea tree soap and I just have like 20 blocks of it and I I even take one with me when I travel because I only like that so um I like don't wear sunglasses because I think they're unnecessary um and I just like to reduce things just to I like to find something that I think is good and then only use that and then just get a few different pairs of that and just keep things as simple and as minimal as humanly possible is your wife normal yeah she is we were the reason why one of the things you said we were sitting around Sean it was me saying my wife Sarah we are sitting around at this restaurant and Sam you have you've got some strange energy in a very cool way you've got very strange and cool energy that I like I love people like you and we were just sitting around and the conversation kind of died and we were just we sat in silence for like three seconds I think and then you just said I delivered my baby and we were like we were like what with what because I had my hands we're like hold on say this again and you're talking about how your wife she you're going to be like a home delivery or something and the Midwife didn't make it in time and you just did the damn thing and you just did it and I remember thinking like the reason I love this guy is I don't think he understands like how strength like your mannerisms your voice they're this is they're so unique and strange in such an interesting way um which I frankly love I love people like you because you're so unique and you're not vanilla do you realize that you're like that honestly not really because I don't I don't try to fit in and I don't try to like I don't even look at what other people are doing like I don't have social media at all um and I never look at really what's going on or what's in the news or anything and I just do what I want what do you do with that free time so let's say no social media no news for most people that's like four to five hours a day or something like that how do you reinvest that four to five hours a day where do you put it what what does give you energy or what do you do for entertainment or what do you do to to unwind I mean all I really do is focus on school and that's mostly the product so I'm just obsessive about the product all the details of it and then I go home hang out with my wife and daughter and then I need two hours of like watching something to to unwind otherwise I can't sleep and so I'll I'll watch series like TV series and I like old stuff like things before technology because it's it's nice and slow and it helps me go to sleep but when you say you're obsessive what does that mean like do people like working with you like are you the type of guy who like if something very small at the footer is screwed up you freak out over that you know I can see a pixel so if something's off like I'm like something's off over there and then I'll inspect it with chrome inspector and it will be one pixel so I can like I I joke with the team that I can see at pixel um and yeah I'll I'll go into those details like I designed schools interface and figma like the whole thing um and defined a lot of like how that entire system works which is it's quite complex well I knew you were like that because when consulting.com first came out most courses don't didn't look the way yours looked yours had this like you had this really cool thing of a it was like a caveman becoming a person uh right is that what it was and then it was like a picture of the globe and it uh it looked like a software page it looked very unique and I remember seeing the design of it and I thought that is incredibly unique and it stood out it made you feel more sophisticated than most other people in the space um you remember that page it might describing it I do accurately yeah what uh what were you think when you made that well that's what I like to do I like to just spend a long time on the tiny details like you know I've spent days trying to figure out the right pixel radius of a rounded corner for the for like a button is that a feature or a bug like uh if somebody I worked with was spending days on a uh how much the Border radius should be on a button I would slap them I'd be like what are you doing this is not this doesn't matter and this is not gonna be like high impact so why are you doing this so you know is that a is it a good thing or is that a byproduct like maybe you do that in certain areas where it really works then asks uh I gotta live with the fact that I do it in these other areas where it doesn't matter at all yes so I you know if if it's not I won't block anyone by doing that right so like when we're building the thing like I'll be very fast and not the bottleneck of the team but then in my spare time I'm playing with things thinking about the next time we update the design system and I'm just tweaking little things in my that's what I do for fun so it's not like what I'm doing is my work kind of thing how do you how do you organize your day uh do you have like uh are you like focused on one thing do you have like a morning like okay there's my to-do list what what how do you how do you create your day most of what I do I would say it's product strategy and design that's like where I spend all of my time just in those zones and we have got like three product teams at school so three full stack product teams with back-end front end QA product manager designer right um and they've got three road maps that are all going in parallel and I need to think ahead of them like I've got to dream up like the whole product strategy and roadmap and everything and then I have to reverse engineer into trunks break it down and then figure out which team should work on what thing and sequence it and then I've got to design the whole thing spare kit brief that team and stay a few development Cycles ahead um and so I'll either be designing something trying to figure out a priority talking to that engineering team or chickens doing the final QA check before we push something into production I actually think that that's totally the right way in my opinion that a lot of companies should run the reason they don't is because a that's really really hard so like you're the brainchild you have to like you probably know every single thing that's happening that's incredibly challenging for just about everyone number two it doesn't feel good to feel like a dictator it's like basically you're you guys are a band and you're like the main you're you know you're the main you're the main guy you're Celine Dion and everyone else is the backup band that's a weird reference but it is what it is you're Billy Joel I don't feel like that's where I went yeah that's that's where we went you're sleepy I don't know long hair uh you're like the guy whereas or I don't know if I can recover from that whereas most uh startups it's like it's it's a lot more decentralized and things like that but with this type of product it seems like you're like the the main person and there's a circle around you with [ __ ] going on is that right it sounds [ __ ] exhaust funny example of this was I remember Sam when you were running the hustle and I was running my company we would meet up every couple weeks as part of our like kind of like founder Mastermind thing where we would get together and uh you know I was sort of drinking the Silicon Valley Kool-Aid which was like autonomy and like give people Empower your people and all these things and I was like you know preaching to my team like hey whoever's got the best idea we're going with you you know oh janitor you got an idea let's do it you know like let's make it happen and Sam showed me uh I meet up with Sam and Sam shows me like a 12-page doc that he wrote out for some new woman that he hired and he just go and the document just says uh welcome here's the things that you're going to do um your job is to do this here's how you will do this step one do this step two do this and was just like handed it to her and was like this is do not deviate from this I don't want to hear you I don't want to hear your ideas on this and I asked you I was like why do this you're like because people [ __ ] up and I just I'd either I think this is the right way to do it and I just need her to do it this way no because that I whatever Sam has said I totally agree with that the problem is that it's [ __ ] exhausting you know what I mean like it's really hard to do that for a long period of time it's not scalable yeah it's kind of scalable oh yeah like the engineers I'm not telling them what to do like in terms of code right so and then I'm not even coming up with all the ideas from my own mind I spend a lot of my time looking at what our community wants so like going through our school Community where people ask for stuff and share bugs and feedback then I'll talk to power users I always find who's spending the most time on the platform get a top 100 just DM a few of them get on Zoom talk just talk to them for hours about it and then I use the product myself and then I talk to the team too and so ideas come from all of these places but I'm like the filter and the the sorter in the prioritizer basically um and then when I go to engineering I know what the feature should be but they they might push back on a lot of what I say based on how easy that is to implement with code they might be like oh do you really need to do it this way because that's going to make the code messy or why don't you do it this way that would be way more simple for the system and I'll listen to that feedback and adjust the actual feature because I'm trying to like I'm trying to give the the users what they want but I'm also trying to keep the code clean and and I'm trying to build things fast too so I'm like how could we shrink the scope of this to make it so we could deliver something faster and and so it's not like I'm just dictating to everyone um there's a lot of collaboration you know Sean is something I've uh do you know that Company Jasper yeah have you talked to those guys is the Founder's name is Dave or David first of all I'm on the website of consulting.com dude well that's what I was gonna say for one if you go to like uh unsplash I think it was called or one of those like stock websites uh stock image websites for some reason Dave is on the picture of so many stock pictures I used to use a picture of him and then I met him I'm like dude I used your face for a stock image you're on this like royalty-free website and number two he used to be part of consulting.com didn't he so Jasper's for The Listener is like a I guess a billion dollar now company that does AI stuff um was he part of your crew he was a he bought my coolest like many years ago um and he was one of our like most successful students um he used to sell coaching like training and stuff but then he he wanted to get into software so then he did this thing proof do you remember that that little yeah yeah and then that turned into Jasper and did I why did someone someone told me to ask you what you think about AI why do they say that um well I think it's like massively over hyped and somewhat like just unnecessary like I don't know about you guys but gbt hasn't replaced my Google usage I still use Google every day um and I've found no real task for it honestly it seemed but the hype is Extreme well the hype cycle is there around like the growth and like well it's it's not there yet but I can see the future of this so you're not bullish at all in the future of it no I'll take the other side of it um Sam anything else you want to ask before we we wrap up no I I appreciate coming I I want to talk to you again another time I find you fascinating I think that you're an original thinker and I appreciate people like you thanks uh all right well that's that's the pod that's it [Music]

I was like have you done any deals like that I would have heard of and he's like you know Disneyland I was like yeah he's like a lot of Windows in Disneyland we do all the windows in Disneyland oh my God they bought a window company got him a Disney contract we do all the windows at Disney [Music] all right what's up we are talking about something pretty special this episode this is gonna be different than our normal episodes which are you know freewheeling freestyling today we got a plan and the plan is we're going to talk about companies that crush it with only one or two employees so the reason we thought about this was there was some news I don't know a couple weeks ago that a company that I had never heard of called War graphs sold for 54 million dollars and the yeah that's I mean that's obviously impressive but the most impressive part was that Warcraft was just one dude so one guy sold his company for 54 million dollars and uh I don't know do you know what wargrass did are you familiar with it is it a gaming thing it's a gaming thing yeah so he built basically a companion app I think for a League of Legends so if you play League of Legends this was like a thing that would keep track of your stats and stuff like that help you get better at the game so he built this little companion app and uh it had gotten really popular I think he got into like a million uh players that used it and was generating serious revenue and so he sold it for 51 54 million in cash and he was upfront he was like I got half of the uh sorry I got half of the 54 million in cash up front and I have the other half as like my earn out that I have to look at like you know if it hits you know our Milestones along the way which is just super impressive for a one-person company and how old is the person uh I think he started when he was young but now it's been like you know seven or eight years so that's amazing I'm gonna guess some something like 30 but the the it got me thinking it was like everybody talks about big businesses for good reason big businesses are awesome uh there they are but what about Mighty businesses what about the the guys who are punching above their weight so somebody who has just themselves or just one or two people that does millions in Revenue profitably flies under the radar and like how many other War graphs are there out there so we did some research and we found some and so that's what this episode is going to be about and we've kind of touched on this before we've done some of our most popular episodes if you go on YouTube you'll see the episode with Peter levels I think has a couple hundred thousand um listens the lesson uh sorry the uh episode about Amit Agarwal the guy who builds uh G Suite you know maybe basically Google Sheets plugins um he does millions of dollars in Revenue as just kind of one guy who was a blogger turned app builder and so those were some of our most popular episodes so I think this is going to be a good one too Sam anything else before we jump in yeah I want to give an honorable mention to this one person Have you listened to juvenile growing up remember rapper the rapper juvenile of course you're giving him a shout out like he's listening yeah I like last year NPR they do this thing called the tiny desk concert series you know what that is it's like they're in the office like playing acoustic songs yeah those are cool they said who should we have and this one guy goes you should have Juvenile and juvenile replies and he goes what the what that he goes WTF what what the f is a tiny desk and hell no and you know what they got him to do it anyway it happened this weekend and so in preparation for this one-man band show I've been listening to that juvenile concert at the tiny desk NPR series it was awesome it was awesome he he remember back that ass up it was so good it was so good I had to be inspired him and Manny fresh in it and it was awesome it was awesome awesome awesome so honorable these are the tiny Desk Awards then let's call it that these are the tiny Desk Awards which are the the businesses that can be run off of one tiny desk because it's just one or two people all right and uh we're gonna do this like an awards show so we have a long list but that'd be kind of boring so we're we're broken up into categories and we each have our answer for the category so for example first category is going to be biggest one-person business but we also have to set some rules here yes some of these things one person it's a bit uh vague yeah one person oftentimes can mean like the founder and like a team of contractors or in many cases it's going to be um uh agencies that they work with of course or it started as one person and it was that way for a long time and then they hired a team uh exactly so it's more of the spirit of the law than the letter of the law here so you know they don't have t-shirts for the company because you know there's they don't have like you know a bunch of employees and and uh you know morale they they probably won't have a uh an office where a bunch of people go into it's either one or two people who are kind of the core drivers and maybe they use some contractors or vendors or agencies for for other things but uh that's that's generally the the way we're looking at this yeah and so uh let's get into it so what's the first one the uh is it the the biggest so you go first so I'm gonna do one another gaming one that I doubt you know of do you know what stardew valley is no what is that so stardew Valley is this game and if you look at the game the game art looks like it's like 8-bit art almost it looks like a very very simplistic game and it was made by one guy this guy Eric Barone and he's basically is like you know I'm he gets out of school he doesn't want to get a job so he's like well you know I'm gonna teach myself how to code uh instead of going to get a good job so he's like why don't I learn how to build a game in order to teach myself how to code like I don't want to just code for coding's sake I'll try to do something with it and he always liked these games back if you have a harvest moon it's like this kind of like Farming Simulator game um there's like very simple kind of like uh you know it had like a cult following and so he's like I'm gonna make my version of Harvest Moon which was like kind of was popular when I was a kid like you know 15 years ago 20 years ago and um so he spends basically uh four years in solitude just building this game by himself before he releases it and for four years his job did he have a job he just lived off his girlfriend his girlfriend had a like a grad degree stipend and uh and then he had a part-time job as an usher is amazing I mean and Usher is a terrible unless you're literally trying to be like a cover artist covering the artist Usher like you know you never want to be a notcher that's not the that's not your crew's not going the right direction when you're doing that um so anyways the he launches this thing stardew Valley has sold 20 million copies um it sells for 13 a pop and so uh you know he sold this thing I think over time it has done 150 million in sales or Revenue um and he's the only guy who built it just by himself it's just honestly not that uncommon Minecraft was largely built the same way there's this guy Notch who's the developer behind Minecraft and if you've ever seen it he'll get on Twitch and he'll just code Minecraft like he'll just stream himself for like 12 hours just building the game and like I think Minecraft have more people overall but like one guy was really the driving force and the driving energy around it for many many years uh but stardew Valley is my pick for for biggest 100 50 million off of one one Game Dev the guy Notch when he's sold I think he sold for like multiple billions right three billion two billion something like that and he uh I think he bought like an like he outbid Beyonce for like an 80 million dollar mansion in uh LA and he was tweeting out or sharing how everyone hates him now he was like I'm so lonely this sucks but he's still in this like fancy 80 million dollar mansion do you remember that whole like ordeal where he was talking about how he like didn't give Equity to people and so some of the people who he hired uh hated him and he was lonely but he was having all these huge parties and he was lost and all that stuff do you remember all that no I I missed all that dude he like went through this whole Spiel on on Twitter about how like he hates his life but oh wow you know everything what else is uh I'm looking at this house this house is insane with the 80 million 70 million it was like a it was a fat I remember like I would love to just see Beyonce getting the news it's like oh who who did it who outbid me was it was it Spielberg who was it oh no it must have been uh but Lenny Kravitz on this like not ch [Laughter] um all right mine is a stream yard so stream yard I'll have to uh remember when they launched but I think they launched in 2019 right before the pandemic hit and it was basically a it was a way to stream events online and stream interviews and things like that online these two guys scaled it to 30 million dollars in Revenue in one year or 18 months or so and this mostly happened because the pandemic they ended up selling it to happen for 250 million dollars it was a mix of cash in stock and hop in ended up laying up off a bunch of people uh like last year but I've heard rumors that it's killing it have you heard these rumors pop it yeah no no I have not heard I've heard the opposite of those rumors but I don't know what have you heard well just like when the layoffs happened and it was like basically post covered events came back online like in person so that's naturally going to hurt the business then they had massive layoffs and I heard that the the founders had taken a ton of secondary or something like that so I heard like a hundred million plus in secondary yeah but maybe the business went well I have no idea I just heard kind of like that generally though when you hear those three things it's like massive layoffs you know Market uh you know the the crazy event that was driving your growth has stopped and the founders people start talking about how much secondary the founders took it's usually because the business is going in the wrong direction you usually people don't [ __ ] about secondaries when the thing is exploding I don't know I I heard the other way I I also thought that and I heard the other way around we talked about stream yard like right when they were getting going and then we talked about them again when they were acquired did you say you knew these guys I think I met because back when I was doing video streaming I met like kind of everyone in this space I I don't know I gotta look up who these guys are but I do know that they got to 14 million in RR when it was just the two of them and then it got to 30 million when they had by that time they had hired up a team so this is kind of like a hybrid they got they got really far with just a couple people and then they hired up um you know from from as they scaled it before they sold and I remember going to their website when it was just them and I there was like the founder and he was he was on the he was on the home page and he was giving like a tutorial video on how to use the product it was just him like with this camera on his lap practically and he looked exhausted he looked so worn out I remember this during the pandemic when we were thinking about using them for something and he looked like super Haggard but it was very impressive that these two guys have built this to sell for 250 million dollars and although it was cash and stock so I don't know if the stock is worth anything I heard it might be so that might be one of the biggest ones that I've heard of at least recent big ones another big one that uh it happened a long time ago so I have no connection it was Plenty of Fish how much did plenty of fish get acquired for like 550 million dollars yes hundreds yeah and uh that was started by one guy named Marcus who now I see online and he seems like he like lives the most lavish life and just does crazy [ __ ] and so plenty of fish was basically one of the early dating websites it was a Marketplace it was like okay Cupid but I think it was predominantly Canadian and that had to be probably the biggest exit that I've ever heard of for a really small small team yeah plenty of fish was unbelievable that guy isn't he like a nut that Plenty of Fish founder I feel like that's a whole another story we should do one day I think it's a whole another I think I don't know I haven't researched it enough to actually like verify the claims but I've heard like a little like grumblings like a little little stories that something weird is going on but I don't know the truth also I love the fact that you've met the stream yard guys and they looked Haggard and you're like it's like in Silicon Valley when you see somebody like that you put your arm around them and you're like hey you all right is it is it because of too much traction or not enough I just need to know how I'm gonna be super much yeah oh it's too much traction okay okay come here come here you sleep on my couch let me feed you just take this check put me on your cap table uh you know like there's really you know one out of ten of the Haggard people they're getting beat down by too much demand and nine out of 10. like that who have you met like that who else have you met where are you I remember you're talking to a guy who um this guy Abner met a guy abder and he was doing something pretty I met him after the fact but he told me the story and I it was it was stuck with me and I always remember here after hearing the story I was like I should look for that so what happened was Twitter started taking off in popularity uh right when it kind of got going in Silicon Valley like it became like a thing and Abner was him and his team or they're like kind of like data science type people and so they were like all right what can we build uh that makes Twitter work better because Twitter was such a simplistic product and at the time it was like almost like a protocol like anyone could kind of build apps on top of it or use the data for something so he's trying to build something he doesn't know what he's doing he's like he's sitting on a train and he starts coding this thing he's like oh I've done this research on sentiment analysis and he's like I was like okay so yeah well the story sounds a little bit boring who cares about sentiment analysis he's like yeah you could he's like you could figure out like how people are feeling about a certain topic because they're talking about it in a certain way so he said so tell him his story was boring right when he got oh my you know my channel started to drift yeah I was like is there anyone else in this a car I could talk to I was in a car with him in Ethiopia you know for four hours straight there's nowhere to run so I'm I'm hearing I'm like all right let me hear about the story sentimentality yeah go ahead tell me more about your PhD and sentiment analysis what did this do and he's like so I was on a train and I'm building this thing I'm trying to analyze what people are saying on Twitter to see if I could get the sentiment the current mood or whatever he's like but then I realized actually what I'll do is instead of figuring out their mood I'll just figure out what are they talking about a lot of like a lot more than usual that's kind of interesting and he basically created trending for Twitter off of Twitter oh cool so he's like he's like oh I could figure out that the word Olympics normally is only said this much but it's being said 10 standard standard deviations more so that means Olympics is trending the the it's it's above its par and he's like this is super cool like I basically have the 10 things that people are talking about on Twitter I can kind of get that I get that signal in a way that you couldn't really get at the time on Twitter and so he creates this and they create a separate website off of Twitter called Twitter trending I forgot what it was called Zone website and they start getting millions of hits on this thing and they're just trying to and as and he's trying to keep it keep it up because he's basically drinking from the Twitter fire hose and he's got all this traffic and so he's trying to keep both of them working eventually Twitter buys them so they become like employees 10 through 20 or something of Twitter oh sick and at the time Twitter had the fail well it was just like constantly Twitter the service was going down it was had so much usage and it was like in this Web 2.0 like it wasn't like scalable yet they hadn't figured out how to scale it and he told me he's like he's like for six months he's like I just woke up every day with like an imprint of my keyboard on my forehead like I had just passed out I was working trying to keep this damn Side Up pass out wake up uh where was I and I just kept going he's like that was six months straight of my life he's like I've never experienced anything like it and at the time I remember thinking oh there's levels to this thing like that's what it feels like when you really have one of the winners like and if you talk to people early at Facebook and they talk about like what the what what it was like working early at Facebook Facebook it's like when people talk about living in New York they're like just the energy was it's the energy you can't explain it and it's like that's how that's what you get when you're inside one of these generational companies at the early stage when they're they're scaling too fast dude that's exciting I love that one um I like hearing those old stories like that I always read those old books like the hatching Twitter and all that [ __ ] I love that [ __ ] yeah me too um all right next let's go to let's wait let's go to a highest degree of difficulty we'll skip a category and come back to it okay so this is the hardest one the hardest example the one that we're like how the hell did you even do that and there's no way anyone else would have done this you go first all right I have one it's called tiny wow so I think the URL is just tinywow.com so do you have that pulled up tiny while yeah got it all right so I met this guy he's a member of Hampton that's why I met him his name is Evan Gower he had a uh another website called Tech junkie maybe you heard of tech junkie but they like just talked about like Tech topics whatever it's pretty normal website but he ended up selling it for eight figures and on the side he started this thing called tiny wow which is a bunch of tools that include like how to convert a PDF but then image editing tools that use Ai and it's one of those websites where you Google like convert this file to PDF it is able to he's able to come up first right now it has 6.6 million visits a month and the reason it's yeah it's insane the reason it's interesting is right now it only does 20 000 a month in Revenue because he says I haven't I just haven't turned on any of the um monetization it just has like uh little ads he goes I'm going to turn it on eventually but right now I'm just enjoying the summer and time at my family so I haven't really like dug deep and like built it and so basically this guy Evan he wasn't you talking about the weather put on AdSense what are you doing Evan this is insane dude that's the cool part about uh these one-person businesses and this is another guy who I'm gonna tell a story about has said the same thing he goes I felt like taking the summer off so I just let it ride for a little while uh so this guy Evan he basically had a history as a a developer he says he doesn't do any development now but he has a team of three people who are helping him or one contractor who helps him with uh overseas who's helped him actually like build and Implement he basically just draws it and Designs it but the reason why this thing is taken off is if you Google or do you remember like do you ever see those videos on Tick Tock that say like here's five websites that should be illegal but aren't so good that they should be illegal yeah so that is basically how it the the website got popular is it's gotten popular from those videos and so the reason why this is really hard to create because a getting traffic to a a like a Content site or any type of website like this it's very challenging oftentimes building the product is not the hard part it's getting users and getting 60 point six million visits a month mostly from social quite challenging we'll see if he's able to turn this but I asked him I was like how big can this get he's like well like I think of like canva so I'm like can we I think it can make tens of millions of dollars a year in Revenue because we're gonna ultimately we have this traffic we can have like a feature that says hey you can edit this uh picture using our platform and we'll charge a small fee I think this actually could be a big business but right now it's really tiny he told me it cost ten thousand dollars a month to run and it's making twenty thousand dollars a month in Revenue wow yeah do you know how much uh how much remove that BG makes who do you ever use remove.bg no what is that oh that's I mean that's that was the old way it's like if you need to remove a background from an image like you need to just cut out the object and remove the background remove.bg was this website that was uh like just because of traffic yeah it was just a go-to and uh oh my God 50 to 60 million in monthly monthly visits so it's just like insane and remove.bg it just had a Stranglehold for me at least on on doing this it was like super quick you just drag your image in it just removes the background boom there you go and uh and then they charge for like yo you want it like 1080P or whatever they started charging for like little things like remove this Watermark and um I'm sure this thing crushes you know I I don't know I don't know how how much uh Revenue they do now but I'm sure this is one of these like Mighty businesses where it's a very small team uh canva acquired them it says that they had at least 100 million people coming to their website last year yeah um that's a CR that's crazy so it's acquired by canva so you can probably I don't know if canva has gone public yet maybe they have I think actually they just did a last month you might be able to dig through their numbers and see if they got Acquired and for how much but that's crazy that's so much traffic this site tiny while definitely could be something like that they started this in 2019. um it's this company collidio um and then they so they started in 2019 they sold it this was 2021 so two years later for roughly 100 million dollars wow and uh wow do they have funding I think the parent company it looks like it's a side project of the parent company the reason why I said these are the hardest to make is getting that scale of traffic that fast is so challenging you know like there's a lot of like software products that we're gonna name as one person companies and that's challenging in the sense of like you have to put it in a ton of hours uh and you actually have to like invent stuff and that's very challenging but getting traffic to me is more of an intellectual challenge where it's like I have no idea like where to start like whereas with starting with software like I I'm gonna make this one feature then I'll do this other feature I'll talk to my users it's a little bit involves a little bit of luck a little bit of skill but getting a lot of traffic to your website early on I think there's less people that know how to do that and so that's why I think that this is one of the harder things to start so here's my my answer for highest degree of difficulty photo p so photo p is very very similar basically it's one guy who recreated the entirety of Photoshop in a web browser for free so oh my God Photoshop is one of the most complicated products in the world he recreated it by himself gives it away for free and made it work in the browser which Photoshop doesn't Photoshop is a you know how you have to download the app in order to make it work it's just remarkable the guy barely monetizes it uh doesn't want to sell it and uh if you go just search his like just search photo P Reddit um or like you know founder Reddit he goes and he talks about like you know why he built it how he built it um and what you know what how he thinks about it or whatever it's pretty insane and I think how much traffic does it get uh traffic wise like 13 million according to similar web uh per month and um he does at the time this was a couple years ago he said that he was doing a hundred thousand a month um off this thing and it was like literally from the most basic absolute most basic of uh of like ads like this is one guy Ivan who made it and it's he's just like puts like the very simple Banner ad on the site and makes like 100 000 a month he uh did a post at Hacker News on April 11 2021 he goes hey guys I'm Ivan I'm the creator of photopee I made almost a million dollars in the last 12 months 90 from ads the rest is from premium uh which is useless you pay to hide ad so it's not even much of a premium when you start your own project you never know if it'll make 250 000 but if you get hired you can be quite sure that you will never make more than 250 000 and so that's why I started it and so this company photo P I don't know how big it is but depending on how many users it has I could see this getting sold for nine figures over a hundred million dollars so um he did an AMA on Reddit and they said uh hey have you hired your first employee yet this was a year ago and uh he says oh after I did my first AMA on Reddit uh lots of great people got in touch I did end up hiring one guy from Prague who uh who went to my university but it'll take some time for him to get familiar with the code he hasn't done it it is like it hasn't done yet it's pretty crazy how this guy uh operates so why do you think this is the most challenging uh just like technically recreating Photoshop feature for feature is absolutely insane like I think that's just an insane Endeavor um and then making it work in the browser like making it performance in a browser is not easy either so like for one person to do this I think it's crazy that's insane yeah I uh the the cool thing about these like one I think the the downside of these one-person companies is that everything relies on you and that you don't have like anyone else to ask for help and you can't hire anyone you can't have anyone better than you doing something because you're the only person and so in order to do this I think a lot of these people they have a they have a handful of traits that we'll talk about in the end but I don't understand how he could grind that hard for that long with all this pressure on him by the way this guy says he put seven thousand hours into it before he made any money from it that's insane so I think that that just takes so much will do you remember Viral Nova it was a guy named Scott de long so Viral Nova was basically an Upworthy clone it was a it says like they're like here's a list of 10 reasons why you don't want to go swimming after eating you're not going to believe number seven and so this guy would talk about like how it was just him writing 10 articles a day and he was like I'm the pressure of all this traffic and all the success it's killing me I feel so worn out all the time and I don't understand how some people can sustain that for a really long time like this photo P guy yeah this is like you know when you go to someone's house and they're like oh do you want to see my model train set I'm building you're like what uh yeah sure why not I'm here and they take you down to the basement and then it's just like they've recreated like the city of Vienna and through their like and they're just tinkering on this like one thing they're like uh how many hours how long have you been doing this and they're like oh I just come here every night I love it and this is what I do it makes me feel so good and you're like holy [ __ ] this is like the most intense hobby that's how that's how I'm not that guy I'm not that type of person are you you're definitely not I think right come on if not uh yeah I envy those people that's an amazing uh willpower all right let's do another one let's do on the other end easiest to recreate so which of these one person one or two person businesses do you think are easiest to recreate that um is the opposite of the highest degree of difficulty go ahead um so mine would be anything that sells information or service so I put just any course creator but you and I know a bunch of these people of which you and I are both of those people uh you know we make hundreds of thousands or Millions dollars a year from like a course or two and I think they're fairly easy to recreate another one is uh there's a company called design Joy you know what they do I believe it's a design subscription basically that's him yeah but the way that he positions it it seems really hard to imagine that that's the truth but basically it's just this designer that you pay thousands of dollars a month for and you ask them to make small changes to different design related stuff and he claims that it's just him but I I believe he claims that yeah but he says it sounds like he does a hundred thousand dollars a month so he does 1.2 million a year or so around that range and it's basically you buy a subscription plan so you pay and you buy like the five it's like four or five thousand a month um and then you you basically get one request at a time um and that's it you get to just say I'd like this design thing done and he turns around in some I don't know what his SLA is of how long he takes to uh to do this but it's like it's cheaper than hiring a full-time designer probably unless like in the US um but yeah that's the I think that's the easiest to recreate but also the worst to run which we'll talk about later but that's probably the easiest one it's like a bunch do you know any other course people that do like like I know Sam Evans does 10 million in Revenue 5 million profit and for a while it was just him I met these guys I met a guy recently who does like a product management course and I was like oh my God who's taking a product management course he goes no no it's how to base your job interview as a product manager like how to get a job as a PM at one of these tech companies and I think he was doing what was he doing but like 2 million a year or something like that I think they were doing like two what two 2.5 they had 2.5 million a year uh roughly in in Revenue I think it was like 80 percentish margins and what they would do is they would basically say they would give away free content that was like how to you know how to get a job as a PM how to interview as a PM how to uh prep for this interview what it was like talking to a Facebook PM blah blah they give away free content to get you kind of on the email list and get you to the website and then they're like hey do you want to like get a job as a PM which will pay you let's call it 120 000 a year if you want that job um buy this course and join this cohort of course or whatever and they basically sell this course for a couple thousand dollars that's going to help you get this job that's going to pay you over a hundred thousand dollars and that's like a very simple value proposition for somebody who wants to uh wants to do that with their career and it was just him it was him in three it was it was three of them three three PMS that kind of like got together and made this thing another example of an easy one to start I think I told you about this it's called cyber lead so you go to get cyberleads.com so it's c-y-b-e-r leads so get cyberleads.com it's this guy named Alex West and basically it's a newsletter where I I think it costs four to a thousand dollars a month so four hundred to a thousand dollars a month depending on what you get what you do but basically he goes and he hand picks different companies that have recently raised money and based off a bunch of attributes he thinks are about to hire an agency and then he gets all these agency owners to sign up to his service and he emails this list out once a month along with like the contact information the hiring decision or the hiring uh uh like whoever's managing ad spend whatever and you can just contact him on he's got your face and quota as a testimonial do you use this no I don't use this but I talked I talked about it on the Pod uh I talked about it on the Pod like two years ago I've never used it uh I've never you've never used it but he sure used you he is he was a big I don't know is there anything can I can you say anything about these people who do this I talked about it on the Pod I said it's so freaking simple the value's so clear I guess I said that on the podcast and he uses that as a quote is there anything I could do decide to take them down you can always say that um oh sorry let me wrap up my thing selling information so anything that you sell information that's the easiest thing to start yeah I think uh so I went the same route but I'm gonna give more detail because I think when you tell somebody selling information is the easiest way they're like cool what so what do I do so [ __ ] I gave three examples yeah but I think you have to break it down a little further so um you know this guy Lenny Lenny Russian last name I don't know I like Letty Rogowski or vegetative uh something something along those lines I like Lenny so Lenny I think used to work at Airbnb or something he was like a growth slash like product guy and so he's got Lenny's newsletter he's got Lenny's communities he's got Lenny's job board and basically he was like I'm gonna become he's like I'm gonna put out tons of free thought leader content on a specific super Niche topic that only certain people are gonna care about but they're gonna care a lot and that's that's kind of the key with this stuff is how do you put out free content to establish yourself as an authority in a niche so that you can then monetize that through either Consulting Services job board paid Community or um or paid content paid newsletter right that's that's the formula and you can look at the um the design Joy guy he does exactly this he puts out free content examples of design work and then says you can hire me for design work um Lenny does the same thing he puts out free content he's got really good stuff like you know how did these 10 huge marketplaces how did they get their first thousand users and he goes deep and he's like I'm gonna interview them I'm gonna talk to them I'm going to get the real answer on the specific zero to one question that's going to be highly relevant to other people going through that same challenge I think he has a podcast too he's got a podcast like at one point his job board was doing a couple hundred thousand I'm sure the newsletter does a couple hundred thousand in sponsorships I think about monthly or annually annually um at least these are minimum [ __ ] way more like I know at the beginning his job boards crushing I don't know what they're doing now but like I would bet his entire roll-up of job board um content sponsorship so podcast plus newsletter and then uh he's got a paid thing right Ben he's got like a paid paid Community what's it what do you think bloody's total thing is 2 million three million yeah for sure about two to three million uh a year and he did that I would say in a period of like two and a half three years it seems like like I think he think he has a fun too he kind of put his foot down on the content side I like he kind of appeared on the scene I would say like two two-ish years ago um obviously you had to know your stuff right so he's like you know spent time learning you know a decade being awesome inside these companies in order to do so I don't mean to make it sound overly simplistic but there are people who did it without that too so another example is uh Harry dry one of my favorite content creators in the whole world a guy I tried to recruit like a hundred times to do something with me because I feel like made to do something great um he keeps he keeps bullshitting and not saying yes but he's gonna say yes eventually so he's got marketing examples he does a great job with this blog called marketing examples now I don't know how much marketing examples makes I would guess quarter million to half a million as just him making content I think he's young he's very young he didn't do the put in 10 to 15 years become an industry like like do the job cut your teeth then go make content he's like no I'm pretty sure I could just look at what's out there and like give my opinion on it and it'll work I'll study this [ __ ] and that's how I feel like you know a lot of people also can do it you can be the Curious novice approaching these uh topics and become an expert just by studying them intensely and so uh I think Harry dry would also be one of the easiest to recreate not because he's not talented he's super talented but I think that's kind of something anyone can do anybody could just say yo I'm gonna study what makes tick tocks go viral and I'm gonna put up content about viral tick tocks I'm gonna become the expert of breaking down Tick Tock going viral and then brands are going to know me as the guy that they should talk to you about Tick Tock Consulting right like or like advertising on Tick Tock and like you could just build your Niche audience and your Niche Authority in that space A lot of people are trying to do this AI right now and the thing about Lenny and Harry was people were doing so first of all like a newsletters Community podcast that's existed since forever uh so it's not a unique business model and also people have been talking about that type of stuff for a long time but what's interesting is that they were both early-ish where there was only maybe I don't know how many but they felt like they were early-ish talking about it to this customer to this community on this platform so both of those guys I think got popular on Twitter right before the pandemic started I think I remember seeing Harry in 2018 2019 which I wasn't even really using Twitter as a power user back then but they all seem a little bit early so I think timing matters for a lot of these things uh speaking of which that Facebook threads thing no idea if that's going to be a thing or not but that's an example of like hey there's this new thing right now if you want nothing to lose you better be there yeah just go get go be around there see what's going on yeah that's one of those things people did with Clubhouse I don't know if that worked out or not but uh the way I say it is like you uh most most entrepreneurs were actually surfing waves you don't get to create the wave but you do have to paddle out you got to be on your board out there in the water you got to paddle out and you know which is a takes effort and then you gotta wait and sometimes it's a dud sometimes it's just a small wave you're gonna have to paddle back out again well when you catch a good one you know that's when you get and we'll see how good you are at surfing you might Wipe Out the first couple times you try it but like that's your job as an entrepreneur is to paddle out be out there and start trying to Surf these waves and get a sense for where are the big waves and um and how do I not wipe out when I do when I do find one so this episode you're giving a really in-depth surf analogy last episode you gave us a fat uh a pitching of baseball what do you say a fat ass fat pitches it was fat pitches if you ever played bass addiction never played baseball or serp in your life bro I was starting right fielder for my high school team which anybody who knows baseball knows that means you're the biggest scrub on the team because that's who that's what they put in right field is the guy who's you know the ball never comes to right field and yeah but did you play baseball in China like they were just learning I might have been in China you went to high school and you went to high school in China yeah I mean or or Australia like it was hey scrubs it was like we played the ball as it lies there I got a golf analogy for you too uh I was in China but that's where I'm gonna be our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better let's go to the next one most fun one-person business so the one that seems like the most fun to to work on I'll go first Joe Rogan so I'm pretty sure Joe Rogan's media Enterprise is bigger than all the late night talk shows combined so forget the Tonight Show Letterman and any of these whoever the new coming in whoever these guys are do the lettermen's been retired for 10 years Man Jimmy Fallon I don't know uh bro who's what who's watching this stuff his audience is bigger he makes uh hundreds of millions and uh he's made hundreds of millions doing it and I'm pretty sure it's just him and young Jamie I've heard from a few of my friends who have been on it how it works so basically they told me that it's Jamie who produces it and it's Joe and then they have one other guy named Matt I think and I forget his name exactly I think it was Matt and basically Matt sends Joe a list of like 30 people they're like hey I can get these 30 people these 30 let me know who you want and sometimes he just ignores it every once in a while say that person and that person and that's all he says and I've heard that it's just those three people that's amazing so I think most people just think oh Joe Rogan he's just a podcaster yeah he is a podcaster but that thing is a juggernaut it is a media Juggernaut so the you know Spotify obviously paid him you know hundreds of millions to to be there uh for a couple years but even before that you know just off the sponsorships off of uh off of the Alpha Brain you know um product that they build off of it Joe Rogan I think has the most fun probably of anyone on the planet it's my sense he took all of his Hobbies he's like oh I like UFC he gets to be the UFC commentator uh doing exactly what he would want he gets to go sit ringside commentate for these fights and analyze the fights but he only does it for the ones in Vegas that are an hour flight away from him he doesn't do any of the the ones that require a bunch of travel um and so all the bit he does all the best ones he does none of the worst ones uh you know he was like I want to do stand-up comedy so he does Stand Comedy sells out you know uh theaters all around the country and um you know gets to make people laugh for a living does this podcast where he's like I'm gonna have conversations with the people I want and people are like oh Joe three hours is too long he's like that's the type of conversation I want to have so I'm gonna do it my way and it worked and so like I just think he just dictated how he wants to live life on his terms I think he has the most fun I think his business is absolutely a mighty business in that it's just let's say one two to three people that uh is building a thing that does you know over 100 million dollars in Revenue which is like if you just valued something like that you know um traditionally which is not it's not Apples to Apples but like if you have a thing that can do 100 million a year in Revenue for multiple years for multiple years typically that's a billion dollar property and um you know obviously it's weird you can't really sell legit you know Joe Rogan Experience because you need him it's tightly branded with him but let's say at least he's built something worth 100 million dollars I think we can agree on that because it's generated 100 million of profit for him and so he's built you know with a very small team a multi-hundred million dollar business at the minimum and he has this new thing called The Comedy Mothership it's like a mile from my house in Austin and there's always a line out the door to get into that place yeah Comedy Club why not why not if you drive by it at six o'clock there's every single night there's been a line out the door to go there and it looks awesome right who you got most fun all right so scroll up to the very top of this dock I put a link in there it sounds like I'm trying to like promote Hampton I'm not it's just that when I had to prepare for this episode I just went through our database and like picked out people and we had just written a blog post about this guy his name's Joseph mambra and he started this company called gym streak and This Guy's super fascinating because he has all the attributes of like what a lot of these like Tinkers have but basically he's from Zimbabwe moved to England when he was like 12 or 13. that was the first time that he experienced the internet he taught himself how to code he taught himself design and then he launched this thing called gym streak at first it was just an app for tracking your workouts and then he what he did was he went and got his buddy to wear one of these like suits and that way he could do 3D visualizations of all the exercises and what they need to look like so he has hundreds of them and so his app it's free to use and they have some like premium thing and basically you track your workouts he uses AI to suggest which weights you should do for the next workout and if you don't know what the exercise does and they'll suggest workouts and exercises to do he has hundreds of these 3D models of like what a proper bicep curl or what this other type of exercise looks like in year one he did three hundred thousand dollars that was in the year 2021 in year two he did 2.5 million and his goal he says by in the next two years I want to get the 15 to 20 million dollars a year in revenue and he's the only employee I don't believe he has any contractors I think he he told me that he uh got most of his uh users from Facebook and Tick Tock ads and he hired a consultant in an agency to help him learn how to do that and right now he said I'm taking the summer off so our growth this year might still only be 2.5 or 3 million a year in Revenue but I because I don't feel like buying ads or staying on top of that so I'm taking the summer off because we just had a kid but it's super fascinating to see a guy who basically came from Zimbabwe didn't use the internet until he was 12 13 and taught himself how to do all this he's like one of those really cool Tinkers and on that blog post you can see pictures of him like arriving from Africa and like learning how to work the computer it's super fascinating you'll see pictures of him with his like iPhone and a laptop at the gym filming people doing like the curls so he can use his AI or whatever to like get the 3D imaging really fascinating company I think Jim streak is awesome if this could get to 15 or 20 million a year in Revenue like he thinks that would be a monster business for one person yeah that's an amazing story wow love that uh good for him that's that's really really cool um next category business we most want to own so this is um I think this is specifically a good question because for us a business we'd want to own would be the lowest maintenance business because neither of us want to really run an extra business right now so it's like which business would you want to own because it is very much uh you know autopilot so it's not design Joy it's not people are paying you and you're providing a subscription it's not one of those content or course businesses where you constantly have to create new content in order to stay relevant and get more customers um I think we both have the same one let's just do the same one that we we both are really interested you you explain it go for it no you go first all right milled.com so most people don't know mill.com it's m-i-l-led.com and it's a really really simple website it's just a compilation of email marketing that different companies do so if you want to see like what are my competitors sending for their fourth of July sale you just go to mill.com you search the brand and you'll see okay here's what Ridge wallet sent uh for their fourth of July uh email it's the top one on the on the Cyber site right now so it says you know you just click and it shows you the exact email that they sent so you can see the design you can see the offer you can see the copy and you could use that to get inspiration for what you should be doing for your email marketing and this guy built the site uh I don't know how long ago now but um he's post on Hacker News a little bit about it and it's one person it's a side project he does a million dollars a year on it he said I was I was doing email marketing for a brand I noticed two things one it took us several days to create each email blast um and two I had to subscribe to like dozens of other competitor emails just to do research for for them so my hypothesis was I could create a site that would just sign up for all the brands uh you know email newsletters and um and then make it easier for anybody who's trying to do email marketing right that's the uh that's that's the core core pitch for it and he's just been running it as a side project doesn't take much maintenance doesn't you know he could just do nothing on it for a little while and it makes money through ads yeah so so they use ads on the left side here you can see like I have it open and he's basically got like in a like a link to the brand itself and then he's got like a cyber security uh like ad here popped up below it he's got like a skincare ad yeah it's just display ads so but here's another way how he makes money so basically you're a marketer you go to milled and you want to see like uh it looks like some shoe brand they run they ran this campaign and you want to check out the email and you read it and get inspired whatever you click that ad and it takes you to the shoe company and it's using an affiliate link if you buy some of the shoes right this is a horrible way to monetize this is a a really amazing product under model under monetized website for sure but good for him for getting the traffic in the first place but that's a horrible way to monetize yeah yeah I agree uh but I think the guy doesn't care he's just like this is easy that's cool uh low maintenance which is why I put it in my one I'd want to own because it's low maintenance and I think it still has a lot of upside uh left I'll do one for one I want to own so I said anything that is like marketplacey uh sort of like a Marketplace because sometimes if you do it right those don't they don't run themselves entirely but the the community kind of handles the business uh built with so built what was started in 2015 or 16 probably built with is like the most Niche [ __ ] ever but there's it's a really big Niche so you go to built with in order to see which plugins a website is using if they are using Wordpress and the reason why that's important is you go to a website that you like and you go oh I love this feature they have let's go inside without WordPress Shopify also that's new it started with just WordPress I think um and so you're like just tell me like the plugins and tell me the the everything that they're using Shopify and built with uh Shopify and WordPress it has something like tens of millions of people going there a month and does at the time when I first found them I think in 2020 I think they were doing 14 15 million in Revenue with just one person so I think that would be a really cool company to own because I think it's super valuable once you get all that traffic and those people coming back to you all the time I think it's a really valuable site do you know anything about built with yeah uh just what you told what you said there I've been using it for a long time basically if you see a website you want to know what they use for whatever they use just go to build with it's pretty great uh it's kind of like a data it's almost like a data Index right it's like more like a database than it is a Marketplace in a way uh but I agree it's kind of amazing um all right let's keep going we got a couple categories left we have a rookie of the year so a new one a new a new one that we found I think you might have already covered yours uh in here but dude it's boring I didn't want to say the same thing twice but this guy Joe mombre this Joseph mombre like I love his story I think that this guy's gonna be a big deal and I and I take a lot of Pride to try to find people before they're like really popular I think he's read the blog post that I that I have linked up there from the Hampton site it's really good I think this guy's Gonna Be A Winner so that's my Rookie of the Year what's only finders only finders is mine so this is one that I don't know how old it is maybe a couple years old now um so only finders is a search engine for only fans so if you want to find a type of model on only fan so you you know you're into you know blonde agents or like you know whatever good looking midgets whatever whatever you're into you can search on only finders and it'll give you a list of top ranked profiles for that thing so as you know I've been down the only fans Rabbit Hole where I'm like I think there's a lot of potential in the only fans uh world of like businesses and this was one of them that I found and um only finders run by one guy he's awesome he listens to the pod he um and he crushes it so he crushes the SEO game for for only fans if you search for a bunch of different popular searches um and in fact actually what what he did was smart which is he didn't want to just rank for like the general uh searches like best only fans or something like that like he wants the high intent ones so he wants the person who's searching for like whatever I don't know what people search for but like redhead yeah redhead if you go to his site if you go to his site you could you click the button on the right hand and it says like what the top searches are so it's like Indian uh he ranks really high for the categories that people are that's like clearly people's thing and it's like I don't know what your thing is but I got if you got a thing I got it for you and because of that those are really really high intense searches and then what he does on the other side is he goes to only fans models and agencies and he says hey if you want more traffic I have tons of people searching for your exact thing pay me per click for every person I send to you so he's basically recreated Google it's a search engine where you get paid per click to send a somebody with intent to your to your to your site and um he could do it he does a really really good job and only fans does not have a discover section on purpose they decided they don't want to be in the discovery business they want to only be in the uh like the kind of the underlying tools underneath these Creator profiles and this is insane and it's just been surfing the growth of only fans which has grown like exponentially like only fans a few years ago was very small uh you know five years whatever four five years ago it's very small and then it got bigger bigger it's like sort of like I mean the curve looks looks unreal like only fans is bigger than twitch it's bigger than like some of these massive websites uh now and it generates a lot of money like they pay out billions to creators uh on the platform and so if you can be part of that ecosystem it's valuable that's interesting I have now met multiple people and only fans that you've never heard of girls that are doing between one and two million a month on their profile because their body is the cogs so there's it's all profit basically they have like you know usually they have like a they'll they'll have like some of them as you get bigger you have like a agency that manages it so what are they doing with this money they're just they have huge income and how long do you think can they do it for five years three years yeah and it's funny that someone kind of exit they burn out and they'll just sell their light name likeness and photo library and be like you run it and just give me a web show give me 50. it's like Bruce Springsteen that's what he did the same thing the boss uh this is insane I I don't know much I I don't know much about this [ __ ] uh this is absolutely insane the engagement on these things are wild if you have a holy fans business reach out to me shot at seanpuri.com I want to invest in only fans businesses that are just cash flow are they cool like when you met these they're cool the problem is they're very hard to sell and they're very easy to be killed and so they need kind of like strategy on like no I mean the girls oh I don't know I don't know you said you hung out with a couple of them and I hang out with them I just talked to them yeah they're nice people I don't know that's insane how did you get in touch with them it's the internet bro what do you mean you know I've how many times on here have I talked about only fans and then people basically like oh you're into that so that they email you and then they they probably have a million Indian guys like dming them uh I mean that's insane this is inside um I don't go through you know when you see a big line at the front door you don't you know you don't go wait in that line you have to go find a side door and the side door is generally you know some some dude who listens to our podcast that runs their business or as their manager and that's kind of like the way in all right let's that if we do or the last category is the worst of the best I have a different one but I would have to say only fans would be up there but I have another one the worst one is this is these are all cool businesses but which which one's our least favorite so uh yours is gonna be only fans no uh I mean it would be but I already had something else Kevin Van Trump so Kevin Van Trump I met this guy Sean likes him a lot now uh I met him in 2000 and 2018. I was at a conference and Kevin Van Trump is like six feet tall and he's like really big he's like a very very large overweight guy and he walks up to me and he's got this super thick accent he goes hey what's up man how you doing like he just starts talking to me and I'm like this guy's so confident and it starts talking about all my newsletters and the hustle and all this stuff and he's got this thick accent he's wearing a Ramones t-shirt and he's got like Converse on he just looks like a like a like a like a Walmart guy and then like he dropped he drops like one or two lines where for some reason we talked about art but he was like oh yeah that Picasso I got one of them some [ __ ] like he said something like that I was like what so I let it slide and then I go how many subscribers are on your your newsletter and he goes like Oh 60 000 and he goes hey how much you guys charge for yours and I go oh it's free we make money on ads you charge it goes yeah we charge like 300 a month I forget exactly what it was and I like do the math in my head and I'm like wait that's 20 million dollars a year he goes yeah it's something like that I don't even know and I started hanging out with him and he basically this guy's name is Kevin vandtrump he's got this newsletter where he talks about agriculture and like how it impacts commodity prices and it he's brilliant and I get to know him a little bit more and you're like oh no you just have a Southern accent he like was a Wall Street like Trader the guy's brilliant he's amazing and he lives in Kansas City and I've done a zoom call with him and you see like he's got like these custom built motorcycles in the back of his like house and he's got like all these picassos and [ __ ] the guy's killing it but that same day when I hung out with them I was like hey you know go get dinner he's like yeah I can go get dinner we we hang out at 8 30 he goes hey man I gotta run I gotta write tomorrow's newsletter and I was like what he goes I do it every day I've done it every day for 10 years I go what do you mean every day he goes six days a week I send a newsletter and it's 2 000 plus words it's really long he does it every day and he was making all this money I don't think I would trade lights with him though just to have all that money I had the same answer I think he's amazing you put me on to him I met him and his son such awesome people so like they're awesome super fun so awesome just fun to be around smart uh really nice just kind people don't like you know no no pretense about them um and same thing he was hosting Farm con I went because you had told me about him and introduced me to him and when when I go there he's we're at the conference called Farm con he's got Farm con which is like the biggest farming conference get together so I go to Kansas and I and was it awesome yeah it was amazing and I'm there and we're talking it's like 11 at night it's like the whole event's done everyone's at the bar every single person is drinking a beer every single person is drinking a beer and uh he's like I gotta get up gotta get up to the bedroom gotta I gotta go back to my room real quick right there right tomorrow's Edition and I was like wait you write it yourself still and he's like yeah I write it I've written it myself by hand every night and he started this thing more than 10 years ago like I think he said like it's almost like 20 years basically he's been writing this thing 18 years or something insane every day almost yeah and it's long too it's not like just some cookie cutter like here's Three Links that are interesting it's like no drone Powell came down said this but and he said this said that you know here's how this is going to affect corn Futures and here's what I'm I'm betting over here and then there's a bunch of memes it's amazing basically his market analysis for like crap you know crop and commodities and then it's a bunch of memes underneath it and he's like nope never do ads um Isaac I just wanted to build as much trust as I can in this community and uh so I never advertise I I charge for it and uh that's why we have Farm con so everybody shows up is because you know they I built a lot of trust over the over the years and I learned more about business from that guy in like one hour than I did in my entire like four-year education at Duke like he said to me he said a bunch of things that I loved I put this in my my newsletter I did a feature on him that I wrote a bunch of the lessons but one of them that he said was he goes yeah the content's cool but he's like being he goes being an investor is the best job in the world you kidding me uh he's like and he just said it so matter of fact that he's like there is no better job in the world than being an investor it is it is the best and you sort of think about that you're like all right well that sounds you know whatever I guess kind of obvious and it's like okay if that's true then how do you get into that job like if if that is true for you um how do you architect your life to get there because he's basically just like look this newsletter is great yeah question makes a lot of money but I wish I was just an investor uh it would have been a better better better choice blah blah they talked about investing because he I think he was on Wall Street before he started doing what he was doing yeah and he goes um he goes you know one thing I only he goes I was early into Bitcoin I was early into Facebook I was like really and he's like yeah he's like I wasn't as early as I could have been he's like but there's always uh he's like I got into Bitcoin like in 20 he's like we started hearing about it at Farm con like in 2013 2014 I didn't buy it till 2015 2016. I should have been in it right when I first heard it he's like same thing with Facebook he goes one one lesson I learned in investing he goes um he goes two two lessons for you in investing number one the best trades are gonna be ones where bones where you buy them you put them in the drawer you never think about them again he's like he's like that was the best thing I did about Bitcoin I bought Bitcoin I put it in the drawer never thought about it again heard all the news didn't care it's in the drawer and I was like damn in the drawer that's a cool concept of like what investments can you just have the conviction and you put in the drawer you say I'm not gonna react to the Daily News cycle about this investment I'm gonna let the 10 years play out on this investment because it was a let's see what happens on the long-term type of BET um second thing he said was he goes uh you always get a second chance to get on the train with the best investments there's always a second chance on the train he's like with Bitcoin you know you think you missed it and then the price will come down that's your chance to get back on the train and most people by that time you know they spend the whole way up wishing they had got on the train train comes back around and they get scared they don't get back on yeah same thing happened with Facebook Facebook you know we had our chances uh when it was Private then it goes public it goes up up crashed back down to 19 I got back on the track that train came around I got right back on and he's like yo that will happen for the best investments and I sort of look for this now of like uh how do you override the psychology that most people have which is when it's going up you wish you had gotten in earlier then when it crashes down you're too afraid to buy in because you feel like oh [ __ ] is it over did it pop is it did I miss it um was I wrong and it's like well then you lose lose you know you want to buy on the way up and you don't want to buy on the way down that's that's a recipe for being poor right like you know buy High don't buy low right that's not gonna work and so uh those two little lessons were ones that stuck out for me but this guy's business is amazing he's an amazing guy and the reason he's amazing among other things is he breaks all the stereotypes he you you'll think that he's just this like hickey guy just like people used to think about me uh and like I grew up around people just like him turns out he's like brilliant he'll he'll like you're like you're gonna talk to me about Facebook and he knows way more about it than you do he'll probably knows all about Bitcoin I mean the guy's brilliant and uh I love hanging out with him and his friends because you it teaches you like I'm a [ __ ] idiot for judging people a certain way these guys are all badass dude and they're fun as [ __ ] I did a call the other day with another guy so uh another guy from Farm con same same sort of guy he's this uh white guy maybe I don't know it is 50s ish something like that was he Super Rich because so many of those guys are super rich and I think this guy I don't know how racist guy private jet rich I don't know how rich this guy is but the guy who introduced me to him was just like yeah this guy's worth you know 300 500 million dollars personally and I was like Wow uh okay that's crazy because I was like I was like do his deals like he's always talking about these deals like does he actually make money on these like is he had it track record of success he's like yeah he has um so this guy this guy's got phrases for days so I I have this doc that I keep on my phone I call phrases except somebody says something that's just like funny or worded well it just sticks out to me it's a Punchy phrase I write it down at Farm con I filled out my phrases thing like because there were so many so this one guy um I don't want to say his name put him on blast but he uh he was at a dinner with uh says Kevin vantrum and this guy was at the dinner it was like a private dinner at the at Farm con and uh he stands up and he goes everyone on the table is doing introductions and sit there I'm like you know how I am Sean and yeah I work in Tech and uh just [ __ ] kill me I guess I'm boring like you know like that's basically like how I felt during the introduction this guy stands up he goes yeah my name's so and so he goes um you know uh he goes exactly where he said he goes he goes uh I don't know who won the World Series I don't know who won the World Series I can't tell you how to get a six-pack abs hell I don't even know where the remote is in my house but I know one thing I know how to structure deals and today I'm gonna tell you guys about a deal that I'm doing and you're like gave this intro and I was like what did he Crush I was like what an incredible way to introduce yourself I don't know where the remote is but I know one thing I know deals and I was like that is incredible then he's uh he's talking about how old he is he goes he cut me in half there's gonna be a lot of rings that's the best nice and then he goes and then I did a call with him the other day and uh I get on the zoom call and I had just finished my workout and my trainer was like insisting because I was like dude I gotta run I gotta be on this call he's like all right just take your call but let's do your like kind of like we try to do like this like myofascial like kind of like you're rolling like a like a foam roller type of thing like you're you're kind of like foam rolling out at the end so we were doing it and he's like just do it while you're on the call foam rolled with this guy so I get on the call I turn on the video and I'm like yeah I'm gonna show them what's going on so I'm like sorry if uh sorry this looks weird I'm doing like some stretching yes the big dude he goes okay cool if uh if it looks like I'm stretching call 9-1-1 because I'm having a stroke dude why would you take a call like that incredible win like to have that line immediately ready when I say you know that I'm stretching if sorry if it looks weird I'm trying to I was like wow that was literally so [ __ ] funny to me I was blown away I was like I don't care what else happens on this call that that was so impressive so good what state did he live in uh he's in Tennessee I think what the hell is a deal struck I don't even know what that means like he like he does he's like private Equity so he buys companies um but he's like I just know how to find a great deal how to put the financing together and how to structure it so that like I get the maximum value out of these deals it's kind of like what he does um and like you know I'm like so I was like I was like you know what um uh I was like have you done any deals like that I would have heard of and he's like you know Disneyland I was like yeah he's like a lot of Windows in Disneyland we do all the windows in Disneyland so oh my God they bought a window company got him a Disney contract we do all the windows at Disney do what with the windows like clean them this guy's incredible what's yours for uh world uh worst of the best um I had both design joy and the Kevin Trump just because of the time thing so I love that Kevin vantrope has built like this this amazing power niche in the farming industry but I uh I would not want to be the guy who has to write the newsletter every night because the pressure is it's got to go out tomorrow morning I felt that during milk Road for a month and I was like nope not doing it this way yeah although I think if I was him I would just find a way to hire somebody to do that like I can't believe he hasn't done that yet um does Ben Thompson still do I haven't read this oh yeah so Ben Thompson is my version of that so he does strategory and every day he writes a newsletter about basically the same four things and I don't even know how he does that like he talks about Facebook Google Amazon Apple Netflix and like what's going like the kind of the business and strategy of what they're doing they're so long these are so long he does this daily long form his audience is like has the highest bar his audience is like the smartest people in the tech industry uh like you know VCS and all that that's who reads him every morning so he's got to come with like original content that's super smart about the same topics he's been doing this for like a decade and he makes three million dollars a year roughly doing this office paid and he only charges 120 a year yeah I think he upped his price I don't know what it is now but he like did raise his prices at some point 120 um it's 12 I think it was 100 and now it's 120. a month uh for this thing you know but but he's you know I think Ben's awesome uh so I don't beat it as a knock for him I'm saying I would hate the pressure of the daily super insightful thing that I have to write every every morning original content about like the same kind of like 10 companies is uh I don't I literally don't even know how he does it if somebody told me they're gonna do that I'd be like what are you saying this makes no sense and uh he does it every day sitting in Taiwan this is the worst this is the worst it is it is amazing um but um yeah I would never want to do this um so what do we think that I wonder what I want to know the listener if they think that these one all in depth on one topic if they dig this if they dig the award category style or the award style what do you think yeah this is an experiment for us of like doing a few focused episodes themed episodes so today's theme was these one or two person businesses that crush it um do you like this or do you like the freestyle freestyle's a lot easier this one takes a lot of work but if people love this you got to go in the YouTube comments and show us if we should do more of these or no uh we're cool either way but this is an experiment so let us know in the YouTube comments dude I stressed out for so long doing this these These are these are emotional for me can I give some takeaways because I don't think we did that uh I think we should do some takeaways all right so here's my my quick takeaways the most common Industries you see these one to two person businesses that Crush are uh just like thought leader on it on social media so just putting out free content on social media e-commerce we didn't do any Ecom ones in this but like there's a bunch of e-commerce that could do like you know a million dollars a year in profit that are run with one or two people and then you can do agencies for everything else um games so we talked about stardew Valley Minecraft there's a bunch of games that are built like this um apps and plugins so plug-ins on top of things like a figma plug-in a Google Sheets plugin a Gmail plug-in that sort of thing and then data aggregators like built with which are basically compiling data like mill.com compiling bunch of things that are of the same thing so it's you go search and you find what you want uh because they've aggregated everything only finder same thing it's a data aggregator um strategy so here's a couple strategy points you need to be either amazing 100 awesome at distribution meaning you're the influencer you're the content creator or you need to be 100 awesome on product you're the guy coding the game and and you'll you'll hire a publisher to do the publishing and so I think that if I was going to do this if I was gonna try to make this happen I would say where can I be either an incredible at distribution or incredible that product and I want to just like put all of my emphasis on that um in order to make this happen the next one you need attributes so a lot of these we made sound simple but you gotta have some attributes some skill copywriting design uh you know the ability like investment judgment market analysis like you got to be expert on one of these things if you're gonna make this happen and so you know you got to get to that expert master master of your craft level if you're gonna do this uh the last one it's all about leverage so the way you can get a one or two person company to get to Millions tens of millions or even some of the examples we gave were hundreds of millions of dollars um was leveraged so you need to be using code uh build it once and then it runs as software you need to use uh media like podcasts or newsletters or whatever or you need to use Capital because you're not going to use labor right like most companies use labor that's why they have hundreds of people working for them but if you're going to not have hundreds of people working you got to use these other forms of Leverage code Capital some money or media are your tools of choice you got to figure out which of those three can I use and that's how I'm going to do it and the beauty of it is because of the internet if you're the best at X you now get to sell to the whole world so like we didn't give an example Miss Excel so miss Excel is this girl who goes on Tick Tock and she in a high energy way dances and tells it teaches you how to use Excel like Microsoft Excel better and she's the best in the world at teaching Excel it turns out the best of the world of teaching Excel is you know how to do the pop you know the useful stuff and you can dance turns out that's what the best teacher of excel look like and she now gets to teach the entire world Excel like the best of anything gets to is to provide that product service or education to everybody that's the beauty of of the internet and so you need to figure out how to become the best of X because and then just make it available to everybody and the last thing I I was going to say was it's [ __ ] lonely like the best times that I have in work is when I'm whether it's in the trenches and like it's a shitty day or it's a great day is celebrating with co-workers these jobs are lonely I'm actually surprised when I hear about this about like how they are able to push like I push myself because oh I have Milds to feed or I want to be held accountable by these other people and make them proud it's really hard to push yourself this hard and to think big when you're by yourself and it's just hard to do this every day alone so hopefully you have like a good spouse or a significant other or something because it's just challenging I I mean when I started this I was like oh I want to be a solo solopreneur I wanted to be a solopreneur or they call it a solo capitalist I raised a fund and it's like I want to be a solar capitalist and I was like oh this isn't fun at all to do this by yourself yeah and not only is it not that good to do things by yourself because you know a little bit of help can go a long way a complimentary person who's good at the things you're not good at is really really useful but on top of that it ain't no fun and like most of life is the journey not the destination and you don't want to have the shitty Journey for this awesome destination and so very quickly I was like yeah this is a duopreneur this is being bad doing this or in the fun it's me and rameen doing this and I basically immediately was like I'm gonna do this even my econ business I gave a chunk of it to a guy who was smarter than me and had done this before and would give me some money and I was like why just because like I don't want to be reporting into myself and only like have myself as a thought partner to be sparring with on ideas about this I want to have somebody awesome just to do some you know idea jousting on this and so uh I think doing it by yourself is honestly a terrible idea you should definitely try to get one other person to do this I think two people is the is the sweet spot where you get sort of the the most autonomy and the least like management headaches and you have uh you still get the most [ __ ] done and have a lot of fun along the way all right that's the Pod whether you're listening on iTunes or Spotify or whatever go to uh search my first million on YouTube and go to the comments on this video and actually let us know we'll read them and see if we should keep doing these that's it [Music] [Music]

foreign [Music] for the past 10 years I've been keeping this little notebook with a scratch pad that I call you see that money wisdom reminders to self and these are basically just anytime I heard something I read something or I learned something that was wise about wealth I would write it down and I put all the notes here and today I'm going to read you a bunch of the things that are in this notebook and um you know I feel like I could do that because in most places you can't really talk about money money is sort of this tacky taboo thing you're not supposed to everybody has to pretend they don't care about money but we all do which is weird um but you know you just have to treat it like this the silent fart in the room you gotta pretend pretend you didn't care about it pretend it's not there uh but it's there and this channel luckily is different there's a channel where we come we talk about business talk about money you're talking about mindset we talk about a bunch of different things that are interesting to us and really the only people who click on this channel are people that care about those things and so it's like when you go to the gym you can flex and talk about your pecs because the other people there care about that sort of stuff and uh so you know it's understood so this is the money wisdom Channel I think in the next 15 minutes I don't think this will be long I'll be able to go through a bunch of the Nuggets I call Golden nuggets that I had written down in this so the first one I'll start with this the rich aren't just lucky so pretend we took all the money that existed and we redistributed it out everybody got the same you know let's say a hundred thousand dollars to start with ten years later I think that most of the rich people would be rich again because wealth building is a skill and it can be learned and uh for most people you want to learn this skill but you don't really know where to start and I'll give the uh I write down these sort of three shifts these big big small shifts that you can make what is a big small shift so I'll give you a quick story um a man wants to learn golf so he goes out and he buys a you know set of golf clubs and he goes to the driving range starts hitting some balls and you know it's going left it's going right some are going to the center you can't really control it doesn't know how to doesn't know how to do it he just started and um so he's like okay I need to build this skill but uh I don't know how you know I don't know what I'm doing to be honest and so he sees like you know in the in the right next to him in the driving range there's a coach teaching a kid so he walks over he tells the coach hey I'd love to learn coach says happy to work with you first lessons tomorrow morning okay so he shows up again tomorrow morning you know this coach teaches them a few things another coach you know he's sort of a you know he's maybe 24 years old he's he himself just graduated from college you know he's not the best in the world he's just the guy standing next to him um but still it helps he's hitting it a bit better but not much the ball's still going left and right and you know the man thinks to himself yeah this coach sucks I don't want this crappy this guy's a kid's coach I need a real Coach and so he says you know what I'm gonna hire the best who is the best coach he goes and finds a professional golfer to be his coach this coach gives us some instructions within a few minutes he's hitting the ball straight it's going great um and so he says all right I'm ready to go play tomorrow I'm playing a full 18 holes of golf let's do this shows up the next day and he's ready to hit the ball straight again but today things are going different today it's slicing left it's slicing right and he's getting frustrated and the worst part the thing that's frustrating him the most is that the coach's not saying anything he sort of expects the coach to jump in and fix it but he coaches just watching so finally he turns around he says hey coach are you gonna you're gonna do something you're just gonna stand there all right like look at me I'm way off I gotta do so I gotta change something and the coach Just Smiles coach says you know you think you're way off but you're really only two millimeters off he said coach no offense I know you're the expert here but pretty sure I'm off by more than two millimeters the ball's gone 100 yards into the lake here and the coach says yeah yeah I understand that the outcome might be far off but all you you're only off by two millimeters you just need a two millimeter shift you see because when your golf club hits the ball if it's two millimeters angled in the wrong direction it will completely change the trajectory of where a ball is going right a small shift in the angle here is going to take us in a completely different direction and so he just shows him a couple tweaks watch where you're where you're hitting the ball look at the face of the of the club so he makes the adjustment takes a swing Nails it and um you know I heard this story first from Tony Robbins and um I don't know I don't know if it's real or fake or whatever but I love the idea because it really rang true to me most things in life even if you're far off in your outcome you're actually just only a small shift in your approach away because that's what changes your trajectory so here's the small two millimeter shifts that I think most people need to make um this was after all the money wisdom I collected they all kind of bucketed into these three shifts that you can make shift number one hard work to Smart work uh growing up we're all pretty much told hard work is the key to success our teachers tell us this our parents tell us this but we gotta ask is this really true because I look outside I see the lawn guy mowing the lawn and working in the summer heat he's working hard or you go into any restaurant go to the back of the kitchen look at the line Cooks those guys are working hard they're working crazy hours it's hot out there it's difficult they're on their feet all day they work you know Saturdays and Sundays because the restaurant doesn't stop they work hard and you know you start to think about it like well if hard work equals success then why doesn't my janitor driving a Bentley right because what you work on and who you work with is what matters it matters a lot more than how hard you work so again what you work on the thing you actually choose to do and who you work with will make a far bigger impact in your trajectory than just hard work in fact there is hard work does help but it's maybe the fifth or sixth most important factor in my opinion uh I do think there's sort of a minimum like you need to work hard enough but beyond hard enough there's not really like a maximum you should be chasing the goal is not to work as hard as you possibly can okay so what should you actually work on right I said that's the most important thing well uh Naval ravacott says it best he says you want to find the thing that feels like play to you and work to others and you should keep dabbling until you find that because at first you might say well what feels like play to me is watching Netflix okay cool that feels like play to you but it doesn't look like work to others and so you have to find the thing that is play to you work to others for me for example it's business stuff so I am a nerd I love reading about learning about businesses I like to go you know if a stock is if a company's gonna go public I'll go read the S1 I want to read all about the inner workings of the business to most people they see this 100 page PDF it's like you're digging through to find the balance sheet or the p l statement for for what dude you're is your boss telling you to do this no I actually enjoy doing that but to others it would seem like work and so that's a kind of a sweet spot you want to identify and really lean into those types of moments or this podcast some people get really nervous about public speaking or it seems like a lot of work or wow you gotta you gotta come up with something you know an hour worth of stuff to say every two days about business and don't you feel a lot of pressure no no this feels like play to me and so if it feels like work to others but it feels like play to you those are the That's The Sweet Spot that's what you're looking for for some people that's programming programming could be you know a joy to some people and it's a pain to others for some people it's writing like I love writing other people hate writing they think writing is just they still have Trauma from school they can't stand writing um you know for my trainer it's exercise after he trains me and you know four other people he's been in the gym for six hours straight where does he go when he's done to the gym because he wants to get his workout in it's crazy like that you know for him exercise and being in the gym feels like play whereas to others it would feel exhausting it feel like work hell Marie condo loves cleaning she made that her thing she loves cleaning uh but that feels like work to me and many others so you gotta find that thing uh why does this matter because when it feels like play you'll do it a lot not just nine to five you'll do it from five to nine too you'll just do it all the time any available moment you have your brain will go in that direction because it's something you enjoy doing so much and because you enjoy doing it you'll keep doing it you can do it for a long period of time even if you're not getting immediate results right there's many things that we will do if we get immediate results it's the things you're willing to do even without immediate results that lead to these big wins in the end and uh you know you know what they call the guy who practices all the time and never gives up right so somebody who does it all the time and can do it for for a long period of time the best that's what they call the guy they call him the best and the best always gets paid in any field the best plumber gets paid the best then he gets paid the best whatever you are gets paid and so you want to find the thing that feels like play to you because it will help you become the best shift number two so we've gone from hard work to Smart work and that's finding the thing that feels like play to you and work to others now shift number two is you want to go from being far away from money to hanging out with money so let's pretend you want to get a six-pack to get a six-pack to get abs you need to start thinking and acting like somebody who already has a six-pack right like they make certain choices about how they eat they make certain choices about with like you know if you travel with somebody who's fit they got in their bags and protein powder resistance bands they'll pick a hotel based on the gym they make decisions you don't make because they have a certain set of priorities and habits that you don't have so you got to sort of think like a fit person to act like a fit person then you become a fit person same goes for wealth you gotta think like a wealthy person act like a wealthy person and then you become a wealthy person most people get this wrong they laugh about this like oh so I should just that guy Rich guys by you know Ferrari so I should go buy Ferrari not really you want to find their habits not their extravagances right not their indulgences you want to find their habits you want to hang around with them so that you understand what their habits are the small things they do on a day-to-day basis that make them who they are and you need to start doing them so you need to shift your way of thinking to match the type of person that you want to become all right so how do you how do you start thinking like a wealthy person well you got to hang out with them but how do you hang out with them right like um you know you they may not be around you you know what if you don't know anybody so there's three ways the first is peers so you want to find you know five people with the same dream as you right do you know five people who have the same dream as you who are taking it as seriously as you or more seriously you want to find those people you need to create a group chat you need to create a weekly dinner hell move into a house together do whatever it takes when I wanted to get good at poker I literally lived with a bunch of other people who are trying to get good at poker and all day we're all playing poker we're all talking poker over our meals we're thinking about poker we're asking each other for questions we're getting inspired by somebody else's success we're getting bitter about that guy's success but it makes us work harder you want to immerse yourself in an immersive environment where you're going to get better and so get as close to it as you can living together is the best if you can't do living together get dinners together if you get dinners you're getting a group chat together do whatever it takes um the second one is mentors so you got your peers now you want your mentors this is somebody who's already done it you can learn from them the trick here is really simple what most people do wrong is they go and ask for you to be their Mentor here's what you actually want to do you want to find somebody who's already done it you want to ask them a specific question hey I'm dealing with this situation right now I needed it I need to decide between A and B here's what I'm thinking um could you give me any uh you know advice on this decision between A and B how would you think about this then whatever they say you go take Massive Action on it and then you follow up you say hey you tell me that thing here's how here's what happened you know it either really worked or really didn't work here's what I'm doing next is you repeat it you do that three times with somebody they're kind of informally your Mentor anyways you never need to ask them to sort of like you know be in a relationship with you it'll just happen naturally by being somebody who asks to ask specific questions so don't ask them for their time ask them for their specific advice then actually take action on it and then the key follow up if you repeat that you'll have mentors okay the next way you hang out with money you got to change your information diet so if you're already listening to this podcast or watching this video on YouTube congratulations you're already doing it but you need to ask people who have achieved what you want what do you listen to what do you follow what do you read uh what are your favorite YouTube channels uh you know my greatest teachers are people I've never met this is people that I follow from Twitter and books and podcasts and YouTube they've made the biggest impact on me you don't you don't need to actually physically necessarily hang out with everybody for them to make an impact but like let's say you listen to this podcast we released two maybe three episodes a week each episode's about an hour so you're hearing us for two or three hours a week that's more than most people talk to their mom that's more than most people talk to their friends that's more than most people talk to anybody so you bringing this conversation into your world is changing the type of conversations that you're having you start to change your conversations it'll change your thinking change your thinking it'll change your actions change your actions you change your results that's how it goes so um these are the three ways that you can hang out start to hang out with wealth um there's one other one that I didn't mention here which is when you hang out with wealth literally you get around people who've done what you did it gives your imagination more food so when you like I remember the first time I went to a really rich person's house and I'm like wow he's got a chef and he's got like oh this this guy just came over just did that for them oh interesting oh they're saying that they travel once a month to go do this thing and this charity thing that they do that sounds really fulfilling you know those stories sounded awesome it taught me like how to how to figure out what to even want and what's possible what's achievable because when you see it it's a lot more realistic than just thinking about it or hearing about it like you know beliefs are good but an experience is always better and so just hanging out with people who already have wealth gives you a sort of these all these like subconscious cues it makes things feel more realistic it gives you different things that you dream about maybe you don't care about a car like for me I never cared about cars but maybe I wanted uh like I always thought I wanted courtside seats at an NBA game then I saw a rich person with a chef and I was like screw the game I want a chef that seems awesome right healthy tasty food that's being made by somebody else saves you time that's that's unbelievable so that's you know that's the one other thing about hanging out with money all right shift number three going from small swings to Fat pitches and I love saying fat pitches all right so common mistake most people make they take small swings like uh they take the first good offer that comes their way the first good job or the first good deal they start too many projects at once I've definitely been guilty of that before uh they chase shiny objects so oh I'm doing this thing oh there's a new thing go over there um you can do anything but you just can't do everything this is a hard lesson to learn in life you can do anything but you can't do everything you know um and the beauty of this is you don't have to do everything so Warren Buffett one of the wealthiest men in the world one of the best investors in the world he missed the whole internet wave like the last 20 years has basically been dominated by the tech industry they missed it that's all right he still ended up doing great why because he understands Coke and Geico his fat pitch was companies like that that were in his zone of competence things he understood that he was able to act on and he you can get rich anyway right the beauty of it is you only got to get rich one way you don't have to get everything right you just gotta get one thing right to be rich um Ted Williams one of the greatest baseball hitters ever he was famous for waiting for the fat pitch he would sort of map out the strike zone he said all right all these are strikes but you notice that you know when it's dead center I hit 400 but if I try to hit on the edge of the strike zone I'm only hitting 230. and so what made the difference between Ted the greatest hitter ever and you know the average or even above average hitter was that they would swing at the two you know the the pitches where they would average 230 whereas he would only swing at the pitches where he'd average 400 right that was his attempt uh to to wait for the fat pitch and only focus on hitting those and Warren Buffett takes this even further for investing so he says unlike baseball there's no called strikes and investing you can literally sit there and pass on 50 opportunities straight just waiting for your fat pitch and um and you know somebody asked him you know what does a fat pitch look like here's what here's what Warren had to say about that he says if you look at the stock exchange it's high you know for the last 12 months will be you know maybe 150 higher than the low uh the lowest you know you know the low part of the stock market he says all you have to do is sit there and wait until there's something really attractive that you understand and you can forget about everything else that's a wonderful game to play in there's almost nothing where the game is stacked in your favor like the stock market but the problem is people start listening to everybody on TV or whatever talking or they may read the paper whatever and they take this advantage that you can wait for something you really like that you really understand and pounce and they turn it into a disadvantage there's no easier game than stocks but you just have to be sure you don't play it too often and that's the mistake that people make they play too often they swing too many times they don't wait for the fat pitch and that's why their returns go down uh you know the first 10 years of your career you probably don't even know what a fat pitch looks like even if it was to hit you in the face so my advice for most people is the first 10 years just go work this with the smartest highest energy most resourceful people you can find go into Emerging Markets or exciting fields and just try to do exciting work work with exciting people because doing that is what's going to train your gut to actually notice fat pitches if you're doing that you're reflecting consistently you're looking back you're saying all right what did I learn last year what looking back what should I have actually been focused on last year you'll start to learn oh wow there was all these like opportunities that were coming my way that I actually didn't recognize to be as good of an opportunity as they were um and so you got to spend those first 10 years like that to hone your gut and then after that you'll be able to notice those fat Pages some common things about like what is a fat pitch what does that mean so like a platform shift like when the iPhone first came out there's an app store all of a sudden there was this new computer in everyone's pocket and nobody had built apps yet that was a fat pitch waiting to happen anybody who jumped on that like Instagram back then they were able to do very well Law changes uh so anytime there's a rule of regulatory change that creates opportunity uh if there's a new tech you know technological breakthrough like AI right now um you know what people are doing building on top of chat GPT or gpt4 uh that's a fat pitch uh Market panics so anytime the market just panics and sells everything well everything's on sale that's a good opportunity to buy great companies another one is working at a generational company early on so if you saw Facebook in 2004 to 2008 you could go in and be like look it doesn't even matter that this is uh and how much I'm gonna make off this you just want to be on that rocket ship and so there's one of these you know one or two of these every decade and being a part of them is you know that's a fat pitch the other one is when somebody owns something but they don't realize what it's worth you know they they have an asset but they don't really understand it fully or they don't have the right lens but you do you know what you can do with it this happens on real estate all the time somebody's sitting on a building uh it's only rented out for this much so they sell it at a fair price for what it's worth but another guy comes in and says I know that I can get a new permit to Zone this for multi-family and I can build more units on top and so he's selling it at what he thinks is a fair price but to me it's actually a steal because I have asymmetric information um that word asymmetric matters asymmetric information is when you know things that others don't asymmetric uh upside is when let's say you invest in a startup and a startup you know you invest a hundred dollars the most it can lose is your hundred dollars but startups when they win they could be 100x or thousand extra turns that's asymmetric upside you can win a lot more than you can lose and so you want to look for opportunities where you have either asymmetric information or asymmetric upside as a general rule of thumb for how you how you invest now of course the likelihood of success matters right like every startup's not going to 100x or thousand X so you want to find those where the probability of them working and the upside make it worth doing okay uh the other part about fat pitches you got to swing hard most people take weak half swings uh they make a couple of calls or they uh you know they send you one email but they don't follow up or you even give them an opportunity they don't follow through um you know don't just sit there and just look or just bunt right you gotta really swing and so winners follow up winners double down on what's working winners uh get on the next flight out to go meet you in person and the way I say it is intensity is the strategy most people want the magic strategy the magic formula but unfortunately the hard thing to understand is actually intensity is the strategy most of the time the strategy is pretty obvious it's pretty Cut and Clear it's the intensity you take to it that makes a big difference and so uh once you find a good strategy you want to execute it just violently versus trying to wait for the The Perfect magic formula Perfect magic solution uh perfect strategy that that doesn't exist um here's an example of a hard swing so there's a guy Taylor offer I don't know why he comes to mind but this is the first one that came to mind uh Taylor he's the founder of a clothing company called feet now but back then he had a merch business I think he was trying to sell socks or something and it was going okay but he wanted to double down so turns up the intensity he's like I'm selling merch I need distribution what if I had the distribution of some of the most famous fine and YouTube stars that existed and the top Vine in YouTube Stars at the time were guys like Logan Paul and a king batch and stuff like that he says how do I get them to work with me right I don't even know these guys how do I get them to work are they so he's watching their videos and he notices that all the doors in the background of their videos like the apartment doors had the same handle and he's like three of the viners have the same they must live in the same building so he hunts down he finds a building moves across the country moves into the building and he knows how they like to work out so he starts just working out twice a day he's like this increases my odds of crossing paths with him and they do cross paths he tells them what he's doing they get to know each other eventually they become friends they partner with him he becomes the first guy to do merch with Logan Paul said sells millions of dollars of merch you know right off the bat he basically leapfrogged where he would have been with lower intensity without being willing to Double Down um and so I love that story because this is a it's an example of of all the things I mentioned right um working smarter not harder uh of moving towards the people you want being near the people you want versus being far away and when you see a fat pitch Double Down swing hard at that thing um so if you remember one thing from this section it's intensity is a strategy winners don't usually have a better strategy is that they do the obvious things with more intensity than you do and the reality is you don't even know what Max intensity looks like until you see it you need to go work with people who are real winners just to see oh that's how they attack when they see an opportunity or they have a problem how they how they go and approach things you got to kind of what I say I always say is like you think the knob of the volume goes only up to 10. and then you beat somebody and they actually the volume theirs turned up to 15. and you're like oh now I know what level 15 looks like as you have to see it once and then it'll just imprint in your brain and so those are the three ships find what feels like play to you and looks like work to others find a way to hang out with people who either have what you want or are chasing it as hard as you are and then take a simple strategy and turn up the intensity yeah this book probably has 50 other nuggets like that but that's all for today if you like this on YouTube leave a comment I'd love to read them I'll respond to all of them every single one from this video and um yeah that's it that's all for the uh the wealth uh the wealth wisdom or the money wisdom master class for today thanks [Music] all right

you wake up at something like 3 A.M or 5 a.m and the first two to three days the only instruction they give you is hey uh feel how the breath feels on your lips when you're breathing in and out okay see you in three days and you sit there it's really extreme what this is my management style too [Music] all right we're live here we have a guest Jack Smith one of my best friends in my wedding an amazing person I don't even know how to describe you jack what you I guess like the top line is you started a company that you sold for like 800 million dollars when you were 29. that's like the that's like the the headline impressive stuff but we have you here because you have done you're just like one of the more interesting people I know okay well thanks for having me I also for kind of an interesting contrast coming after Rob um because like he was describing himself as like the Pinnacle of human optimization right like he plans how long it takes him to go to the toilet each day and I was thinking I'm maybe an instant contrast so I'm like human procrastination like the exact opposite of that so yeah but you do optimize stuff like Sean I don't know if you know this but it's like Jack one time he went to his birthday party and his wife made him a cake and it was in the shape of an Amazon box because he had this like it was like a walk-in closet but it was basically a room in his home and it was full of Amazon boxes and you're like Jack what is that any he has this list this Excel spreadsheet that he keeps and anything that he buys ranging from a book bag to baby uh apparel or baby accessories or one time he was obsessed with chocolate he would literally buy 50 versions and test all of them and then rank them on this like attribute system and then have a and so he has these huge lists of everything that he's tested and he's done this so much that we're haven't you been banned from Amazon like multiple times yeah and then also bonobos had this policy for I don't know if they still have I think for many years I had a policy where you could return any item even if it was used up to 365 days after and so I had a spreadsheet tracking when I bought everything basically I got a new wardrobe every year because I just sent all my clothes back on the 340 days and then just got it all as like uh credit and bought an entire new wardrobe every year um so yeah I got banned from Amazon a few times you would rather have more in common than you than you think he's planted his poops and you're planning your returns in a giant spreadsheet which by the way we should like give a background so basically your company was called fungal you how were you 22. I'm 21 20 um so basically like the story that you always tell is you had like you got into an accelerator an incubator I think you had one idea but it wasn't working out and then you just like mocked up like a PowerPoint you went and it was like on a mobile ad Network so basically you would see an ad in between levels of games you brought it to developers and they're like oh yeah this is way better if you could actually build this we're in and you did that a bunch of times where you got maybe one or I think a million dollars of the commitments of like yeah I guess if you build this we would spend like this much money and then you took that and you actually hired a a developer Bryant who's now the co-founder of webflow and you built that business and then it like spiraled into this thing where I think you'd only raised 10 or 15 million maybe 17 million and within seven years I think wherever it was when you sold you guys were doing a million a day in Revenue it could be in that region yeah maybe yeah around hundreds of millions in Revenue it was absolutely crazy and then you sold it for I forget what 800 yeah yeah kind of in that region and I mean what's interesting as well is obviously Sean talks about having worked with [ __ ] one um nothing app loving launched about six to 12 months after us so I think it's another example you don't have to be the first to Market like everyone's jumping on the AI Trend right to be first to Market but actually you don't have to be the first Market to be the biggest app loving was one of the slower movers and to get context they at their Peak have been multiple times bigger than fungal they went public and probably at their peak in the region of 10 billion market cap now they're a bit low up to the markets they're nine billion now they were 20 billion at its peak uh something like 20 25 billion at this peak what do you think they did why did they have kind of a let's call it 10 to 20x bigger outcome if they started a year later when you look back what did you learn from that and it was also interesting because uh one of our investors besides fir Khan being a beast one of our investors came to us and said like oh yeah we're backing we're looking we're investing in this company they do like um video advertisements inside of uh mobile apps Etc called Apple Avenue we're like uh you're describing our company what are you talking about you're investing in do that that's what we did to do and actually uh so they're caught uh they're called Web um uh win web investment Network they invested in I think they're the only investor invested in fungal and app loving um they're great guys but at the time we were like [ __ ] um so they have massive wins there uh one bit we observed is actually app loving bungle we thought that like at the time before vungle mobile ads were monetized food like banner ads like kind of on the internet you know with internet festivals she had these crappy banner ads and we were like well they obviously suck so we're gonna do video ads which is 10x better but a difference that app loving did is they didn't only do video ads they did everything they did they they were like we don't care what you want to spend money on we'll just take your money so they're like one perform you can do banner ads video ads everything and so I think that um enabled them to capture a bit more market share and perhaps um the uh founding team being more technical like I'm saying that I'm a crappy engineer uh like I could not build bungle from scratch and Sean listening to your story on uh one of the more recent episodes you described furquon making that dashboard for Adam that he could just look at the apps and poach them right we did similar bits um but there's perhaps more technical one of our hacks we did is we actually had a team of people in about 10 people in Pakistan and Pakistan is so cheap so we had an entire office and they had one job two and this is why it was really easy to recruit there we said just play mobile games all day we just got them all on iPhone and we just like play games all day and whenever you see an ad write down what the ad was advertising and what ad network was using it and so they basically built us our lead gen database by playing all the games so maybe we did it manually they did it by looking at this SDK source code and so yeah that's amazing you're like last night someone was asking me I was at this dinner they're like have you ever met anyone who um created a business and sold it and was wealthy enough and they just retired and I was like not really basically everyone I know who's started a company and had some type of success usually after some amount of time six months or three years they usually get to something sometimes it's more intense sometimes less intense but they usually do something you're actually the only person I think I know who was incredibly successful at a very young age so 30 years old or whenever you sold it and you actually have not ever started another business before you do a lot of odd stuff like for example I'll be like Jack what are you doing now you got any projects you're like yeah I have like a ton of pen pals in prison and I like set up this thing where it's this website where people inmates can order any book they want to and I like ask them to create like a book report on it and I'm like that's so interesting do you think a you'll ever get back into business and is the reason do you just spent all your days just like seeking out all these interesting topics is that what you're doing now so I would not say that I'm retired at the moment because when I think of being retired I think about having no stress and just like sitting around reading books all day or something like that you know actually I am working on a bunch of stuff um but they're not just it's not taking approach of trying to build another billion dollar company when I think back a trait I notice in many entrepreneurs and I observed in myself is that I think um I was successful early on because I had a chip on my shoulder I had something to prove and I'm doing my first um startup in London it was really hard to do a startup and I also felt like people kind of didn't respect me um I had they like people um just kind of thought I was a joke or whatever and I kind of felt inside I thought I was like I think that I can build something successful I didn't want I didn't aspire to be super rich or anything I just wanted to build a big company but I had that chip on my shoulder something to prove now when vungle Soul when I kind of reflected I was like I don't think that I have that chip on my shoulder anymore and I think if you're gonna try and build a billion dollar company you or or really Venture that company or something you have to make a lot of sacrifices right and um have a drive about why you're doing it and when I sat I'm like I don't need more money now and I don't have this thing to prove anymore so when I sat with it I felt what is going to motivate me more now is where can I have an impact and kind of impact the world not necessarily trying to impact a million people in the world but even if I just deeply impact a few people in the world I think that will be a driver to a reason why to work on this because making more money is not enough of a driver for me and all of us free we're in this chat group right about Founders that have sold their first company and it seems that the majority of people have this crisis I've sold my company but I don't know what to do with myself and I'm good at building companies I don't really need more money but so I just do it because that's what I'm good at and I can't think of anything else to do and also I don't want to just sit around so it seems to challenge many others are facing for me the conclusion I came to was where can I add impact and that looks like setting up some Charities and a project that I'm working on at the moment you guys have talked briefly about it before is moved to Portugal to set up a kind of digital detox type place for people to switch off from technology and be in nature so these are the kind of things I'm doing I mean that one it will hopefully make money but money is not the core metric if it's been a success or not even if it doesn't even if it breaks even or loses a bit of money if just it can heal people people say like yo that changed my life was super healing to me and people talk about it that is success for me with that project dude you're the first person I've ever met who does a lot of things that are now more popular so I remember one time Sean Jack and I were hanging out and we are playing frisbee golf it was just us it was like 10 a.m in the morning we're playing frisbee golf in San Francisco and I was like Jack you're being a little quiet what's wrong and this was like after an hour of playing he was like oh I am I was doing Ayahuasca from for the last three days and I was like what what's Ayahuasca he's like well you go to this house and you like drink this thing and then you throw up and you're supposed to like you know find yourself or whatever and you have like a shaman guiding you and I was like when did that end and he was like oh I came straight from there I was there like I was there like an hour and a half ago and so you would do that stuff like way before this type of psychedelic stuff was popular another thing that you would do Jack would come and speak at hustlecon and he's like hey I gotta go like literally the next day I was like where are you going he goes oh I'm going to Bali uh for three weeks for a silent Retreat and he would I would see him leave he would bring like basically no clothes and a massive bag like a whole carry-on or a whole check bag of books from the library and I was like what are you doing he's like I was just overwhelmed with all the people I got to go to Bali now for and he would go to the silent Retreat for literally three weeks and not say a word and now I'm talking to like my quote normal more normal friends my friends who are doctors and lawyers whatever and now they're doing it you do so many things that are so odd and now every now everyone's talking about psychedelics uh like these silent Retreats are significantly more popular you've been doing that since 2012. I remember you was telling me about all this stuff because this is the crazy thing I've ever heard of and you've been doing all that now and it's way more popular vipassana is a is a type of silent meditation so if someone says they're done a silent Retreat often they're talking about this thing called vipassana and yes I think it has got more mainstream nowadays but it has actually been pretty popular concept for a long time but I've never done it and that is actually really extreme approach like um many people I speak to who have done them so it's kind of like if you can't swim and you jump off an olympic diving board it's really extreme approach to switching off and feeling burned out some people I think they're doing it because well I know people tell me they did it because it sounded like a challenge but it's not necessarily a good thing so to give an example you go for 10 days right my friend did it his pillow was made it's run by monks it's a non-profit they have about 300 locations around the world run by monks and it doesn't cost any money you maybe pay small fee his pillow was made out of concrete you're not allowed to make eye contact with any other person there your meals are like rice you wake up at something like 3 A.M or 5am and the first two to three days the only instruction they give you is hey uh feel how the breath feels on your lips when you're breathing in and out okay see you in three days and you sit there so it's really extreme what this is my management style too but this is really popular but what I did and I was inspired by Bill Gates he had this thing called uh think week where he just goes to a cabin in the middle of nowhere and he just reads for a week and I was like oh that's awesome and I found this place in Indonesia and it's just totally different to uh the Persona because they don't have any rules like you can make like the only rollers don't talk to each other but you can make eye contact you can do whatever you want you don't have to do any meditation at all but and then so for me I just took loads of books and I came out of that each time getting all the benefits these people doing big Persona Retreats talk about like I feel super re-energized my mood feels off the charts super happy but I'm having an amazing time I'm reading all these books I've wanted to read all year and the food is amazing it's grown on their own jungle slash farm so I'm like this amazing experience and I feel awesome and all these benefits but since the other guys are like oh I spoke to one guy this morning he's like uh totally glad I did it would never want to go through that again was one of the hardest experiences of my life and I'm like well you can actually get a bunch of the same benefits but you don't have to talk to yourself but I've never found a place like this place in Indonesia and so for many years I kind of felt that I just have to do this which is expand their concept to other continents around the world so I'm starting in Portugal If that goes well hopefully then expand to America Etc that's awesome you put a couple things on the sheet that I want to do um you said business opportunities so you're not it sounds like you're not doing you've been able to resist the temptation to start another business even though you're good at business and you see lots of opportunities so uh share with us a couple of these like random ideas that you have on this list yeah because um I know you guys like I think the audience likes different business ideas and things that are also actionable with my first million wipes I was kind of thinking to myself and one business I don't know if you guys have come across this but it was kind of interesting to me um it's a company not VC back or anything but it's called Nomad capitalist and um is this guy and he's kind of made a name for himself as the leader for rich people that just want to go around the world he organizes a conference for like family offices and he has a book and he has this brand called Nomad capitalist and if you look on Reddit loads of people talk about it I actually did a pre-screen call with them and I also read the reviews about it Etc they're basically just a reseller for tax lawyers because tax lawyers just suck at marketing you know and he's got a podcast he's got a book he's just a really great at marketing and he's got this like he's like oh the best track strategy is to like have free passports I help you get multiple passports and set up a bank account in another country Etc did a call with them and they basically wanted 25 000 retainer and then what they'll do is they'll just make you a report and they're like all right the 25 000 you can later put it towards whatever things we propose for you but um I was like okay but then as I did more research I kind of just myself found out like wait I can just cut out you and just find an awesome tax attorney myself and pay three thousand dollars I don't need to give you 25 000 but he he had he's he's doing really well and he also has this level like if you pay him 75 000 you can like go and hang out with him on an island in person and he'll he'll cut he'll be your concierge so some of these people I think it's just like rich people having too much money and they don't want to do the research or reference checks to find good tax people they're like oh well this dude his website looks really great he must be thought leader he's got this book He's on all the podcasts I'll just hire him because also I found tax attorneys they don't give you a simple answer to the freaking question you know I'm just like I I want to do this whatever and then they're like oh it's really complicated and they use all this jargon they just suck at speaking plain English he um so he's built a really good business and I was thinking I think a business opportunity is building a reseller layer on top of these industries that just suck at marketing or communicating what they do you know um so he's doing it for tax International tax for really rich people and I was thinking there's probably other Industries where just making amazing brand website write a book go on all the podcasts and make a brand about yourself hit really great name right like Nomad capitalist um to do that for other Industries um I thought was one idea so what do you get what do you get for the 25 Grand he's like I'll make you a report they'll make you a report an eight page report telling you we think that you should set up a trust in Bermuda and that is going to cost you um 30k the 25k that you paid us you can put that towards the trust in Bermuda um but basically he's just taking a cut he's just taking a Reese he's just taking a referral fee from the lawyer you know it only costs 5K to do the trust so basically and then if he gives you the report and you don't like it um he keeps the 25k so this is this is the business model that um the Think and Grow Rich guy does and Dave Ramsey I've come to realize so what they did is I I know somebody who reached out to uh who got into Think and Grow Rich Robert kiyosaki's like you know book Plus uh Poor Dad Rich Dad is the Robert Kawasaki guy or whatever his name Robert something they can go rich as Napoleon Hill yeah yeah sorry that's what I meant Rich that poor dad oh did I say they say yeah yeah yeah um yeah so uh he reaches out to the Rich Dad Poor Dad guy uh who I think is that Kiyosaki guy and he's uh uh basically that like he's got a philosophy he's like look this is the way to get rich and it makes sense and you're like cool I want to do it he's like awesome reach out to one of our uh you know reach out to our headquarters and we'll do a call and we'll get to know you and we'll tell you what we think you should do and it's just a layer reselling tax strategy and so what he did was he paid 20K to these guys to get a connection to a tech strategy lawyer attack strategist and lawyer who then did uh you know saves him a bunch of money I actually saved him like 80k or something like that so he's like oh yeah there's a great deal I put in 20 got 80. then he introduced me to the tax guy and the tax guy is like cool yeah for all this it'll be 6K and I was like oh but like I saw my brother I was like you know you you paid 20 I paid six what do you mean and he was like well yeah like that I was like where did the other you know what were the all the other money goes like Oh that goes to like their Central agency like that filters the deal so they don't just take a cut it's not like we get a 10 referral fee they mark up the whole service by 3x and keep 66 of the 3x markup in order to do this and then Dave Ramsey does the same thing so I was like you see Dave Ramsey right like you know America's you know favorite uncle or whatever and he's doing this call-in show he does all this stuff and I was like how much and we had done this feature on him on the Pod that blew my mind Sam you knew a little bit about this but he has like a huge campus of like his office is like uh it's in Tennessee he's got like you know multiple buildings hundreds of people on staff and I was like dude how big is this guy's podcast that he could pay for that that sounds a little outrageous like what's going on here and it's basically the podcast the books all of that is just lead gen for people to come to him and if you go to his website it'll say what do you what do you need you want Insurance you want a mortgage you want to learn how to save money you want tax help talk to people with the Ramsay shield and basically what he does is he goes and finds local people in your Market they have to pay to apply so they pay some number some amount of money and uh like you know a couple thousand dollars to get certified and when they're certified so he makes money off them but then he for them it's a no-brainer because they're going to get leads from his giant top of funnel like his website if you go to like uh whatever the traffic you know analysis um on similar web it says it gets 10 million visits a month on his website so he's getting a huge amount of traffic that he just funnels down to these providers and he basically gets his cut and they and these advisors all have the shields like what does the shield means like our team has vetted them as they invented what you don't know if these guys are you know what are you actually doing out here and I'm pretty sure this entire business is making like 300 million a year um and this is off or more a combination of basically his like the the Ramsay trusted advisors and it's basically like they follow the Ramsay rules um and it's like what are the Ramsey rules it's like oh you know there's parts of his philosophy that they follow and um and so they can they can either pay for the leads or they pay for the certification and just off this lead gen he's just generating just like tons and tons of cash and then on top of that he's got his like his university and then he's got his media ad stuff so the combination of all those is sort of like uh a 300 million plus a year Empire which is pretty insane it is doing exactly what you described Jack it's a it's a layer that I call it a router business it's going to route you to the service you want yeah and you know I'm the router because I'm the trusted source and if I do actually do a good job of curating or hand selecting and people get a good outcome from it then this can be a sustainable business and so yeah I think you're absolutely right on that and what's the other one yeah what says rtfm what does that mean oh um rtfm I just meant like read the [ __ ] manual so basically I was talking someone um have someone helping me with like mid-journey and all this stuff just came out right and then I was just trying to figure out like I kind of just delegated to him like all right we let's just see if mid-journey can help us so as I said I'm building this like physical place and I'm like just see if it can make us some mock-ups so take this image of a cabin and this image of the piece of land and just see if mid Journey can blend them together and we even hire people of upwork to uh and fourth Fiverr like mid-journey experts to help us and the results sucked and then they was not doing what I asked and then he had said he'd been playing around with for a while and then I was at some point I was like I [ __ ] it I should this is going to be a valuable skill I should learn how it works at least the first step I did is I read the mid-journey um guide book that they have and it explains how to do it and then within 15 minutes I saw like hey guys um we can do what I'm asking you just have to use this certain command do you even did you even read the [ __ ] manual about how this works I think most people don't read demand like manuals are boring right they read the manual they're just trying to figure it out themselves or look at YouTube and then I was just like just read the menu it's pretty simple and so I think if you just do the basics that most people don't read the [ __ ] manual about how mid-journey works or chat GPT or something there's so many people that the AI is this merging Trend but they're [ __ ] lazy I'm gonna read the 20 Page manual and you can kind of just tell them like oh you want to do that um I'll just do it for you it maybe only takes you five seconds but you can just charge them a premium you know actually um my wife she has a startup and she said there's this guy um he's going around he's doing conference in a different country like every few days about Ai and his teaching Business Leaders like oh mid-journey chat gbt that's how you use it this is this ask my wife I'm like what's that guy's actual credentials you know and he's not he's not he's just a nobody but he's saying that he's an AI expert because everybody is it only just came out recently and he's just running workshops and charging Business Leaders loads of money about how to implement this in your business and so I think if you just you know if you just don't sleep and just learn mid-journey chat TBT learn all of these things only came out recently you can be a thought leader and write a book launch it launch on Amazon a book how to use chat GPT in your business and and launch it for each vertical using chat gbt for lawyers and accounting and whatever um you guys are in the group I don't know if you saw um Sean is more active say I'm not but people were talking about this business case text just got acquired by Lexus Nexus for 750 million dollars and actually in the investor report it's kind of embarrassing but in the investor report the um Lexus Nexus said the reason we pay 700 million dollars for this business is because they came up with eight prompts football open AI about how to make it give good responses um to law questions so they're kind of openly saying this business is just a layer on top of open AI they just came up with eight prompt texts and so we're buying them for 700 million tell me more about this company I mean I'm not an expert but someone in the group who is in the industry said LexisNexis is competitor has just come out with some AI thing and so Lexus Nexus which is like multi-billion dollar company was like oh [ __ ] like we need to get up to speed and we need to get up speed fast and so they just paid this load of Chris or what people are saying is ludicrous son um because it needed to get up to speed but literally in the investor report they said the reason we are buying this business is because they have eight proprietary prompts and then anyone who's used TPT or anything knows that's like not very much intellectual property or whatever you're buying you know I think case takes has been around for like 10 years though so whatever they were doing before uh you know they were they were around uh so like I think they have like on their website their analysis ten thousand law firms use them so you know it's not literally just uh eight props but but I get I get your point and definitely they got the uh the AI premium on the exit here because uh yeah it became strategic immediately strategic and Urgent for for Lexus and I'm totally with you about the the you know you could become an expert in mid-journey and chat GPT and like nine days nine days of like trying to do [ __ ] and then basically figuring out how that applies to certain vertical or job is uh is definitely like a a thing that that can exist and should exist I had the same thing I was trying to use it in my business my econ business and I was like how do I do this and I just reached out to the guy at Runway and I was like hey I'm trying to take an image and make a very similar image and I was like it's not I don't like I can't do text to image because I can't describe this image I have an image I want another one like it and I want actually 50 variations of it can you do that he's like oh yeah we have image damage just go over here and I was like oh thank you like this would have I didn't know even which tool to use I would have known what it's called I would have known how to do it and then oh I did it but there's one problem he's like oh just change this setting uh blah blah and then it just fixed it I was like wow that's uh that's amazing it saves me so much time and you you really do have to play with these things and most people don't have the time or the patience to go play with these things to figure out how they actually work as a business leader you pay your lawyer a thousand a thousand five hundred dollars an hour to give you tax advice right why would someone not pay that for a mid-journ person if they can answer their question in an hour um for a worldly a thought leader Mark Cuban has this great blog I don't think he updates anymore but he was writing it for maybe a couple decades now it's really old and I used to go back and read his old post and a lot of people don't know this but he actually got his first like two or three million dollars of wealth when he was 31 because he started this thing called micro Solutions it was basically I forget how he described it but it was basically like a like a I.T agency so like if a big-ish or even a small company was like implementing Oracle or something like that he would help install it on everyone's computer and then teach people how to use it and he uh he goes the reason my company was successful was it because I necessarily was an expert on this stuff but he goes I was the only one and he used their same acronym he was I was the only one who read the [ __ ] manual he goes I would stay up late at night and I would read the [ __ ] manual and I would just learn how does this HP computer work and the next day I could go and like talk to a business owner and explain how it works and say yeah we can install that thing or this thing or that thing and then I would go and read the manual on those other things and that's all I did and it was hard work and I stayed up all night reading these things but that's how I became uh an expert in the stuff is I just read the manual which no one does and it's pretty funny because he used the exact I think he has a blog post actually that has the exact same acronym that you have here's what he said exactly it's a blog post called how to win at the sport of business he goes every night I would take home a different software manual and I would read it of course the reading was captivating I'm reading Peachtree Accounting word star Harvard Graphics you know Lotus Apex at the every night I would read some after getting home no matter how late it was it turns out not a lot of people ever bother to rtfm read the freaking manual and so it turned so so people really started thinking that I knew my stuff and that's all I was doing yeah that's hilarious and he like talks and he talks about that in a ton of different blog posts where he talks about read the read the freaking manual it's it's quite good uh any and he attributes that to like a lot of his early success you have a few others that I gotta ask you about okay so you wrote on this little cheat sheet you wrote uh you know non-obvious barriers to entry for business and then he said hacking the iPhone to record screen uh what are you talking about here non-obvious barriers barriers to entry for business sure and I mean as I said you don't have to be the first mover to Market but um to be successful in business but when an entirely new product comes out there are opportunities to the product that's why I was able to hack LinkedIn ads that at the hack we've talked about for because LinkedIn just launched it so it was not properly bug checked and all that stuff you know now the idea I was saying or it's not necessarily a business idea about where you could discover opportunities for me and to give an example is that um you might have a wedge or like a business you might have a you might have a hack this it's not a business but maybe it can go somewhere from that initial kind of hat you know so to give an example with fungal um back in like 2010 um the business I had before we were making educational videos like how to use Adobe Photoshop and stuff like this so like videos about desktop like Computer Applications and um fairly around that time I think a year before the iPhone app store had launched and I was reading this Gartner report like all right iPhone apps are gonna blow up and then I was going feeling like wait so we're doing this for desktop and um apps on your computer why could we not do the same on your iPhone now that nowadays it's very easy to record your screen on the iPhone right like you just pull down and tap this called screen at the time you could not record the iPhone screen now I read a little bit online and I kind of felt like hey I think I've looked up these different pieces of Hardware it's like um a camcorder mixed with like this cable you plug in with the iPhone but you have to jailbreak the iPhone etc etc I was like I reckon or I just have a hunch that if we put these together I might be able to figure out how to record the iPhone screen now my co-founder he was like do this [ __ ] waste of time like you've got 48 hours to try this out otherwise we need to move on all right now not that many people know this but actually the Apple Store lets you buy a product and you can return it within 14 days even if you used it the MacBook an iPhone an iPad you can return it used so we had an intern it was his first day there and I basically said our company we have about a thousand dollars in the bank account and I told him like the take this credit bank credit card and I told him to spend our entire budget at the Apple Store I want you to buy the latest iPhone and latest iPad and your first task as the intern is jailbreak this and we have 48 hours to figure out if we can record the screen from this because my co-founder thinks it's a waste of time I think it's not and and we and then we're going to return it off within 14 days so we have a Time Time buffer because we don't have a thousand dollars to just throw around so we're going to play around with this iPhone Max 14 days then we're going to send it back we managed to record this we managed to record the screen it was a free it was taking like a cam called a cable you had to jailbreak the iPhone etc etc but we managed to get this unique thing where we could record the screen of the iPhone at that time we didn't have anything useful to do with it it's like okay great we can record the screen in the iPhone what can we do this but later on when we built the video ad Network um when we came up with the idea about the video ad Network that vungo is today um obviously if you're gonna run a video ad an app needs to have an advertisement to run right and we were the only um because we had just started with this we actually just had an in-house um Production Studio that's how we initially made money but charging 500 to make a video for your app but 500 that kind of sucks but what we do is we parlayed that idea and at some point we made the best videos of anyone like app loving or whoever they couldn't make a video so what they'd have to do is you'd have to spend thousands of dollars hiring creative Ad Agency who probably used a camera to record the iPhone screen or you had to do loads of work as the app developer and send them all your image assets we could literally record the screen with the iPhone that others could not and so what we said is like hey guys we're no longer you can't buy a video from us anymore like people loved our videos the best quality videos but we're like even if you offer us two thousand dollars we don't make videos anymore but if you spend more than twenty five thousand dollars on our advertising Network we'll make you the video for free and our videos are the best so they're gonna convert amazingly as well but you can you can use the video on your website and stuff but you cannot use this video on app loving or any other network it's proprietary to us so that was a hack that worked for fungal and what I would say obviously you have to have a credit card that had this limit and check that Apple actually allows this but what I would do is if I am 20 years old and I have a credit card because America gives everyone credit cards I would go to the Apple Store the first day the Apple Vision Pro comes out and I would try and hack it and jailbreak it and play around with it look up on my head so I'll write it and I would try and find hacks like how to record the screen of the Apple Vision Pro that's not going to be a feature at day one no one needs to do that if you can hack it and do that you have something proprietary you could launch your business off the back of that and I would return it within 14 days and maybe go to another Apple store and buy it and get my friends fire or something but that um is one opportunity of like you know it's a hack it's not a business but that unique hack that no one else has can lead you to have a barrier to entry to be successful and build a billion dollar business in a tangential industry from there I love that I love that you you also have a couple on here you said why I Believe In The Law of Attraction and practice applications this is interesting to me because I think there's like people who believe in the Law of Attraction and they also you know believe in horoscopes and crystals and other stuff too probably and then there's people who are you know hyperological rational Problem Solver types that typically don't believe in something like the law of attraction I would have pegged you as more of the Practical uh logical Problem Solver type but you're saying you believe in this so tell me why you believe in this and what do you mean by practical applications yeah people that are really rational um like my brother-in-law is a bit hard to talk about this topic because they're so rational I'm pretty rational but I'm also open-minded stuff now Law of Attraction the interpretation of many people with the crystals take and I kind of it was kind of funny because I went to somebody that did this alternative kind of uh kind of like massage therapy but like alternative and then she was doing it at her house um but then on the bookshelf was like a book like how to manifest well to be like a billionaire or something but then I'm like um well you're in this like really crappy studio so how's that going for you you know like on the extreme alternative side that you're talking about Sean like doing horoscopes or whatever I'm somewhere in the middle where I'm like Law of Attraction so popularized by the book called The Secret um if you just do it at the basic level it's just like oh just like think about what you want and it will manifest and appear to you but actually there's a book that I like called practical Law of Attraction and what it's kind of saying to be honest it basically I didn't know about this stuff when I was launching my business but it kind of actually reaffirmed the stuff that I was already doing in my life to be honest which is like clearly the clearly feeling and defining what you want and then taking steps to get there now why I think there's a practical application and why I do believe in it I don't believe that you just think of it and then nothing happens I think now to give up um Let me give let me just give an example story that reaffirms this I was I was living with my roommate and at this time my business was going pretty good but he was trying to launch a business off the ground and he was 35 and he was trying to fundraise raise a c round and he could not raise any money at all and his mindset was just stuck about feeling sorry for himself like he was just like oh I read on TechCrunch about 18 year olds getting into y combinator but nobody respects me like I have way more experience than him but investors they must just they don't value me they they blah blah he's feeling sorry for himself he's having negative energy I mean a prime example of it was like one day uh he called me and like uh really like anxious and he's like oh my God Jack like um a letter from the IRS arrived for you and I'm like uh dude I'm sure it's not that big of a deal but he's like dude what the [ __ ] that he's freaking out right and uh lo and behold it actually was a refund check they were giving me a which one but he had this negative mindset and I feel that obviously people study by Body Language and all this stuff but I feel that law of attraction works because there is so many micro signals and Body Language we're projecting to people all around us that we're not in control of and don't even know and so I feel for me I and my co-founder we were convinced we're going to raise funding and we're the [ __ ] and I think that investors and stuff can tell you know you can tell if someone's bluffing so he's going into this meeting and he's got 100 projections and he's feeling sorry for himself he's already going in with the idea that these people um are not going to invest in me and so they are just sensing that this guy's a loser right um versus me I'm just like we're going to raise funding and so when I say something like an investor one time asked us like how's your fundraising going we had no investors but we told him like oh it's going amazing we're just we've got a bunch of top tier people interested we're just deciding who's going to be the best fit for our business and the guy kind of freaked out and it actually gave us a term sheet because I think he could tell that we believed it we were not lying because we actually believed it now what was amazing with my friend is at just at some point I just noticed him adopt a mind set shift just one day basically and at some point he basically just said like all right look what I've been doing thus far it hasn't worked and and he also was saying that he looked at me a bit as a bit inspiration because Jack just it doesn't not worry about this stuff you know and he's like I realize that I haven't going been going all in because I'm scared that if I don't raise funding I'm gonna look like a failure to my network as if I try and do a business again then they'll think like oh well he failed the last one I'm not going to do it again but he's like he's like from this day forward I'm adopting a mindset that if I do not raise funding for this business I'm never going to try and raise funding for a business ever again this is my one shot and I'm gonna go all in and he looked up all his connections on LinkedIn and he was not embarrassed about rejection or that he would look stupid to them in future he's like I'm going to ask every single person in my network for investor intros literally within a month or so he raised amazing seed round business now has raised over 25 million dollars because he just went all in and I think that people could tell that he had the conviction you know he's telling them now he's not feeling sorry for himself like I can't wait something he's like I'm going to raise funding and this business is going to be [ __ ] huge and just it was amazing to see him adopt that mindset shift um and so that is an example for me of law of attraction is like yes you're manifesting it and whatever [ __ ] but you're actually believing it and you're projecting it to others now think he's adopted that new mindset right so if an investor rejects him in his original view that would have reaffirmed his original view right like oh all the investors hate me and I'm never gonna raise funding because I just got rejected if with this new mindset actually it doesn't necessarily have to change every single outcome in every interaction you have but it also changes how you view them if one investor rejects him now you'll just be like oh well I'm going to raise funding so I guess this guy was just not fit I just move on to the next one you wouldn't see it as reaffirming that you suck you would just be like oh this investor is an idiot like I'm still gonna write funding it doesn't distract you from the path so that is what I was thinking about when it comes to law of attraction and I've we've been friends for a while but I remember very distinctly and you might need to fill in some of the details right and I'll try to be vague and you can decide what you want to share but I remember distinctly I think we were I think we were at my apartment in Soma in Soma when you came over or we could have been at my house in uh Glen Park but I remember like distinctly hanging out with you and you had just fungal hadn't sold yet but you had sold some shares to live off of because you were basically cat you you didn't have a lot of money you sold some shares and you you got maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars but you lived off that for like three years and it was at the very end of that money and you had you didn't even tell me I I asked like how things are going um do you have enough money to last until you think your the company's gonna sell and you're like yeah I think it's gonna sell for a whole lot of money for hundreds of millions of dollars um and I'll be fine when that happens and I was like but how are you now and for some reason I remember I saw your Robinhood account or saw one of your accounts and I don't know if you remember this but I think there were single digit thousand dollars left because you had made like a really dumb trade do you remember that and you were like totally calm and I remember like being around you and it was like yeah you're you're one of my like three best friends and I remember thinking like oh like you're my family now like you have inspired me because you actually were living what you're talking about now do you remember that you remember when that happened yeah and I mean in line with that basically yeah I got a bit of money like as you said a secondary right and I was living and then the money was running out doesn't last forever I think that I um I I saw from the previous episode people like talking about specific numbers right so I think that when I I think yeah I think that when I left fungal um and then tried doing [ __ ] and it didn't work out Etc but I didn't have any many savings and fungal I think I got a hundred and twenty thousand dollar salary we paid us after we raised funding but prior to that we've never taken any money and then just to help me out because I was like Hey dude I don't actually have any money um my co-founder fungal helped give me an introduction to um some people that bought a secondary of of some of my stock now I think that I I can't remember that I think it was 500 000 and I hadn't held the stock for five years so it was not qualified this thing called qsbs yet so I basically had to pay a bunch you probably have to pay half of that in tax being in California right so I had like let's say 250k left that's not a load of that's not a lot of money in San Francisco to pay your rent food you have no other income now I was advising companies and stuff but they don't give you they give you Equity they're not giving you money and my money was running out and Sam like you said I didn't have much money left and people were saying to me like hey dude what are you gonna do if you like run out of money uh and I was like oh I guess I'll have to get a job but I'm not really contemplating that right now I don't have a timeline for when business is going to exit but I kind of feel something is telling me that is I'm gonna be all right I'm not freaking out about it even worst case scenario I'll move back in my parents whatever but I was not making a plan B what was the dumb trade I was day trading like options trading and all this [ __ ] and kind of funny um they're like 250k is not a lot of money in San Francisco for food rent in my day trading business [Laughter] hi and with hindsight is is very stupid but like I was day trading and stuff to try and make some money when I looked back in hindsight I actually was spending like a few hours a day because I just got interested in trading so learned options trading and all this spending a few hours a day I actually would have made more money if I had just put it in the Vanguard VTR if it's S P 500 as I wasted all this time and yes lost a load of money um yeah so that was just a negative trait of experimentation the way you described it uh I've heard described differently so Tony Robbins did this uh this is a video on YouTube of him talking about this where he says like you know you've ever heard of the phrase like a vicious cycle and a you know vicious cycle is kind of like what you described your friend was initially doing which is he draws these three circles he says first one's belief second one's action third is results he goes uh like what do you do when you like let's say you're you're supposed to do something but you don't really think it's gonna work um it doesn't matter what it is like you know you're looking for the salt and uh you know your girlfriend says it's in the cabinet but you already looked there you don't think it's there so you kind of you go you don't really rummage around too much because you don't believe it's there right so basically low belief typically creates we you know low or weak action and lower weak action almost always creates bad results and then the the message the story We Tell ourselves is see I knew it I knew it wouldn't work and then it just reinforces the low belief and that's the Vicious Cycle that happens for people uh you know it could be uh uh I don't really believe that I'm gonna stick to this diet and so therefore I'm not really that hardcore but I start to slip and then my results say yeah you never stick to what you say and then you reinforce a little belief right it could be on and it could be business it could be personal it could be whatever and then there's the exact opposite which is The Virtuous cycle The Virtuous cycle is massive belief this is gonna work what happens when you believe something's really gonna work you wake up before the alarm clock you get out of bed you start doing it immediately you can't wait and you take Massive Action what happens when you take Massive Action for a while you start to get good results or massive results when you get massive results it reinforces the belief see I knew this [ __ ] was gonna work and so that and there's basically that's the difference between winners and losers is which side of that cycle do you go down and like the core thing is there's some people who just wait for a result to happen to to inform their belief and what that basically means I'm going to sort of wait hope to get lucky and then I'll start to believe and I think anybody who's in this kind of entrepreneurial bucket the the prereq for any result is the belief and uh and you have to have that sort of massive conviction or massive belief in yourself and in what you're doing and that part is that that's the Law of Attraction part that's the part where it's faith it hasn't happened yet you believe it will happen and because you believe it will happen you're right it's not like law of uh not like the secret where they're just like close your eyes and you say I'm not you know there are no weeds in the background there are no weeds in the backyard you look oh there's still weeds in the backyard well you didn't take any action you didn't go and get rid of the weeds is is you know the action is a is a requirement to actually do this you also mentioned one other thing on that which said you have to feel it versus just say it yeah is there a difference there because I when I talk to people who who kind of really believe in this uh they over emphasize this feeling feeling it part versus just saying it or uh or trying to believe it in your head it's my wife is totally not into this at all and maybe it just doesn't work for her but she's like dude I can't just feel that I'm gonna can't just feel all it's gonna work it doesn't work for her but for me maybe I'm just delusional or I just have conviction in something but I just sometimes just feel it's gonna work and I guess um one bit that is related to this a bit is like perhaps adopting different mindset personas so I saw this interview with Beyonce and they were asking her about like she has um her thing like Sasha Fierce right her nickname and they're like when does when do you become such a fierce and when you just Beyonce the same as a joke but she's like I literally become Sasha Fierce before I'm going to go on the stage because when I'm Beyonce I'm nervous I think people are going to hate me or whatever and I just adopt this alternative Persona that I Am Sasha Fierce and I am going to kill this performance people are going to love it it's amazing because they're adopting she's adopting some Persona and she's really feeling it I I don't necessarily adopt this other persona but that is the feeling that I think uh would be insane yeah I do the same thing and I also think that um who do you become I have this Persona that I created Angry Patel like what are you who are you going to become and uh yeah again this is another one that came out of Tony Robbins he he goes um he goes we all have we all have a version of our personality like you know raise your hand if you've ever been um super kind to others yeah yeah everybody raise your hand raise your hand if you ever made selfish choices and been a selfish [ __ ] everybody raises their hands we all have all these features of our personalities like the question is who's driving the car right now and he's like you know people think that they come to this this weekend workshop and I'm gonna oh Tony drop is he changed your life In fact when you go home people sort of mock you like oh so what happened you're a whole new guy now and he's like you know obviously you don't um you know you don't become a whole new person after 35 years in one weekend but he's like you know one thing we will do because he's like I'm gonna take the most badass version of you and that's who gets to drive this weekend and if you if it's only for this weekend and you decide after this weekend I don't want that person to be the one who's making decisions from now on all right fine fair play but for these next two days that's who's in charge we all have a version of ourselves that is the more badass version of ourselves the one that that does believe it's gonna happen the one that one that is decisive versus indecisive all these traits he's like what do you call he's like what do you call when you um I forgot what he says like he's like we're gonna make that that uh he's like we're gonna make that personality our [ __ ] he's like what do you what do you do what do you train a dog you give it a name and you train it to come when you call it and he's like so you're gonna give it a name you're going to figure out how you're going to be able to adopt that state when you want to be in that state he's like that takes practice reps and we're gonna get a bunch of reps at it this weekend and you sort of you have to figure out all right what is the version of me that does have those traits that does walk that way that does make those decisions and then can you call it on command or are you only going to do it when you feel good are you only going to do it when the weather's nice like no no you want to be able to have that on demand when you want it he says the same thing like I think his real name is not Tony Robbins either it's like his original name was like Anthony he's got some other last name he's like people see me now and they're seeing me on stage and all this stuff they think oh man Tony you're you're amazing you you know you're just special he's like no I was Anthony blah blah I was broke I was fat I was all these things he's like I created this Tony Robbins [ __ ] I created him and I was just like I like that part of the the thing that he was talking about because it's I think more empowering if you feel like oh you just are the way you are and that's it you're a fixed quantity and it was you know it's based on your genetics it's based on your childhood things you didn't have control of versus this idea that oh I actually have multiple versions of my personality there's some that I would want to be in charge more often than others um and I can craft that I can create that version of me that I want that's a different mindset some people don't believe it some people are like really married to their kind of like their upbringing and their past traumas and their their DNA that's not uh that's not how I look at the world at least dude this is get me this is getting me am I feel good I feel like I need to go I need to go create my version of Sasha Fierce um Jack I um you inspire me I'm happy I feel thankful we're friends I feel thankful that you came here you're a very inspiring person I just feel I feel you you're you do a it's like you're you're almost not inspiring because you're not this like crazy intimidating person but or I guess you're the right type of inspiring because you're not this like crazy intimidating person but you have and you have a very you're very mild manner I'll be with you and um other friends and I'd be like uh Jack like you I already know you know all about this topic that they're talking about you but you're just sitting here asking questions why aren't you like pumping your chests more or like you are dressed like this bum right now at this thing all these people think that you're just like one of my loser friends but you're like you know successful not in terms of just Financial finances but you've got like this you're my spiritual friend dude can you uh yeah help me out here a little bit well I'll be like you're like successful in like all attributes like I know you're like really insightful I know that you're successful traditionally you've got all these like amazing things but you're you don't even like you want me to brag about you that's like I feel like I've got to like sometimes like put you in a pedestal and and but that's one of the things I love about you is like you're just very very Meek is a bad word because that almost sounds insulting but you're very humble uh and you're very mild-mannered and that's one of the reasons why I love when you come on here and you like explain some of these stories because you never ever brag about yourself and I like hearing you do that every once in a while check yeah well thanks for having me on again I mean uh pick you up on I mean what is very important for me just to I guess just from my childhood and stuff but I've always tried to be humble and I'm not judging any it doesn't matter I will have an in-depth conversation with like to give you an example I'm here in Portugal right and there's a guy I pay a guy to come and pick up at my recycling out at my cardboard he's taking the cardboard to the trash so the trash man I'll have an in-depth conversation with him about how his life is going and stuff like that and I think it is good to remember that you can be successful and still be humble and not judge people about where they're at now um Sam like your father-in-law lives with like a celebrity and he said like the celebrity just [ __ ] it lives in the same apartment complex and treats everyone like [ __ ] and ignores him he's like and he and his they're both rich and the thing to remember I think is where people are in their life now is not where they're going to be in 10 years and people if you treat them like [ __ ] they're gonna remember like I when I was 1920 we pitched a VC in London a venture capitalist and we've been speaking to the associates we had a few meetings with them and yes we have nothing an idea was terrible but um the associate said like hey the partners agreed to have a meeting with you just like come by here at like 6 p.m to come by the office we're like okay this bit of weird times come by but sure whatever and we had no money like spent the money but my business part especially was in a lot of debt we spend the money got an underground ticket went there Etc in within 10 to 15 minutes at the meeting getting started because the guy was asking his questions is like you guys don't have a business this is just like [ __ ] and at like 6 15 it's just like yo I've got to go to dinner so this meeting's over 10 years 15 however many years it's been more than 10 years later we still remember that meeting and that guy treated us like [ __ ] he's still got a VC fund if he asked me for deal flow I'm not gonna give it I'm not going to pretend that never happened I'm like dude I remember how you treated me when I was [ __ ] our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better I call you uh when I describe you to other friends I said I think Jack is the most interesting man in the world and I think uh there's this great quotes like to be interesting you need to be interested and to me that's the perfect description for you you're the most interesting in the world because you're interested in the most things at the most depth you know in the highest variety and so I've talked to you about you know five different things and you've gone down a rabbit hole in each one of them so it turns out and uh because of that you always have like a really interesting point of view what's been the best find like you're talking about this chocolate rabbit hole you went down and you're like you know you you may come out with a different conclusion than the experts or the people who've done this for a long time what's an example where you you kind of just get you came to a different conclusions yourself well it was actually I was listening back to our last episode or maybe or one of the previous episodes and it was what we talked about there where it was like I just looked me and my co-founder at least just researched how ad networks work for a week and then um we were like all right we think this is how it works and um Tomas who runs Angel pad was like dude you're thinking you come into totally different conclusions in a week I was working at Google for a decade and there's people with Decades of experience in this but we just fought from the principle of just very Basics and so the first bit similar with app loving is we were like why are these ad networks charging um based on how many times someone watches a video we built a video ad Network we were like apps they actually just care about the end action so they actually only care how many people install their app or how much money these users are going to spend in their app they don't actually care how many people watch the video so why is it that the industry charges that way and so we kind of made a bet and said we will charge it doesn't matter how many people watch your video we'll just only charge you based on how many people install it it was a bet luckily it worked out sometimes you have to kind of make a gamble right like especially with an ad Network we had no idea if the business would work because the unit economics are kind of out of our hands right we don't know if these ad network if it's going to work you you always do weird stuff like this that makes sense but I'm like no why would you ever do that so um like for example you named Your Child So Jack has a two-year-old now uh you named your child baby yeah for the you told me you're like I'm just gonna name her baby for the first 12 months because I want to get to know her and I was like dude like everything about your life is weird can you just just do do something normal for the kid and you're like no I think I think this actually makes more sense and then I got to know her and I like and then you you should talk about the naming ceremony but you did this thing where you named her after a year and you're like this name like it fit her more and I had to get to know her a little bit and I was like after a year I was like that actually is makes so much sense but it's so not normal but you're always doing these weird things that actually appear to be well you've done a lot of stupid stuff but you've got a lot of things that actually like are pretty amazing but are not normal at all yeah and and I that's one of my favorite Parts about you you know what I mean cool thanks and I mean also because I listened to the pot a lot I noticed that um you guys hadn't talked about Sam had made a massive announcement on all his social that now he's gonna be having a baby um and so notice you guys haven't talked about that so I had some of the different wackier things I've done with my baby if you wanted to talk about them a naming ceremony was one of them yeah you know me and Sam just were just like guys we're just like yeah um nice job with the thing all right uh let's move on you know girls are like oh my God congratulations I'm so excited for you wow oh my God you look you're glowing Sam you look amazing and I was just like hey dude um good [ __ ] about the you know you know all right let's talk about business the the your stuff's working congratulations and we um well I wasn't sure I wasn't sure like what I wanted to put on the internet and I haven't actually made my decision what uh Sam posted a shirtless picture of himself to celebrate the baby I was like oh wow that is that is unbelievable combination there like that's a what an upsell you created in this photo announcement with the shirt off flexing in the middle of my stomach she was like cropped out of the photo it's like oh yeah by the way there's a baby over there hey that's the only reason why we did the whole thing uh do you uh do you put your do you put your kid's face on the I don't think you have maybe on Facebook Sean have you checked no I have but you only do it on Facebook right where it's just like friends well my wife does on her own Instagram so you know that's like but you know it's just her friends so yeah I'm trying to decide what to do I think I don't mind but I don't know anyway I'm still like working through that let's go through some of the things you did on the parenting side Jack so the naming thing Sam talked about it yeah let's do this let's finish that one so how did you come up with that idea do you think it was a good idea and eventually how did you actually end up naming her besides baby um so basically again coming like basically I think one of my values maybe is I don't like being told what to do and relating to what we were just talking about I also like to question norms so preparing to give birth um uh or maybe even yeah you're preparing to give birth what I read online and the Midwife Etc was saying is you have to pick a baby's name before you leave the hospital so we can put it on her birth certificate and he'll stop and so and I was like uh why do you have to do that like that's quite a short deadline they have to pick a name before you leave the hospital after you go through this traumatic experience yeah I was like I don't really like being told to do that like does you really need a name or he or she like just being born like do you really need a name you don't really need and so basically I researched and it varies state by state but I found that as long as both parents consent I this was in Hawaii where I was as long as both parents consent within the first 12 months you can change a baby's name without having to go to court or anything like that you just fill out a form and as long as both parents consent we just had like a no tree come to our house you can change the name pretty easily so I was like okay well um I'll I mean the first conclusion was I don't want to have to pick a name before I leave in the hospital there's too much rust for me and it's also telling me what to do so um my wife the last name was more important to my wife because um she's Korean and in their culture they have like a book of last names and whatever and so and we kind of made a deal okay the baby can have your last name but I get to take a lead on the first name I wouldn't pick it by myself but I get to take a lead on what is it and so then I was like okay well we'll just have the first name as baby and so um that is what we did at the hospital like uh on the birth certificate Etc so submitted it and then I did get a call from the Department of Health or whatever like a week later and they're like okay we just want to confirm um I understand you've had a recent birth just want to confirm the uh name and I and I was like yes it is um b-a-b-y and they're like okay so just to cover Ace baby the name of your baby and then it kind of surprised me because I was like yeah that's correct and then the guy was like okay that's cool I mean actually I've worked here 10 years and it has been one or two other people who've done this before as well actually and I was pretty surprised about that but anyway and then I also thought like um in South East Asian culture like China Korea maybe some other places they have this kind of just for fun they have this uh ritual when the baby is um a year old or so they put it the baby on the floor and on the other end of the room they put down like a stethoscope a law book stuff like this and they just let the baby crawl and whatever it picked it's like oh I picked a stethoscope that means you're going to be a doctor and then it's just for fun like let's do this Indians do that too but it's just three stethoscopes yeah oh you're supposed to pick up all of them exactly yeah except like 50 years ago they started adding like little motels that you could pick you know they're like oh nice and for my bit then I was like all right what if we actually did that but we just have different names so then she can pick her own name because I also remembered that when I was when when first joining High School like the first day of school they were like all right everyone go around the room and say an interesting fact about yourself and I remember I couldn't really think about an interesting fact about myself and I was like oh if I do this then she's always gonna have an interesting fact about herself right like I picked my own name uh it's pretty interesting so I was like that's pretty cool and this like product Obsession you've done this with babies so Jack's actually The Best Gift Giver of all time so what he does is uh like for my big my big life events Hill um like one time when we got married he sent me this maybe like three really big boxes I bet you there was like three or four thousand dollars worth of products in there and he'll send me like a variety of products and then he sends you a list of a paper that's like three pages long and it's a detailed description that says like this is blank the reason why it's the best and you're like explains it and it's like sometimes it's really random for example he was like these are the best bath towels because they have a little bit of copper in them which prevents molding or he even like my wife uses lotion all the time he's like this is the best lotion it's the best because it uses this vitamin or whatever and it was like crazy or it was even like these are the best um gummy bears because they're low in sugar but they still taste sweet but they only use Stevia and you did it with like maybe 50 items and then when I told you we were pregnant you sent me this box but it was all baby stuff and you're like this baby formula it's meant for babies that are three months old but I actually think it's best for newborns because it's the same thing as the newborn one but like there's a small very I forget exactly everything but it's like this massive list and you're doing now are you doing that now with all the baby stuff where you're just like literally analyzing every product um yeah I test out quite a bit I mean the reason I gave it to you as a gift is because you and Sarah had told me like oh you should create a business like uh Jack's box of like your favorite stuff I didn't actually want to do it in the business because I don't think it would make that much money and quite a bit of effort but I wanted to do for you guys because you kind of come up with the idea um I researched different products now do publish your your research well um not for baby products yet I was actually thinking maybe to make like a b a baby book or ebook um just with different recommendations you've seen um on my as my pinned tweet on Twitter I have my favorite products um just random products so I have whatever favorite I don't know what I've got on there but I've got like 20 products I shared as my favorites on Twitter and your underscore Jack Smith that's your thing uh let's talk about some of the other crazy things you're doing so you have a guy uh watching your baby on baby camera in Pakistan or something like that what's going on so you what are you doing with this baby sleep monitor thing yeah I mean um I kind of feel bad because you know when when speaking to new parents or if someone says like you're having a baby like people say like oh prepare to like never sleep again you're never gonna be able to sleep I kind of don't say anything but inside I'm like dude I'm sleeping better now than I was before having a baby um and that's due to setting up various things but um one of those is that I mean you have to have a house big enough for this but basically we put um my daughter a few doors down and so um initially if she would wake up and cry in the night we found that you know she would wake up cry for like five minutes then often go back to sleep so she only really needed help if she's crying like longer than that and I actually got the idea from Jonathan Swanson who's the founder of thumbtack and he called it like digital night nanny I called it like deep Sentinel for babies um I know Sam invested into Sentinel um and basically what it's doing is having a virtual assistant uh I have in India and basically he just watches my baby cam uh all night and he basically has Specific Instructions like okay if the baby wakes up and starts crying you start a timer and if she just cries for like three minutes and goes back to sleep don't do anything but if she cries for like more than seven minutes then um call me and wake me up and we have like you know I have a special phone for that and we have a backup phone in case that one broke or something so um basically we only get woken up if our daughter is crying longer than seven minutes and then so now I would say I only have to tend to her she's two and three months two years three months she now only wakes up maybe once every two months we have to go to her otherwise we don't have to do anything so that was one Jonathan Swanson came up with had been really good for me what does that assistant say uh that Indian person say like when you're like yeah here's the job um I mean that's a pretty odd request yeah um well one of the guys actually it was um I'd been working with this guy as a virtual assistant and then he's he's like oh my brother's in India he speaks a little bit of English but not perfect English he's looking for a job do you have any tasks that I can give him and then so I was just like all right let's do this so I think for him pretty awesome job because he can be multi-tart he can be doing whatever else um I mean the downside is that I don't know how they're working this but he actually doesn't take off a single day in in the year he's working 365 days a year now so I guess he's having like Thanksgiving and Christmas and the baby monitors on loudspeaker with his family I don't know so he doesn't take any time off yeah he's just not there Jack he he has a look at the camera in months he's like this Baby's two years old he's gonna your baby's gonna have some horrible separation anxiety I feel like it's been crying for like 15 30 minutes and like nothing ever happened your baby's like his twitch stream so um what about some of these other things so you said uh I don't think that universities will exist in 20 years and don't plan to send my daughter to school let alone College okay a bunch there say more so why I'd read this book somebody on Twitter had um recommended it and um it's called like don't tell me I can't and it's written by this guy a kid who's like 14 and he is it's his Trend at the moment it's trending now but he's he's talking from his perspective that he was doing this since three years old or something how he was brought up that he was not homeschooled like homeschooling has been around a long time right he was what they're calling unschooled this is actually a trend at the moment and he described how it worked for him let's see how it worked for him is like his family was super poor and also his dad was an Army veteran like injured in the Army and so was in a wheelchair and stuff and so he was always kind of helping to help out his dad and be self-sufficient and so um and the local school was like the worst in the country or something and they didn't want to send him there so initially they were like all right we'll just try homeschooling you and so he was homeschooled for like six to 12 months but it didn't go that that well and one day his dad um he said normally they were more encouraging but for whatever reason one day he just asked his dad like Hey Dad how do people um how do people get rich and his parents were like really poor so maybe also touched on an insecurity his dad is just like oh why don't you just figure it out yourself you know why don't you just watch some videos of Warren Buffett because I don't know we're not rich and then he did that he went and listened to loads of Warren Buffett stuff and it actually spiraled from there so underschooling is the concept that homeschooling is trying to replicate the school curriculum right like all right Math Science and you still have to do the tests and all that unschooling is there is no there is no curriculum the kid just learns whatever they want to learn and whatever is useful so he was saying from around an age of like five to seven years old he was repairing their car and doing things like this and he'd grown up in a poor family but he actually started his own business and by the time he was 13 he like parlayed it like so initially he bought a tiny piece of land and got some animals on it and like sell the produce in his local town and stuff then he got he built he bought a super run-down um house that was falling apart and the seller they'd built the house themselves and so they didn't want to sell it just for money but he's like hey look I'll buy your Shack that's falling down and I'm a kid and I'm gonna put on dedicate all my time to repairing it so it's it's restoring your legacy and so I really liked that and they sold it in for cheap he repaired it and then flipped the house by the time he was 13 he had something like hundreds of acres of land he was managing and he said one time when he was about 12 he went out with some friends and they were complaining about what they were learning at school they're like oh we had to learn the names of the planets in alphabetical order when the hell are we gonna learn that you would need to use that in life you know they ask him they're like hey Cole what what are you learning at the moment and it's like oh yeah well I've just been looking into recently found it kind of interesting how rich people generally have like a pass through LLC and then a C Corp and then they can deduct this from their taxes on this and the other kids are like what the [ __ ] is talking about you know he got so not like crazy rich but he got he was only 100 in his dad he actually was like loaning money to his parents he's like they never asked me for money and I never asked them for stuff but like in tough times like I loaned money to my parents I bought our car from them just to help them out you know stuff like that and then for me I was thinking back in school like I learned piano in school I had some piano lessons and in at some point had to do like gray you you had to do you know playing chords and I had an exam and then it was just so shitty you know it was not fun like I don't want to learn how to play these chords and music theory and stuff passing exam and I'm like this sucks and then I'm just looking now especially nowadays kids learning piano they'll do it by just seeing what's their favorite song and they'll just learn to play the song and that's just really fun and I think that exams and stuff just ruin the fun and curiosity of learning skills and so for me my daughter I'm just like how can I ensure that she's just having fun for as long as possible and um and like this kid said that was unschooled he said like he didn't learn traditional math but just when but it seemed that he had a need to learn a score a skill obviously he would then learn it like he's doing his taxes so he has to learn math to do his taxes but it's not because they're like oh learn the Pythagoras Theorem and you have no idea when he's gonna use it he identified himself I need to do my taxes so I need to figure out how to do math and I think that's just a philosophy that I subscribe to a lot I mean is wacky obviously but when you look like Elon Musk he created his own school for his kids Jeff Bezos created his own school for his kids I think he only has like seven kids I think that um you don't have to be billionaire to take this approach like billionaires seem to be thinking the school system is kind of [ __ ] up you don't have to be a billionaire you could but also poor what are you going to do then so fast forward she's six or eight years old what are you gonna do or at the moment she goes to this thing it's called is that another Trend it's called Forest school it's actually nothing to do with school basically they just go to a forest a bunch of kids and you're just playing all day like do you have a fake mud kitchen and you are like um picking oranges and turning to orange juice and you see a sheep and [ __ ] I'm I'm planning to just create my own thing like that but going to a bigger age I'm just like let's just bring a bunch of kids anyone in a local school thing can come around and also I feel like instead of teaching them like how to write and studying whatever I'm like wouldn't it just be awesome like whatever topic they they can pick the topic if I can suggest some wouldn't it be awesome if I just ping my buddy and be like hey Sam could you just teach the class a lesson on copywriting or I kind of feel if they just ping someone on Twitter if someone ping if someone is if a 10 year old kid pinged me like hey um I underscore myself and I've decided I want to learn business would you mind doing a lecture to my class and um we'll we'll have my parents will bring us to you I would totally do it um yeah so I'm kind of thinking stuff like that so I love this um my sister actually runs a school like this called nature kids if they said they're just outside all they just walk around they go on Trails if they find something they like learn about it and if they want to go climb trees they climb trees whatever and it's basically has two two things one uh so she has a traditional school and she has this nature school and the Nature School the kids are like by the end of the day the traditional school kids are like dead they have like no energy they're like ready to go home and they kind of like want to just watch YouTube or whatever and the nature kid kids even though they've been out walking around all day outside they have like way more energy which is like kind of counter-intuitive that's the first thing I've noticed um the second thing is uh yeah like they know a bunch of things that are interesting to them versus like in school it's sort of like you know you're forced to learn something that's not that interesting to you and you sort of begin to associate learning with boredom learning with sort of like uh you know being forced to do things versus on the other side uh you know it's self-driven it's great and exams right yeah the pressure of that now the the and I love the story you told about that guy but my question would be I think I think unschooling or sort of self self-driven learning is awesome when you're driven so what happens if your kid is not trying to like you know flip a house and learn through learn about Pastor LLC he's like I guess like the fear I would have and I think most people would have is your kid doesn't really have any interest they kind of just want to you know sit around and do nothing or uh you know they're and so now you you're unschooled but you're not really having this kind of like awesome you know self-driven curiosity do you like are you worried about that or do you think like no I can create that or this situation will will mold a person to be more that way and also on the other side what if she wants to be a doctor or a lawyer where you need uh you need to learn how to write credentials yeah and you need credentials yeah I mean great questions I mean the first side I definitely agree with you Sean um and is one bit my wife has said like you know some kids are not like you jack wanting to I was trying to make money when I was really little and stuff and might not take that approach I think just have to see how it goes as we go along uh one other bit that was interesting is um I visited a local Montessori school and um so Montessori studying it we're learning these different things just my wife and I just have interest um but one bit they had which is awesome is exactly as you said Sean School finished and we went there at the end of the day so whenever School finishes 4pm or something actually there was a bunch of kids still there and they have a farm outside and the head teacher was giving us a tour just because my wife made friends with them with her and she was walking around speaking to the kids about what's going on in the farm but she was not telling them anything to do the kids were just giving her an update so she's like oh I see the rabbit cage is broken like what's going on with that and the kid was giving her like a detailed plan like oh yeah we've seen this broken and we've come up with a new Roofing method that we're going to implement Etc the kids run the farm and I was like that's awesome what if you just have that but just scrap the school part and the school was also quite religious so like what if you just scrap the religion part of homage um Sam about the bit if she wants to be a doctor um I mean yeah I would guess one approach could just like go yeah sit out of like or take the total opposite approach and just hire loads of tutors and be like all right if that's the approach you want to take then okay I guess we're gonna have to get you up to speed faster than other kids um and I don't know how much you've actually known when you're five in school anyway so maybe just like all right you've got if you want to do that you're gonna have to be super smart and skip a bunch of grades then uh we'll help you do it but hahaha uh uh I don't I just I love hearing your stories I mean we could we could do this all day um I don't know what do you think Sean how do you feel yeah I've had a few times Jack where I just call Jack randomly and I just ask him about something and uh I think you are kind of more of a one-of-one at least in my life of people who are very uh like I don't know independent minded is kind of like the best way I would put it uh like I think you choose to lead your life how you want I think that's inspiring I also think that you are extremely like Sam said sort of curious and uh like I think you're a great competitor when you need to compete in something but you're not constantly trying to compete with none asked for and that's a very Silicon Valley trait people are trying to compete in times that are what are you competing on why are you trying to you know show that you're the smartest you're the richest you're the one at most whatever um it's an annoying trait and I think it's great that you don't have that so uh I don't know it's good good to talk to you as always do you leave us with either a book or product recommendation one of Jack's finds that you think people should check out that you're passionate about you something you think is awesome um well the book that I mentioned I guess the book that I talked about unschooling is like don't tell me that I can't um and two uh I guess like uh um spoiler alert like the kid it really sucks because this kid was building something amazing he actually drowned and died uh right after we wrote the book kind of sucks but it's a really short book you probably should have listened to me yes a sick way to end it it's a good time to end up [ __ ] so what's the name of it don't tell me I can't um and then it's just still so book you can read it in two three hours and challenges a lot of assumptions you might have about education and stuff and so for me was like really inspiring seeing this book I'm looking at your products on here did you just say wait beside did you just say she should alert you should have listened to the line yeah the library just tell them don't go in he's like have you read my books I'm going in um you're an [ __ ] Jack I'm looking at your Twitter list of products and you have this buckwheat pillow I think I bought one of these are these like hard as a rock like aren't they just like super super dense you can adjust how much buckwheat is in it and then I also have a pillowcase that divides into three sections so you can why do people love these so much they you need to get used to it a little bit but actually it cures my neck pain and I can't sleep on another pillow and I think Sam you said as well some of your friends even ship the pillow to the hotel before they arrive Nick Raiders Nick Gray is have you heard of this Nick Gray our buddy Nick Gray literally every time he goes to a hotel he has his assistant send this pillow to the hotel and then he just leaves it there when he's done every single time and sometimes if he's going to stay at a place for more than I think like four days he ships them a mattress I swear to God you could you if you Google I have a message from the hotel Google Nick Gray pillow and he'll tell you the story and I have been to like whenever you if I'm in a city and he's visiting I go to his hotel room and he always has that pillow he gets it shipped there every time how would you get rid of them actress yeah well I don't but I don't know what he does about the mattress but if you Google it I think he has a blog post on it but I but it's not just talk I've like oh whenever he's staying somewhere I'll go to his hotel just hang out with him and uh the pillow's there every time this is so funny wow so basically it's the best for neck pain a pillow normally is like you know it's a rectangle and then but ideally you actually want your head to have less support than your net because otherwise you puts your head at a weird angle you know so with this you can pull the backweet to one end and so it's giving a lot more support to your neck whereas your head is a bit lower and so it allows you to kind of be laying completely flat and so you're not kind of crinking your neck and waking up with like neck pain the next day I was listening to this podcast of Derek sivers on Tim Ferriss and Derek said he's an interesting guy he was they're like oh you do this one he has this one business I think it's like web hosting or something like that and um he was describing it and then Tim was like why did you decide to do this he goes uh you know sometimes I'll pick a project I'm paraphrasing her he's like sometimes I'll pick a project because I think about who's my customer and do I wanna are those my kind of people and he goes this is a business that lets you host your own personal website and I just realized that people who have their own personal website for no reason like just their own name.com those are my kind of people and I was like oh that's really great to figure out your filter for like what's a simple heuristic where like not everybody you like does this but everybody who does this you kind of like and um I think this like try every product to try to find the best quality of life levers I think this might be one of those things because everybody who I've met that does this I like that person and uh you're you do this Nick Gray does this and uh it's kind of amazing do you still have a sheet are you still tracking everything I'm not really a spreadsheet no I mean for example with the baby box I sent you I just looked around my house at like like I just kind of anecdotally buy a bunch of stuff try them all out and then send back ones I don't like and just keep the best so I wrote it down for you so I don't have a fixed sheet as I said maybe I might turn it into a baby book um but haven't yet he had this closet at one of his houses that I used to go to and it was like again a walk-in closet and it literally had I bet you it had thirty thousand dollars worth of supplements in there like it looked like a it looked like a pharmacy it was like um any bottle you could imagine and I was like does any of this do anything he was like nah not really you can't really feel he goes except this one thing and he had like a Ziploc bag and it had like tar in it it looked like it was like I was like is this like heroin what the hell is this and he was like yeah it works yes it was like he's like this is like Himalayan something and if you just take a little dab of this this it gives you so what was that it's called shillerjat um have them consistently found it repeatably amazing but yeah Himalayan uh shimmy Jacks is like an extra from a volcano or some crap dude it was like I swear to God it looked like a pharmacy it consistently impresses anybody that you tell about it that's what it does he had like scales and it had like white powders on it I mean it looks like a drug dealer and I was like does any of us do anything I don't know how much money you spend on all that it was tens of thousands and you're like this one thing is the only thing that like is amazing it was like a Ziploc bag of just this like tar amazing all right jack we gotta wrap it up this is fun uh thanks for coming on we should do this again thanks so much for having me love the podcast listen to it and I don't listen to any other podcast to be honest I just listened to it in the car so thanks again so much thank you

let's go outside of the tech world so uh two brands that that I uh I'm looking at that have lasted a long time Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton has lasted maybe 250 years now and when you think of Louis Vuitton you know what you're getting same at New York Times New York Times has been around for 250 years not Everyone likes them but you know what they're pursuing which is their version of the truth but then let's go to Raising Cane's you ever been to Raising Canes Dude Love raising case I met the founder of Raising Canes once he is awesome [Music] we're live what's going on what up how are you uh I'm thriving all right good so I've been thinking about this conversation you and I had we talked about Outsourcing and I'm actually going to put a lot of words in your mouth you didn't actually say everything I I'm implying that you said a lot of stuff which you didn't exactly say so so you're kind of more of a representation but Rob Dyrdek said something amazing on this pot uh a few pods ago he said two amazing things one he goes if I just do these he goes I was what did he say he goes I was making I was looking for these 20 30 million dollar wins instead I'm gonna look at and I would do like 12 of them he said he goes instead I'm actually only gonna do one or two things and I'm and I'm gonna hope that they're gonna be big and then he also said he has this thing called Forever Estates do you remember what he talked about forever Estates so afterwards he sent me mock-ups of this and I like Google the architect and everything and there was this really cool article that they rob and the architect wrote together so forever Estates Rob said I want to build this home so basically he said he had 12 million dollars liquid at the time 10 million dollars he went and bought this plot of land and then he goes to build the home I want it's going to cost 30 million dollars at the time I didn't have that and I it sounds like he maybe he has it now but he was like basically I want to build this home where the deer dick family for many generations can meet at this home to discuss Family Planning and family issues and things like that and so I'm going to build this home exactly how I want it and we're going to call it forever Estates because hopefully it lives forever I found that very inspiring did you find that inspiring loved it loved it I love when people take an absurdly Long View and more than anything I love when people have a vision for their life and what they're doing when somebody's got it it was awesome and compelling vision for their life that is like one of the most attractive traits to me it doesn't even matter if I agree with that Vision it's that they have that vision and that they agree with that vision is what matters I thought it was awesome and he sent me mock-ups of the home and I was like dude this is so inspiring and so I got I got all up hot and bothered about this it was awesome to me and so I started thinking about companies that can last a long time uh I've been a little bit obsessed with this because with Hampton things are going well we're not a success yet but it's very clear that like I always tell our team physics will allow this to work there's demand I've got a good audience for this we've got a good team physics allows us to exist there's nothing that gets in the way of this we're already somewhat successful the only question is how great will it become and I'm starting to think how do you create something that lasts 50 in a or 100 years whatever it is and the word brand is something that I've been thinking about a lot and I think you and I as well as our audience we get in these like short-term thinking and we use like the a word the Arbitrage word or we use like we use these certain words that people actually don't think about branding they don't think about soul and I've been thinking a lot about that lately and there's this book that I'm uh reading where it's called lessons from the century or lessons from the century companies Club so it's like this one woman studied like companies that have lasted 100 years and she's like what do they all have in common and I've been thinking a lot about that and you brought up something you said you invested in this company Shepherd which I think is awesome I actually am starting to use them um I'll give you a plug is it grow Shepherd or support shepherdsheper.com yeah support shepherd.com you talked about that investment uh in the company and it's and you're talking about Outsourcing it's basically you hire people in the Philippines I think also Latin America and they do a bunch of odd jobs but you said something like I want to hire tons of these people and I started thinking about that I started thinking should I do that and then I realized I shouldn't do that because I actually should do that for some roles but the thing that like you should do it for some rules but I had this like off-site this like uh Hampton retreat with like a bunch of our employees and I realized you have to build a real strong company culture and you have to figure out how do you keep employees for a long time and that's one of the key keys to building a brand that can last a long time and I wanted to hear how are you and this by the way this topic is not that exciting for anyone who's in survival mode this topic is more exciting for people who are in like Thrive mode where it's like I got this thing working to be clear the first phase of the company is just build something that people want and figure out if you can get it to them um right don't worry about culture don't worry about brand don't worry about the forever plan don't worry about the 25-year Vision um none of it's gonna matter if you can't do the first thing Sam has done the first thing with Hampton he has proven that he can create something that people actually want and he could sell it to them so now he's thinking you know and now you get what I call Progressive ambition I want to do a whole video on Progressive ambition I'm going to show people if you go back and you watch Mark Zuckerberg's early interviews and people are like where does this go from here you're on eight campuses now you're where are you gonna we're gonna open this up to everybody high schoolers everything he goes he's like 50 schools he's like well you know our goal is to get to you know all the major colleges um I'm not sure everyone keeps saying why you know expand expand expand some things are cooler when you don't expand and I don't think why do we have to open up to everybody I'm not sure I mean some some things are really we can build something really really useful for college students so maybe we should just do that and then now the guy's like created like hot air balloons that give internet to Farmers in India so that they can use Facebook right it's like he got progressively more ambitious as he went along and that's which is a crazy story in itself by the way Facebook uh I think Sarah helped to work on this or something at Facebook Facebook basically puts these planes over India so any Indian can access Internet because the issue with growth of Facebook is they literally have everyone on the internet they have to create more internet for people they got to create a bit more Tam I'm like we're tamping it up right now hold on we gotta give more people the internet so they could use our app but that's cool that it started where that's a great phrase Progressive ambition very common for different companies you can go back I'm a forensic I'm an archaeologist I go back into the to go study the early origins of these companies and you find this very very commonly that they start with a sort of humble ambition then as things start to work they snowball their ambition they become more and more ambitious as they go realizing the opportunity is wider and bigger than they had initially uh you know planned for and that one step of success earns the right to go for the next step of success and that it is okay to ladder up because what most people do is they look at them today they say well now they're trying to do a b c and d so I when I start need to also plan for a b c and d and it's actually like no you actually just start with a you don't actually have to do anything else of course there are exceptions there's Elon Musk saying we're gonna you know but you know even Elon for example let's take one of the most ambitious companies in the world SpaceX right what's the goal what's the mission statement it's like make the human species multi-planetary so we can survive when we ruin Earth uh or Earth gets you know hit by an asteroid or whatever and so it's like wow what's more ambitious than creating a rock literally rocket science to create rockets that will eventually take us to live on Mars wow that's like the biggest Vision ever when SpaceX started his initial vision was to do a test demonstration sending a plant in a rocket into a certain like a certain height I don't remember exactly where it was to you know have the first living thing you know go out of uh you know past the moon or whatever wherever you're trying to take it and that's all we want to do is just take a plant out there and he's like oh I'll just fund this you know take me 20 million dollars but it'll inspire people towards science and you know hopefully NASA will then fund real Mars missions after that and then only you know along the way he's like you know what screw this plant thing I'm gonna let's actually do it ourselves we don't need to inspire an asset let's just do the whole thing ourselves he also got progressively more ambitious and also when he first started he started a thing called zip2 which I'm almost certain it's basically like putting the yellow pages on the internet which I'm sure he had some cute way of spinning it where it was a grand plan but it it he made 20 million dollars off of it which is a lot of money but he was like in his head he's like I gotta get my nut you know what I'm saying he's like you see every every human has a number a phone number and you can reach them this is one of the most marvelous things in the world and you need a way to reach them it's information you know he'll make anything sound fancy but actually one of the interesting things is Elon is also credited as like you know the you know he found he created PayPal he didn't actually create PayPal uh you know PayPal the product was created by you know first Max leban and Peter Thiel but even then when they merged with elon's company he had this big vision for x.com he's like x.com is going to be everybody's full Financial life it's going to be banking it's going to be mortgages it's going to be loans it's going to be sending money it's going to be savings accounts it's going to be all things to all people and that was the vision for x.com when they merged Elon was the CEO of the merged company and the plan was to createx.com and so he had this big audacious crazy vision his forever plan about how he's just going to change the whole financial system and actually the only thing that worked was going back to the basics let's make something that people actually want see if we can get it to them and it was like oh yeah eBay sellers would love a way for people to to pay the money when they send them the like beanie babies and so literally it was send money via send money via email small amounts hang a pal was the was the actual use case that people wanted and needed and it was only when they essentially booted him out and focused on that small use case the smaller Vision did PayPal actually take off and so you know sometimes you almost have the reverse or you start to audacious and actually you needed you you skipped the step of finding that initial foothold and that's what PayPal actually did and here's the rub which is which is very similar to that that I'm experiencing that I'm trying to think about which is how do you balance take so so in order to build a company that lasts a long time you need to you need a few things which I can talk about but you it starts with having a brand it starts with having a very clear defined purpose it starts with having you have to have employees who you want to work with for a long time and there's a bunch of things but how do you balance paying the bills and taking customers and also like having this mission that might be polarizing to people and I'm trying to figure out when is that transition do you always have it and that's something that I'm that I'm constantly thinking about now which is like where I don't think it's a switch I think you have to have it embedded in your culture early on but where do you make sacrifices where do you make sacrifices I'm not sure I'm not sure on on going from short term to long term thinking how that happens and that's something that I've been thinking a lot about lately so it's hard to kind of give advice without any specifics but I'll do it anyways I'll be the advice guy for a second so when I was doing my very first company it was a stupid company we're trying to do the I'm trying to make a restaurant chain the Chipotle of sushi and we had all these micro decisions to make like any business does on a day-to-day basis should we use this packaging or this packaging for our thing well this one costs costs more and looks better but this other one you know we would have better margins because it costs less and then there's this other one that's eco-friendly and blah blah and so one of our mentors at Duke she um sat us down and she's like guys you're having The Wrong conversation and we're like what do you mean and she's like it's not about packaging what do you mean she's like well let me ask you this what decision would what decision can you make Upstream of this that would make your packaging decision obvious I was like well we don't really get it she's like you got to know what do you value right are you about ruthless efficiency and margins because if so then the choice is obvious there's no choice right you just choose the one with the cheap packaging with the best margins are you about are you is your number one value the quality of the customer experience uh because if it's the quality of the customer experience you're definitely not going to choose a cheap one but you also won't choose the Eco one that's going to kind of melt you know the old paper straws problem it's not actually the best product but it is eco-friendly it's like so if you're all about product quality that's what you're gonna gonna go all in on that's your number one value then the packaging decision is obvious same thing with the other side if you're all about sustainability if that's your number one value then the decision is obvious she's like you don't know which packaging to pick because you don't know what you stand for you don't know your values and she's like what you want to do is figure out your values number one so what are the things you value more than more than other things because they're and you only know what you value when you're choosing amongst good options it's obvious to Value something when you have a good option and a bad option there's no you didn't test your values there your values only get tested when you have multiple good options but they're good in different ways and that's when you need to know which one do we value um the second thing that she said was uh Jeff Bezos has this great quote where he goes they're like oh you know Amazon has been around forever and uh you guys have just kept growing and growing and growing and you know through every Innovation cycle you know the internet mobile phones whatever Amazon has been Cloud you know Amazon's done great how do you stay on top of the curve and he goes because we don't look for Trends he goes we ask ourselves the opposite question instead of saying what's going to change we say what's not going to change so basically he's like good we're customer obsessed that's the number one value for them and he's like number two we ask what's not going to change oh P are people ever going to want less selection no are they ever going to want higher prices no are they ever going to want slower delivery no Okay cool so now we know that those are never the never changing things so all we got to do is how to figure out how to give them more selection lower prices and faster delivery that's what they care about they're never going to not care about those things they're always going to care and all we got to do is just continually find a way to do that so I think that gives you a sort of long-term orientation like for Hampton what would you say say are the never going to change things I've got to figure that out frankly when I started it was the same thing as Zuckerberg which was I just want to like be around smart people you know what I mean are people ever going to want to be around lower quality Founders no they're always going to want that bar going up that they would look in their peer group and they're in awe how did I get in this room right I think that's going to be the first feeling you want to create is holy [ __ ] all the other people in my group are awesome I can't wait to talk to these people right that's going to be I think always the number one the quality of the other members in their group to them and then I I think the the thing I've been thinking about is they're always going to want their peers to be committed so you have if so we've been thinking about what happens if you don't show up to a meeting it's like well we should just ban them let's ban them you miss them both of those things we mentioned hurts Revenue because if you make the exactly you want to increase Revenue widen the door baby let them all in they'll let everybody who wants to pay the bill come in okay but now you've ruined the quality of member problem you know the long-term people will never want this to go in that direction you're screwing that up for short-term profit same same thing on the people don't show up you ban them or you also you know have to go ahead and remove that subscription revenue from from the from from the old stripe account and so you're not going to want to do that either but it will only happen if you take this long-term orientation and say no no the thing we value the most is people want a product it's high quality people that show up and care about this community about this group and if either of those two every decision has to be first and foremost from that point of view does this increase the quality of our members or decrease it does this increase the commitment levels or decrease it and I also think that so you you were given the example of Facebook and Amazon and I looked at those as examples as well but let's go outside of the tech world so uh two brands that that I uh I'm looking at that have lasted a long time Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton has lasted maybe 250 years now and when you think of Louis Vuitton you know what you're getting same at New York Times New York Times has been around for 250 years not Everyone likes them but you know what they're pursuing which is their version of the truth but then let's go to Raising Cane's ever been to Raising Canes love raising case I met the founder of Raising Canes once he is awesome you guys gotta I don't know his name but Google Raising Cane's sound founder and like watch talks with this guy he's like a southern boy I think from Louisiana he started a chicken finger place I think at LSU and if you go to Raising Kings now here's what you're gonna get they all they sell is chicken fingers you can basically get them deep uh breaded and deep fried or not breaded and deep fried and then I think they only sell fried or fried or obesity fried which one do you want yeah like there's like there's only there's no options and you get it on a styrofoam like a styrofoam uh like uh school lunch box like type of thing and they're not fancy but you know what you're gonna get every time and he's like adamant he's like We Are Gonna perfect this we're gonna get this it's gonna be fried the exact same time every single time and it's not sophisticated but you know what you're gonna get another brand that I like [ __ ] Dollar General you ever go to a Dollar General yeah of course dude it's it's not sophisticated it's not high-end but you know they're just gonna have a ton of stuff and it's going to be low quality and it's going to be affordable you know what you're gonna get every time so I don't think you need this sophisticated like it's day one here at Amazon and we're like no you don't need that you could have like no like we're fashion Nova like it's cheap apparel that you know you don't have to make a lot of money and you could buy it and we're always going to be on top of [ __ ] you don't need a lot of that stuff uh that high-end like sophisticated stuff you can be anything but it's just cool that like to see people who are adamant about what they are and they just deliver value every time or at least they're focus on the brand so anyway that's my spiel about that and the reason I was thinking about it was because you were talking about Outsourcing stuff and I'm like oh that definitely seems cheaper but is it cheaper for every role in the long term because you have to build in order to build a brand that lasts a long time and let's let's let's be straight here this is all about like doing dope [ __ ] it's also about making more money I think you can make more money if you drag out your Excel sheet you're like oh this grows 30 20 every year yeah drag that [ __ ] out for 50 years AC let's see what's going on over there right this is it's this is also rooted in like Adventure and fun exciting and in greed so I don't want to get that twisted uh but anyway you have people who want to work for you for 10 20 years uh it gets really interesting and I think you can actually like embed different things in culture do you know White Castle you ever heard of White Castle you know what that is right dude White Castle I [ __ ] love White Castle I went and looked at their like LinkedIn I was trying to figure out their executive team like all of them have worked there for like 30 years and they used to make fun of them like oh man these [ __ ] suits I'm like no no no no they know who their customers they know what they're doing and you get the same [ __ ] every time and it works because there are people have worked there for [ __ ] 30 years and they like know what the company's about so anyway that's my rant rant over but it's something I'm thinking about it it's something I'm thinking about I'm glad we just discussed says publicly I'm actually gonna I was taking notes yeah yeah good uh I think that's cool I I take the exact opposite point of view for the record um I do not think about building things that are gonna last 15 100 years I think that's really hard and I think it's unnecessary I want to be the thing that lasts 50 or 100 years not uh an individual brand necessarily well you are the brand if that's the way I think about it is this um it depends on how you want your career to go some people get really excited about building something and being a part of something and working on something for 30 years I get more excited about taking like sort of seven year chapter arcs of my life and be like cool I want to have five you know I only get One Life to Live um I want to experience all the things I want to ride all the rides and so I do a you know I did a a tour of Duty and I I lived in Australia and Indonesia and all these other places that was fun that was where the Great Adventure I moved to Silicon Valley in the heart of San Francisco and I tried to do the billion dollar startup thing now I'm doing this basically cash flowing business side of things and podcasting creating content I'm a content creator now that's interesting uh that's fun in a new way I'll shift at some point uh you know you know seven years from now I'm not gonna be a content creator anymore or I'm gonna shift the content I'm gonna Create TV shows or a stand-up comedy set or something yeah but you do realize that's all rooted I'm gonna like Jujitsu your ass you realize this is all rooted in the same [ __ ] which is like your BR it is a consistent brand and you are changing the monetization I might not even put my name on uh like my name is not always going to be front and center on everything when you're a content creator it is but other times it's not for me the more important thing is I'm not I'm not gonna Bank on people recognizing my brand in order to do something I do want to accumulate enough financial freedom and Runway so that I can go pursue things that don't have to make money right away and um and so but but you know it's all about what you the vision for you you have for yourself so that's why I was talking about Rob Dyrdek has this vision for his house you have a vision for Hampton what you're trying to create this is long-term enduring thing I have a vision for my my life or my career that is Chapters and episodic and I want to have that variety and new challenge where I have to like go become uncomfortable and try to get good at something new and learn a different you know sort of yeah go learn the dark arts of a different area of different different whole different industry and go become a beginner again that's something I get excited about more so than creating one thing that's going to last a long time or I'm going to be a part of for a long time is that a phrase we're going to start using the dark arts I mean that's patent is so yeah saying that right now um where do you want to go um let's move on okay I got two quick ideas for you in general I want to say this by the way in this pod I think we're going to make a shift in how we create the content so right now every episode is this mismatch of breaking down a business talking about Frameworks an idea business idea here or there I think what we're going to start to do is segment them better or chunk them better theme the episode's better so you know what you're gonna get and we just go really hard at one thing so we're gonna do episodes where it's really hard on just ideas business opportunities that we see we're gonna go really hard on certain topics like um one-man businesses or you know businesses that have very few people but just crush it it's gonna be a lot harder for us to do the prep for that but I think it'll make for much better episodes so uh we've been talking a bit about that I think we should put it out there that we want to we want to start doing that but until then let's mismatch a little bit I got an idea for you so okay if you made a grid of customers that are easy to acquire or hard to acquire on one side and then customers that are not that valuable and super valuable on the on the other axes um one box that interests me there is hard to acquire Super valuable and the reason why is because those companies can become very very defensible very very valuable right your value as a company or even as a person is just based on how easy are you to replace you want to be Irreplaceable Irreplaceable that's how you can actually make more money in the long term so what's on that in that quadrant like uh like a [ __ ] plain manufacturer or something like that something that sells to government so you go get government contracts not easy hard might be hard to do might be boring to do long-term expensive government contracts it might take you years to get to the point where you can get one but when you get one very valuable and very defensible and so um I was thinking about this I was like what because I invested in this um drones company called valency a long time ago I've invested maybe many years ago I have no idea how they're doing I was a small investor I don't even get the updates but um at the time they were doing pretty well and they had a uh you know I was like okay well this valuation's a little bit Rich for where you're at but why is it you know why do you think this is the right valuation and it was like but they're about to get this government contract that's 100 million a year contract one one customer will now become worth more than all their customers combined because and what's the term length of that contract I think it was like a there was a couple that they were up for I think they were like sort of three and five year deals something like that so it's like okay these are huge deals that you can get and once you get one government contract you're sort of de-risked and you've done all the you know the clearance and all that stuff you basically you have to get your company to a spot where you could get a government contract and once you have one being able to get the next one becomes more likely because you're sort of in The Trusted vendor Circle so I was like oh that's pretty valuable I was just thinking about one the other day you know with this whole covid pandemic somebody out there has got to be selling some kind of pandemic modeling software or detection software to every government in every country of the world and this is also have like a network effect where as soon as you provide you're the provider of this product to uh one government it's actually something that all governments would then choose you for because you know the more governments you get the more compelling your case becomes and so I wonder who's building kind of the talent what palantir did for I think uh like National Security type stuff somebody's got to be doing for biosecurity so who is creating the uh pandemic monitoring detection modeling awareness program that you can then go sell to every single government on Earth as an indefinite ongoing contract hey these things happen once every 100 years we have the Spanish Flu we got coveted all right I'm just gonna go I'll be your provider because hey they're devastating when they happen and I could I could be this for you for the next hundred years I think that's a a hundred year company that uh is probably quite defensive and quite valuable if you can do it I'll talk to some of my friends who work at Pelletier I'm like hey what'd you guys do today and they're like oh just like uh stopped a terrorist attack in France how about you I wrote a blog post you know what I mean like until five tweet Tuesday today yeah my favorite Tweets in my newsletter it's cool have you ever looked at it it's like those uh have you ever worked at those there's all these like net worth calculators where you're like where will I be in 50 years and you're like well if you were to start in like 1884 uh this is where you'd be if you were starting like 1995 this is where you'd be and you can like see like well because that this 50 year or this 30 years actually had slow growth this uh 10 years had fast growth and you could like see all the different scenarios you're like so if we take the average it's this but if this happens this so you're kind of like talking about like that but with like potential illnesses who have you researched out there uh I haven't researched any of this but I'm sure it already exists these sort of like uh you know like because people have been worried about these sort of like viral things but obviously they were insufficient right so like whatever existed obviously sucked because we didn't detect it we didn't have any plan for it and we had no idea how fast this thing was spreading like literally the best pandemic model I saw was made as a side project by Kevin Systrom the founder of Instagram for fun on the side where he's like oh look I can break down by state they are not the viral coefficient basically of this of this virus uh based off of this public data I'm getting about hospitals and hospitalizations and um I can use that to kind of show which states are flattening the curve versus which states are about to go exponential and you know they should really consider doing something and it's like somebody's got to be doing this this got to be the easiest sales pitch of all time right now is kind of what I guess what I really mean it's like if you're sitting at MIT or one of these places just be like wear a sign that says I went to MIT and then go walk into the government building open up the fanciest like Matlab you know like model you could find and be like you need to pay for this and just see what happens I think I feel like they can get you can get pretty far right now with this pitch of like hey we'll help you with the we'll help you keep track of these viruses do you remember about two years ago you and I were both interested in people who are trying to detect fires uh forest fires do you remember that yeah yeah we did it we did this on the Pod right there was probably like one or two like kids like college kids fooling around with it but then there was like I think two different companies that raise money I think from Founders from fund and actually they were ex-palanteer guys I forget the name of the company it's a four-letter word it was like gel or I forget what it was but they were I tried to invest in them and they were like they weren't having it because they were uh getting big and they they didn't need any money but do you know what happened to those guys uh felt maybe was it felt f-e-l-t um I don't know the name of it that's really hard to remember uh but no and I also don't know what uh what came of it but yeah there was I remember when the California wildfires were happening I felt like every three months there was like a new fire and the entire like State of California was like covered in Smoke um yeah I remember when that I remember when that was happening to find early detection of wildfires was like a like a startup idea that a bunch of people got funded for yeah it was really interesting what we need to do what I'll do not this week but next week because we have Jack on next because I'm gonna actually do research and see how these guys are doing because it's very similar to what you're talking about but what was your uh what and what was your other thing that you were looking at you have this other thing the Celeb you're going to go from selling to governments to selling to Jessica Simpson yeah exactly yeah not the same IQ so basically this next idea is so celebrities are having this like deep fake crisis uh crisis and opportunity so deep fakes are getting really really good and celebrities now have a crisis plus opportunity so the crisis is you've seen this fake Tom Cruise it's deep fake Tom Cruise this guy's like amazing it looks just like Tom Cruise and it's like a video you know it's this is getting really good you're not going to be able to tell dude did you see did you see the do you see the ones where they put our podcast in Spanish yeah those are awesome by the way we should do that we should release our podcast and everything they were amazing they were so good I mean and I've heard of these new scams where they'll take uh people whose voice and video you get access to and they call your parents I mean like Hey Dad look I'm trapped I need some money can you please send it like just don't ask questions to send the money it's wild it's wild and so I think there's an opportunity here so I think celebrities who get paid for their name and face and you know oh I gotta go fly to you know Arizona and shoot this commercial for Gatorade right now and it's gonna be three days but I'm gonna get paid all this money blah blah that's gonna change into Kindred would like to use your your AI clone in their commercial you cool with that yeah you get to sit at home and collect the check and it's like maybe it's 50 less you know expensive for the brand maybe it's the same cost for the brand I don't know but uh celeb you don't have to do the work anymore that's going to be a big deal so the more famous you get now you're not gonna have to actually do the appearance thing because you'll just send your your AI it's not double to go do it so that's an opportunity but there's also a a risk there which is what if somebody's just doing it without your consent and so I think somebody's going to need to create a sort of celebrity deep fake licensing company so it's a company that goes and says look we're going to create the legal entity that's going to house your name and likeness that other brands can come interact with when they want access to this and we're also going to do the detection to find out is anybody doing the unauthorized use of your name and face somewhere um and we will handle all the takedowns for you so it's kind of like a reputation.com but for this new deep fake thing so you basically will go and I think you'll you need to it's almost like Angel list you need to create the legal framework for how these work you need to go sell this to every agency and say hey you should we've created one for you know you have one of these for all of your your clients on your roster and when a brand comes to you use this to issue the license that has the rights and controls on it that has the digital encrypted watermark on it um that has the tracking on it and then we will also fight anybody who is trying to use it without paying you because that's going to become an issue as well um that's what I think is going to happen I think somebody can build that company right now I used to get all these emails when I first started the hustle because what we would do is we eventually bought a Getty's license which is like 50 Grand a year but before that we would use I would just type in whatever picture I wanted and then I'll go to Google and click like allow for commercial use and then I would like I would use those pictures on our website and then at once we got popular we would get all these emails from these patent trolls they're not patent trolls I mean we were we were using someone else's picture and they would say send us three grand and we'll go away otherwise we're suing you and I started looking into them and basically what they did was they just built this technology so they could detect if someone's photo was being used and they would automatically like crawl they would use like who is and find out who the webmaster was and send you this email and I wonder like how those folks turned out like what's going like how some of these people actually built those those things and if they were profitable I imagine so like there was one time I used someone's picture it was like in the I think it was like the it was like a thumbnail picture it was the smallest picture and I didn't even know we used it and I think maybe someone at our company took a screenshot of it and like tried to alter it and then put it on our website in the smallest way and they totally caught it and within like a few hours we had to send them like three thousand dollars it's like [ __ ] they got us I wonder like what that looks like in the world of AI when you are having a bunch of these fake celebrity videos you know what I'm saying yeah yeah exactly so I think somebody's gonna need to uh to to create the good version of that so one option has become the troll uh the other option is become the official sort of like broker of of these of the usage of these digital defects um all right so that's my second one the company by the way is called felt f-e-l-t.com felt that was the it was uh that's what we talked about remembering you want to talk about how you flew Ben out to convince him to move with you yeah I think it's good actually because remote work is you know obviously all the rage and remote work is great in a bunch of different ways but I'm of the opinion which is uh remote is great when you have things figured out and you need people who are just operational to do things anytime there's a lot of needs figuring out or creativity or just your brain trust I think works best in person um and so I told Ben the other day I was like Ben I think we're on to something with what we're doing uh business partner Ben business partner Ben I was like you know he lives in Austin right now and I was like you gotta I was like you gotta move out here and he's like oh but like you know I live here now and Life kid we have family in Texas I was like yeah I know but like you we both believe the following right um every time we get together magic happens um this can be pretty big like what we're doing can become pretty big and so even like a 10 to 20 percent Improvement on uh what we're doing is actually worth maybe tens of millions of dollars so it's like you know it could be worth it to move um and California's a great place too so it's not like I'm saying you know let's go to a rural Ohio or something and um and so he was like okay why do we do this so he moved out here for the month so he got an Airbnb in The Burbs or San Francisco and The Burbs where I'm at and he's like I got an Airbnb brought his wife kid came out here he's just been living here for the month and um and I also I offered him I was like dude I'll pay you dollars which bleep that out um if you move and he was like and I but I told him I go but the number drops by 20 every quarter that you don't move because I was like this is not like a standing offer forever it's a burning it's an exploding offer I said you should take your time you should think about it but you should also know every quarter that you don't move that number goes down dude he should tell you you come you get your ass to Texas yeah no he knows I'm not going anywhere he knows I'm not going anywhere that's not the that's not the deal I actually lived in Texas for a long time uh and you know the other thing is like here in California you know in San Francisco there is kind of like for for example for our rolling fund there's so many companies so many other investors so many people in the startup world like you want to be like proximity Is Power you want to be near as many other people as you can that are doing the same sorts of things as you as you are um to the extent that your lifestyle will allow it and so uh so yeah we'll see he told me I think I think I got like a 10 to 20 chance well I'm coming out I was I was with him a week or two weeks before he went out there and I was shocked when he told me that he thought that there was maybe a 20 chance that he could be convinced and by he I mean the the levy entity uh the the household and I was shocked that it was 20 is it still 20 percent I don't know I think so but uh we also work a lot when he's here so I'm sure his wife's like dude this is terrible like you work more now like oh man I don't want to do this and so uh so that might be working against us the other thing though is uh the way we work is kind of goofy like um I don't think most people do this but you know for coding they have pair programming it's not that popular but some people do it what pair programming is I I think um what's the name of that agency that was in San Francisco that was like a really popular Dev shop uh it was like it like went public at one point you know you know the name uh yeah yeah I don't remember it but yeah they popularized it at least I don't know if they invented or popularized it but basically it's two programmers working on one computer you know right it's like the uh the engineering two girls one cup basically it's like you sit together there's one keyboard and you would think well okay you have half the efficiency like only one guy's working only one guy's coding but actually you get more than double the efficiency because it keeps you completely focused and you and your partner are basically both talking things through it figuring things out on the Fly and literally me and Ben do that when he comes out here to work we I'm like all right put your laptop down like just we buddy up side by side at this desk and we'll just work on the same thing at the same time and like I can't just like open Twitter and start messing around over there what's happening what are you doing can't you can't just say open new tabs you know uh as you're figuring something out one of the guys pointing something out you just sort of really stacking uh that's why I call like stacking Focus it's like whatever my level of focus is plus is a level of focus on the same thing so that's been good the other is the in between time so already when we work remote we call each other all the time uh you know probably on the phone two hours a day three hours a day maybe on calls either with others or just ourselves but what's happening now is we'll work on something for a bit that's kind of like us being on a call together working on something and then we're like all right let's go get food and we'll just hop on our bikes we'll go to this taco shop we go get this we go to the same taco shop every day we get the same same meal every day we play waffle ball afterwards hold the hands if we skip home basically but while we're doing it it's sort of like the best ideas are coming out uh in all the in-between time and that's the time where normally if we'd be like okay bye close Zoom or close Google hangouts or whatever and then you know I put on a podcast and he does something else and you know it's the in-between time where you get the serendipitous ideas um so it just kind of reminding me how valuable it is to work in person so here's here's the issue that you have or I've always had with you which is whenever I'm around you whenever I am around you both of us are high high-ish energy people where you're the type of person that eggs people on and then I'll egg you back on or I could see like and I'm not even that bad at that but you do I'm sure there's a lot of other people like Suli where you guys just start egging each other on and it's like wait a minute we're totally off track here we should just do the same thing over and over again does this having him around just distract you further because I can see you guys just like you're sitting on two like love seats and you're throwing a football back and forth and you're like why don't we do this yeah what if we did this it's like well [ __ ] it let's just do it right now it's definitely a part of it okay every single day that's like that I crumple up a piece of paper I throw it to him he throws it back and we're playing catch talking about [ __ ] that like you know things we could do that are not like just the obvious things but the beauty of it is as I've gotten older and I've gotten wiser and I've been doing this podcast two things have happened one I hang around you and you're very good at just doing the thing every day whether it's your workout or it's whatever I'm just gonna do the thing and I don't want to get distracted by everything I just want to do the thing as I hang out with you is how it helps there was also a guy who came on the podcast long time ago one of the earliest episodes and he designed it's he's from Peak design they make these like camera bags so he started his company sad that was two years ago yeah this was like one of the first 15 episodes I think and um he uh he so he makes these camera bags who knew and they do like I don't know at the time like 70 million a year in Revenue off of camera bags and I was and like clips for your DSLR camera I was like what the hell is this that big of a market and he had done it off of Kickstarter and he kind of inspiring guy and uh as I was talking to him I go so what's your philosophy around business he goes he goes everybody's got these like plans they got these ideas blah blah blah he goes I think it's like life and business is just a six inches in front of your face he's like it's just this it just held up his hand six inches before he goes I just look at this and I just do the six inches in front of my face that's all I'm focused on and I just do that every day and that stuck with me and so we have you can't see it but on the wall here I wrote six inches in front of our face on a giant like post uh like a giant sticky pad thing these things are great by the way you should buy these these uh giant sticky pad things where you sort of tear the paper it's like a huge Post-It note that goes on your wall dude at Monkey Inferno your old office you are like that guy you always had white boards and like pads that was your thing you were always standing up like writing yeah that was you you always said that yeah whiteboard sesh real quick so so yeah I have it here and it says the six inches in front of our face and so the first thing we do every day when he comes over is we re-prioritize the six inches in front of our face it's like what are the small no-brainer steps forward that will make this like one percent better today and we the first three hours of the day we don't do anything else besides knock those out and um I think theoretically we could just do that for eight hours a day I would get bored out of my mind also I can kind of get eight hours of work done in three hours of focus when I put my mind to it and so that's what we do first and then for the rest of the day we think okay what what else could LeapFrog something forward Beyond those one percent obvious improvements so we knock out anything anything we can think of that's a one percent obvious Improvement the six inches in front of our face first and so that's how we've been able to stay focused our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better dude you shared something on Twitter about uh what's this football player's name Russell Russell okong yeah oh my God so I'm not a football I'm not a sports guy at all so I didn't even know who this person was and you shared this thing this basically who is he he was he was he good yeah he was awesome he was a former lineman so linemen are you like the biggest guys on the football field so he's you know probably I don't know 300 pounds or something like that uh he's like six five he's he's six five 310 pounds when he plays yeah and he was like a star like he won he like won a Super Bowl ring he was a pro bowlers awesome awesome player um I remember I think he was playing on the Seahawks for a while that's that's kind of what I remember him uh he's now on Twitter there's a couple of these athletes like and Dominican Sue um Russell okung that are like they're kind of like on Tech Twitter somehow like and so Russell and you could DM him and they'll and he's he's been replying to my DMs yeah like Matthew dellavedova invited me to an event the other day I was like this is so cool that they've crossed over and they've got their athlete Camp they've also got kind of business Tech uh interest and there they like the by the way the best thing about it is they come in so humble um which is like they uh they don't like they don't come in with this like well you know who I am personality like this Saturday so we do I started this basketball pickup game every Saturday for Founders and investors out here in the East Bay and we rent this gym and then we we all just play pick up for like three hours and uh Zaza pachulia came and he's uh he's a former player on the Warriors and he oh really he tweeted like oh yeah I'll uh I'll play and I didn't invite him to the first one because I thought he was joking when he replied and then he emailed me after the first was like bro what happened I didn't get the information no way I was like no way oh [ __ ] you actually were gonna show up and so he came this week and it was [ __ ] awesome dude like not awesome at basketball obviously he's also a basketball compared to us but he um Zaza is is it like a big Russian looking guy or I don't know where he's from where is he from I don't know Serbia or I think he's from I think he's from Serbia I'm not 100 he's just Google it Georgia Georgia he's uh yeah he's like seven foot uh and he's just he's a beast and so now he works for the war yours he does like their business side their operating basketball operations and investing uh for them and uh he's just super personable super funny guy like was totally humble and like you know did he play yeah he played with us for three hours it was once it was amazing um I was talking so much trash to him and he was just such a good sport about it it was amazing so yeah I just I gotta say I was so I've been so impressed with the way that kind of like the athletes I've seen that crossover into business and Tech they like they do it with with like I don't know so much finesse it's really impressive wait what did you learn about I love seeing pro athletes in real life and just like seeing them joke around or like behind the scenes Instagram videos where they're like hey watch this I bet you I can jump over this thing they jump over this like huge thing you're like oh my God these people like we're not the same type of person was there any athletic attributes that he had or was he just totally chilling well yeah for sure I mean if you see Zaza play in the NBA Zaza was basically like a screen center like his number one skill was he could set a huge pick to get Steph Curry a shot but when he played against us right he's Steph Curry he's just draining shots from all over the court you he didn't even take these shots in the NBA you never saw him take these shots and he's just and he made all of them fast break pulling up from the three-point line and he has I was like when's the last time you played he's like 2019. I was like no way he's like no no I've shot around he's like you know I'm in the basketball facility so I shoot around but he's like I I don't even know last time I like played it like I can't like it kind of like a competitive game and uh so a couple things so his warm-up was like a real warm-up like he like he's talking but he's doing these like hip flexor openers and I'm like oh yeah he's like he's just he's actually an athlete he's had to like get his body ready many many many times over and so you see like a bunch of the dudes who come in and it's like yo here's this VC or here's this like Tech founder and we're like I don't know I guess Tyler touched my toes is that what I do to warm up like we don't know we don't even know what to don't even know what to do to warm up whereas he's like doing these like uh you know hip openers the second thing is when he played obviously his game is a lot better than you see on TV because you know where the competition is so you you gotta you gotta be a star in your role in the NBA and he was a star in his role as this like paint protector screen Setter here he could do a lot of other things that he never got to show there uh the other thing is like he was like a bear so he was mostly you know just playing point guards passing the ball mostly um like getting everything obviously he could post any of us up he's got a foot on all of us you know in terms of height so he wasn't just abusing that but when it but like we beat him the first game and then they won like six straight and then you beat him you beat his team yeah we won the first game yeah they were just like you know whatever we got after a quick start um but then the they went on a 6-0 run or something like that just crushing everybody and then when we came back out to try to beat them as a very competitive game and then it's like we poked the bear it's like all of a sudden he started driving to the hoop and he started like playing like aggressive it's like oh yeah don't forget the bear can kill you uh the bear might be nice right now but the bear will let you know that like I could kill you if I wanted to and he just chose which style he was gonna yeah he's like let's let's just put it to a six now we wear the three let's just put it we'll just put it out of six just for a few minutes don't get it twisted this has been a three up till now I'm just gonna show you that then I'll go back down wow that's awesome um that I love seeing those types of people like just like in normal settings um and so um talk about Russell so what Russell's doing I I saw him you shared it he has his website and it's here's why it's interesting one he's we'll put this we'll see what he's doing he's doing a 40-day water fast that alone is interesting but what's even more interesting is he's doing it in a very like I wouldn't have expected this like six foot five 300 pound football player to be so introspective and if you go to his website do you know the name of his website actually no I will have it in front of me if you just Google his name and then go to his Twitter and you can click off to the link he's got this website hey it's built on ghost which is like a pretty like in the know nerdy web platform I think it's okungfast.com is at least where the I think that's where the um that's where you posted if you just Google it you'll see it but it's like a yellow website and like he has email pop-up pop-ups and like everything is set up really actually like exactly how it should be like the email pop-up is like thoughtful and then you go to a confirmation page that's thoughtful and he's blogging every single day and he's posting the same picture every day so as of now I think he started this thing at 260. I have to know I think we buried the lead so he's he's gone he's going on a 40-day water only fast he's lost a hundred pounds so far doing it and obviously it's not just about the weight loss it's about like sort of like the mental Challenge and the mental Clarity that he's getting as he's doing this like you know sort of this this very uh it sounds to me like a really intense fast I think he's on day 21. well he talks about how it's a spiritual thing and he basically like he he's just so much more thoughtful than I ever would have picked this guy just because I'm stereotyping like an NFL player and like his writing is very good and very clear and there's a lesson that he's learning each day and he talks about that and everything's well written it's just wonderful it's a really really cool fourth day was the hardest he goes because this is where the body is transitioning into a new state so he's like I had headaches fatigue my body was transitioning to using fat as the energy source rather than you know the in the input of new uh you know carbohydrates and whatever and he looks good so you could see even when he started it you look at day one where he started he still looked uh pretty lean now you look at him at day one he's starting to get like skinnier and skinnier and skinnier and his writing is starting to change it's very fascinating and he's been tweeting about it every day as he goes I need to blogging about I think it's awesome I love seeing this right uh yeah and he's also like he's on day 21 he's on day 21. he's also like a Bitcoin Max he's an interesting guy by the way there's a a guy I met named Byron Jones who retired this year um he was like one of the best cornerbacks in the in the in the league and he retired I think at 30. so he came into the league probably 21-22 and he retired at 30 which is an early retirement and he got paid very well probably made like I don't know 80 million dollars playing in the NFL but he had said something when he retired which is that I can't run or jump anymore and which is shocking because this is like one of the most athletic guys that was in the NFL at the time when he was playing and I went to a dinner he had a 44 inch ver wow 44 inch ver and now he's just hit broad jump um freak my buddy Romine uh hosts this event called game time every year in LA and it's basically a mix of investors and athletes that get together and so I've gone the last couple years and he hosts this dinner and at the dinner there was a few NFL players on the table and they all mentioned like uh I forgot what they were called a torbital not torbital it's not the steroid it's like some shot that NFL players get basically it's a pain pain tolerance shot a pain reduction shot painkiller and they're they were just like dude that shot it's like magic and it's a curse they're like because it doesn't make you feel better right it just makes you not feel pain no no you feel better but sorry it doesn't cure an injury but it doesn't cure the underlying issues it's like you he's like we would go from you know Sunday you play uh Monday you feel bad Tuesday you feel like man I was in a car accident and their body feels like it was in a car accident you're like there's no way I'm gonna be able to practice on Thursday and play next Sunday like that's just like where my body's at on Tuesday versus Sunday seems crazy and they said that like uh they're like man that you know like the culture in the NFL is like you got to play obviously and so these like a lot of guys get get in the habit of taking this one shot T something I forgot what it's called and they take the shot and they're like it's like a miracle dude like within an hour you're running again and they're like you went from not you know like limping to like you're just back to you but also every time you do it it's like taking time you know it shortens your career because this is so bad for your body what you're actually doing to your body when you do that is you're not like it's not like the underlying tissues have healed in the process and um it's kind of a crazy thing so I think one cool thing about Russell's doing is he's basically like trying to rewind the clock on you know when you're in when you're alignment they tell you to beef up and what he's doing is is doing a sort of a rapid and drastic change in his physiology in order to get his weight down so that he can live a little you know longer healthier life as he goes yeah he said I went through a pulmonary embolism I don't know what that is is that a heart thing uh I had lacerated lungs no idea how you get lacerated lungs but that's wild a series yeah a series of surgeries ligament and ligament and tendon damage and getting up every day was just really hard I thought magically when I finished playing it would get easier but it got harder harder I had completely depleted my testosterone so he basically just explains he's like I was left in shambles and so that's I guess one of the reasons why he's done this and I think it's really really really cool I don't think I'm gonna do it shout out to him I like I like seeing him do it what else you got um I like this question I got so a guy tweeted at me I want to get your take on it so his name's Christian vanufel uh great name so Christian says question for you Sean he goes what work seems like small boy stuff but actually packs a punch so we have this phrase we say on the Pod all the time no small boy stuff and we don't even like spend a ton of time defining it because honestly it's always stuff is kind of obvious but I would say the general buckets of small boy stuff would be um you know overly worrying about things um small boy stuff would be thinking small rather than thinking big thinking short term rather than thinking long term um you know caring too much about what other people think of you you know there's a whole bunch of things that you classify as small boy stuff like complaining when things get hard uh or things don't go your way complaining in general waiting in general these are all like small boy moves but I thought his question was great because the magic is in things that other people think are small but actually pack a punch and I had an answer but I'm curious what your answer would be I'll give you you want me to go first you want to go first I'll give a very quick example we had our I keep talking about the offsite my CEO the company he put all this effort into creating like little individual awards for people and like writing like uh appreciation notes and like being very thoughtful in the itinerary and I was like dude just like who gives a [ __ ] let's just get in the room and hang out he put all this work into it spent hours and hours and hours 100 worth it I I was giving him a hard time and then afterwards I go nope you were right I was wrong that that is an example of things that seem below your pay grade that you you proved it was worth it love it uh I would actually also give you credit because that would be one of my answers which is um admitting when you're wrong openly and quickly I remember hearing a story about um one of the guys at Sequoia who's awesome uh like helped build Sequoia into like the most successful VC brand or one of the most in a long time somebody asked like what makes him great they go all he cares about is getting it right he'll be in a meeting with you he'll say his opinion and somebody else will say their opinion and you know most people either start to debate or uh like we're kind of like it's like we're talking past each other it's like I'm talking about one thing you're talking about another and I'm the boss so I'm gonna get my way and he's like he's the first guy he has this phrase he always says well he'll go okay nope I like your way better let's go with that um like nope that's better like let's go with that is a uh a awesome small but big thing you could do as a leader in any company it sets the culture that it's not about who's right it's about getting it right getting to write you know over time um here's what I wrote as some of my answers I said small things that seem like small boy stuff is actually big doing customer service yourself early on so being on the front lines um answering customer service emails uh questions feedback picking up the phone all that stuff um manually onboarding your first 10 or 100 users so um literally yourself sitting there with them you know going to sit side by side with them and having them install your product or on board onto your product and and answering their questions seems like an unscalable small boy way of just spending your time actually no it's a huge huge thing and it'll teach you a lot about your product and your Market um sending follow-ups follow-ups following up with somebody who didn't answer you always feels like you know like a little low status [ __ ] move but it packs a big punch follow-ups are where all the magic is and I think there's also a big piece of follow-ups which is a lot of people don't follow up because they don't hear back and they assume they say they're saying no they don't like me they hate they hate this idea uh you don't want to look stupid they get in their head about it they start assuming the worst instead assume the obvious people are busy and they forget uh people are busy and didn't get around to it yet um and when you follow up with that mindset that's the sort of no small boy mindset it's like I'm offering something of value to this person of course they would want it maybe they haven't yet seeing the value in it maybe I didn't convey properly or they just haven't gotten around to it they're busy and that's okay um I'm still here um the other one I wrote was finding things that recurred daily and making them two percent better because daily things that you do things you do with high frequency compound um if you made them slightly better and so this is where I think a lot of people are like why are you optimizing for your shoes or your mattress or your pillow or whatever like why are you why do you care so much about how you're uh you know like I'm a stickler for how a meeting starts I'm always like no no at the start of every meeting we say all right the purpose of this meeting is this and a good outcome of this meeting would be you know why and um if you can't say X and Y like we're not doing the meeting I'll stop people and I'll say no no do this or uh when people talk I'll be like hey you know you're talking a really low voice and you're not sitting up straight like can you just do it like say it with some energy it'll make a difference and like but that's every meeting then people know that's how we do meetings and so once you teach me how we do meetings we're gonna have a lot of meetings at this company so we're gonna make them better we're not just gonna have shitty meetings let them let them slide so finding recurring things and making them slightly better because it'll compound over time so that was mine what was your partner's name at Monkey Inferno um furcon uh furcon I think was like I don't know him well but I could only I could hang out with him for 30 seconds and I could just tell he's the man at seeing redundancies or not redundancies uh seeing things that you do over and over and over again and be like yeah we're gonna get rid of that and we're gonna fix it by doing this this and this and it seems like you're like dude you're just slowing us down what are you doing he's like no no you got to go fast to go slow or you got to go slow to go fast he seems like that type of Personality did he do that all the time he was definitely um he had you know the Hacker's laziness which was like I'm not gonna do something unless I'm unless it's clear that it's gonna that it matters like I'm just gonna do [ __ ] just to do [ __ ] that's the first thing um second thing I'm not gonna do the same thing every day if I if I'm doing it if I have to do it multiple times I'm automating this and same thing he would look around and be like yo what's Sean do what's Jason doing like are the non-technical people and he'd be like hey Neil you see Jason keeps what he's doing is he's going and finding each person manually on Twitter you should just scrape this whole list put it in a database and and copy paste this code snippet so that he could put that on his machine so that he could just have his leads ready so he can go faster he would do a lot of stuff like that like he told a story early at Apples App 11 was a mobile ad tech company that um is now worth billions of dollars he was the co-founder of it and what for Khan told me a story he's like yeah Adam the CEO he's like one thing he really cared about was his dashboard like what does our dashboard look like so that I have visibility and he's like he's like I kind of watched Adam to see like is there really any value out of this or is he just you know sometimes CEOs just have pet projects they just want to look nice and he's like is it that or is there value here so he shattered him he's like all right I'm not going to sit on my computer instead of your computer you show me what are you looking at with this dashboard what do you do with it and so he showed him and he's like yeah I do I look at this I look at this and that tells me who we need to go after um for these deals and I need to figure out how much to offer them so that I can get them faster like you know instead of just saying you should work with us for these features if I just make a monetary offer that's better than their current ad Network they'll switch and he's like okay so you need to figure out this list you need this data and then you need to know a projection of how much we can make with them so you can offer less than that but still more than what they're probably making for their current ad Network and I should show you which what the current ad network is in this dashboard I'll just figure that out by looking at their SDK blah blah blah hey look he basically put together this like command center for the CEO and he's like he basically built a sales tool rather than working on features of the product he's like I'm gonna build you something and so what they did was they would go to a developer they say you should use our ad Network and they're like I already have an ad Network he said cool I'm guessing your ad Network pays you nine dollar CPM and they're like yeah something like that he said cool we'll pay you 22 dollars is it how can you do that uh don't worry there are ad networks better I consider the convention right networks better but I'll just sign this paper that says we're already going to pay you 20 no matter what like I'm just confident it's going to perform because I know our ad networks better and they're like okay he's like but here's you know you got to switch and we have these two Engineers standing here next to me they're gonna help you switch today and then they would just and they just rolled through the ad Market because they were able to go to people and make them no-brainer offers how did they make them no-brainer offers they because they had this Command Center internally that was how big is this app what are they currently using how much are they currently making how much do we think we can make off them and then how do we have a a spread there that we can work with and so I thought that that was a great example of for con uh figuring out how to make the company successful in a way that most Engineers would not do because most Engineers just want to work on product and not even product like the under the hood parts of the product which is like even worse than making the product better dude this is the most wholesome episode we've done in like two months talking about like CEOs fighting each other and [ __ ] no one's making no one's getting made fun of we're totally aligned lots of take-home value here this is this is a uh this is like the most wholesome thing we've done in a long time I actually am like I feel like I'm learning this is this episode was good because I'm sitting here in a notebook taking notes I'm learning that's a good some learning yeah I love that well that's it that's the episode good pod [Music]

he needs a hold me back guy you're a hold me back guy you're in a fight and you're like Hey listen I'm gonna go after these guys I need you to hold me back so I'm not I'm not actually trying to fight this guy I need it to look like I'm trying to fight this guy and I need you to hold me back and it's it's got to be a if these guys weren't holding me I would have kicked your ass he needs to find a hold me back guy I think elon's hold me back guy his hold me back guy is going to be a hard sneeze he's one hard sneeze away from getting like a back smaz him you know what I'm saying like [Music] all right we are live what's going on dude amazing hoodie sick hoodie you like that Hampton yeah that is uh very nice I had a team offsite we had all of our employees get get together in Brooklyn and the CEO my CEO Jordan organized this lovely event and he gave us all hoodies that say Hampton and then our city that we live in you're um you're a stressful dude to organize an event for I've never had to do it but I've been a part of events where um people are organizing for us and I'm like they're like oh yeah um by the way it's everything you know the venue changed and we forgot you know there's only one chair on stage I'm like it's cool all right no no problem and then you're like what the hell and so I would be very stressed if I had to throw a offsite or an event where you were um my like kind of core customer of it is that fair let me yeah yeah that's fair but let me explain my reasoning behind that and this is very business related number one I believe the way you do one little thing is the way you do everything so what that means though is once you have but but if you've proven to me that I can trust you I'm all in and I don't question anything and so until you've proven that to me I question everything and if there's not a good answer behind it I doubt you and once we get past that stage I'm good the second reason there is no second reason I actually forget what it is a good reason reason here's this here's the second reason and we could actually talk about this for a second if you want but basically the second time around you've done something everything is so much calmer because now my entire reputation my entire net worth it's not tied up into this one entity which is what many things I've done in the past have been so I'm much calmer I'm way more uh subdued this time yeah I think that's true uh for sure and do you find yourself thinking bigger as a kind of like the now this is you've got one win under your belt um what was the phrase that Justin Mar said once you do whatever you got to do to get your nut and after that go for your Noble Mission um so you know you've gotten your nut now you know you're you're financially secure you're safe do you not only are you calmer but are you more I don't know ambitious or long-term oriented in some way yes 100% I used to criticize uh Founders if they would sell secondary so you'd read about this a lot you you you typically only read about it when it's done in a bad way of which it's done in a bad way many times you'll see this company which is going to go bankrupt the founders took $50 million off the table and it didn't work out the reasoning behind that I think is great still uh which is you give uh an entrepreneur five or10 million and they're like wow I I can I can live a really nice life now I think bigger that's definitely the case with me I think significantly longer term so I think like what's this like in 20 or 30 years as opposed to next quarter and I don't care if it fails which is actually a good thing meaning I'm able to try more within it I what have I said trade them mean keep them Keen it's like that with with trying to find a date and make money so like you the less I care the more it happens yeah I the way I think about it is like because you see examples on both sides you see when somebody had no other option Back Against The Wall that's when they when they when they Rose to the occasion and you could also hear the other other scenario which is because I was Secure I was able to play a long-term game and I was less emotionally um invested in the ups and downs of it therefore I was able to make better decisions and blah blah blah and you could see both examples so which one is it and actually I think the reality is that Success is Not based on either one of those it's not based on how much money you had in your bank account when you had zero or when you had a bunch people tell themselves stories about it either way I think fundamentally if a person is driven intrinsically driven um it doesn't matter whether that fuel is because they're a technologist and they just love technology they're trying to make something good for Humanity or they're insecure because you know in seventh grade uh Rachel dumped them and it's like well either way it doesn't matter uh you know like it doesn't matter what your driving force is as long as you have a driving force and it's different for a whole bunch of people there's there's examples of people on on on all kinds of um you know uh like with all kinds of you know chips on their shoulder I think you do need to be driven and it's just a question of by what and I think everybody's got to by what are are are you more calm now that you've had success I'm definitely more calm uh but I was pretty calm before a cal I would say is not really the word I guess the way I would put it is um I'm less desperate and I think that has ups and downs again like I said like when I was desperate to prove myself like uh you saw that I worked in that really fancy office I also slept in that office I think basically it was like one year was like 275 days out of the year I slept there and like it was nice to sleep there so really night they had an apartment built into the office so it wasn't like the it's not like I was sleeping under my desk on the like concrete floor but nonetheless that just sort of means you I just didn't have a life I didn't want to have a life I didn't want to care about friends and dating and other things I cared about just making it I just wanted to be successful really badly and I was like it's not even that I was super productive all those hours but I was like look I'm going to throw all my hours at the problem I will sleep here I will wake up here that's just seems more efficient I'm just going to do that I did that for several years but now I would say that desperation has been replaced with um you know a different asset okay I lost the desperation which was serving me what do I have now which is like I can operate more out of a like I can choose things that are like I'm I'm actually driven towards like that have a purpose even if there's no short offensive as well yeah there's no short-term path to like right now for example I'm writing this newsletter uh every day I write this thing every day there's no ads there's I subscribe no small boy or small boy small boy.com and I'm writing this thing there's no ads there's no premium there's no upsell there's no business model so why am I doing it and I'm like because I really like writing and more than I like writing I like finding interesting [ __ ] to write about things that you know scratch my curiosity so I'm able to do something and then as I'm doing this thing that has no business plan that has no whatever I'm seeing all these extra opportunities open up because that I that I couldn't have seen at the beginning and so just by doing the thing I really kind of have drawn to I'm most interested in I'm doing my best work and when I'm doing my best work these unforeseen things start to open themselves up and I'm like oh I would have the 24-year-old me would have never been able to do this because 24y old me was desperate and needed I needed a payoff quick now I don't need a quick payoff and so I'm able to do things differently and I think that has a different Advantage can we talk about um is there a new chip on your shoulder now now that you and there's been a very well you tell me is the feud that you're experiencing right now your internet Feud is that has that even made it to the point where you bring it up at the dinner table no no no but my wife is not aware of it but she's like hm how come he's looking at his phone for like an extra 30 seconds longer and it's because I'm coming up with a a badass Slam in my head is what's actually happening I'm word smithing a seventh grade insult right now and uh I don't know what what does my kid want what do you want hold on Daddy's busy I'm coming up with a Y mama joke to Jason calicis right now background of this is there's a podcast called the Allin pod they're great I think they're good but they're different than us and we uh we uh a lot of people will listen to both of ours so maybe there's definitely some competition in there but we can all win and last podcast Sean challenged them uh basically to a $100,000 poker bet heads up poker but there was some more there was some more detail behind it but I shared that uh on the internet and Jason calanus I thought he was coming hard at me too but he came hard at he said Sam you're great Sean you'll still learn and he gave you a head Pat and he said uh smart of you Sean to punch well I don't know if he so so the background is uh while we were I forgot what we were talking about I think we were making fun of him a little bit because he um in the Rogan debate people were like uh you know it's raised $2 million for this uh the scientist to come debate this guy like a kind of a a famous internet challenge here and he's like I'm in for 10K which is funny because the anti was doing was 100K plus I've never made fun of Jason if it comes down to it I you have my loyalty I will I'll die for you but I've so far if you want me to I'll I'll I'm gladly hop in I've stayed mostly neutral this is a you thing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's fine I by the way I like Jason for the record I have nothing against Jason calanis uh I I'm I listen to this week of startups for a long time I don't listen anymore but I used to listen like back in the day I like the all-in podcast uh it's sort of like two thoughts that are both true um I like their content I have nothing against them personally I've met them a couple times um in passing you know whatever no no no no totally harm there's no no no no ill will there also I think some things he says are funny and cringey like funny kind of laugh at you not with you type of thing and cringey like when uh the thing I think the joke I had made that he didn't like was that when um I said Allin is billionaire talking about billionaire [ __ ] MFM is millionaire talking about millionaire [ __ ] and somebody goes actually it's more like three billionaires and Jason calican and their friend Jason calanis and he go he came in for his own defense and goes actually I'm a CTI centimillionaire I just thought that was cringe as [ __ ] which objectively and scientifically it is and so I think he might have might have taken offense to that and he didn't he didn't fully like it but I would say my poker challenge to them is only for fun I just think it would be a fun thing to do I think it'd be a fun thing to watch um I'm just looking for some action I love playing poker they say they're great at poker okay let's do a little celebrity uh no noele challeng nothing's been settled you're not doing it yet well they didn't take the bait I think you know he was sort of just like well you know you're not famous enough for me to do this challenge I have more to lose than I do have than I have to gain uh out of doing this was sort of the the vibe I got which honestly Fair Point the problem with that is that that's not entirely true do are they are they more popular you could argue that for sure for sure but but there there's a ballpark and uh you know it's there I'm in the stadium yeah it's not like calling a you know what do I say it's not like calling a a 510 guy tiny you know what I mean like you got to be at least 5'6 to get that nickname you're you're 510 here you know what I mean not small enough yeah yeah but the funny thing is as I was talking about youo we should like on the podcast I was joking I was like oh wait is this fake Internet beef I would love to have some fake Internet beef that's you know this is how rappers for Generations have been getting famous you know they they just have fake beef we should do this as podcasters with other podcasts and so I think that was the the sort of like the the the the the fun behind it we got one uped big time just when I thought me and Jason calanis were getting some some fake Internet beef Palmer lucky comes off the top rope the founder of oculus and Andreu comes off the top rope and just body slams Jason people love that and then while that's going on Elon Musk challenges Mark Zuckerberg to a fight and now I don't even give a [ __ ] about my own poker match I need to see these guys fight uh let's break this down we we have to do this story Yeah so basically I don't actually don't know how it started do you know how it started but what what I do I I'll fill in when Facebook actually Facebook officials replied with a beautiful response well there's there's a few steps to it so I think the first thing was um I guess the old I think the origin of this was a presentation leaked out of uh Facebook that was talking about the Facebook's coming out with a Twitter competitor I think it's called project 92 or something like that and it's a Twitter competitor and their pitch was sort of like yeah it's a Twitter competitor um Instagram people will be able to immediately have their Instagram following on this so if you want to if you're already famous on Instagram you could just start sharing short form text like Twitter on our new thing and um you know it will be run by like run in a sane way like it'll be managed in a sane way I think was the something something with the word sane in it and so essentially implying that Twitter is sort of insane and the way elon's running it is is uh Reckless so that got out that that pres internal presentation leaked um maybe intentionally maybe not I don't know and um so Elon started making fun of of Zuckerberg he's saying like you know Zuck my blink you know like you know he's just sort of like you know tweeting stuff like that and then somebody somebody was like you know watch out zuck's been training and he go and Elon replies and says um I'll fight I'll fight Zuck in a cage match so he says this and Zuck screenshots it and posts on his Instagram story with the caption send me location which for those who don't know is a iconic UFC slogan by khabib uh one of the the great I think I think one of the greatest uh UFC fighters of all time who was when he was fighting with Conor McGregor and McGregor was like oh he's scared he doesn't want to fight me blah blah blah and and khabib just goes brother I'm not scared you want to fight me okay just send me location just send me location like basically where do I need to go I'll fight you anywhere and so Zuck hits Elon with the send me location and this triggers a chain of events that I thought was a joke so I thought first of all I've never seen Zuck talk trash that was already kind of an amazing moment he he he he did a heel turn which is awesome the second thing is I was like okay well there's no no way this is serious and then Elon sees that tweet and goes or sees that story and goes I'm serious I'll do it if he's down and then people are like wait what I don't know if you saw this today Sam you see that Dana White's involved so Dana White who's the president of the UFC comes out because again I'm sort of um you know my greatest fantasy would come true if this uh if randomly two Tech billionaire CEOs went and decided to do a UFC match that's my two worlds colliding all of a sudden Dana White comes out and he says I talked to Mark and Elon last night both guys are absolutely dead serious about this um he goes this would be the biggest fight of all time Floyd and and Connor was one of the biggest fights of all time this I think triples it there is no limit on how much this could make he said it would be in Las Vegas it would pay-per-view and it would be about a hundred bucks pay-per-view and you would have 51-year-old Elon Musk against I don't know like 39y old Mark Zuckerberg who's 100 pounds lighter than him and uh dude what is happening is this is this real and then the Verge reached out to Facebook and a Facebook official which is replied and they just said yeah and they go the story speaks for itself which is another like basically there's a guy in the UFC that always says it is what it is and that's exactly what what Facebook just said they said we it is what it is it sounds it sounds serious and I thought that was a pretty baller move I think this is hilarious I think this is awesome I love a freak Show assign me up all right so I have I have some rapid fire questions topic number one most importantly do you believe this will happen yes or no and why um I believe Zuck will do it and I and I and I think he would do it I think there's not a chance that Elon would do it I think Elon would get very hurt just trading for it and I don't think there's a there's a there's not a world where Elon does so you think it's a no uh no because Elon I yeah 100% agree with you I hope it happens I'm not saying it won't happen but I would just if I had to guess I had to guess I would say it doesn't happen because Elon realizes that he's going to lose a lot he's gonna lose first of all if he does this he's gonna get destroyed he's he's gonna get tapped out and if he if he does it um I think he realizes that it's a pretty bad look for him to lose to Zuck his cool factor is really high and he needs to find a uh a wiggle out he needs he needs the uh he needs a hold me back guy you ever had to hold me back guy you're in a fight and you're like Hey listen I'm gonna go after these guys I need you to hold me back so I'm not I'm not actually trying to fight this guy I need it to look like I'm trying to fight this guy and I need you to hold me back and it's got to be a if these guys weren't holding me I would have kicked your ass he needs to find a Hold Me Back guys I think elon's hold me back guy his hold me back guy is g to be a hard sneeze he's one hard sneeze away from getting like a back smaz him you know what I'm saying like he's not the guy's not fit you know he's a he's a he's a charlie horse away from quitting yes a winner by NY Mark yeah um all right so so that's my second question which is how do you think let's say let's say our dreams do come true this fight does happen what do you think would actually happen like predict the actual fight what would what would happen fight starts what happens I think that Z look so I I I I box for fun and I Spar and what I've learned is it doesn't really matter that much it matters a bit but it doesn't matter how in shape you are it doesn't really matter how tough you are if you don't practice that skill set and you go against another person that doesn't have that skill set it just it just your light ears away from one another just being comfortable getting hit I think Zuck would uh finish him within two minutes he' probably uh get him on the ground and Elon would tap from getting uh his arm injured or something like that yes um now the counter argument be but Elon could train are you counting Elon out this guy's proven he could do anything he could train what's the counter to that he won't I don't think he'll train and I don't think any amount of training look you can't make an overweight 51-year-old fit in any amount of time OIC the magic powers of OIC he's already on OIC he's already lost like 30 pounds on OIC it it it's it doesn't matter keep in mind Zuck still only 39 I think or 38 no I I don't think that Elon can train I don't any no amount of training will get him to the point some extra data uh people were on Twitter were like Elon we love you but man I I think Zuck would handle you here's what Elon said three things that he said oh I saw this number one he said I don't work out except for sometimes when I pick my kids up and throw them in the air so he doesn't work out at all he doesn't exercise yeah forget about fighting the guy doesn't exercise um secondly he's like I'm so much bigger than the guy uh you know just for reference elon's like 6'3 200 plus pounds you know Zuck is probably 59 I think five 58 5'9 maybe 5'10 Max and uh it's probably giving up easily 50 pounds in a in a fight here so weight classes do matter and Elon says I have this move called The Walrus uh yeah I'm just like a walrus I just lay on them they can't do anything they're just pinned this is this is his plan none of that matters doesn't matter what guy does Jiu-Jitsu Jiu-Jitsu people want to start on their back with you on top of them it doesn't matter I I'm not a practitioner of J Jiu-Jitsu but I've watched it enough that I feel I feel confident at least in this call it was so one-sided exactly it it doesn't matter by the way training like uh you could if you're a beginner in Jiu-Jitsu you can go to a Jiu-Jitsu gym for six months and you'll still be getting your ass whooped by like you know people who were just like you know one year ahead of you because the learning curve is very steep to actually get good at this stuff like you you don't pick up boxing or Jiu-Jitsu very quickly boxing I don't think would be a factor I think the fight's going to the ground uh both guys are too uncoordinated nobody's knocking anyone out both guys I think would look very unathletic and would end in Zuck tapping him out by the way do you see this picture I put in the doc look at this uh this picture of Elon wrestling a Suma wrestler have you seen this yeah he said he's briefly done karate briefly done Judo and uh and done a little bit of Jiu-Jitsu is what Elon has said in in the past if I had to bet on Elon versus Mark on most everything I think I would choose Mark Zuckerberg yeah like whether business or fighting I think both a good I think Zuck would be a better hang I think Zuck would Trump him in just about everything don't you agree I mean good hang I think a lot of people would pick Elon they think elon's looser and more fun and it's like oh he he smoked weed with Joe Rogan he must be awesome right like this is like how most I think he would be an awkward hang I think it'd be very uncomfortable I don't think I think Zuck is is just Zuck dude they're they're both Podium on the in the awkward Olympics I mean let's be real here yeah yeah but z z Zuck like you know he reads books on where to place his hands when he meets people like he's like place on shoulder you know what I'm saying like and he actually like studies it you know I I think that Zak is gonna win in in every aspect do you agree uh I agree I really hope this happens there's this Dana White thing gave me a slight hope but there's a famous people don't know this Dana White is a like he's a worldclass liar um in fact if you ever go into like the UFC communities on on Reddit whatever like one of the most famous like taglines of the community is don't don't believe his lies because he'll tell you he'll sell you anything he's a promoter um he will he will try to drum up interest doing whatever he's got to do and uh if and and try to pull things off like that uh this might be by the way this might be the hail Mar save Twitter uh thing you know like uh Mayweather McGregor did like $500 million if he thinks this is going to do triple that let's let's just pretend Dana White's not lying for a second here if this fight did like a billion dollars and Elon took home you know million out of that net hey that's you know just another few months of runway for Twitter which is currently uh you know unprofitable and uh you know depending on who you believe could be could be bleeding advertisers I I have to imagine that there's also like a life insurance policy that these guys have like I wonder if it's like you have to have security with you you can't you can't ride a motorcycle going to do what billionaires do they're going to just send in like a proxy it's like here's my bodyguard versus yours right like in history isn't this how like conquerors fight they don't go fight themselves they send in their best Gladiator like the top engineer at Facebook and the top engineer at Tesla need to go in and fight for their H I would still I would still bet on anything Zuck does do you w to um can we talk about beehive yeah let's do it tell me a little bit about the background of beehive all right so what is beehive beehive is a piece of software if you want to create an email newsletter beehive in my opinion is the best way to do it I'm biased because I invested in it but I also used it before I invested in it we used it for the milk road we built our whole business off this I basically saw what you had done with the hustle what the morning gr guys had done and you guys had all done almost like what I'll call like The Homebrew version of beehive which was like when I asked you I said hey what should I use for this you're like well you know you're here are some things you care about you care about deliverability you care about how easy it is for your writers to write you care about a referral program blah blah blah there's five tools and what beehive was was and it's complicated it's complicated and it's expensive and what beehive did instead was the guy worked at morning brew and he built out their like referral and growth program I think he left and he basically was like how do I productize the internal Tech that we kind of had at morning Brew so that it makes it easier for anybody to create a newsletter brand so and this is a constant discussion that we had at the hustle and my constant answer was no let's just focus on this one thing and that's true I made the right decision because it's so challenging for a media company to be a soft Ware company and vice versa it's hard when you're doing one thing to like I had ad sales people I'm like you guys can't sell software it's just different and he has proven that I actually predicted I was like no because we're not we need to focus and also because I don't think there's a market for it so far I think I've been proven wrong but I I haven't been proven wrong totally we'll see if it actually works he spin it out he so he creates beehive it's basically you go on you click a few buttons you got a newsletter you got your templates you can create segments you can do all the features of a newsletter great um it's good we use it for the milk road we build our whole business off this thing we sell milk Road after a year or so along the way um I got pitched by him probably when you did I was like hey I'm thinking about this Bey thing uh we're raising money big fans of you guys would love to have you involved and I I had the same opinion as you I was like I don't know seems small it's like I think I think there's some newsletter brands that will be big but um I don't know if they're under Tech is going to be that big I don't know if there I don't know how big that platform would be as a as software so we passed uh and I think the first valuation we looked at was maybe 10 million-ish 10 um yeah you passed two at that time right for same reason Market might be too small and at the time I was saying no to most stuff but really I also thought I I don't think this can work I don't think it's I don't think it can work at a venture scale and there's a classic lesson here which is like um you sometime there's such a thing as knowing too much um often the people who know the most about an industry are uh either a too much Scar Tissue they just don't want to be involved with it anymore they just want to go do other things they just don't want to think about that because there's too much like I spent seven years I left a piece of my soul over there and I don't really want to want to worry about that again and the other is you get too defined by like you know uh how things are and you don't really you're almost too too deep in you don't see where it's going this is why very few breakthrough Innovations come from traditional industry experts they come from often beginners um um and why why would a beginner be able to create a breakthrough and not an expert um because they come in with a fresh fresh perspective in a blank slate they don't they're not limited by you know the prevailing wisdom so that's that's happened many times over so we pass we start using it though I'm like I'll be a user so yeah know that there's that I'm not going to invest but I'll be a user so we start using it and what did you think of the product and at first it was good but I kept running into these limitations and I would be like hey uh oh my God they don't even let you uh filter by X or wait you don't even have analy for my growth side or the referral program only does this you know like I I would find these I'd bump into the limitations because this was very early on we were like one of their first users I think and his reply I bet was the best reply on Earth because that's what it seems like it was the perfect repli as always which is uh I hear you we agree already working on it but let me see if I can get you something a little sooner um you know we're planning to release this in two months but let me see what I can do here and what they would do is either he would manually do a workaround for us it be like look uh we don't have this analytics thing yet but here's what I'm going to do I put a button on your dashboard it's ugly it's gray nobody else can see it it just but it's an export it'll email you a CSV and then can you just run the run the analytics yourself for now until we build it so he would give me a he would take three hours and just make my life better he would understand he would also ask me a bunch of questions like so what are you trying to really do here and let me just confirm I understand this like a good product person would do he's trying to really understand the needs the second thing he would do is then they would actually ship the feature so he'd say that's two weeks away I remember telling Ben many times Ben be like oh yeah they said they're coming out in two weeks I was like dude are you a rookie like no way startups say anything they don't like no what Engineers ever hit a timeline like this never happens sure enough two weeks later hey they would proactively reach out hey the future's out test it out I want you to I think it'll work for you guys now and we would go do it and he just did that three times so over the course of about three or four months I was like Chang my mind called Tyler we need to invest in this thing I was like but what about your concerns about the market I was like I don't know still might be true but here's what I do know this guy an animal is making a product that's really good and um you know what this might be an example where the market is bigger than you think uh which has been the case for many Big Winners like you know what's the market for you know private black Town Car on demand or crashing on someone's house as an Airbnb right like these things can become a lot bigger than you sort of initially look at if you sort of squint I've heard so many people say the same thing about him and I've noticed because I follow him online I've only talked to him once or twice I've noticed online of him changing like quickly moving quickly changing the product quickly and whenever I saw that I I thought damn he's gonna do it he's he's gonna I don't know how big but something's gonna get pulled off here that's that's I you could tell that right away and this is so two things on this one there's a framework that we had in my very first startup we realized this we were in the we were doing our sushi restaurant in the restaurant industry there's this weird phenomenon which is provide what's expected no points mess up their order minus 10 points but fix the mess up plus five points so it's like I was like hold up if we had just given them the right dish they don't care they just H move on as expected if we mess up their order they're angry but if we Fast Fix and we not just fix their order but we give them the freebie with it or we you know we we really make come back and make sure that they're all good or we take it off their bill all of a sudden had a tremendous experience with us and they'll go tell their friends and I was like what's with that and I I came up with this sort of like the Fixit theory of restaurants which is actually mistakes they're going to happen anyways and actually what you need to train instead of a mistake minimization it's how fast and how like thoroughly can you fix it because that actually creates like a a higher net promoter score that's beautiful this guy's doing this with software basically did you make this up yeah I'm sure there's some some I'm sure there's some name for this I don't know this is like a whatever or you know discovered but like I'm sure there's a fancy name for that I just called it the fix it Theory right like if we fix it it's it's all about how you fix it and the fix it is where you get the like die hards so that's very good I noticed that and um so he was doing that I'll give you one other little beehive story which is like I don't know a little dark maybe doesn't want me to share this but like you know at some point bet am I right this the CTO passed away right his CTO passed away so we were a biggest jerk of all time he says the twoe thing something didn't happen in the two weeks one time time and I was like dude come on you said whatever where's that feature we really need it don't you understand how important my newsletter blah I'm being like you know I didn't say those words but like I'm playing it up in in a way here we were we were just like oh God complaining like it's not ready yet he's like I'm so sorry we're just dealing with something right now his co-founder or CTO had passed away during the startup and they were you know that's a very hard thing for any entrepreneur to deal with yeah he handled that like as well a human being can handle it meaning was totally you know like gracious and empathetic around what was going on but also understood that like you know he's got to he he's got to keep moving forward in some way and he's gonna have to figure this out it's not an easy thing to figure out I mean like all kinds of crazy you just don't know the passwords to half the things right like it's like all kinds of stuff that you don't even really think about because knock on wood this never happens but you know just seeing how somebody overcomes adversity and deals with really tough situations is another thing where you sort of see you know characters revealed in moments of difficulty and adversity and you see how somebody handles something you think you know what I think they're going to figure things out fast forward to I think he's really young too right he's like 20 he's he's in his probably 27 yeah something like that yeah he's he's pretty babyfaced I don't know he seems Seems youngish um I'll tell you two other interesting things so yesterday the reason why we're talking about it is yesterday they announced we should probably should have led with this yesterday they announced they're raising they raised a series a 12 12 a half million dollar series a from light speed at like a $50 million valuation I think is what an article said yeah I think a little more than that so they they raised uh this money and it's and they he posted a graph of their ARR so their annual recurring revenue and it's uh hockey stick curve it's three million in ARR and like I don't know how long let me let me check I think it's sort of like uh um yeah 3 Milli AR and like 12 to months maybe something like that um just really really really impressive and so he um uh the Run rates I think four million he's like and he said in the thing we're trying to end the year at 12 million and uh super impressive and and this year so go go from four to 12 that's what he's that's what he's trying to jump he says currently at a $4 million run rate um they have 3 million of recurring revenue from their subscription product plus another million of revenue from their like cuz they help you let's say you want to sell ads or you want to monetize your newsletter they'll help you monetize your newsletter too so they have like other products now um wow and it says uh yeah I forgot he posted the chart but I think it's like roughly 18 months to two you know maybe 24 months at the Max uh that it did that oh you got a call out in the in the TechCrunch article he said used by milk Road hell yeah that's right I'm in the ballpark baby um so you know you know I think that this is a good good um an interesting example I'm curious to see how this plays out I could see this still honestly going one of two ways you know I'm an investor but I could totally see this being a great business that wasn't Venture scale meaning like he he might sell this thing for 100 they might get to 25 million in in revenue and sell for $200 million dollar I think that could be that's probably the expected outcome to be honest would that be would you be happy with that yeah I'd be happy for them I mean we we would make some money it wouldn't be like the type of return We would like you know that you would like in a startup portfolio you're obviously looking for these like Billion Dollar Plus outcomes but hey you know like that's a win's a win and I would be really Happ happy for their team so you know I think that would be life-changing money for him it be a great outcome I think that's like that's like the the the like if they do well if they execute well I think that's on the table I think what's the question is how big does this kind of newsletter media thing get can this get to the scale where okay if they're if they're trying to get to 10 million in AR this year they're at four trying to get to 10 if they get to a 100 right if they 10x once from if they 10x from there over the next you know five years that's now a billion dollar company the question is like can it become that um what would they need to do to do that I think that's gonna be be be the challenge of the big question for them I don't think that's gon to happen if I had to bet I think that there's a nine figure exit that's going to happen here that will make them wealthy and be a huge success I don't think a billion- dollar company is going to happen um I think it's too challenging I think that um I'm an investor of convertkit if you Google convert kit and then the word bare metrics you can see all of the revenue and the churn on convert kit convert Kit's been doing it for eight or nine years I think and you they're a little bit more focus on small businesses as opposed to beehive which is like Freelancers turned oneman Twan companies and you can look at their turn of convert kit and I would think it's better than beehive and it seems very challenging to get to 100 million in Revenue in a venture time in a venture time frame yeah I think that's I think that could be uh totally totally totally the case so on convert kit their Mr right now says basically 3 million a month so 36 so it's 36 million a year yeah 36 and look at the churn I think it's 4% a month yeah 3.5% a month um so does that mean that most people turn out after one year is that what that math means no uh I don't know I don't know I don't do public math definitely definitely don't try to do monthly compounding into into extrapolating that for 12 months that's not easy for me um but I think you know three and a half percent churn per month is uh you know obviously not great but uh it's also not like bleeding in in in SAS metrics no not at all and I think that I would rather be Nathan Barry and own 90% of that company of course Nathan probably had money or had some income coming in so we had like the ability to do this and like you said everyone's got to get their nut and get it how you can yeah so I think it's going to be massive success I just don't know if it's going to be a billion dollar company but I think that the takeaway here for myself for you and for the listener is the speed of shipping new stuff and making iterations and more so talking to your customer constantly and hearing what they have to say and asking them why not what do you want but why and I'll come up with the solution I think that's the takeaway here I think the fix it menu thing is or the fix it framework is really really really good uh is that what you call it yeah I'll give you I'll give you two other little Frameworks around this so one is from Paul Graham Paul Graham wrote this essay once where he goes um a thing I've noticed like you know in successful entrepreneurs Paul Graham created YC so he saw you know whatever thousand plus entrepreneurs tried to come through there and picked picked very well he goes one of the things I would say is most commonly linked with like success he goes can you describe this person as an animal and what that means is not oh he's like a giraffe he's got a long neck no it means could you just be like dude that guy's an animal right d she's an animal uh it's basically just just just just describes the sort of tenacity intensity and speed with which somebody moves and just figures things out and gets through obstacles and breaks through plateaus and that one piece of like kind of like investing advice has really stuck with me and like served me well cuz it's really easy to get analytical about the market about about the product about the industry about the competitors and uh you should that's that's good look at it from all angles but whenever I'm like this person's an animal I'd make a bet for better or worse I'm just like I'm just going to air on the side of betting on people when I think when I can describe them as an animal uh because that type of person could figure things out and I think on balance it's just a higher predictor of like outside success um and also the opposite is true I've had I've made some mistakes in investing when I'm like oh love this Market love this product and I'm sort of projecting if somebody was just a beast and took this on they would just crush it and I kind of Overlook the fact that the person going after it is sort of soft and timid and seems to lack aggression it doesn't seem to know their [ __ ] they really know their numbers about well when I ask about the customers they don't on LinkedIn a lot yeah they they keep wondering about stuff and when I ask them what's going on 3 weeks later they don't really have Clarity on like what's changed what's better what what they're focusing on um you know when they hit they get overwhelmed easily and it's like I've I've also talked myself into Market uh you know Market Investments and I I guess for me early stage investing I think that that that is the person and animal is just a very important test that's one our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new our software is the best HubSpot grow better I got an update from a company I invested in and they were talking about their new like LinkedIn content series and that was like the main thing and I and this is a software company and I was like okay but how about Revenue profit and like how fast like you know what I mean I was like I I don't care also I don't care about the new hires frankly 100% I'm going to [ __ ] on my own portfolio this I would I I said this the other day I said to to my investment partner Roman I go ran man like I feel like maybe 15 best case 20% of our our portfolio writes good updates I said that makes me worried because I was like really there's two buckets there's people who just don't write updates at all or they're inconsistent you know they pop up when things are good or they need something and then they disappear for nine months when things are going tough and Paul gram also has written about that which is um when you stop talking is when go bad um like the people who survive are the ones who continue being in communication even when things are tough and when you omit information when it's like hey so why didn't you just put how you you told me how much your burn was and your lot why didn't you put your cash balance in there exactly uh like like you know I could do the math we invested in one company early on that's a pretty famous company in Silicon Valley and it was really hot for a period of time and now it's like people have gone sour on it I know what you're talking about and they said uh they like would write they first when they were when it was really hot they would write these very surface level updates like oh we hired this VP and this person and this person and we brought on this new investor it's like cool but what what about the business how's the business going and you're almost like it's almost like don't ask about the business it's like what's going on why why is that the feeling and then sure enough 18 months later oh bad news coming out you know we had to do layoffs and there's bad press article and all this stuff and we're just you know we need to raise money but it's not looking good it's like what's your burn rate oh we burned 3 million a month I was like dude what and why haven't you been saying this right like it's an unbelievable and then and if you ask them like okay what's the problem right now it's like oh the problem is you know the funding market right now and this that it's like no the problem was you were burning $3 million a month for a long period of time without the corresponding like you know reward for that burn um you know you weren't growing in proportion to that burn and you were Reckless with money right like that's the the reality that's the honest lesson out of it you might be telling yourself some other story um similarly with our portfolio I would say about 20% are writing good updates and a good update is here's anatomy of a good update I might actually just release a template for all on this but it's basically um hey guys as a reminder we are Hampton what we do is this right like first just like say what you do uh not that like your investors forget but it's in general you're not top of mind for people and you should have a real clear Punchy thing that you're Drilling in this Association whenever this whenever you think of this word think of us whenever somebody has this problem think of us and so like first start with that then say last month was and your answer you're a great month uh good or bad answer that question and then write the kpis and the kpi got to be Revenue active users or active usage active customers in some way the the negative of that so some churn or you know cost number associated with that your net burn maybe cash balance you know how much cash do we have on hand and then you want to write the number for we have to write the number for what it is in parenthesis you want to write how much is that up month over month and what is your goal right how are you doing against your own goals because our annual goal is to get to 10 million in revenue or get to 100 million in revenue and to do that we need to be doing X and we're actually either above that below that or on track that's the honest way to start an update below that you can write whatever the hell you want to be honest you got to write that part first the next part you should write is why that happened so revenue is down because blank revenue is up because we tried this affiliate thing and it's actually working pretty good we're going to double down on it revenue is down because blah blah blah users is flat because you know we didn't do XYZ or we are doing XYZ and it's just maintaining we got to figure out how to get to the next level so you have your your sort of two Sant commentary on the metrics then after that you could put your ask like here's what I need from you and below that you can put in whatever the hell updates you want honestly I don't like the fluffy [ __ ] the fluffy stuff what you don't want to do is what a lot of people do hey um we have this article can you share that's the you know the the start of the update um just a quick update on our end good month for us um we made these four hires I want to welcome you know Steve it's like what why are we talking about Steve your VP of marketing um you know they just go on you know Steve used to work at Visa but now he's over here and that's really great blah blah blah oh on the product side we release these new updates it's like dude this is not where you put patch notes um like your investors care about something and um you don't want to go over here and wave your hands about all this other [ __ ] that's not actually like the core relevant information and I think uh it's just wild to me that people don't get that I I refuse to like I'll die on that Hill that's how investor update should be written and it's crazy to me that people don't just do that consistently yeah when I see that I just think you're ly about something this is goes back to what I said about the way you do one thing is the way you do everything if you're not honest if you're not honest about it I think that you're lying about other stuff and I just and so I think it's really important to do these things really in the right way I used to do this all the time at the hospital I felt I think you used to get mine right you used to send me your updates and they were phenomenal they were perfect it was exactly in this format and you were like you know you're just the University of common sense it's not like you were like getting mentorship or advising or your fifth startup it was just like all right what are people going to care about like obviously the key metrics how I think how it's going what I think about those key metrics and what we're going to do next that's that's basically what your update was I think what I understood is that like people basically want to get rich they want to get laid and they want to have power like most of my things in life are rooted in like knowing those three things um and the problem with a lot of Silicon Valley companies is they think that like the answer of but I learned a lot is good enough when it's like no man I give you my hard-earned money I expect a return and you need to be uh uh what do they Scott B told me is he goes you need to be a steward of capital and I heard that and I was like oh my man you make it sound so official I sound like a knight like I'm just like deploying like money I'm like a I'm like a night and shining armor to do this and so there's like that and it's basically like I'm a small business owner trying to make money and my business is investing in your company you just took money out of my family's mouths and you know food off our table that's how I feel and so if a person isn't doing everything in their effort to give me a return on my investment I get [ __ ] pissed if they do really hard they work really hard and they fail or if they make erors I I'm cool with that because I knew that I'm playing the lottery here but if they do this soft [ __ ] and they don't aren't honest about it it kills me honest in the sense of lying I actually think that's the minority case I don't think people are actively lying I think if they're lying to anyone they're lying to thems I think what's what actually happens it's it's lying through a mission it's lying through a mission is what it is so so I think it's there's three scenarios either you know the situation and you don't want to say it bad or you just don't even know the situation you're not on top of these things really bad it's usually the first or you know it you don't want to say it and you're intentionally withholding the information in order to mislead or misrepresent or whatever the worst and so it's really bad bad or batter right like you know like bad bad or a baddest it's it's like there's really not a good explanation the only good explanation that I will accept is that there are some companies that are doing so phenomenally well and they know that investors are actually kind of a leaky a leaky bucket and they don't want they want to get ahead they want their rumor meal to go ahead now let me tell you the number of times it's that out of a 100 is one out of 100 I had that happen to me did I tell you have I told you about this so all right so the hustle was supposed to sell the deal was supposed to close on February let's say 5th February 5th was the uh their earnings call was also supposed supposed to be on February 5th and that's a big deal for a variety of reasons but there's like legal implications here uh you know the sec's involved so it could be it's as simple as like if I told someone that we were about to sell our deal wasn't big enough to do this it it did happen but it wasn't because of us but where the stock price can change sign significantly at the announcement and if I told someone and they make a big trade which has happened multiple times not with us but multiple times that there's insider trading that's against the law you go to jail that didn't you know so there's like that implication there and there's also like other implications around like you know it's just not like cool it's it's not like it makes you look bad well anyway we were supposed to close on let's say February 5th someone told axos on February 4th I get an email from Sarah Fisher I think her name is someone leaked it to her I had only told I told a small amount of people who are helping me I think I told you who are like guiding me and I also had to get like some people to sign some paperwork and I explicitly said don't tell anyone this is a big deal I think I told them this will ruin the deal if you tell people which isn't true but you know I told them that it could have and February 4th the day before we're supposed to announce it I get this email from Sarah and she goes I have uh a source saying that you guys are selling and she told me a bunch of facts about the deal that I was like how on Earth do you know this and it didn't fact get leaked and I we're not a big company like we're not we weren't big enough that this is like I don't I don't know why this should be gossip but it happened and it freaked me out big time and so I understand that perspective of not telling people certain things with my company now with Hon things are going well I'm not going to talk about it too much when things are going well shut up I think that you should shut up yeah shut up and push the yeah yeah so I understand that perspective but it happened to us and it it drove me crazy and I was I I have I suspect in was one of three people to this day I hold a grudge with that against with all three just as preventative measures just preventative and I just stare at what they do and I'm like I'm plotting I'm plotting to a get a to find out Intel that they did it and B I already have my revenge planned and I'm just waiting and I check it I check what I check up on them constantly and those people probably know who they are because they see me looking at they're LinkedIn all the time I want to like I want them to know that I see them they're like I love us you know keeps he always keeps tabs on me what a good guy oh I'm looking I'm looking a lot and so I have a feeling who uh who it was but can you tell me about this uh Black Rifle story because I have a little bit of information about them too yeah this kind of fun moment so we so a few episodes ago we did this what's black say what Black Rifle coffee is all right Black Rifle coffee it's a coffee brand so it's a coffee brand that I would describe as like it's like kind of patriotic it's like an it's like has an American vibe to it and um the customers are mostly middle-ish America or Southern and they uh they they are probably right of Center coffee it's kind of like a you know just to put it in a box which I'm sure they don't they don't love but like whatever just to for for for Simplicity sake um started by veterans I think so it has three or four three of the four guys or four of the five guys were former you know military Marines whatever some something like that and so they and they're Hampton members by the way oh there you go and so they um so they they start this thing and there's a kind of interesting origin story to this uh it becomes a it becomes a really popular brand in fact like not only do they sell a lot of coffee um they sold enough they sell enough product that they basically they went they've gone public so uh let me see they're stock as of I think it's three or four billion dollar market cap still I think it's a little less uh now maybe the whole Market's gone down so uh current market cap is 1.1 billion so they built a billion dollar DDC like U DDC brand basically consumer consumer package you know do you know how they started one of the owners had a bunch of Facebook pages I think he had like 30 Facebook pages ranging like it was like [ __ ] for moms to like veterans and he started selling a ton of stuff he was like looking at all the stuff they were selling and they were like damn we should make our own thing and that's how the coffee business I I believe that's how it started so I did a call with him one of the one of the guys which one um Richard and so I think he might be in Hampton too so he um he had said something slightly different he didn't talk about Facebook pages he talked about YouTube so he was like I was like what's your story he's like well I was like you know he's like wanted to be an actor goes to Hollywood it's like whatever it's not really working out exactly great he's been in a couple things but he teaches himself to code he starts making iPhone apps really early on in the iPhone app store does pretty good with that ends up getting hired by Verizon or something like that to do like something on the marketing side for them and um along the way he starts doing YouTube fairly early on and so he's doing YouTube videos and um for the brand but and also for himself like personally doing YouTube videos and he starts building up pretty big YouTube following and then him and his buddies start trying out different products and they're trying out you know this and that and oh should we do a I I don't know what the examples were but it's like you know um let's just pretend t-shirt brand and shoe brand and let's do um you know this this thing that thing hats and then and coffee was one of them and the coffee one took off and that's kind of like how they they rallied around Black Rifle coffee to this day I think they do like tens of millions in merch sales not the coffee but just like people love the brand so much they'll buy the t-shirts and so tens of millions of merch that there's t-shirt comp there's fashion companies that do tens of millions and that's their whole business this is like their their spin-off business that's like how strong the the brand is in fact when I'm on the zoom call with him his background I'll I'll put a picture up on the YouTube channel but it's just like a great example of like this kind of like the subtle branding that exists today when you're on a zoom call it's like your background your clothes like says everything about you because that's how we meet now right so you can actually bring a full story in about your home and everything and he's got like you know on the wall he's got his his camo thing he's got his gun he's got his like he's got all the stuff that's kind of like that same vibe that you know like kind of you know the American tough guy military veteran uh you know like that sort of vibe so we're talking he's telling me the great story and um the reason why we're talking is because he's like dude I was listening to the Pod and I heard you talk about the total man thing and he's like oh that's awes something just hit me he's like I just love that I love the total man thing I went on I saw that somebody had the domain and uh I bought it um and I was like oh cool like it I didn't I was like I swear I looked and the domain wasn't available he goes oh no no I bought it off somebody like I think he bought it Grand and he's like he's like want to gift it to you and like if you want to do something with it great like um that'd be awesome um that's a ball like I hope I can write this off or something but uh you know I just wanted to do this I was like a baller move uh it's like when dares I think has done that for you like on your birthday he bought you your Dom he bought me a um like a $20,000 domain it could have been more but it was copy that.com he bought it for me and so uh baller move and just and I was like what resonated about the total man thing he's like I don't know man he's like I just felt like um the way you talked about like the way you and Sam talked about just like look it's important to me that I like stand for something my own Co I live by a code um I care about Fitness I care about these things um like I care about being a man and like that's important to me and like you're right that Society has really like pushed this thing that if you're trying to be a man you're it's like toxic masculinity and it's like doesn't have to be like you don't have to be a jerk or or you know like um rude in any way but like why is it bad to like want to be Manley and I think it just kind of like resonated with him and so we bought this thing and we got a lot of [ __ ] for that you see people some people were angry about that and that sh I think there was an understandable reason that they were angry which is we gave it and we when we were talking about it we were like you know I think you're seeing the craving for this type of content and this movement embodied in people who take an extreme version of that like Andrew Tate or uh stuff like that people like people just immediately they hate Andrew Tate so much they got blinded by rage and they're like you guys are saying Andrew Tate's awesome and this total man thing is about Andrew Tate it's like no no no I'm just saying like when you look at objectively that this guy's extremely popular he's the number one most Googled man in America right now it's all under an umbrella and we're saying what is the appeal I think part of the appeal not the whole thing but part of the appeal is that this guy preaches that you need to live like a like a [ __ ] man and he's like you know be hard don't be soft like mentally be hard be tough uh physically be hard be fit um you know in your relations with people don't you know be a softy don't get pushed over don't keep apologizing and graling like you know carry yourself like a man and I was like and I was like you know what we had said was that I think the pendulum has swung too far in One Direction where a lot of people are preaching like a a um uh sort of like I don't know what you would call it almost like a soft or sort of like a genderless like identity thing where it's you it's not cool to be a man and I think that's building up a craving for people to want to be a man and so whatever something resonated with that he bought the domain and I was like yeah we should do something we should try to just make it an open source movement of and and when I mapped it out I I did a little five minute brainstorm the other day with Ben and I was like yeah what does it what does the total man mean I was like part H this is a good this is a good little branding lesson I was like I was at first I I I went down the path of like what matters to me like what matters to me is like I like to have I care about like Freedom like Financial Freedom I care about Fitness I want trying to get more and more fit I want to be somebody who is free to move their body in certain ways and is is a very fit individual um but I also care about family and whatever and I was like oh I think I just described something generic I said what's the real appeal of this totl man thing it's not this well well-rounded appeals to actually nobody and I said Sam said something once on the podcast that made me laugh but I kind of like I wanted to make fun of him and I also kind of liked it I was like jealous and I wanted to make fun of him at the same time what was it you you said this thing it's gonna sound so simple it's gonna sound dumb you you said it's important to go it's important to me to be a [ __ ] man like what what are you what are you even saying isn't that obvious what you said that and you go yeah it's just important to me like to be a man and like to be like you know how know how you explain it maybe you didn't even explain it that maybe was the beauty I I don't remember exactly but I I say it to Sarah all the time I go I take care of business like go we we take care of our business you know like all and that doesn't mean money that means you know look I'm gonna provide emotionally uh financially spiritually I got you like we I take care of business whatever you need I got you I I'm here for you yeah and uh it's like I'm not going to I'm I'm going to try my hardest not to get too emotional if you're emotional I'll be your rock I'll treat you with respect I'm going to take care I'm going to handle business that's what we do exactly and I was like I think it's more that it's basically I was like I don't think it's about this well-rounded blah blah blah because it dilutes the message well here and I also said and then I'll let you go I said um when I like to exercise I want to be able to outrun or what did I say I said I want to either kill and eat everyone in the room or outrun them I I stole that from Galloway from Scott G you told me you go don't you feel that way and I was like hell no feel that way what are you talking about it's a ridiculous thought you took your most ridiculous thought and then said don't you feel that way sometimes no I've never once in my life looked around a room of men and been like I could eat and kill all these people or outrun them not once but when you said it it stuck in my head it was provocative I wanted to make fun of you but I was also like you know there is a negative truth in this madness and that is where a real brand is built and so that was my my my little branding revelation to myself when I was doing this exercise around the what what should we do with this total man domain I was like honestly it's real simple it's about being a man being it's about men who want to be be a man what does that mean we don't need to explain it it's somebody who handles their business you can come up with all the examples you want it's not a checklist that's not the total man attitude is a having some some predefined criteria checklist no in all situations Be A Man About It and that's what I was like that's take care take care of business that's the brand Baby Be A Man About It no matter what the situation be a man about it and I was like that's the total man philosophy you could apply that to whatever situation you're going through in life but what are you gonna do with it so is this going to be uh I know Jesse Isler who we're going to have on soon I've been emailing with him he's got this really cool thing where it's like you run up this mountain a bunch of times and that's like climbing Everest that's kind of cool you I mean an event is the is the obvious one but but you can go a bunch of ways here's the here's here's the idea Fresh Off The Dome you just said what do you want to do with it you asked a great question my brain came up with an answer it's inspired by 75 hard which is also a very total man and it's great total men don't don't always join movements sometimes we create them so we're gonna create our own version of this and it's going to be the man month and what is the man month it's basically 30 days where you commit to to working towards being the total man in these like you know couple ways and it's like for 30 days we're doing cold shower we're doing 50 push-ups right when we wake up or 100 push-ups right when we wake up first thing it doesn't you're oh you're late all right you're 10 minutes more late go right oh you can't do 100 push-ups I'm waiting keep going we'll stay here till you're done uh right so all right so push-ups and cold push-ups and cold I think is two we just need a third and it's going to be you do these three things you're just going to do them for 30 days straight and we're just going to harden you up just going to harden you up a little bit and so what's the third what's the third in this thing well is this too soft you gotta you gotta you got to tell you got to tell the woman in your life how you feel or the man or the man in your life you got to tell got you got to be kind you gotta tell someone how you feel it could be kind it could be oh you've been avoiding confrontation it's time to say or you got to have a tough conversation you might have to have a tough conversation oh you really appreciate somebody you better show it right and so you're going to send a message voice memo text message what to your mom to your cooworker to whoever and we're gonna do that every day you gotta have a tough combo we G do that every day for 30 days a tough conversation a tough shower and a tough morning that's how we're doing it all right well you got to call it total right a total conversation a total yeah a total one and so I think it's good I I my feedback you need to add two more things five or six my critique of my own thing here it's a little too easy easy I think it needs to be a little bit harder potentially it's got it has to be so hard that you're like H I can't believe I'm doing like the 75 hard thing it's pretty hard this and people have to look at you and be like are you nuts yeah the cold thing the cold thing you're on to something with the cold thing that is quite challenging but you got to have about you got to have a few more hard things 50 push-ups if you're fit I could do 50 push-ups in one sitting yeah I think it's got to be a lot more the original thing I was thinking about cuz I was like what would it mean to cuz a lot of is also inspired when Zuck did the murf thing and I was like whoa zuck's kind of being a man right now like what's going on this is that's pretty cool could I do that I don't think I could do this I can't do a 100 pull-ups like that's is something I can't do right all right so I started working towards it so the next morning I woke up and I did my little quarter murf I ran the oh he runs a mile hard I'm going to run the quarter mile I'm going to do a quarter of the push-ups quarter of the pull-ups quarter of the squats qu of the Run and I'll do it again until that's easy when that's easy I'm gonna make it harder right I'm just going to keep inching it forward until I could do the full thing and I was like yeah that's the way to go it's progress right like it's about progress and so I think you're right I think we kind of need to Workshop the actual difficulty level because I think it to hit the brand right it's got to be something that other people think you're crazy for doing yeah I I think that's great it can't be reasonable you could also be a little self-serving and make it like a post on social media so you get that little hashtag going around by the way you you got to share the results we're not charging money this isn't a program you buy it's just a movement you're either in or you're out that's it that's it you're in and if you're in you got to do it if you're out stay out when so I've known you for close to 10 years now did you ever think that 10 years ago you'd be about this life never never it feels good though right it feels good to be a man yes it feels good it feels good look I think it feels good I um I I agree I think it feels great I when I I remember when I moved to San Francisco uh San Francisco uh people would make I felt really like nervous I was like people would call me a redneck because I moved from Tennessee I remember when I when I first got uh like in San Francisco when you moved there you'd have to interview for an apartment because they had so many applications I remember going to like one of these interviews and people being like this was in 2012 right I guess right after Obama was there an election in 2012 people were like who'd you vote for they asked me who I voted for in order to like get this apartment and uh like so I I was like I gotta hide like which I think we voted for Obama but I had to like hide a bunch of [ __ ] about myself not anymore things have changed my friend this stuff is actually a lot more popular if you go to San Francisco things are a lot different muscles are are not quite in but they're more in than before and fitness is more in than before and hard conversations are more in before so I think it's good that you're kind of capitalizing on this we're we're not chasing Trends here this is timeless people have been trying to be people have been trying to be hard for their whole like you know since the beginning of time uh you know in fact the only thing that turns me off is if this is a trend all right total man all right you're you're sounding harder already do you uh do you have to wrap up now I see you looking at your phone by the way I'm gonna do my Elizabeth Holmes and start uh talking with a deeper voice on purpose dude people make fun of me uh on our YouTube they say I've got a high voice yeah and so so now I'm like thinking in my head I got to talk lower too hey dude I think that's why Mike Tyson became Mike and I think he had to overcompensate for his voice and just turn into an absolute Savage oh so you're agreeing I have a high pitch voice it's not low oh my God that's ridiculous that is ridiculous that is ridiculous um all right that's the pod [Music]

I definitely admire Andrew patreon from Panda Express because they're a married couple that built this whole thing and they've owned the whole thing privately the 2600 locations they did 3.7 billion a year with 27 net margins and they take 935 million a year in personal income and I think that's only possible because they have created a new vision for what they wanted the company to be about which is about their employees he just sells like orange chicken like that's not exactly inspiring but like he employs like 20 000 people he pays for them to go to Tony Robbins he gives them like the Think and Grow Rich books and he's like yeah like the whole chicken like that's cool and all but I'm actually taking an hourly wage worker and we're trying to like Elevate them and so I'm like oh I can get behind that

I think the supplement industry is notoriously dirty how did you actually go about creating the cleanest supplement the people who helped develop it were all like Trainers for the 49ers and the Celtics right the product backed that up but it we never found that level of media that could validate it to reach a large enough consumer base that would be willing to pay that extra amount of money until huberman said to that audience that was probably just a straight cash deal when you guys bought that ad spot I would imagine right I'm not entirely sure what this deal is but whatever it is he got underpaid [Laughter] it was too little

you want to know what I am Pro a freak Show I love a good freak Show like when people start fighting in the middle of the street or there's a car wreck you know I'm stopping I'm gonna ask him to pull that wreck a little closer so I could see like hey police can you uh fill me in on the backstory what's going on like I love this what's going on fellas what do we got here [Music] we're live what's going on how are you what do you think uh I guess is this the first time we've talked since deer dick since uh since you moved into a small woman's bedroom or something what do you what is this where are you I'm visiting family for a month in Brooklyn and I've had to rent a place it's impossible finding monthly like like a like a three month rental very hard to find so we use Airbnb and it's the best I can do all right how's it look does it look like Victorian or something yeah it looks like um I feel like my sister had this little princess bed growing up so it reminds me of that um what uh what you got today you gotta I could see your eager for something what do you what do you have I'm eager for something and let me preface this by saying I'm not a political guy I'm not really conservative I'm not really liberal I'm not pro-vaccine I'm not anti-vaccine like I'm not I'm not liberal I'm not conservative I'm best described as aggressive I'm really I like I not only do I I just don't care it's the thing but you want to know what I am Pro a freak Show I love a good freak Show like when people start fighting in the middle of the street or there's a car wreck you know I'm stopping I'm gonna ask him to pull that wreck a little closer so I could see like hey police can you uh fill me in on the backstory what's going on like I love this hold on fellas what do we got here when I yeah when I flew here I I flew here I you know and I download TV on my YouTube app it was three episodes of cops that's the kind of guy I am so what's got your eye what's the freak Show that's got your eye so basically this Joe Rogan Kennedy thing so here's the background Robert F Kennedy uh you know he's he's Kennedy Jr I don't I don't know what his acronym is he needs a good like RFK junior rfkj is that it um so basically this guy he I actually saw him talk a couple times because I like went through an obsession with the Kennedy family but he's Robert Kennedy's who's JFK's brother so he's JFK's nephew he's running for president now and he's been doing the Pod circuit he went on all in and then he recently went on Joe Rogan and I don't even know all the things that he said because I don't really care that much but he said a lot of things that could be categorized as anti-vaccine so but and here's what happened this is the cool part there's this famous Professor and uh kind of famous vaccine guy who's been tweeting all of his opinions and everything he tweeted out that he says Spotify has stopped even sort of trying to stem Joe Rogan's vaccine misinformation it's really awful and from all the online attacks I'm receiving after this podcast it's just absurd and it's clear many people believe this nonsense now here's where it gets interesting Joe Rogan is the type of guy who doesn't normally respond to this type of stuff he kind of he seems like he's got thick skin he doesn't really get bothered by this but the same on the same day he replied and he goes Peter if you claim what rfj junior said is misinformation I'm offering you a hundred thousand dollars to the charity of your choice if you're willing to come onto the Pod and debate him on my show with no time limit from there it it's snowballed so now it's up to 2.6 million dollars of other people so Bill Ackman put up 150k Dave Roman Reuben 100K Patrick bate uh Patrick that David 100K I think even like uh Andrew Tate is now offering 500. Jason callican is coming in with a hard 10K trying to slip that in and say I I'm with you put me down for a put me down for a buck yeah well here's the thing I was like thinking about this I'm like should I hop in on this and just like say some number like collecting from these people no one's collecting yeah how could I insert this and how can I insert myself into this situation but now it's 2.6 million dollars to get this guy on the show and I'm I think he said so far that he's not going to do it and I just thought this is awesome I love a good freak Show I love like I think that uh we actually have a presidential candidate coming our pod soon um I don't know if you know this yet but I've said it actually don't tell me I'd love to be surprised yeah I love a good team he's a guy he he uh he started a pharmaceutical company his name's Vivek and uh he like he dm'd me like six or 12 months ago saying he's gonna run for president and I like laughed at it I didn't laugh at it I just didn't even respond which is worse you know what I'd love to do because uh I think that guy's cat interesting but I think what would be more interesting is if we have because he's kind of let's say a uh you know an upstart candidate or whatever like he's like you know not the favorite he's not the leading guy um I would it would be great if we had two of the upstart candidates come on at the same time and so we could debate them because it's actually kind of boring when you have one candidate come on and uh they just kind of monologue their piece for for a very long time like I've seen a bunch of these guys go on podcasts and frankly it's kind of boring when that happens I would love to have like the most pipsqueak debate of all time it's like us moderating we don't know anything about this only like half a percent in the polls and we're just like it's this is The Showdown hundreds of dollars donated to charity what's the question gonna be like what's your opinion on car crashes like we don't know anything like do you like websites ending of Breaking Bad good or a little underwhelming yeah like yeah I want to talk to her I want to see what she's got to say about you dude like we don't know anything but last time what was the Asian guy who ran last year who like said he loved math yeah dude did he run and say I love math I mean that's just like I think that was like an explosion it was like make math great again I thought that's what it was but he he messaged me all seasons a year before well he messaged me before like one of our events hustle God he's like hey I'm gonna run for president can I come talk and I was like I wanted you to be VP I was like dude you're gonna make me look stupid by some crazy guy saying he's gonna run for president you're like that guy on the street who like holds up a sign you know it says like aliens are coming I can't associate with that and then turns out he kind of made a good run and so this time I was like I have to take this at least a little seriously and so that's why we have to have Vivek on but yeah what do we have two guys being like uh yeah we just asked about their workout routines because we're going to compare you on things that we value in other men so you know like here's a situation a person breaks into your house and we just see how they react and the reason I'm bringing this up is I'm not one of these guys that says like oh like I think Jason calcaneus said this he's like podcasts are gonna shape the next president the next president will be will be decided off of podcasts or something ridiculous like that by the way do we have a little beef with Jason kalkanis he's kind of sliding into our mentions here he's coming in a little hot I gotta say I like Jason calcanus but uh if if he'd like some internet beef I would happily be the recipient of some internet B yeah yeah grass-fed internet meme sign me up I like Jason too I've only hung out with him a couple times and he's always he's always been nice to me but he's been nice to me in like a rude Uncle type of way where it's like patchy on the head he's like a compliment yeah yeah he's like oh that podcast you have it's really great I think it's precious yeah you know what I mean like he's like it's like yeah Jason said he loved my startup but then he said he was cute at the end yeah um yeah so but if if for the sake of entertainment I'm happy to I'm happy to to call him out uh I want to do two things so first uh on your birthday I tweeted out um you know just a little thing and then he he he came into I I tweeted out a thing I was like yeah happy birthday too and I I made up a bunch of nicknames I was like the vanilla gorilla the long arm of the law you know whatever the two percent milk himself Sam par and I was like you know give you a little shout out like that just freestyling and um he he replies with the the like hmm think face as if because I think I was like what the hell is this what does this mean and then somebody they were like oh I think he thinks you stole his shtick from all in where he he gave them nicknames like uh the Sultan of science the queen of quinoa whatever right and uh is that adjacent calcaneus trademark yeah yeah I was like oh yeah you think you started can I nickname like the like turning left like is that a thing like can we can we trademark blue yeah ridiculous that's a little weird um so yeah I do think he passes in the head and thinks he's great but then uh there's another another hilarious Jason calacanus moment I gotta say from Twitter so um so I just replied and I said uh I said all in billionaires talking about billionaire [ __ ] MFM millionaires talking about millionaire [ __ ] and uh you know just like that's a that's a description so people liked it and then but someone someone said exceptions oh you they go all in three billionaires and their friend Jason I was like okay that's a good bird and then he came back and said you know a bottom five lamest thing you could say he goes more like one billionaire and three centi millionaires whatever just roll with the punches millionaire that's like if I had to insult someone with 100 million dollars I would call them ascenti millionaire like five eleven and a half I do want a challenge by the way I want to challenge the all-in uh podcast too um to a poker game by the way I will play all of the all-in podcasts I'll play all heads up and a game of poker so I will play them heads up I'll put up a hundred thousand dollars and uh and if they be if if two if two out of the four beat me uh they get they get 100 Grand but if I beat three or four out of the four I get 100 from them they each they only put up 25k each and I'll play them heads up we'll live stream you really think they'd win well I've seen the whole thing and I will go in order from centi millionaire to billionaire so I'll play Jason first I have a quick work of Jason and then I'll go Friedberg sacks and then chamoth at the end because I think they think chamoth is the best player uh out of them so are you good I mean I I I I know nothing about poker are you good I'm better than them that's all they need to know I mean they named their pot after it I mean they're basing their a little bit of their their brand on that my nickname is the nuts and if you know about poker you know what that means so so you know we have our own nicknames for ourselves um all right let's get back to it I don't know why I got on this Jason Castle we could wrap up we could wrap up this little part but I'm not one to say like I'm not gonna make an absolute statement like Jason did but I do think that there is like we are going to see that this th this little freak Show that's going on right now is awesome for RFK for sure and I think we'll see a little bit more of podcasting have a and here's why I think that this is inside baseball a lot of people don't realize this but so the hustle now is read by let's say three and a half to four million people I have 250 000 followers on Twitter I think yeah it's precious Sean you had uh 250 000 I've got 250 000 followers on Twitter you have 350 000 the Pod let's just say has a hundred thousand listeners per episode the Pod consistently out punches in terms of Engagement all of those things I would say would you agree with that in terms of like uh people who actually like trust and um will take action on things uh yes yeah 100 so I do think that for people who don't realize or who aren't in the game they don't realize that podcasts I have significantly more influence over people than I think any other medium that I've used uh or that I have access to I don't I don't have a big YouTube I think YouTube would do the same but um but yeah podcasts definitely do I I agree with you I think podcasts are a bit of a little bit of a sleeper still which is you know depending on on who you are but I I think people are are shocked at how effective podcasts are at swaying opinion um I want to point out a couple other things so some people are saying oh Joe Rogan you're just doing this self-serving thing you're just trying to have this this freak show this debate to like pump your ratings I would say not true at all um look at somebody's actions not their words Joe turned down having Trump on his podcast he turned down having uh other presidential candidates on his podcast that he thought would just kind of be promotional or not a good conversation or bring unwanted attention uh to the Pod like saying no to Trump is saying no to ratings especially in the last election when he was uh or when he was kind of on the rise and um he just said you know I'd rather not I'd rather not do that I'm not sure I'm the right person to moderate that debate and um you know I don't think that they would be truthful I think they would talk Talking Points you know if I had Hillary or Biden on um so I'm not sure that that would be a good thing so I think you can't really say that Joe's just doing this for Ratings I think Joe actually I think Joe actually thinks RFK I think he actually sides with RFK and says all right if you're gonna say this guy's full of [ __ ] come explain why and let him let him argue with you and let's see where where it lands uh that's the first thing the second thing is have you seen this guy this the scientist I saw what he looks like he looks like I would think a sign like I mean he just looks like a a nerd right like an older yeah he looks like a guy like cosplaying Neil deGrasse Tyson so he um so check out this clip do you take care of your immune system in other ways do you take probiotics are you cautious about your diet I'm not as cautious about my diet as I should be I'm a junk food-aholic that seems ridiculous for someone who works with health yeah yeah sometimes man I just don't get it right so you live in large we call it like that mouth pleasure so much you're willing to sacrifice a little bit I am yeah you know I you know I I can I have to concede that's the case do you take vitamins I don't take vitamins really yeah wow what about essential fatty acids which are great for your brain fish oil all these different things that are fantastic I'm not gonna I'm not gonna argue with you you got it you got it listen but it would you would have a much better argument you're making my wife stay here if you're taking care of yourself a hundred percent instead of but you still need to but you still need your vaccines I'm sure you do but vaccines aren't going to prevent cancer no that's true we got to get you healthy buddy yeah can't be pushing only chemicals and injectable forms to facilitate health fair enough yeah not chemicals they're vaccines oh I'm sorry what's in them what it's not I mean it's some sort of chemical no no other antigens right they're they're fluid macromolecules what's the liquids uh typically it would be saline or you know salt water so it's him on Rogan it's the same scientist I believe on Rogan and um in the past Peter Peter Peter um so he's he's talking and he's talking about vaccines and uh he says something about he says something but he's very pro-vaccine so he's like says something vaccines and Joe's like yeah but you know like not everybody feels good like putting chemicals in their body he's like oh it's not chemicals it's uh these are antigens these are you know cells and he's like okay well you know what I mean like just putting something else in your body like you know are you taking care of the main things and he asked Peter he goes he goes do you do you do other things uh to be healthy because like Peter's kind of like you know he's circular in shape and so uh and he's like well you know I I do I dabble in junk food and Joe just starts pressing him and I've never really seen Joe do this but I think he wanted to make a point he's like how how much are we talking like once in a while or like every day he's like no not every day like he's like so how often and he's like I don't know like every other day he's like uh what do you what do you have he's like potato chips or you know candy or whatever and he's like do you exercise and he's like you basically this guy over like a two minute period is like yeah I eat like [ __ ] and I don't exercise um and Joe's like isn't that crazy like shouldn't you but you know better than that right like you're saying people are crazy for not taking vaccines or pushing against them but like you are not doing the basics of human health like you're not exercising you're not eating in a nutritious way like don't you see that that's probably like yeah I should you know no one's perfect uh and he's like he's like do you really just love that mouth pleasure so much that you it goes in on them a little bit which oh which I've never seen Joe do he's like generally like quite like amenable like you know he's not really doesn't really do that but I think for him it's like a you know he plants a flag around like you gotta he's like it's non-negotiable like you know he's like I know for me I travel somewhere first thing I do is I go to the gym it's just a non-negotiable it's just something I do and then the other guy goes yeah I do that too and I was like no I don't think you do that too like you could just tell him to look at his face he's like yeah but it's different maybe the way I'm doing it the way you're doing it because look at what's Happening Here did whenever I uh when I go and pick which doctors I'm gonna use uh like when I move to a new city or something I definitely their Body Matters right right yeah you don't want the bald Barber um yeah like I I went to this one doctor and she had this a beautiful vein up her bicep and I was like I'm in I'm in Benny uh I was in yeah dude that's hilarious I also think that uh there's some other strange stuff about this guy like uh his daughter has autism and he wrote a book called like Rachel's vaccines didn't cause Rachel's autism or something like that which I just thought was like a really I don't know I can't imagine as a parent doing that that sounds like just very aggressive yeah um so anyways just I I would say and it's funny to see the the debate here because some people are like there's on both sides there's Rogan you know Macho bro which is basically like yo bro Showdown let's go but you know you and me behind the school at 3 P.M they want to see a fight happen and they really just want to see him like get punked uh is kind of like one energy and then the other energy is like this is uh stupid this is not what scientists like trying to bully a scientist into debating when that's not his skill like this other guy is a he's a politician he's going to have talking points written for him all the stuff well he's not a politician he's not a PO he's a wannabe politicians trying to be currently um but but they're basically like this one guy's like you know uh this is what he's doing he's going around talking about the stuff he's been doing that he's been giving talks on this stuff for a long time and this guy's you know trying to just be a scientist he didn't sign up to be uh like kind of a debater of this stuff um so that's like the other point of view and there's sort of like anti-bro in that way of like you can't like uh stop trying to make this a fight that's like anti-science to do that this one guy who I really like his name is ishan Wong he used to be he's like from the the uh from the tech world and he um he worked at Facebook early on he was the CEO of Reddit oh his he has a new company where he's trying to plant trees yeah exactly uh he's trying to change like that it changed climate by by planting trees uh I just want to read you what he said I thought he had uh I thought he had a good point so he goes every science attack person who's currently on the bandwagon calling for the vaccine doctor to go on Rogue in a debate should be ashamed of themselves um if you care about the truth or science like a kind of a podcast debate is probably the worst thing to advocate for usually that argument goes something like this if you're the vax doc and you're so sure you're right you should be willing to go on and defend it otherwise you lose credibility that sounds like a good statement but he's like uh it's an example of what Plato the philosopher would call uh rhetoric's oral spell in simple terms what he's explaining is like there's a difference between what is actually the truth and what can be said in a very persuasive way and right you should want a medium where it's all about who could be most persuasive you should want to if you want to debate to the truth you should do it in a way where persu your charisma your persuasiveness your loudness uh you're on the spot thinking is de-prioritized compared to just like making your most logical argument and then letting somebody take time and refute it it's basically like I call it the Malcolm Gladwell effect you know like he he writes so well and even though it's theories I'm like oh it must be true yeah exactly exactly you when you hear somebody who's so eloquent you can you can conflate how nice it sounds and how persuasive it sounds for how true the actual argument is and vice versa somebody could be so dry and boring that even though they're saying something that's really uh on point the message is not received by the by the market so he basically says uh he's like you know if you really wanted to do this this is what you would do uh so just to finish the Play-Doh thing it's basically um uh oratory so just going and verbally you know giving like a speech or a presentation um is the medium where you're most likely to have people fall under a great orator spells and he's like people are more like sheep than you than you want to think and a great order can get people to do crazy things if you've ever seen Hitler give a speech or uh you know Mussolini give a speech you could see how a great order from and you've seen it in the good direction in the bad Direction how great order can move people to do something and believe something that may not they may not have actually believed otherwise uh so anyways his point was like if you really want to do this they should do it through long-form boring writing one person should write down their argument with uh sources cited give the other person time to respond to each line each paragraph of that argument and then you'll have basically both sides of the argument written out uh nobody wants to do this because this is boring and um if you actually wanted the truth though that would be the way and I thought that that was really good and it reminded me of something that was in companies that I had also seen from from uh you Sean's blog which was he was like yeah and companies the same thing happens um the person in a meeting who is tall charismatic uh willing to put their opinions forward basically they are 100 confident in their opinion yeah exactly sound familiar no I'm not holding up a mirror right now um but basically that person is going to like disproportionately sway what actually happens and uh and actually there's another method so he basically it's called the Delphi method and the Delphi method was basically this method where um you bring up a topic uh everybody sort of presents everybody gets the same set of facts then you write down your initial thoughts and statements and then they're circulated everybody reads everybody's initial thoughts and statements anonymously you don't know who said this so you can't just oh the CEOs thinks this okay I guess it's right uh you just judge it by the merits of the argument anonymously everybody reads it and then you can go revise your statement based on new information that you've got and you update it and you pass it around again until you get to you know a sort of like you know what what people believe is the strongest strongest meritocratic um argument after several rounds how do you spell that it's called the what Delphi d-e-l-p-h-i and there's a couple benefits of this first Anonymous so it's not just like the the the highest ranking official gets their way second is it's time delay so you don't reward like for a great decision you don't need to think of the answer like right on the spot like if it takes you five minutes to think of something five minutes is nothing but in a meeting five minutes is everything you can't just sit there quietly thinking and formulating an idea for for 15 minutes or an hour uh the meeting's over by then and so the argument has moved on by then so this time delay and anonymity is really important and I love this and um I'll tell you I shared this with uh with the CEO at twitch and I was like I think we should do this he was like dude I love this this actually would solve one of our biggest problems I think we have in our meetings which is people think that my opinion is the answer is shouldn't be I'm actually usually the least informed on the topic because I'm the furthest away from the data um and secondly like we reward the loudest the loudest mouth and not maybe the most thoughtful person who who could have an answer and it's really hard in a normal meeting setting to get that person to speak um then I'll give you one more data point Josh Elman who's a an awesome dude friend of the Pod he's a he's a VC plus like now he works at Apple but he was basically like the growth guy at Twitter the growth guy at LinkedIn the growth guy at Facebook like he like LED growth at like three or four of the Robin Hood Robin Hood he invested in Discord he led growth at like four of the biggest consumer hits there ever been he for fun the other you know while he's kind of like you know just kind of goofing off now he for fun built this slack app that does the same thing he's like yo slack is kind of rewards the same thing like whoever's online the most gets to like say the thing in slack um and he he created this app that was like a time delay so you anybody could prompt a question and then everybody has a certain amount of time like in the question it'll say you have you know we'll read the answers in four hours so anybody could write their answer within the four hour period what's it called oh thinking time is the name of it um so just Google Josh Elman thinking time it's a slack app and thinking time.org is the URL and basically it just gave you time and then you could say all right here's what I think I think X and then it tells you all the answers will be released together in 30 minutes and then in 30 minutes it posts everybody's answers at the same time to prevent group think and I just love this because I think these little like nuances actually can really change the way any group of people interact um because I know I'm guilty of it all the time I'm I'm loud I'm persuasive but that doesn't mean I'm smart it doesn't mean I'm right and uh I like actively look for methods or tools to counteract that this is um a awesome I'm going to use these things I like that b in real time I just want to call out what just happened this is called a good partnership where I bring kind of [ __ ] and Sean just kind of polishes that [ __ ] and we somehow get something amazing this is this is this is called chemistry my friend this is this is how it's done that was that was beautiful I didn't know you knew all that stuff and you tied it around perfectly I'm actually was asking those questions and I'm writing notes I'm actually going to go use this thing thank you yeah and the Delphi method that's awesome um I've got a few more things but you want to go to one I'm gonna do a quick one first uh I got a simple business opportunity for people so I don't know if you know this dude but uh so Google analytics which is the most popular Analytics tool on the planet is is changed basically shutting down they're not saying it's shutting down they're like it's changing for the worse like I would love to see actually I want to film a commercial on behalf of all marketers out there of the Google fake Google have fake Google analytics commercial where it's like but what if we made it worse in every way what if we rethought it and removed all the key functionality and replaced it it's impossible to you with vague analytics wouldn't that be better than precise analytics it's like people wondering why I think the reason why is because of all the Privacy stuff the cookie stuff so basically the same thing that happened to Facebook where Apple changed their rules the iOS 14 rules and all of a sudden Facebook ad performance went down and it was like yo genius is over there why why is why is performance down and why don't you have attribution like why don't you know if I spent a thousand dollars on this ad did I make 900 1200 what did I make why can't you just tell me that uh you know I put your pixel on my website you know your Facebook you're the biggest Geniuses in the world it's impossible and the reason why is because now legally they're not allowed to like use this type of tracking that they used before where it's not a technical problem it's a regulation problem meaning the site that serves the ads can't also track the users on third-party websites and this is why portfolio company triple whale exploded on one of my investments exploded in popularity and is now like you know on track to be this huge winner because let's say you owned an e-commerce store and you were using Facebook and you're spending like we spent hundreds of thousands on Facebook ads every month um we we have to know is you know how are Facebook ads are performing and when Facebook's ability to track that got cut off due to regulation people were like what's another solution and triple it was like hey we have this thing called triple pixel we can tell you more accurately than Facebook how your ads are doing and so everybody signed up triple takes off does amazing and so I think the same thing happened to Google where Google had to because of the Privacy reasons be like all right you know what we you know there's been a ball yeah because of the ads business we gotta just you know lick a finger and and guess you know roughly you got about this much uh traffic conversion et cetera and so um not great so they're upgrading this thing called ga4 it's called Uh Google analytics lackadaisical that's like the new update yeah that's the update after six beers and it needs a nap um yeah and every marketer I know hates this thing and also nobody knows how to migrate from Google analytics to ga4 it's like a there's like every time you log into Google analytics there's literally like a ticking countdown like it's you know season four of 24. it's like dude your analytics are about to explode you need to go learn this new tool that by the way sucks and you need to migrate everything over because in 14 days there's no more Google analytics for you and um so me and a bunch of other people are like how do you do this and we try to migrate over didn't we're like this is this working I don't know if this is working out of the box and I think right now there's a very simple business opportunity for somebody to go be the ga4 export expert put out a ton of free content and be like I will handle your migration for you and you just cold email every business owner that you can think of it maybe in the e-commerce space that's where I would start but if not e-commerce SAS businesses whatever and be like hey do you want help migrating over to ga4 I'll do the whole thing for you it's done for you turn key just pay me uh you know fifteen hundred dollars and uh and I'll do it I think you could I think somebody can make a million dollars in the next six months just migrating people over to ga4 and auditing their ga4 to be like hey is it set up correctly um just as a one-person service business or a two-person service business I agree I need it I need it we've been trying to like figure this out I don't even know how to set up reports I was out of the game for about a year and a half and then I came back and everything done changed I don't know how to do it dude everyone else has changed pronouns and Google analytics what the hell just happened yeah two years ago it doesn't work the same way anymore there's no office dude Everything Has Changed another thing that's changed is newsletters like people are asking me like what do we do for this newsletter and I'm like dude I don't know it's been two years and in that amount of time Everything Has Changed like when we started the hustle it was us morning Brewing the skim and I always I don't like saying it this way because it sounds like it's a bigger deal than it is because it's not but we kind of like pioneered this very small industry and now people take it seriously and there's all these like agencies around it and they tell me what they're doing and I'm like I don't I don't get any of that I don't understand how any of this works it just things have changed very quickly yeah yeah um I was gonna say something but I decided to to um to take the high road on on something I was going to call someone out on Twitter but I just decided not to do it I think you'll know who it is but uh yeah I'll avoid it this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better um okay I got another thing for you what how would you like to hear about a business deal that involves one of the goats uh that involves I like goats billions of dollars that involves a messy divorce let me tell you the story about Michael Jordan selling uh his team right now the Charlotte Hornets that was related to a divorce in a roundabout way so the story actually so so a lot of people are looking at the story right now and they're like Michael Jordan bought this team for I think 275 million dollars and it's about to sell for two billion the the whole thing did he sell the whole thing I don't think anybody no I don't think any of the NBA owners own 100 but I think he's the majority owner so he um the valuation of the team at the time was 275 million and he bought it and now it's gonna sell for two billion dollars MJ strikes again the go the goat strikes again the guy's gonna make you know more money doing this than he ever made playing and more money on this probably than he made through his Nike deal as well so you know found a new found a new way to like you know double his wealth but what's interesting is actually who owned the Hornets before MJ did uh so I don't know if you know uh do you know the story do you know who the owner was this guy Bob Johnson does that sound familiar well do you know the one that was the richest black man in America at a given time well okay we're narrowing it down no but maybe he's the guy who started so yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I listened to his uh his wife was uh his wife was like also the the head honcho I think right him and his wife kind of right maybe I'm not sure about that so he starts um BT with like uh he has fifteen thousand dollars of his own money he puts that in he gets 500 000 from a guy named John Malone and he's like look there's no cable network there's no Channel That's caters towards black Americans and he's like you know we can do this we can build this up and so they had music obviously so it's basically like the black MTV so they had music they had award shows culture whatever BT's a winner and BT wins he sells BT to Viacom for three billion dollars which is just an incredible outcome right so he did he own the whole thing yeah they were the uh I don't know what John Malone got I don't know if it was a loan or Equity but like yeah he owned the majority of it so after everything is all after everything settles Bob Johnson is reportedly worth you know about a billion and a half dollars one point three one to 1.5 billion dollars and he diversifies he puts a bunch of money into uh real estate he owns hotels so he owns hotel chains he owns um uh you know a bunch of different like assets basically but they're all kind of like cash cash heavy assets so building hotels that was a lot um he had like I think a casino type thing or like some some gambling thing or whatever he needed money for that um so he's put out a lot of cash then he gets divorced he gets divorced and his wife gets 400 million out of the 1.3 billion awarded to her in the judgment so that judge made a you know gave her a very nice uh settlement or very nice uh ruling guess who she marries a few months later the judge yes I don't know if it's a few months later I shouldn't say that Mary's the judge which is it's just incredible wow that's an incredible I honestly wasn't going to tell the story until I heard that I was like oh I gotta tell this story just because that is that's how thankful that is amazing so so did did but didn't they did they freak out afterwards and appeal it or is that a thing I don't think it was done so so he so this happens he buys an NBA team so he buys the Bobcats at the time um for 300 million dollars and um I think they were like the expansion franchise basically and so but they're burning money so he's losing 20 to 25 million dollars a year he loses another 200 so he buys it for 300 then he loses 200 million operating the thing and just operating expenses which is crazy because there's this famous phrase when it comes to NBA teams that nobody's ever lost money running an NBA team and all the owners claim they're losing money but it's really just like a negotiation thing against the players they don't want anybody to know how much money they're actually making or they'll run it at like a slight loss but the franchise values appreciate getting like crazy so they're like oh poor us how could we ever afford to pay for our Stadium it's like dude you bought this for 300 million it's now worth three billion like I think you can uh I think you can afford it um so he's losing money he's got all his money tied up in Investments he's got a ton of debt he's using a ton of debt to build this thing he's like all right look I need to turn this team around he hires Michael Jordan so he's like Mike come come work for the Bobcats you're from Charlotte and um you know come work for the local team you you run the team so he's Michael's running the team but Bob is getting stretch for cash and basically he's got too much debt and his shit's all about to come due and so he's about to lose his entire Empire because he can't come up with enough money to pay off his his uh his note and they're about to take all the collateral so he's about to lose all his hotels and his his team do you think that in those situations which has happened a lot they go to the ex-wife and they're like listen hey uh do you remember that time that I tried to make sure you got nothing but you still got something can we talk you know what I mean like I wonder if there's any I wonder if I've never really this is where we had our first date uh you know why I brought you here I just wanted to see if you had any of those feelings left for me because uh I'm about to lose it all so he's about to lose it all and he's like okay I need to like sell the team or something but the team is losing money and they're the worst team they're the sariest team so he wants to sell it for like you know 350 million or something like that can't find a buyer MJ comes to him and says all right I'll buy it um I'm gonna buy I'm gonna buy it for I'll put down 25 million in cash just 25 million and I wanted out of 275 million dollar valuation so he gets like a 25 30 discount on the team because Bob's under pressure and has no other choice basically he's like but here's what I'll do I'll assume all the debts of the team so I'll get you off this debt which will relieve the pressure on you so MJ buys this team for only 25 million down and now is going to sell this thing for 2 billion which is like a you know 100x cash on cash return for him buying this team which is just an incredible move and yet another reason MJ is one of the goods there's a shark is that story popular I've never heard that no that's not popular that's uh that's a that's a MFM original an MFM classic soon to be copycated by all of our little Fanboys everywhere who will uh take this and turn this into a thread a newsletter a tick tock and an IG reel for themselves and so you know it'll be everywhere soon the one thing that another interesting twist it's going to be here's what it's going to be called it's going to be called like Michael Jordan made money he became a billionaire in ways that you didn't even realize were possible and has nothing to do with him playing and has nothing to do with Nike here's the story of how Michael J Michael Jordan turned 25 million dollars yeah I wrote your hook for you too um there's there is more to the story potentially so the team has sucked ever since Jordan bought them and like basically he actually underperformed like the team sucked the franchise values are down uh his franchise Valley should be up more than it is uh he so he didn't actually maximize the value on it uh but it just shows when you when you buy right it's hard to you know hard to lose money at that point um the other rumor is that MJ is only selling the team because he himself owes a bunch of money that's the other rumor I don't know if this is true or not but well there's always these crazy conspiracy theories that he's like a degenerate Gambler and like there's always there was a I listened to a podcast called conspiracy theories and it was how the mob um made him retire from the NBA or something like that and then they there was even theories that they killed his life yeah that's that's the conspiracy is that they killed his father because he owed money and that the commissioner told him you need to take a couple years off because we could suspend you but that's a bad look for you and us because you know of this gambling problem so you just disappear so you know that's the that's the conspiracy theory who knows if that's true the other version of this is the guy who bought the team now he's got gay pluckin he's the guy that ran Melvin Capital which is the the hedge fund that the redditors or the Wall Street uh bets guys blew up in the GameStop thing and so Gabe lost like 500 million dollars and that they were his fund was about to go under and then he gets bailed out by what's his name Ken Griffin the rumor is that Michael had given Melvin capital A lot of money hundreds of millions of dollars to invest on his behalf and that they had lost it and so um he needed cash and so that that's why he sold it and now he sold it to that guy he sold it to game which is pretty crazy this is this is Juicy man this is this is a this is a juicy grape this is a this is a grape of a story that is a lot of what I just said is stitching together pieces because people don't come out and say everything uh but they do say pieces and then you kind of have to assume things in between again and he's protected Jordan's protected pretty hard like I remember uh you remember that rapper Chamillionaire yeah uh he told the story he he like because you know rappers love uh Jordan because of well he's like a good like you know a black a black man succeeding and they love his brand and Chamillionaire was like nah man Jordan's the worst one time I tried to get an autograph from him and Jordan goes nah I don't give autographs or take pictures with n words and uh like there's like the store at Chamillionaire was like huh and he's like at the time he was like I was famous like not famous enough that I thought like Jordan would bow down to me but famous enough that like I thought maybe I would get like oh nice to see you Tabitha and he's like I I got nothing I got nothing from Jordan and he's an [ __ ] and I and and I don't remember how he explained it but it basically I was like oh Jordan not a nice guy not not nice at all I would have thought that it was like a story of like everyone knows that he's a jerk on the court but I would have thought like oh maybe that just like ends once you retire but it sounds like maybe that's not the case yeah I don't know why that would end when he retires um okay yeah so that's the uh that's the Jordan story where do you want to go next all right I have got one interesting thing so everyone wants to say Sean what's your Ecom store tell me all about it and you give out little nibbles and you kind of tell people you know things are going well but you want to know what the problem with Ecom and also a lot of other businesses that we talk about the things that are somewhat easy to start the valuations are [ __ ] like a a decent Ecom business right now what do you think it sells for five times profit yeah one times Revenue which is usually which is the same thing as a five-time traffic for most of these so the thing is about is like a lot of these businesses that we talk about and what people initially start particularly like the really crap ones like a drop shipping or things like that or an agency they don't really sell for a lot of money and so I like the research businesses that a can last a really long time a lot of Ecom businesses well a lot of businesses in general don't last long particularly ones built off of Facebook and things like that um or it's a struggle at least and also B they sell for [ __ ] one type of business that I've brought up consistently is trade shows and the reason why is I've noticed a trend where a trade show business can last many many many decades sometimes there's many examples of them lasting 100 plus years and these businesses that are okay like they're not that fast growing but they're good man they're consistently selling for 10 sometimes 15 times profit which is pretty good that can be three times Revenue whereas a media property like the hustle if it's only okay that will sell for five times profit sometimes six times profit it depends how fast it's growing but I was reading a flash in Flames this is like tiny tiny tiny trade publication that I read and they're telling this story about this guy named Tony Robinson he started this company in 1991. he started this company called Uki I believe it's Uki media and SEO is screwed you don't want to be Tony Robinson yeah yeah he's screwed for a bunch of reasons but he like never gives interviews he's like a pretty low-key guy but it's called Uki media and events and you could go to the website if you click it it's like it looks old it doesn't look special and most of the people in the pictures look like they're above 60 years old um so it's like not like particularly new looking or they're not at least trying to like be cool um and but here's what's interesting so they own 17 B2B uh trade shows and they own a couple magazines but almost all the revenue comes from these trade shows and their biggest one is a 24 year old thing called the automotive testing Exposition or Expo and it's basically this is like a niche amongst uh niches it's not a car show it's a trade show and a core exhibition that has uh it's where the people making the machines that help you test if your car works so if you're building a Tesla or a Ford or whatever you're constantly testing like your new self-driving system or your testing like I guess uh uh different new components in the LCD screen things like that there's people who are building machines to test that this is a trade show for those people and I was like doing more research about this and he was saying he goes I chose uh I chose to specialize in transportation and avoid developing products or what's he say uh uh whatever actually I was going to quote something that's not that interesting of a quote but here's listen to the revenue 2019 they did 32 million with 30 margin so they made 10 million uh dollars in profit let's skip 2020 and 21 they only did 8 million in Revenue how they still did 8 million in Revenue during those periods I don't know 2022 post covid revenue of 26 million same margin of around uh 26 so they did 6.7 million in profit 2023 the expectation is 30 in Revenue nine in profit and there's a rumor that they're about to sell for around 12 times profit so this 30 million dollar a year trade show business is about to sell for somewhere between 100 and 120 million in revenue and he's done this multiple times so he had one for aircraft Interiors Expo so like people building aircraft Interiors he sold that for 10 times profit he also had a magazine company that he sold for only four times profit but he's done this multiple times and there's this there's this guy in Hampton his name is Jonathan weiner he's done the same thing he did Money 2020 he did shop talk and I think he did one more he sold each of them for around 100 to 150 million dollars and it was like 13 times profit I'm gonna ask him to come on the Pod but it's just crazy that these uh trade shows are consistently selling for 10 or 13 times profit now here's the the opportunity if I'm one of if I'm listening to this pod and I'm trying to start a business what I would do there's a whole lot of niche Twitter handles there's the strip mall guy there's uh the used car salesperson guy there's the used watch guy I don't know this for sure but I bet it's not just you and I like a pop culture type of person who's just like paying attention because it's fun and we're outside but I bet there's people like the strip mall guy and I bet there's dozens and dozens of other people like that who are in these really niche in which the actual industry insiders follow them and they get they get a kick out of them it could be like the motorhome guy or it could be the I don't know whatever it is I think you could partner with some of these people and build these trade shows because the way these these particularly this guy Tony Robinson the way that his thing works is I think access to the events are free but what they do is they hire sales people and they pay their sales people a lot you give them I think he even says in the article it's like 80 grand a year base but up of you they can earn 300 000 a year but what they do is they sell spots or boots at the at the trade show and they create a map where you can like see it all in different it's just like real estate different locations could get higher prices and it's basically like you know it's not like a conference like what I used to do hustlecon or Ted Talk where you're going to like watch content like the content's not important you might have speakers but that's just to attract the right type of people it's really to do business and so this small I bet you there's a lot of like 10 30 40 million dollar a year businesses that sell components that sell to Toyota it's like just your door handle I don't know something and they do business there and they say all right great I got five leads that was five leads I can probably get a few million dollars if I can close one of those leads so it's worth it for me to pay fifty thousand dollars I think someone could do some of these trade shows with a lot of these industry Insiders on Twitter and I think that's an interesting opportunity and I think it's significantly better than many of the other opportunities including agencies that a lot of people are starting online it's harder like if there's bad weather you're screwed or if there's a pandemic you're screwed but these things can sell for way more money and they can actually last for dozens and dozens and dozens of years so that's my pitch on trade shows and a small opportunity yeah I love it I I think that's great um nobody talks about trade shows more than you in my life and uh I was stunned when I heard about that guy who did chop Talk Money 2020 and I think they did the health care one I forgot what that one was called um uh those are it's really really remarkable I don't fully understand it meaning um what don't you understand like uh let's kind of walk through it so basically um what's the draw to get the attendees to attend how do you tell the what what is the value prop for the attendees is it meet others in your industry is it see these vendors up close and personal is it listen to these famous people three famous people talk what is the core draw well I think it's all the above but let's go through each one first one you didn't mention is I think sometimes it's like oh sick I could justify a free trip to Florida like I'm gonna go hang out with people and also oh hey Bob who is not really our competitor but he's in our industry he might be there so maybe I can go and shoot the [ __ ] with Bob and hang out with him but I could bring like eight of my teammates and we could justify this trip I think that's definitely a thing the second way that you get the so it's all about this is a Marketplace so you need the attendees to be there the second place or second way you get there is you need like interesting speakers so it could even be someone who's not even related yeah but it's like oh wow this one person like Gary vaynerchuk like that's not really in our industry but like whatever like I would I've always wanted to see what he had to say like all right cool I can get that person and then the third one is let's just see the latest and greatest technology and so we can spend one day like getting to know what's going on in our industry but I really think a lot of times it's rooted in I want to get out of the office and I can justify this three thousand dollar ticket and I can get five of my co-workers to go and it's an easy justification but in this one they're giving away the passes for free is that correct the this UK I think uh when I went to their website they advertised free passes so that's the extent of my research okay and then in money 2020 they charge people right and so uh how do they sell those tickets how do they how do they build the brand from scratch is it content first uh free content then they lead up to it or are they just cold emailing what do you know about how that guy Jonathan wiener or whatever his name was uh how they did it well so that's why uh it helps to have some type of audience and so what you'll notice is a lot of these companies their trade show and media businesses so oftentimes they'll create a blog or magazine in order to get some type of audience and then they'll use that to like use their authority to sell tickets but other times I think what you can do is you can just cold email a bunch of people to be honest I think that in order to get look I start when I the first year that I did hustlecon I charged 300 and I was a nobody so like I didn't have an email list I had nothing I got the right speakers and I was able to get 400 people to come and that was only in six weeks time I think it's actually significantly easier than you think if you go into a niche to just tell a handful of people and those handful of people tell a handful of people because a really successful show in a particular in a smallish Niche you can do a lot of damage with a thousand or two thousand people but then you really start making Revenue after a year would we do off MFM let's say we could get magically get somebody to organize this whole thing because we don't want to do it what could we use our distribution for that would be awesome well I would never want to do this because I think this because the the value here is low but podcasting so you can do a podcasting one you know we have 30 friends who are big-ish name podcasters you could do a podcasting trade show where you have like what are we using now Riverside Riverside would be a booth and like [ __ ] I don't know like all the [ __ ] that we use it's just like the podcast the business side of podcasting is just so small but it's like oh man it smells good Small's good the pro the problem is is that the contract values yeah exactly that's the issue you need something where people spend millions of dollars so the podcasting was but like but would you ever want to go you don't leave your house so but hypothetically a person like you would you want to go and like shoot the [ __ ] with some other guy who's a little bit ahead of you and like just hear best practice yeah yeah that's fine maybe okay so podcasting is one what else I don't know dude what what are you interested in oh it's not what about why what do you think what Niche do you think what type of Niche do you think would work so for example these these guys are doing auto parts and all the automotive industry because it's B2B and a bunch of people are selling uh you know high-priced things we've seen that um money 2020 was like Hey fintech is gonna be a thing let's just make the number one I don't know if those are trade shows as much as they were conferences but like let's make the fintech conference let's uh let's make the e-commerce conference that's kind of what they tried to do with those to like ride an upstart wave um we could probably do something either involving investing or high net worth people so where and your your booths are uh different type of like a question that you and I and our friends constantly ask each other is like does anyone have like a an accountant who they trust or I am having this tax issue what are some lawyers that I can trust I think you could do something in that vein I would have to narrow in on what it what it would be I think you could do something like that um where like one customer for a particular Law Firm can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars in a lifetime of fees or or or a net worth uh or a financial advisor could I think you could do something in that vein by the way we've been to a couple of these Farm con I think is a is exactly this so that's for the agriculture industry we went to that uh another one is um back when I was doing the sushi restaurant I remember we somehow were at the qsr I don't even remember what it's called is the qsr event and I just remember that the CEO the guy who created it his last name was hamburger and I was like like I forgot what's the name of that effect where people end up living up to their name um like there's like some uh there's like a whole subreddit about this uh Reddit people Lizzy just a big juicy guy I mean what would you I mean just just basically this is just the idea of um like somebody who's named John Hamburger ends up creating the quick the fast food trade show like you know Usain Bolt is the fastest man on earth like this is just it's too good to be true uh like if you're that wolf of franchise guy who we like on Twitter oh you definitely this is what he should do you could pull up you could pull off something like this now it's really logistically it's still like this isn't easy this is there's some challenges but it's simple not easy it's a problem that's been solved tons and tons of times like it's not like you're inventing we're not inventing anything new this is a s this is we're selling T-shirts you know it's still like revolves logistical issues but like it's it's not you're not inventing anything yeah yeah that's cool um all right I think that's that's good I'm Gonna Save My other topics for the for the next episode did that not tickle your fancy it does it seems like you you know it's good when I'm slacking in the background because I'm just like oh here's a half-baked idea here's a half-baked idea uh of what could happen I think the trade show stuff is actually pretty fascinating and I like you know I think there's two ways to approach a business one is like what do I love to do and let me just follow the like follow my curiosity follow my natural like scratching my own itch type of thing and then the other is like the cold calculating like all right let me work backwards from businesses that sell with high multiples and I'm just gonna go fishing over there because I don't know I don't know what my passion is so might as well just go calculate the best opportunity I've actually done both in my life both can work you can win both ways I think it is better to win when you follow your passion but like um but I but if you're not gonna do that this is a fun way to to reverse engineer what business you should be in and I don't want to say this is like an absolute thing but it appears as though the comp there's lots of buyers for these businesses because the way that like there's a handful of publicly traded companies as well as um some really like uh heavy heavy heavy backed PE companies where what they do is they just buy like eight of them and they put them together and they do synergistic stuff to reduce costs and whatever and it seems as though it's a very very high buyer Market whereas like Ecom for example I don't know if agencies are like this I I don't know they might be they may not be but some of the things that people start they're they seem a little bit more difficult to sell whereas these things aren't as difficult to sell totally that's right um good stuff all right that was a good episode I like that one that's the pod [Music] foreign

foreign [Music] family people who like pink Pop-Tarts welcome this is another Master Class my first master class was on raising money it was about how to create a killer pitch deck that's the start of your journey if you're an entrepreneur you're trying to go raise money from investors to uh to fund the company this is now about the end of the company how do you sell a company and Ben asked me to do a master class he's like hey can you do can you record a master class today your boy's lazy so I'm repurposing a presentation I gave uh three four years ago at hustlecon I went on Google Drive I found an old presentation I actually didn't even look through it I'm just going to do it live here uh sort of improv style but I remember I remember being on stage and giving this talk about how to sell a company because I just sold my first company and I remember at the time being like I wish there was some more content about this because if you want to learn how to manage people you're gonna there's tons of books and you're gonna get practice every day if you want to learn how to grow revenue or sales there's tons of books and you get practice every single day when it comes to selling a company there's very little content out there that's at that I thought was any good and you get very few reps you might sell a company once every four years ten years it's it's not a common thing that you do and so um we're not you know if you don't practice you're not very good at anything so I learned something some things during the process of selling my companies and I'm going to share them with you today uh so let's see what I was thinking four years ago the only thing I did was I removed the hustlecon banner at the bottom and I put a new logo there because it said hustlecon 2019 I thought that would not look so great so uh let's jump in and hit the first slide here we go okay hey that's me um look a little different nowadays not too different here we go I still got the headphones we still got the headphones that we can rock um I've sold two companies now one to a big company so when we sold a twitch twitch owned by Amazon so selling a company to Amazon was one way and then milk road we sold two two private buyers just like you know two dudes who uh were independently wealthy from their previous businesses and it was a it was a totally different transaction so I'm going to share some lessons from each when I made this presentation I had only sold Vivo so I added the milk Road one just before I went live here um but the rest of the presentation I didn't add any lessons so let's see if I've learned something the second time I always start with this when it comes to selling a company this is a this is a picture of a foot and a dog and it is the first picture ever posted on Instagram Uh Kevin Systrom the founder of Instagram he posted this uh right when Instagram went live and um you know today it's this like iconic picture of like you know this is how it all started and uh you know here's the guy himself Kevin Systrom looks great you know power pose got the white sneaks and um if you're Kevin Systrom you know you got a dozen employees you make a billion dollars everybody loves you right because you've built the hot thing and everybody comes knocking at your door right if you ask Kevin system how do you sell your company he'd say well you gotta create you know uh Sensational product and then people will just come and offer you a billion dollars right like that would be his experience my experience was very different we had built a good not great business uh we had built a good but early business and we were trying to sell and so here's uh what we experienced so if you're if you're reading this or if you're watching this you are not Instagram and I think my talk will be maybe a little bit more applicable to you than than what uh you might hear from the people that are on the Forbes list because they're they were in a totally different position of Leverage and bargaining power than most people are when they go to sell their business um this is you you've tried you've pivoted you've hustled it's not working or it's kind of working or it's working but you're just tired you're ready to move on um and this is a very common thing entrepreneurs get to and um when you're here it's okay to think uh you know where should I go I've been there I felt it myself and this advice I heard all the time was great companies are bought not sold that sounds pretty cool it's a nice little fortune cookie but remember you're not Instagram and so great companies are bought not sold I think that's true but most companies are sold not bought that's my my contention at least and that was my experience we sold the companies more so than we just immediately got bought because we were just crushing it beyond belief like you would like you see when uh you know whatever huge companies get acquired um here's a headline from when we got bought this number is incorrect uh which just shows you don't don't believe everything you read in the media um I don't know where they got that exactly but uh yeah we we sold we sold for you know eight figures but not uh not like that uh you know once you and and sales it's weird when people come up with these numbers too because it's like you get cash up front then we got the signing bonus you get stock the stock price changes you know it's all there's all kinds of ways to to sort of like manipulate um sales numbers but um when you get I let me let me go back here when you got started you thought this is gonna work and this will be big if it works and I can do this and I want to do this more than anything else that's typically the mindset of an entrepreneur when you start and the reason I say this is because the first thing when it comes to selling your company is figure out do you even want to sell that's why I started here do you even want to sell because when you're in this state of mind no way you would sell why would you sell this is going to work it's going to be huge I could do this and I want to do this more than anything else that's how you should feel when you start a company and then you have to check in and say all right you're seven and try not to check in on your most frustrated day but you want to say uh do I still believe this is going to work do I still believe this will be big if it works do I still believe I can do this and do I still want to do this more than anything else when we sold our first company we had hit this you know all of them kind of are true except for this will be big if it works I thought we might have a medium-sized exit the first time and that's why I decided Well let's sell Now versus play this out for four years four more years and hit a medium-sized exit yeah it'll be multiples more than where we're at today but um it still requires four more years and time is so precious with milk Road it was more of the last one I want to do this more than anything else it was actually working and I thought it could be big but um my brain was wandering to new ideas new things and I was loving doing the podcast so much I just is this the one thing I want to wake up and do every day and focus on with laser focus yes or no so these are the questions you got to ask yourself say are these more true today less true today or at the same as when I started and that gives you this takes to this point point right when should you sell so if you get a great offer cool consider it if you don't believe in the business anymore well maybe sell the assets because if you don't believe you're not going to really take Massive Action you don't take Massive Action you're not going to get any results and then you'll just reinforce your belief like see I I knew it I knew it wouldn't work right so belief is really really key um and lastly the you know Common case is you just don't want to run the business anymore you prefer to exit versus hire an operator and you just you're ready to move on and do other things so three moments where you might sell um who do you discuss with I just wanted to put this up here for a second so you know talk about it with yourself and maybe some mentors but then yourself and your partner is yourself and your co-founders it's really a a lot of conversations in your own head which is why managing your own psychology during a sales process is the number one most important thing it's what helps you be good in negotiation it's what helps you uh get people across the line that's what helps you um you know stand up and operate every day while you're also trying to sell the company it's very difficult to do that so managing your own psychology is really important and then there's a note about your investors in your team there is a finesse you want to do with this some people believe don't tell anybody until the deals are done some people say well no I want to be transparent with my team um for me I've always been on the be transparent with your team but it does have drawbacks people start to work a little bit differently when they realize oh we're gonna try to sell this thing what does that mean for me should I be looking for a job is this what happens if we don't sell will I be rich what's going to happen and so I think discussing it with your investors or your team is something to be very careful about I probably aired too much on the transparency side I if I would gonna go play it back now I would only discuss with my co-founders and I would not talk to the team until the deal is done um and so you want to create a little like communication table um so your co-founders you want to tell them ASAP uh you know hey it's time to explore options I'm going to do X you can help me by doing why um investors you want to tell them and say hey we're going to explore a sale here's what I think it would look like employees you might say hey we've been approached we're considering it blah blah here's the good news here's what it means for you uh I wrote you know you can put ASAP you can say this we're going to do this when the deal closes you can say that we're going to do this when the deal's getting close to closing you know you you want to decide your timelines and create your communication table okay now to the fun Parts how do you actually sell the dang thing so who's who might buy you you want to break it up into buckets of potential buyers because you're really going to run a sales process no matter who you are you become a Salesman when it comes time uh to do this so I would say there's four potential buyers there's the Unicorn so uh high growth companies that might want to buy you um to accelerate their growth there's dying dinosaurs so you know incumbents that might need to get fresh blood fresh Tech fresh um you know fresh energy fresh cash flow whatever it may be um there's your adjacent companies your Json alligators uh this is like uh what's that game Legend of the Hidden Temple so yeah you got the adjacent alligators they're they're next to you uh they might be peers or uh competitors that you merge with and the last one is Talent Farms this is just go sell it to Google and uh they just want Talent so they don't care about your company or your Market but they they just want Engineers um you have to also know the different roles who are you going to be talking to so when you get bought um the other side is going to have an exec Champion so who's the one person that really wants this deal to happen if you can't identify that person ain't No Deal gonna happen you should always know who is the person that is pounding the table on that side saying we got to do this deal or hey come on let's figure out a solution to that problem or dude just let's bridge the gap let's come up a little bit right you need to know who is the champion on the other side identify them and you're going to nurture that relationship you got to know who's the company router who's the person in the middle that can get you to the different people that need buy-in usually in big companies will be Corp Dev um but in smaller companies you might know who else it is maybe there's a admin person or assistant just who are you going to be able to reliably get information from and two that's not necessarily the key decision maker and then you got your deal Doula so uh this is using a childbirth metaphor um so if you're trying to burp this baby uh you know a do look who helps you you know remember to breathe think about this um you know let's move to this position it's gonna help hey we need to get water here know your Doula is the one helping you through this often you know painful but wonderful uh you know um process and so I like to find my dealers these are one or two people who have done M A before um in my you know they're in my corner I can trust them that they'll be keep everything confidential and I'm gonna bug the hell out of them I'm gonna you know these are people that I was texting and saying uh hey I'm gonna say this back you know is that too desperate no no okay let me you know wordsmithing it like I'm a you know seventh grade girl trying to figure out do they like me do they not like me how do I phrase this in a way that demonstrates strength without pushing too far your deal duelist will help with that uh for those who love one of the greatest shows on Earth this is the Dennis system so I'm going to take you through the Dennis system of how to how to sell your company so stage one the D demonstrate values so why do companies buy companies there are financial reasons and then there are strategic reasons so financial reasons obvious you're crushing it you're making tons of money they want your ebitda they want your Revenue uh pretty straightforward if you have it many people don't so who buys companies when there's strategic reasons well here's six strategic reasons um the CEO finds it interesting that's the first one that is surprising uh how far that goes CEO's got a pet project CEO has got an itch to scratch awesome if you're so lucky to have that fantastic number two there's a new executive or an executive gets a promotion and they need to demonstrate big moves as a signal so they're they're they're on the way out or they're on the way in and they're looking for for some kind of big move some big big thing to do as a signal that's good for you when that happens number three they're trying to catch up to a surging competitor um you know this is Adobe trying to catch up with you know using figma to catch up this is uh there are many examples of this along the way Synergy one plus one equals three this is Uber with DD in China so that they don't keep competing each other driving costs up they say hey why don't we merge into one entity and then we own a monopoly we can cut cost actually we can raise prices um so one plus one could equal three in this case um they're afraid of you this is Facebook buying Instagram you know you do what they do but better Instagram was better at sharing photos than Facebook and uh okay you're gonna get a strategic premium when that when that's the case and the last one is you have unique talent so you might have computer vision phds and they're having trouble finding that talent in mass and it's actually cheaper to acquire you and get the talent as a bundle that's proven to work together versus going through a long slow recruiting process and so it's important to figure out for every potential buyer what what might be the reasons that the that that they will they will buy you um Next Step e engage physically so who do you actually reach out to what do you saying what's the goal um you know you can reach out to a number of folks University Executives just go meet somebody who's um at the company Corp Dev their job is to meet companies that might be interesting to acquire um investors might make introductions you know when we were selling we went to uh I went to an investor who was an investor in Discord and I said hey we got this thing Discord I want to buy it he said let me email the CEO CEO gets an email from their biggest investor they're going to take it seriously and then all of a sudden I'm you know next day I'm in a meeting with the CEO and I'm pitching why this why one plus one could equal three um there's also advisors and what do you say you know you say hey I want to discuss a partnership on how we might be able to work together intent right like that's discuss a partnership is the best way to kind of open the door the more aggressive way which I've done also is hey we got an offer you know we're considering our next steps maybe we're going to raise money we or we have an acquisition offer uh we'd love to talk to you before we just go and make a decision and they say oh yeah yeah come talk to us first don't just don't just do it without you know we want to we want to take a peek under the hood we want to know our options before we get in your goal here is just to get an in-person meeting and so um you know use these two frames in order to get an in-person meeting now what do you do if you don't know them well you got to reach out you got to reach out cold ideally you've been building a relationship over time this is the smart way to do it is you meet people in The Company You Keep Them posted with light updates they see you they know you they see you at an industry event so that when the time comes you can do this you're not an absolute stranger approaching them but I've done it as a stranger too usually when I'm a stranger Corp Dev is the easiest way to go I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out-of-sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better [Music] um next and nurture dependence I'm covering some of the words here but you want lust not love lust is going to get is a high burst immediate like oh I see that it's like greed it's like oh I want something out of this your goal is to tap into emotions and when I say this it's about Clarity not trickery you're not going to manipulate anybody into buying your company what you can do is frame what you're doing in a way that is maximally appealing to them something that Taps into their desires their dreams their emotions their pain points and you need to trim the fat of your story so that you are the answer to that problem um I'll give you an example when we sold to Twitch I had met in terms of engage physically I gone I'd gone through Corp Dev Corp devil got me a meeting with the CEO the next day and I said all right well I don't know what to I don't know how to frame what we're doing to the CEO but I had met a guy on a boat in Australia of all places who worked at twitch who's an exec I said I gotta hit that guy up so I hit him up I said hey can I get a beer with you today say oh yeah yeah sure let's do it I said I got a meeting with the CEO tomorrow I don't know how to navigate it you know the guy can I just gonna be with you just to get you down up so I go get a beer with him and I say uh you know here's um you know what's he like what's he you know what what should I expect blah blah blah and then I said tell me what are the top like three when you're in these exec meetings you're you know you're you're at the highest level I'm stroking the ego you're you're I know you're in the room when they're making the big decision so what are the top three priorities like what do y'all really care about is it profitability is it revenue is it growth where what are the top of your priorities I think he'll say them I said okay I said which one of those is like stuck which one of those needs a solution because like sometimes you already have a solution in mind you love that solution you don't want to interrupt it but which one is still we don't really love our plan here it feels the weakest and needs some bolstering and then he told me hey we have this thing and actually everybody's pretty bullish on it but we don't have the right team and we don't want the tech to do it and the guy we have he's not good with tech so it's gonna be a problem oh say less so then when I go into the meeting the next day I say we're great at doing this one thing and I'm a great leader and I know Tech and we have the team that we have the tech already built and I have the team that can that built it and so now I packaged my story as how I am the solution to their problem versus what most people do is they come in as a startup and say here's what we do here's why we're great you know here's this other feature we have here's this feature we have and oh this guy says this they're all over the place and it's like all right good for you but that doesn't tell me why I want you so it's a sales pitch you gotta package yourself as the solution to their problem um another way to say this you need to find their pain offer a cure um you know other questions that might be helpful what initiative has the most juice or momentum or buy-in right now you want to buy in is like the best word with corporations what has all what has all the the exact buy-in right now oh they're all bought into this idea uh what are the fires that he's putting out who's on the chopping block um what company are you guys most afraid of um if I only had 20 minutes in front of your CEO what part of what we're doing do you think he'd be most interested in talking about um and then you also want to suss out who's the decision maker so hey right now we're talking to this guy is he the decision maker or who should we be talking to oh no no his boss is boss is the guy um then you want to talk down talk to this is a little Pro tip talk to Founders who have been acquired by the same company before so go to them say hey you acquired three years ago four years ago whatever what was it like how did the process go were the timelines that they told you real or fake was the when they said this is the most we could do was that real or fake um did they try to retrade the deal later or not um what what was your experience with the CEO was he really into it was he is he more reserved what did what did that mean you're trying to get a bunch of Intel and hey this is founder to founder from somebody who uh you know has done it before ideally who's left the company now uh I got a ton of great Intel on this okay here's another this is just a classic move when we did it you want to do the work for them so what a lot of people do is they say here's here's what we do then they sit there and they pray I hope they understand it I hope they get it I hope they like it no true that you take matters into your own hands so you basically say hey I wrote up a one-pager that explains where I think this makes a lot of sense strategically for you guys because if we're going to do this then um you know I want to make sure you know I thought about this from your perspective and what what this would look like once we join um you know I did some crazy things so basically on the technical side I had our team write a technical one-page here's all the stuff we built how long it would take for anybody to build it what's our special sauce um so that they could just see man buying this is going to save us so much time look at all these assets they already have uh here's the talent here's my I've made our team a present like into a presentation of like here's all the talent we have what they've done before make it really easy for them it's a dating profile do I want to swipe right or left on these people um and then I the thing I wrote a letter from the CEO I said I said um I think this deal makes a lot of sense and I wanted to write that out into a memo I know you guys have this memo writing culture like Amazon has this thing like you write six page memos for all your strategies so I took a stab I wrote One um you know I obviously I don't know some of the internal things so I you know I took guesses they're they're in blue you can see the guesses but um yeah I wanted to put my Logic on paper because I don't want to do this if this doesn't make sense right you're not saying please please buy me you're saying I'm trying to figure out does this make sense for both of us it's a two-way street and so in order to do that I wrote something to give myself Clarity I thought you'd like to see it and so um I actually wrote for one of the Acquisitions I said this is how I would announce this deal to the to the company to the team to your exact team and the rest of the employees and I just wrote a really persuasive argument of like we bought this company here's why here's why this was a good idea here's how here awesome this is going to be here's the how this solves one of our problems uh I'm so excited about this acquisition and like in doing so again I made it easy somebody told me this one of my deal duels he goes you need to turn your company into a giant buy button like a like Amazon one-click checkout so that means make it easy to understand what you do make it easy for them to understand your team your technicals your your Strat how you strategically align and last thing you get your get all your financials in like very clean proper uh you know data room so that there's no friction in trying to buy your company last one neglect emotionally the Dennis Reynolds special so you need to find another partner you need to go cold all right you don't want to be all in hot on one partner that is not how you get the best deal so you need to find multiple partners at the same time you need to be negotiating these in parallel you don't do one at a time you you start the process you're now doing running you know you're starting conversations with 10 folks that wants 20 Folks at once you're narrowing it down you're trying to get multiple offers in the same week so that you could tell them hey we got another offer um sometimes you go cold a little bit make them sweat uh not too long don't push it but uh it's not a bad thing I also leave breadcrumbs I don't know if this made a difference or not but I would like check in on my Instagram story like I'm in Seattle oh cool I've never been to the office to this cool office before and like they know they're like oh he's at Microsoft he's at Facebook where is he he's talking he's talking to our competitors um so you know I don't know if that [ __ ] works but it amused me at the least it made me feel like I was doing some some James Bond [ __ ] all right last one Inspire hope this is where you go back to me say look we got other options but we want you can you make that happen can you get your deal can you get your offer a little stronger here here and here and it's time sensitive look like we have this other offer on the table they're not going to sit around and wait um so if you can get us something we can we would like to work with you we think you are the best fit but obviously you know Bird in Hand this is a really good offer and you know I don't want to blow it for my team by by sitting here hoping you guys come around um you know you need to to use the The Leverage from one deal to get a better deal and then you sell entirely so you need to do the you have your due diligence stuff ready you need to make sure that the closing terms are clean you need to get a good lawyer and a good accountant don't and don't burn Bridges because deals fall through and you may need to go back so make sure you communicate properly even when you say no to people um and uh do everything with with sort of integrity and Grace because uh many times deals have fallen through we need to go back when we sold the milk Road it was a somebody we had rejected last minute but we didn't burn the bridge and they didn't burn the bridge and we came back you know later and we said hey still interested and they sure were and there you go the advice I got here was uh before my deal Doula was this is when you need to Sprint the hardest so normally an entrepreneur gets a term sheet it's like they want to relax finally look at this the big number I'm Gonna Be Rich this is awesome and they take a moment to relax you can't relax here this is where you sprint the hardest to close you cancel everything else you just spend all day following up with lawyers data room uh your accountant making sure that all your ducks are in a row solving any problems uh along the way and lastly celebrate make sure you celebrate uh very often the whole process is so stressful that the the main feeling is just relief I think that's common but you want to let that relief subside and then have the joy and the The Pride that you you did something kind of amazing and so uh I don't know if I have any other slides left okay remember some some tips here the great advice I got birds fly fish swim and deals for all through that's what they do just remember deals fall through that is completely normal for them um you can't get emotionally too high too low the second deal momentum is everything if you have a conversation going the speed with which you follow up and you get them the materials and you you move forward is everything momentum is everything when it comes to deal making and last thing one choice is no choice if you only have one person that could buy you one company that's gonna buy you you have essentially zero people that will buy you have zero leverage so you need to have multiple choices one choice is no choice all right that's it um that's the master class let me know what you thought about that one drop comments um on YouTube so that's where I read them so go to go to YouTube my first million hit the thumbs up if you like this subscribe to the channel where over 200 000 subscribers now that's amazing if you guys like these I'll do more of these uh they're not easy to do these master classes right like and it ain't easy to drop these kinds of bombs but if you guys like it I will make an effort and I will try to do more of these uh until I'm all out of knowledge and um and then I'll then I'll stop and just go retire so let me know if these are worth doing and uh your compliments fuel me to do more all right I'm out of here [Music] thank you

one of the things I've always envied about Elon is that like every company he gets involved in basically Saves the World so even Twitter he was like needs free speech and it's like boom I was like man how did he take a meme platform with tweets and arrogant dudes you know and turn it into free speech for socialization like that's where I think a lot of his Geniuses and so for us we want to build a company off of praise and not punishment you can punish people or you can praise them and we believe that you get more performance out of Praise now you look at Goldman's actually JP Morgan look at McKenna deals and a lot of people are like man it's a toxic work environment it's really hard bubble bath and so those are usually punishment driven cultures if it were just Layla it'd be a woman driven thing be like oh it's a girl who's saying you should be nice to people but I think I given how I look how I talk I can probably deliver that message

I remember the first time I recognized public and then it was once a month and it was once a week and then it was once a day and then it was every time I'd walk outside the door and now it's about six times every time I walk outside I get recognized but here's the pros we get the best talent for our portfolio companies and for acquisition.com because so many people want to come here we get them for at market rate or below because of all the learnings that they want we get the best deal flow that's all proprietary companies that want to work specifically with Su scale the company I continue to do it because I'm more rewarded for doing it than I am punished for doing it but you know you get weird letters and things like that it comes with the territory and it's to be expected so for us the pros outweigh the cons but there are kinds

so does that mean that like the vast majority of your real wealth creation has been in like the 10 last 10 years no in the last like a few years but you weren't you you were broke I was I would consider myself broke I would say I started from zero almost in 2016 when I launched the machine I wouldn't say Deadpool I mean you're a millionaire you would you were you worth at least 10 I would say I was probably worth like you know 15 or 20 in that film so not broke but to me I was like bro to a future billionaire a millionaire is broke [Music] laughs Sean say exactly what you just said to me when we finished our recording with Rob Dyrdek I said I think that was the best episode of MFM we've ever done uh I I don't know I don't know if I'm just on a high right off of it but I believe so people can tell in the YouTube comments they should tell us I to me this was the best episode we've done 400 something episodes how many have you done Jonathan something like 400 episodes that was the number one my favorite the best episode we've ever done the from beginning to end I'm shocked so like you asked him we started getting along really well and you said Rob what's your net worth and I was like damn is he gonna answer that and he gave the full answer We're not gonna say it now but it's somewhere in the middle somewhere but he gave the entire answer where he broke it down he talked about his I'm just actually shocked that he said most of the things that he said and it was amazing in a great way stories of two companies that he's built and the stories were phenomenal uh we talked about net worth what he does with his money how he thinks about investing we talked about like how he kind of went from beginner at business and making all the mistakes to now being really sophisticated and how that all happened a really short amount of time we talked about his his house the forever estate the dream that he's been building around and how he does it was we we touched it hit all the buttons had the inspirational the Tactical the uh entertaining the humorous it had everything that I like in an episode but in one so I'm I'm I couldn't be happier right now so if you use YouTube whether you're listening on on podcasts or you're actually watching us right now let us know in the comments what you think or if you're not a YouTuber just tweet at Sean and I it's uh Sean VP like vice president Sean VP and then thus sampar and add Rob to it and let us know uh in Twitter on Twitter or if you're a YouTuber let us know there I'm very curious what you guys think and uh tag Rob if you can give us a wave of feedback I'm gonna send it all to Rob after after the Pod to to show him uh the the love because I know people are gonna love this all right without any further build up here's the episode episode with Rob Dyrdek uh all right we're live Rob we uh Sean you missed it because you're late you're always late and that's dear that's his whole thing is timeliness and he was talking mad [ __ ] about you because you were using his face and his time template that he talked about in the last pod I am human optimization was the big the line from his last time he was on that's been I think it's like in our trailer now and uh Rob if you are human optimization I am human on optimization I am the opposite yeah and hey look the beauty of the you know time Mastery is you don't you're also it's time flexibility and understanding that life is this living experience but nothing brings me Greater Joy than to know a man that was using my time data for customer acquisition and knowing that how much I collect my data and how how specific I am with mastering my time would be seven minutes to have me waiting for seven minutes makes it even more it makes life more Grand to me to know that for you knowing how much I respect and use my time so thoughtfully that you would steal a little bit from me even you know what I mean it's very fun okay that is well played I appreciate that dude we were talking about a bunch of stuff before you hopped in Rob I want to talk about that in a second but you came on I think two years ago or a year and a half ago I don't remember that was like your first everyone I just reread the comments a minute ago everyone said the same [ __ ] which is the exact same thing I thought which was Rob's just a skater uh he's he's smart and does good TV [ __ ] and all that stuff but we didn't realize that he was just profound and that pod I felt like one is your what it does you're coming out as like this like human optimization thing now I've watched you with so many other people and you've I've gone more in depth on some of your stuff is that true was that like your first time like was that like the the artist formerly known as Prince moment you guys get all the credit thank you that's what I was looking for hey because because let me give you this you led out with trying to talk to me about you did you did no depth of research into seeing what I was up to you let out with some skate talk and TV talk and then I went on like a 20-minute rant to un so that you could understand the depth of how I operate yeah then the entire conversation changed for an hour you know what I mean and that that that to me is like the funniest part of the experience was I said okay they didn't even they have no idea who they're talking to let me let me lay this out real quick and and but again I I'm so thankful that you guys the conversation turned to because it was also like I had been collecting the data using my rhythm of existence but I'd never shared it before so even then sharing it with you and then you guys reposting it it really began to like create the wave and then you guys put out a a little thing that was about what if Rob how would Rob monetize his data and so you put out this entire thing about like how uh to build an app and and what I would need to charge in order to create a business out of it and it really started the wheels in me of like like realizing that man I need to turn this philosophy first into then a usable digital product that's more intuitive that's deeper than an app that's actually a software that allows people to realize this level of Harmony and overall happiness that I've created through this system and which has led to where I'm at today of continually pushing the philosophy forward and ultimately creating a software was inspired by you guys we get all the credit that's nice there's actually a couple listeners who after they heard that made their version they were like dude who was talking about this it sounded so awesome he said he might share it but we haven't seen it yet so I just went ahead and I made my own version it's it's linked to Google Sheets it was kind of a janky version but I definitely inspired several people to I mean many people to to look in order to be like you know how am I treating my time and it seems like you had the kind of the complete balance you were like I have my time that's with my wife and my kids and then I have my work time and then I have my body you know you had it all so I think that definitely inspired a lot of people to look at it but it also inspired some people to try to build their own version of that tracker so that they could have the kind of the you know the what gets measured gets managed that type of attitude around around their time yeah and again I think it's it's so much more complex than that right because time's alive and your time and experience your present basically your whole life leads to this present moment in time and then the energy that you feel at this present and moment in time is ultimately the quality of your reality that you're in right so time ends up being this much much more important aspect of learning to manage and then you're changing all the time the world's changing you're selling companies you're starting new companies your kids are growing all these things so like managing your time and how you stay balanced is constantly changing as well as you change so it's this ongoing focus in my life that it's this Con constant assessment and and adjustment to lead me towards a better probability of a better future experience and that's what's difficult when somebody makes their own app there's sort of a philosophy and a rhythm and a process that I think I need to that I'm creating in the software that makes it much more intuitive based off of the type of personality you have and the way your life rolls to get it to actually work because otherwise it just feels like you're making checklists and and making data and then it gets too difficult and it's over you know before you join Sean we're talking about Andrew huberman and the reason why we're talking about them is because but I I like to skate Rob is a skater hardcore obviously professional skateboarder and heberman loves it and we were talking about that and I don't know if you know what momentous is Sean but it's like they're they're one of the main advertisers on the heberman Pod and they're and it's Andrew huberman says like this is the only protein that I like so obviously I bought a ton that's what I drink every day and Rob was like and I is it Jeff is he the CEO I'm supposed to talk to Jeff Jeff is the CEO yeah yeah yeah I'm supposed to talk to Jeff because Ken Ridout introduced us who was also on the Pod and anyway uh Rob was like yeah yeah you know that's cool it's amazing to see what how past that business grew because of huberman's uh you know promotion you know you know I co-founded that company not too long ago and it's just crazy how fast it's grown and we are like wait what Rob you co-founded momentous protein yeah and look in in and here's the thing with momentous protein I co-founded it with Matt Wan in 2016. um the when they brought it to me he had a vision for creating basically the most premium supplements that the market had ever seen the Ferrari of supplements it was called project one at the time and um Matt was foregoing his first year of Harvard to build this company he was 18 years old and his father uh Mark Juan had been one of the big investors in my professional skateboarding league so I had a relationship with him and said you know I would do this project with his son first thing we had to do was Rebrand it right and really like create a name and a soul into what is the absolute Pinnacle of supplements momentous right and all the way down to where I even you know went through the whole process of even making that logo you know like to me that m is like this Timeless extraordinary logo and Rob that's you in photo shop or this is like a creative agency pitching you guys how does that happen you take it make it this is literally an illustrator of the agency sent some logos of me cutting up the agency's logo and being like no get rid of there was a circle in the middle I'm like no this is like look at this it forms like an m in a mountain like like get rid like I literally cut and pasting in my illustrator the momentous logo love it and so we launched that company and what happens we don't sell a thing we don't sell a thing what do we got we got the most overpriced like protein in the entire industry it's like it's like 35 above like every other protein like it's like literally nobody buys it nobody buys it now you what do you got you got an 18 year old CEO this kid doesn't even every single day is another thing of like oh that's what happens in business you're you're if you want to talk about the headwinds of No Man's Land and the pain of launching a business with an 18 year old genius right because he's brilliant but he was 18 and didn't even understand anything about a company and you can't advise somebody into running a company you know what I'm saying you have to fight the fire learn the battles to ever learn how to operate a company long story short this this business never got off the ground for years and I finally now he's older and like I'm like look man you've got to make a decision like you've tried everything you've done all different types of Partnerships you've made all different types of verticals of product it is the Ferrari of supplements it is absolutely the purest and best you kept it real but you just can't find a market for it like you either have to sell it or you have to find somebody to merge with but you got to move on like you can't like spend your You're Now 23 like you learned everything go figure take this skill set that you learned and apply it to a business that has a a more uh relatively faster growing opportunity what were the sales what what were the annual sales when you when you had that conversation oh I want to say a few million and just losing money year over year and how much did you put in yeah how much did you put into it to start I put in um shoot I want to say not much like 200 000 and the first like like at the beginning to get it off the ground and another hundred thousand three hundred thousand maybe do split Equity when you do that like and I got 30 of the business okay okay so so now um man raised so much Capital Any Which Way but Loose you know now I'm on the board I'm in board meetings like and there's I'll tell you what nothing nothing is painful as board meeting after board meeting when there's no Revenue growth and you're just burning Capital trying to figure out how you're going to tell a story to raise more Capital to keep the dream alive um that went on for a significant amount of time we got incredibly deluded and then the it was just like hey man you've got to make a decision here on like what you what your life looks like forget about forget about this company forget about this investment like you now like are you you forgoed going to Harvard to build this company so you essentially like stepped away from from this big education which always like in the beginning I was like this kid's too smart to go to school what he should just go start a company he doesn't need to go to school like as I have kids and I'm older you know what I mean you know like seven eight years later I'm like man I I was like the bad uncle by advising them to not go to Harvard and I'll do this company with you gassed him up right like I I think he should have went to Harvard in hindsight um but again like diluted all the way down he went out and found uh amped um the business that Jeff was running at the time that I actually man I I looked at in 2015 and almost did a deal to own half of PR lotion and and the amp product because of how much I believed in the IP uh of of what they developed because it was built through this um uh biopharma group that I was doing deals with back in 15. in my early days of hustling and they merged and in that merger then they did a deal now they're joint companies that the whole company becomes momentous and then they they lock in that humor bin deal and then the business exploded overnight overnight wow overnight you know do you know how how much did it grow by like man like 20 times right like it like it went like um it is it is now like poised to like now make a real run and I would attribute it to the one for one like media to consumer that Andrew huberman was to the product right so we could never find an audience it didn't matter how much like ad spends we did where we spent it we had deals with NFL teams and MLB teams and all these athletes and all this stuff but it was when it finally landed with someone whose core media is their authenticity in um the science side of human optimization then he's saying hey Andy's has this massive platform then he's saying this is the very best supplements because they are in fact the very best supplements when you tie those together boom that thing goes you know what I mean that's a Amazing Story what do I have now I don't know what do I have now like four percent you know what I mean like I've been good so now you know call it nine years later uh or a seven years later I already gave up on the brand don't even like claim it like looked at it when they merged as an exit and now it's just like completely exploded but you know and yes I'll get like a return on my 300 000 that would be significant um to you know probably a regular investor but you know for me in the co-founding game it could have been you know I looked at selling that business for 100 million in under five years and having 20 of it when I when I measured that out in 16 versus you know selling it eight years later and making a million dollars wherever I end up getting deluded on the end and like okay cool you got like two and a half times your money but that's like that's not why you play the game of venture creation that was I think that was my perfect so that might be my the favorite story that's ever been shared on this pod for a couple reasons one you told it great two um it had it had all the the drama the elements uh to it and three you're very honest like um most people that come on this pod uh were like how much did you put in they're like ah hand wave we're like oh it's doing well now and then they're like yeah it's doing well but they won't say that last part which like yeah but you know it's been eight years I got deluded and honestly I'll make kind of [ __ ] all on this and and I I I'm really the game I'm in you know that's good but the game I'm in is to create create X very honest I I want people to appreciate that because that is so we do we've done 100 plus guests of people that are from all walks of life people that are post economic they already made it they have no incentive to kind of like to to not fully be honest with with the situations and uh it is very rare to hear that so I I really really like that I got two follow-ups for you on things you said there the first is you said you kind of think maybe you should have gone to Harvard and I think there's an interesting question that applies to a lot of people which is like should I go to college I kind of feel like you know people who make it they're like ah you know that's not where you learn it you learn it in the real world it sounds like you were kind of in that boat but you said maybe you changed your mind as you've matured or with your own kids what what's the thinking there what is it he should have gone to Harvard because the company wasn't working or you came to appreciate something else about the value of college I think I've come to appreciate the value of college above all and as someone who quit High School and started his first company at 17. you know what I mean like I'm I think about this but do you appreciate college or Harvard and top 20 colleges well Harvard obviously has a higher level of like Prestige but but what I never understood even back then was the looking at business in a multi-dimensional way learning everything about business understanding product and and supply chain understanding brand and marketing and customer customer acquisition understanding uh sort of management and hiring and teams like all of this uh diff and understanding sales and then understanding operational side really understanding the financial side knowing that all of those have to integrate into a financial model that you've got to believe you can execute because that's how a business actually becomes successful is when you project what you're going to do and you actually do it not project a fantasy uh so you can raise money right and I think that going to business school you at least uh leave with the fundamentals of that and and have a general knowledge that when you step out into the real world and really try to build a company you're you're at least going to have a foundation of what you're launching off of versus what he did what I did when I was launching all these companies when I was young all the way into my 30s or what he did at 18 years you have such little general knowledge of how it all works because you're such an optimist especially when you're really smart you can figure things out fast but there's just too many things that you don't know when it comes to like the complexities of building something like a business right and then uh my second question was do you uh this is a little nerdy on the protein side but how did you actually go about creating the cleanest supplement because I've thought about this many times which is uh there is definitely a market for people who want this the highest quality purest grade best best for you products they'll pay the extra 20 bucks per bag to get it um and when you you look I think the supplement industry is notoriously dirty like uh you know the places where they make stuff you know it's if you test these things they don't turn out very well so did you guys do anything radical to actually achieve that result or was it just finding the right partner and then that was it it was it was first like the people who helped develop it right we're all like trainers and uh for the 49ers and the Celtics right then um it's all the certifications that make the um I can't think of their exact name like grass and info sport whatever these intersport whatever they may be but these certifications that are very expensive right so now like the layer of edit what does that do the man it just keeps putting pressure on price and margin right because there's just a certain point where it's like man it's so expensive more expensive do even the people that really care isn't making enough of a difference right for the absolute premium and to me absolutely we'd find a consumer and that consumer never showed up until huberman said to that audience which converted Sam and now has Sam talking to Jeff like you it's like that level of authenticity the product backed that up but it we never found that level of media that could validate it to reach a large enough consumer base that would be willing to pay that extra amount of money it's a dice roll when you when you launch a business to do it like that you know we need to get in the certification business I think yeah that sounds like the real business this is cruelty free certified Inc yeah we will we will certify everything for y'all for for the low low price by the way it's funny that like Joe Rogan is like bro Oprah but now tuberman is like Dr Phil or Dr Oz or something like of the of this kind of like the guy media game where it's the the doc if the doc says this is the way to go if he says this is clean you know he can move a lot of product like an unbelievable amount of product in a short amount of time but look you think about it's like when you think about the depth of him and how he approaches it like you know how deep it is so it's like he's earned that respect from you and and so it's like you don't have to you don't question whether or not Nike's going to put as much effort and Innovation as they possibly can into a running shoe you don't even look into the technology you pick the color and which one feels the good you know that they're going to do all the work to get it there developing that level of authenticity is incredibly difficult you know because there's a lot of other people that are huberman-esque that do not have his depth which in turn does not allow or his process that you believe in which in turn doesn't allow them to carry the same weight that he does and that was probably just a straight cash deal when you guys bought that ad spot I would imagine right yeah I'm not entirely sure I was involved in the company at that point I'm not I'm not entirely sure what the what his deal is um but whatever it is he got underpaid whatever it is hey whatever it was too little look I am not privy to what it is but whatever it is they got a deal you know what I mean like I just know that what what are some other uh Venture creation that you've been up to so that was one amazing adventure creation story you got me hungry for another do you got any other interesting things you've been cooking and how many have how many have you even done have you done you've done dozens of these yeah I've done a bunch I've done a bunch you know what I mean and and that's and here's the beauty of it too is like I've made so much money right that I'm you can play the game more honest right which in your you're not really you're judging yourself off of your irr but you are not like once you get to a certain point like you're playing the game for the speed of the irr and the scale of the IR and its potential because when I started the game I wanted to build 50 to 70 companies uh and make you know uh own uh 25 to 35 and sell them for between you know 50 million and 150 million and make 20 to 30 each but when you know you sell a company for 200 million and get you know 150 million you you're like well that's way more fun like how do I how do I move this number from like making you know 15 to 30 million a deal to like you know 50 to 200 million a deal right you just begin to change as you're sort of evolving and what do less deals you want to do less deals right and then you you want to be much more focused on the opportunity and then like focused on all the Lessons Learned would I start a supplement brand with an 18 year old ever again I would not you know what I mean like and so let me give you an example of an opposite version right so um I was approached by a really really uh seasoned CEO who had just built a company and sold it was a footwear brand called greats okay so I also owned a pair of those man right so so you understand him is a brand and him is a brand Builder and as a CEO like you know and he had an idea he wanted to share with us and it was in the beauty space and he essentially presented to us this concept of um filtered shower water is this overlooked Cornerstone of creating your beauty routine like your water is filled with all this garbage that dries out your hair and dries out your skin it does all this stuff yet for some reason there's no no one's approached Beauty and filtering the water right so we do all the and again so okay wow this is super interesting then now you look at it from a business model right then it's like oh wow now it's reoccurring Revenue so it's a single bit of Hardware that now the filters have to be replaced so now you've got this reoccurring Revenue now it's a super experienced CEO that as as a depth of knowledge in in DTC so it's not like you know a lot of times you'll find a a an experienced CEO that came from retail who just oh it's I want to build an Amazon business right because retail's so hard like anytime you find people trying to transition to what they think is an easier way to create meals uh is always a red flag but it but again now he has the the understanding the knowledge and now it's like is this space ballot so we do the research what do we do we go and look at the entire space of all of the filtered shower heads the entire Market it is tiny tiny tiny under a billion dollars right and he wants to charge 135 dollars for the unit 35 dollars for the filters you know you can go to Home Depot and get a shower filter for like 19 bucks you know there's like one Premier premium one that's sold by a beauty company that's you know kind of chromey or whatever that's like 99 100 but like no movement and so when you look at that opportunity you look at it like it's as clear as can be where it's like man this is either Pure White space and there is a real opportunity to like make this matter in Beauty and make a massive business and or it will like literally just not work it is like so pure but then the tantalizing side is well boy if it works man it's like think of the friction it takes to get a shower head in but man think of how low the churn will be on the subscription because it'll be way more friction to to take it completely out to stop your uh reoccurring like subscription every two months then it will and put back your old shower head like that made it this incredibly compelling concept and and by the way for the listener this is basically your shower head so I don't even I don't even think most people know this but the shower head it's not that hard to remove you can kind of do it yourself and what you're and it's Jolie is this Jolie is that you say it Jolene Jolie and you basically they give you or because I've seen this company they killed it in year one I think they did four million in sales in the first year you basically they send you a thing a new shower head you they send you a wrench you put it on there and then you put little like filters and packets and I think they smell nice or something like that and they might have some type they might have some type of other good stuff in there but the the premise is is that uh for all the really hardcore Health nerds they're afraid of some of the chemicals and minerals that are in city water and so they want this to be better um and I have friends that have like um what's that one uh like charcoal water filter that's made out of metal that ever they do that for their home like they do these really like ten thousand dollar projects for their home and what this product is is that for a shower head did I summarize that and think if that's correct and it's the efficacy of it right and then how did they launch the company how were they able to go to 4 million and now this year you know they'll do close to 40 million is that they um they opened it up by like putting in your ad your your ZIP code so you could see all the contaminants in your water nice so how they did all their initial customer acquisition is they got all the data of what it because the sit the the water departments have to report all the contaminants in the water and so they scraped all that data you put in your zip code and then you got um a complete report of all the stuff in your water that's how they did customer acquisition for months before they even had the product out you know what I mean then they did pre-orders before it launched right then what were we all hanging on for what's that first quarter of churn the churn was at like you know 1.2 like of the subscription it's like everything about it and then it was just growth month of a month of a month then like they just keep evolving like they launched an erwan in the grocery store they have a giant display and you can buy them an erwan right the it's like the entire process of how they did it overnight because you got to think how do you value a business like that that that that business is valued at 200 million plus in a year and a half because how are you how do you really look at that where it's like yes it's selling Hardware month over month but then it is stacking subscription dollars like so it is it is this extraordinary Hardware subscription service that is incredibly rare that has made it so valuable overnight he built the company with three people we're the primary investor it's profitable and never raised another dime ever again chef's kiss what size check you do on that one yeah I did 800 in that one so that's I mean that's that's substantial right for an early stage startup I mean you know I will I'll go I go I'm all over the place but I'll go up to 10 million you know what I mean so when I think 800 I think it's like kind of small what's been the biggest bet like where where have you plowed in something like 10 million into what type of bet was that I did you know when I uh my professional skateboarding League my production company uh merged in with Nitro Circus and created thrill one media and then we sold 301 media for 300 million right of which uh we got 200 million right and this was sort of like the layering in of my production deal and then the group that bought 301 I invested 10 million with them to buy me um as and then did a separate deal as it relates to having a bigger stake in the production company uh that I sold and my league and the overall Sports property um because I knew um during that that transaction I knew I was going to negotiate for a bigger television deal so I basically leveraged um you know my ability to go and get a lot of value for the company so I got all this Equity back they just paid me you know close to 200 million so I used 10 of it and to invest in buying me so that I could you know turn around and hopefully make another you know you know not not nearly as much but hopefully like another like 100 to 150 off of it a couple years down the line and when you say we is that like Deirdre family office or is that uh right you don't have a fund right yeah it's just your family office just my money yeah like no I this is all my money so I and I just run it like a family office and I just look at that as where I would deploy Venture Capital right so if I just deploy Capital into real estate and Ventures that I have a much more control over and or I have a higher leverage or position uh but it was amazing think about this like in the closing of the deal I had to not I it was the most money I made in one shot right and the most like I had invested it once an adventure so with the like here on my you know closing that deal in the zoom call it was the most I made and the most I invested in in one uh one one here here with you know whatever like I whatever my like final check off on was it but again what are the stakes of it it's whatever you know what I mean I look at it as it's fun and like I'm underwriting the business because I went and signed a massive television deal so I'm under underwriting that entire roll up like and it's amazing Partners it's Dana White and the Fertitta family who own the UFC so it's like even being close to them and knowing them for so long uh just makes the joy of of even partnering with them fun and exciting and I dedicate very little time to it right like I I still um and help help sort of adding the vision and how to continue to evolve and grow it but I you know continue to shoot television at an even much higher scale like now I'm shooting 336 episodes a year up from 252 um that's still at four percent of my time um that's you know essentially five hours a day uh four times a month for 10 months right like is essentially what it is but it's underwritten the entire roll up it is you know a billion dollar television deal over a seven year period with the production and everything involved I get all my talent money but then I'm also leveraged into the roll up in the production company again to sell it again um and it's it's it's it's just squeezing water out of a rock you know what I'm saying it's like you're looking at opportunities inside every deal you know there just isn't a world where I'm just looking at like where are the ways for me to add leverage create opportunity in each one of the ways that I look at every one of these deals um each and every time who are some of your business uh advisors mentors friends that are helping you develop this muscle because you know you go from anything you want to do you go from a white belt to blue belt eventually you're you can become a black belt and it sounds like you know when you started you were more of a white but like everybody and now you know looking at structures looking at ways to double dip looking at ways to um you know measure okay I want irr but also I should be thinking about the gross dollar amounts and maybe fewer deals but bigger deals who have you learned a ton from that uh that you you respect either as a friend or mentor on the business side man I you know I don't think anybody plays the game like this that I know that's in my circle you know I think it's a it's that experience and it's that like continually looking at every deal multi-dimensionally right and I think like the gift that I actually had early on is I used to look at media and marketing multi-dimensional right so like in the early days I would you know be able to look at like a television show and how are all these ways that I could monitor monitor monetize it right like how do I own the rights of media and then I could sell that to different people like I always looked at opportunity multi-dimensionally but I didn't understand how to build and create value and business so I never looked at business multi-dimensionally and I just think I'm at once I taught myself really how to look at business holistically and how to create and build businesses to sell creating value that then I began to look at you know how can I see all of the opportunity in these different angles in order to you know create the most value for myself and a lot of times under right risk you know what I mean like if I didn't know I was going to go and sign that Mega television deal I wouldn't have put into 10 million but I but then I said well what if I go and sign this deal how much additional Equity will you give me for my 10 million right then they're like oh if you go and get that deal then we'll give you 12 extra percent you know what I mean like then it's like okay now I'm like you know I just made my literally overnight made my 10 million worth like 60 million and and underwritten it off of the deal that I'm going and making hundreds of millions of dollars to just do you know so it's like you're and at the end of it and keep in mind through all of this I work less now than I've ever worked you know what I mean through optimizing my time and getting more and more efficient of how I use it I work at at about a 40 hour week to manage my family office all of my Venture portfolios and shoot television and a podcast you know what I'm saying all of that is without a 40-hour week you know this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better what do you think you're worth at this point um so you have you have liquid and you have obviously a liquid um what do you think the the kind of the old the n-word the net worth is at um and do you do you have a goal with that and last podcast you go I need to be a billionaire like I deserve so like yeah where are we at remember that line it was a beautiful line no no I don't but that's really funny it's like I'm you know I was doing because you got to think like you know I have this uh in between our last call I I had this I hired an amazing CEO that came from a family office structure I needed somebody that understood business but understood sort of the Dynamics of a family office but was also young and excited to go on like a a journey to a billion dollars right and so I have modeling for just my cash flowing assets that take me to a billion um like forget about like any of your Venture stuff and building out uh sort of your pathway through the business side um like I have modeling out to the year 2050 like that I have fully integrated on all asset classes that I'm even investing in now where do you make the billion dollars you make it either slowly over time time at compounding or in big chunks right so if today I'm my net worth of all of my assets is a little just under 350 million right that the the pathway uh there's the slow long Pathway to a billion that's easy through compounding right because because uh just like seven or eight percent correct right and with the the buildings now you got to think about the way the buildings work and the real estate work is I'm getting five to six percent cash like a tax-free cash but I'm still getting seven to ten percent uh Equity growth over the long term um and and some of those are you know so you know call it with the cash 15 16 irrs but a lot of the buildings that I've uh sold I ended up with like 35 and and 42 irrs and what do you do with that you 10 31 exchange it and and you get new buildings on an ongoing basis so like that real estate even side of it um is compounding in a unique way and then with my cash you know money markets are giving you five percent right now close to five percent and then I keep uh a significant amount of liquid dollars in in sort of new Veen high yield funds that kick off around a blended ten percent that aren't going to grow but you get cash for your cash you're making so much cash off of your cash then you're making so much cash a tax depreciated cash off of your um off of your real estate portfolio that you you know when you look at all of I look at that I call it the modern cash flow portfolio where it's just that cash is underwriting the expense of my life in the family office right and so I don't even like when I have these big exits and when you know all the money I get made from TV I look at all of it through the lens of how much am I actually making post-tax per hour so okay it seems like I'm making a lot shooting television so efficiently but um and how much time I actually work on the deer dick machine and the actual uh Venture side of the business when you look at long-term capital gains versus ordinary income but boy when you look at the amount of time I spend on that cash flowing portfolio and real estate it's a couple hours a year and so what do you have as a as a dollar per hour goal like what do you what is good for you what is bad for you right so like everybody uh has a like you know if I do something that that saves me a hundred dollars I go return a blender to the store that wasn't a saving of 100 it was it was a loss I'm looking at a million in hours ago you know that's your goal right as it relates to energy and effort that's put into it right and and you know because I I it's fascinating when you look at how much money I make from television and then what that ends up being like post tax and fees even though it seems like a limited amount of time because I and it's only four percent of my time but seeing all of them through that lens it's a way more interesting way to view it all you know what I mean because since it and again it goes back to time it's like when you because what life do you want to live right and and where do you get time where can you buy time back but ultimately where are the places where you make the most money and people don't believe in them like this idea of passive income uh passive income is not buying a building that you've got to operate and you're constantly dealing with like trying to keep it rented and things breaking and trying to make decisions that's not passive income in real estate passive income is when you give money to an operator and they give you cash back for your money that's when you're doing nothing now you're you're you what you have to get good at is evaluating rules and and creating principles for the type of operators you'd be willing to deploy Capital with so that you know that they're world class and that you what they say they're going to do that they do which in turn all you're doing is reading statements and putting a little money together or putting a little bit of time to think through strategy future strategy a few times a year that's the the difference on the way you choose to get into an asset class you know and based off of the last pod you you're saying how like I I think you said I think you're 47 now right um You said on the last pod that basically I think you said into your late 30s you'd screwed a whole bunch of [ __ ] up I think when you're trying to raise money from um I forget the the VC or PE company but you're raising money for something and you're like dude my business sucks I'm losing money turns out I'm I was wrong so does that mean that like the vast majority of your real wealth creation has been in like the 10 last 10 years no in the last like few years but you weren't you you were broke I was I would consider myself broke I would say I started from zero almost in 2016 when I launched the machine I wouldn't say death row I mean you're a millionaire you you were you worth at least ten I would say I was probably worth like you know 15 or 20 and that's out so not broke but to me I was like bro to a future billionaire a millionaire is broke well yeah but but he he described it he was like in my 30s he's like I I spent this this and you you said phrases like I had nothing but I would tell you that the majority of this wealth was all created between 2018 and 2022. over that four year period right and now it's exponentially scaled right I don't even know you know when I think about sort of how I've I I'm I kind of I very conservatively um valued the ventures that get me up to the 325 Zone I could easily push those to I could easily say those are are you know push me closer to four right and but it's also like then okay what is how do I want to continue uh to create like bigger opportunities in the future because I'm always like five years into the future the same way I understood in 2016 here's the strategy the strategy worked only it was bigger than I had anticipated then all these other additional things that happened I had the clarity of like this is what I was going to do but then that Clarity the universe conspired to create more opportunity that I capitalized off of and got to this scale that I could have never imagined in such a shorter amount of time and all it does is make me see further and clearer on how I can get the scale even bigger which leads me to believe compounding I become a billionaire over time uh but I I believe I can create some Ventures including the software that I create that and the platform that I want to build speak to that core audience that I believe I will be able to monetize it at a much higher scale and a shorter amount of time with my existing portfolio of assets and if you Google your name you'll see like you went on a little bit of a buying spree where you're buying like I think four really really nice homes in LA but I thought it said that you I thought there was a quote saying you're not going to live there that's rentals um a is that true and B what type of real estate are you actually buying that you consider cash flowing real estate versus just personal yeah so I would never buy a house of rent that's like I didn't think so I I thought it said I I thought it said that maybe it was like on the what's it called like the dirt or like the real something like that yeah really what I did in this look this is gonna like this will this this will give you this is this will give you an ex like Clarity on how much money I had and how dumb I was in 2015. okay I like had met like my wife like all I wanted to find was a forever home I had like realized in 14 like I had began to develop like like like learning everything about business and everything you've got to think in 2013 I was dumb as dirt I was at the bottom I didn't understand business I didn't understand anything I hired all the consultants and all the groups and began to formulate everything I needed to learn to speak the way I'm speaking today and and the strategies of what money is where do I want to invest it never even heard of multi-family units in 2014 right like all of this I I then took all of my money at the time I had the all the money I had to my name in 2015 it was 12 million dollars in cash moved it all to cash like because I had money and all these different Brokers that didn't know what it was here I am in two thousand 15 with a vision for like how I'm going to create a venture Studio the deer deck machine and the whole thing and I'm looking for you know I just gotten married and I'm looking for a forever home or a place to buy and I find the most heaven sent piece of land that God has ever created in a gated community in Beverly Hills that is a like this gated community to a private road to a Four Acre Promontory with unobstructed views of the entire La Basin Hollywood Sign ever the most extraordinary property I have ever stepped on in my life and paid 10 million cash for it and then took launch this dream with two million you know because I was like oh Nick this is my destiny to build a house and live on this land forever so it's just land it was just land just land call it forever Estates and I I have sense and so in that neighborhood like where it is I have bought multiple houses and remodeled them in the neighborhood while I continue to design uh forever Estates as it's called and and kept it all these years carried the cost you know 200 Grand a year just to carry it spending milk like built a whole designed a whole house as an architecture team fired them hired sayota the best architects in the world out of South Africa and we have just been designing and designing and designing it was part of the vision of like I'm going to spend the rest of my life in Forever Estates like that's where I'm going to live there is no better piece of land in the city of Los Angeles it's the most extraordinary home I rented a house for three and a half years bought a house for 6.5 sold it for like nine five two years later after remodeling it bought another house for for eight put two million into it this house that I'm in now is two doors down from the entrance to forever's Estates so when I begin to build it uh at the in the fall that I can be there every step of the way but what happened begin to build it in the fall how long ago with timeline are we talking this has been eight years say to me they're like this is crazy and I'm like man I'm going to live there forever and when I build it I don't even want to think about the cost it's going to cost me 20 million to build I don't even want to think about it I needed to get to generational level wealth to even like I didn't want it to be a burden that's why I kept buying houses and kept working on the design and then now you've gotten to such a scale what's the strategy now well I'm putting it into a trust I'm paying cash for the house to build it and then I'm going to pay rent to the trust and then it's going to build an endowment so that this home can be in my family forever but run it be self-operational that is so it doesn't have to be tied to the estate that it will be ran and then there can be family meetings and forever Estates for hundreds and hundreds of years into the future right and you can't even get to that way of thinking unless you have kids unless you create generational wealth and unless you get to that time but that all happened over five year period you know what I mean that is an extraordinary transition to get it started it started with a horrible decision I mean 10 10. trouble you took look I put I could have put 10 think I'm gonna say you know how many build how much money I had invested in buildings in 2015 100 000. 100 000 I had invested 100 000 and was making you know seven G's from that one and and like I put instead of putting 10 million into a cash flow which would I would have been set for life if I were to put that 10 million into the buildings that I put back in 2015 that got like 40 irrs like and we're kicking off like nine percent cash I would have been like set for life from the compounding and the cash flow of that one thing oh no oh no I took ten put it straight into a liability do you know what I'm saying that now I'm carrying the cost of paying the taxes and double homeowners fee because it's a double lot so I'm just carrying 200 Grand a year up and and then I'm paying all these Architects on an ongoing basis to continue to design and develop it absolutely ludicrous you're uh you're amazing are you taking adoption I think you're 15 years older than me you know I could be your your teenage uh you're taking applications yeah I want to go to Forever Estates Man River States for you is going to be more like a decade estate it sounds like the way it's taken but oh that is like hey and look even um hey if it lasts forever what's a decade man that's a drop in the bucket but but think about it it seems to me I don't even it's just another part of seeing my life completely in multi-dimension because it's like it's my relationship with my wife and kids in time it's the health that I have it's how every part of my existence has continued to expand and get better I didn't get better in just business I didn't get better in just I got better in like all aspects of my existence on an ongoing basis so that house if I would have built the house I designed five years ago I would have been so bummed because I got every six months I would get a completely new design get it in VR and as I changed and thought about and got clearer on what I wanted the future to look like and how I would want family meetings here in 200 years like it allowed me to keep evolving and keep evolving to where when I finally got to this point where I'm just about to get the final permits it feels right on time to me I love that right and and it's like I'm healthy you're happier wealthier wiser and I know that I'm just going to get healthier happier um wealthier and wiser till the day that I die and right now what's my goal one million hours of Life 114 years and 54 days so where am I spending a significant amount of my wealth understanding every single aspect of my body and having a very deep longevity plan that allows me to to enjoy life and live it at a high level at the ripe old age of 112. someone get the 114 just fall off a cliff I uh oh my God Rob you're amazing so I was gonna ask you about longevity like uh perfect segue right yeah I want to ask about that too and what I was going to say is very similar to that which is like you know a lot of people when I sold my first business and had my first bite of like financial success I was able to get physically fit it was definitely a little bit easier I could hire some people but also like I felt a little bit more calm and I had more time is this new focus on longevity and focus on all this stuff is that because you now are financially successful and have more time or do you think that you always had this this bug and what are you doing now health-wise I have been doing it Non-Stop for as long for for 20 years I got my first blood panel and started optimizing into my blood work in 2012. so for me the what where a big transition was in 2015 around the same time I had made the decision that like I was in the best shape of my life but my body was always achy and I had made this decision that I started having a doctor come to my house five days a week and all I wanted to do was build a perfectly structured physical system and there was no timeline to it and really what it led to is triangulating a ton of different therapies which in but in the process allowed me to learn every muscle in my body how the fascist system works what are my neurological deficiencies what are all of the things that I need to retrain in My overall system internally as it relates to leaky gut and blood brain barrier all of these sort of things that lead to inflammation that lead to to heart disease and all these different things that that reduce your quality and length of life I had been doing over a decade so now the way I approach it is so sophisticated because I know every single aspect of my entire function holistically of my body my mind my time my energy so it's a different level so what happened when I got to this scale of success I referred to it as Peak top it's the same psychological uh chaos that happens to a drug addict at Rock Bottom where like you finally make a truth in you where like you don't you can't be a drug addict anymore and something shifts in you mentally I finally got to I'm I it happened to me on the other side where like you've started getting more and more disciplined and healthy that you all of a sudden were like why would I ever not just be extraordinarily healthy for the rest of my life and what happened from that point I have not missed the day of getting up at 5am I have not missed a day in the gym I have not missed one day meditating I have not missed one day eating supplements eating clean I have not had a drink I haven't had any sugar I haven't had a snack any of that for since I hit that like nine months ago the data that I shared with you guys as it relates to the quality of my Life numbers how I feel about my life work and health zero to ten and then my discipline numbers what percentage did I get up at five brain train meditate get in the gym eat clean and not drink and take my supplements it is one hundred percent across this entire year and then my qualitative numbers are at the highest they've ever been so every single day I wake up feeling extraordinary right and I grew into that and then the more success I had if I didn't have to then decide I want to be healthy I had been working when in 2016 when I designed my vision for my business and my financial success I designed a vision for my life success and my health success so what happened over the last seven years is I got better and better and better at all of it which led to this euphoric state of where you have an incredible depth of knowledge of your entire reality and your current state and your future state so you're just continuously predicting the future and creating higher probabilities of being healthier happier and wealthier in the future while living extraordinary in the present what's been like the the 80 20 of that like the the the things that have made the biggest change on your health I mean look you I you not drinking not eating sugar and intermittent fasting and eating a lean uh protein and vegetable meal to me is everything is everything because you're just your body begins to clean itself you feel better about yourself you make sharper decisions you go two layers deeper your emotions are more in check like things happen inside the family different things that are uncontrollable you're able to like like control all of those better that just pure diet alone in avoiding all of these like like processed foods and and alcohol like in being committed to that will absolutely change your life because it gives your mind more depth to to be able to execute at a higher amount at a higher level in the limited amount of time that you have to execute sorry have you seen this guy Brian Johnson what he's doing look I look at Brian Johnson as this guy's outrageous it's too much but I with all my judgment because I'm our like if I would have told myself five years ago hey this is what you're gonna be doing I'll be like that guy's crazy so I look at man I I feel like Brian Johnson's crazy but I'll probably turn into Brian Johnson in like seven or eight years yeah he's wild man he's wild yeah Brian Johnson just has that look you know what I mean he looks like a futuristic like amoeba you know what I mean that's what I was thinking I looked at him the other day I'll go all he needed all he needs to do is tan if he Tans everybody be like this guy is amazing he doesn't tan and they're like you're you're a vampire bro just he looks like AI all like the new AI versions of people like coming out he looks like an AI person he might not even be real he might not be able to be real he's a mid-journey but I do look at like that aspect because you've got to think about anything think about the way that I talk about business it's knowledge and experience and an understanding and then a continual Evolution and growth of understanding the whole like applying that to my relationship with my wife and family applying that to my health applying that to business applying that to investment implying that to building my my family office like all of that way of thinking like is is based off of gaining knowledge to take something from not understanding it feeling difficult to then making it easier then continually optimizing right you're just incrementally making it all better what what are I love the way you think and I love the kind of pursuit of greatness and pursuit of Excellence for yourself and having a vision for yourself um I also know that it's inspiring but also hard to relate to Perfection and so I'm curious what are the current flaws or bugs in your software that you're still debugging we all have some bugs in our software that's running we're we're hunting them down and we're trying to squash them one at a time what are some that are still still in your your system it might be in business it might be in Hell might be in you know for me oh you know a nice bag of chips it's still a bug in my software uh you know maybe something oh sometimes when I'm with my wife I'm not as present as I should be I'm on my phone but I know that's not really me and who I'm gonna be but I'm still catching up to myself in that way what are some of those for you you know and this is gonna sound like extraordinarily um don't say it I tried to help you man I tried to serve you up a way to be vulnerable here no no I'm not I'm not uh no again I'm not there is no yeah no no I'm not there is no like to me it is like I still get triggered like and we'll get angry right like I will get like when my expectations are mismanaged at a high level I'll I'll get mad and get like in snap right like I have I'm not even kidding you like I am trying to like like even when I get triggered I'm trying to stop the triggers um to avoid like saying something like letting it come out right like I'm really but I still feel the trigger my goal is to get to like don't even let things trigger you like when you let people get angry but you gotta think part of like the evolution is like there's certain people in your life that do that to me that I had to let go of right and continually optimize for those people and this is the this is embedded in my soul this is embedded in my soul when I feel stuck when I feel stuck when I'm working on like trying to do deep work or doing and I feel stuck all I want is pizza and wine all I want is pizza and wine it's not even like a matter of like like acting on it it's like my soul feels like it needs it needs a glass of like wine and it's like because whenever I get stuck it's this this psychological thing of like just [ __ ] let it all go let it all go so even though I don't act on it because I've just evolved Beyond it I still when I get stuck I the feelings are are exist in there but but I'm telling you it's the you know the commitment of where it went 100 health and no alcohol and no sugar in that level it eliminated so many things it eliminated me being like you know short with people it eliminated me like making rash decisions right not thinking through stuff and just like shooting from the hip you know which is a recovery you know I used to say like you know deer deck Enterprises are money Fearless right because I would uh and like invest so recklessly when it was really our money's dumb but that Reckless like let's just push it forward like let's just let's just start it and go for it is still something that I fight on an ongoing basis because I'll get excited and energized and see it and be like let's do it and I've got to control that impulse just to that I've that I've learned to control in this state at a much higher level but there are very little and here's the thing I I look at it as like how Kobe was never like was relatable to me because it was too much discipline and how Tom Brady like man why would you not take the off season off like like I used to look at that as this impossible level and to mean like I know that I'm I'm reaching this unrelatable unattainable place it's why I put out a podcast uh earlier this year that was the most unrelatable podcast part one and part two because I just laid out the depth of like actually how I'm operating and what I've learned along the way to get to this level because I do want to I want to be the proof that you can get to a place where you never get angry you never have a negative thought where you are completely harmonious and balanced in all your relationships and time and health and happiness where you are happy and filled with gratitude seven days a week every single day ever even under unexpected duress I I'm living in and I know it's possible I want to continue to be proof that it is then I want to build the product services and tools that other people can use to get to this level and this feeling because to me it is heaven on Earth it is true happiness is really the output of this existence that I've created in a relatively short amount of time let me uh let me run this trend by you guys that I'm seeing and it's related to this so I live part of the time in New York part of the time most of the time in Austin Texas and I also owed a ranch out in Texas and what I'm noticing is that in Austin it's almost like La a little bit where we have all types of Health freaks you know it's like it's really cool to be around those types of people and I eat really healthy as well and I'm noticing that my extreme help friends they're doing something like that like a redneck family like where I grew up what they used to do which is they buy a cow so like you like go in with either you or your neighbor and you go and purchase a cow and someone Slaughters it and then you get like the whole cow for the year and I noticed that Zuckerberg I think two years ago he made this commitment that he was only going to eat what he killed or I think even grew and I'm noticing that my health friends are doing this now and I've seen a lot of tweets recently where people saying like you know I'm eating healthy but I still feel bad but when I go to Europe I feel good and I did some research there's the FDA and the European the EU how they like measure food it's a little bit differently like the the preservatives and things anyway have you I know you're into Health now and I know you invest in a lot of Health and Wellness stuff my prediction is that in the next five or ten years I think we're going to see a couple Brands where you can buy meat online I'm even seeing people like revolt against like Whole Foods meat have you are you eating and so it's like something I've been thinking about is me have you been do you eat just meat off the shelf from Whole Foods or do you get it from somewhere special because I think there's going to be an interesting brand that does this the next five or ten years yeah look like I my meat is not so special to me I when I and so how I do it how do I do it I get um meal delivery seven days a week right and I get from which brand uh it's just a local Chef here so I get that's all organic right grass-fed and so I get a grass-fed beef yeah yeah so it tastes so bad man yeah and and so look so so to me I'm that's my Baseline and then I have breakfast Wednesdays with my wife I have Friday night pasta with my wife Sunday night Sushi like I have sort of the rhythm of dates that I take my wife on and so when I look at that particular protein if you will at this stage like I'm I look at that as as as as much as I'm willing to dedicate into what's in my body until I can get to a point where the data shows me the impact of having Daisy in the backyard and me cutting Daisy up and slicing off a rib is going to deliver more nutrients that's going to add to a a longer uh higher quality of life I would need the data to take me there one day as opposed to getting that nuanced and the delivery of the quality of that protein where at this point for me that's enough as it relates to what I'm capable and my personal capacity can dedicate to the quality of the food you know I think this is going to be a thing Sean if you don't know there's a company that just raised money from Peter Thiel it's called Coop and they're making the Tesla of chicken coops so normal people could have a chicken coop in their backyard have you guys that shot I'll believe any Trend yeah the cat Coop guy he's the I crack guy right same guy yeah AJ dude I'm so fascinated with this look listen listen right now fundamentally would you have your own chickens that you slaughtered and ate chickens if it was no it's for the eggs it's it's for the eggs yeah it's for the eggs eggs bro you you just told me that a shower head company is going to be worth billion okay and you just bought a 10 million dollar piece of land when so look you might have an error in your judgment things happen like I I know your biggest weakness is you sick of the shower but come on yeah look for eggs maybe the beef I you know I but I don't know I'm not I don't I'm not you guys when you look at Trends on an ongoing basis you you refine your lens of like the things that were improbable that ended up working when they're harder to see you know what I mean I I think Maya even lens is is always ties back to the probability of the unit economics and the reoccurring Revenue aspect of it you know like I look at it so much more through that lens because even when I think about the coupe right if you're selling a single unit Hardware uh now you've got this incredibly small um like like customer base in the very beginning that are the ultra healthy and then they're they're it's like a a mattress like in the direct to Consumer mattress game as soon as they buy one they don't need another one for for you know 15 years right like it's it's would suffer that same sort of consequence versus five years ago Coop would get you know 100 million dollar valuation based off of like there's gonna be coups in every house in the world it's Innovation it's like the Tesla of eggs you know so right My Lens isn't as refined and I always go back to like like how much revenue the idea could create from a long-term value perspective um versus those those tough uh Hardware businesses that are minimal margin and you sell one you know so what what trends interest you now where what do you think's gonna be popular in the next five years and where you investing your money for uh what interesting Trends are you looking to invest in yeah look I don't invest in anything I invest in real estate and and businesses that I create and right now I haven't even uh invested in a new Venture since Jolie um you know because to me I'm I do think when I look out into the future like like as it relates to the type of stuff that I would do would still be related to biofeedback um you know Health customization all of these things that that help lead you uh to optimizing your overall health and well-being um you know I do think you know uh like you know you got to think those those glucose monitors that have that sort of come out to kind of give you an indication of like what your blood sugar is doing when you're eating food um that they're going to evolve that to eventually become dopamine and cortisol and it's going to end up being a Cornerstone of like how you even your life is actually feeling based off of what your your blood is saying in real time I think that's going to be something that really makes a big impact on the world um and and to me I wanna I wanna time into creating the existence management system that helps you manage how all of it fits together to lead to your present moment in time and help you optimize for guiding your life to creating higher energy present moments that you use with purpose and whether that's to to be on your phone and watch TV with your wife because you're tired or it's um for you to be ultra present with your kids so that you can actually experience it or you want to be able to design use the present to design a better future for yourself like it's really about how do you become this healthy develop healthy and understanding in the knowledge of yourself develop the ultra awareness of everything about you so that you can continually live a consistent state of Joy because feeling Joy over long periods of time is what it creates the feeling of happiness so we could wrap up with whatever you want to but I know the people in the comments are gonna be like why is that douchebag bringing up me what the [ __ ] they're already good I already know they're gonna flame me in the YouTube comments yeah I was just curious Rob uh I wanted you to can you can you finish with the two-minute crash course on something I've been uh look interested in and you know very well which is production companies so I noticed uh I don't know anything about Hollywood or TV production but I I my ears perked up when uh I forgot who was they bought um Reese Witherspoon's production company for some hundreds of millions of dollars then uh I saw that Peter chernin from The churning group he's doing a roll-up of production companies he's put in a billion dollars to work rolling up production companies and I thought oh that's interesting I read some interviews and he's talking about why he thinks there's a you know growing and sort of insatiable demand for content and then uh you know I just look at people who create Netflix shows I go look at uh you know oh love is blind this ranked number one on Netflix who created this I was a small production company like is this like the startup game where you create the next hit show and you become a billionaire or is it a ruthless business can you just just describe what creating a show or creating a production company is like and if that's a good business to be in or not as someone who um sold their production company for 200 million and who like had an offer on the table um that fell apart for 400 million recently um it is the worst business that you could ever get in in your life this is like and I'll explain to you why it is a shoot which you kill game and the Distributors control all of the money so like in your you have a hit show and you have this flourishing production company and then the show gets canceled and your company's worth zero right it is and then the problem with shows is like they don't pick them up for long periods of time I have a five-year 1680 episode order of Television it is unprecedented in all of production it does not exist but why is it hard for me to turn around and sell that because it's one single show and now they look at the and it's so expensive because it's made the production company so profitable but let's just say that didn't push you away a production company is built like this right you you've got to build the infrastructure that allows you to have your camera equipment your finishing equipment your licensing for your music you've got to basically then go and and give a budget to a network who's going to give you 500 grand for an episode and now you have got to figure out how to pull uh 20 to 30 percent of that in margin right so it gets in incredibly difficult to do and the only way that you can do that is look at all of the different ways that you can scrape margin out of that budget by owning vertically integrated so a lot of times there'll be people that that you know have um you know television shows and they just get paid an executive producer fee right so they will make a lot of money like Jeff Tremaine uh who is one of the executive producers on my show you know makes millions off of ridiculousness and doesn't just off his executive producer fee nothing where we rolled in our executive producer fees then built out the entire post and finishing and music division to push our margins up to be able to to create a sellable asset then we had multiple shows and then the um you know the call it the long-term sustainability of ridiculousness created the value that allowed us to sell it right and so even if you you launch an a production company and you have love is blind and it's a hit show you're not making that much money off of that show you are now hoping to stack shows and then end up pulling off of that margin that you get to split right and then then you trade on ebitda right so when you sell the business you're trading at like you know six times ebitda five six times ebitda and then a lot of times now they won't even buy you outright they will partner with you incentivize your long-term earn out because they don't want to just like pay you you know five times six times your ebitda and then all of a sudden like the show goes away right they and and you were the creative force behind getting new shows right so it's a lot more like complex and when you think about like the big dogs doing it they're looking at it more from they're buying the creative minds that are making the new content all the time so when you if they believe long term in content they're just and when you look at that aggregate you can have a couple of them slip and have a couple heroes in there and when you see all those together you can bet that that thing's gonna generate a ton of cash because the industry itself is built around being incredibly lean and then um being being profitable because they're only worth their profitability and then they can accordion you got a Big Show and all this stuff and the show goes away boom you bring it all the way back down because you you put so many people under under the show itself so that's where the bigger vision is for them to look at and is there an opportunity um for creatives and people in the space in this day yes because endeavor's doing it churnan's doing it a lot of people are doing it but it's extraordinarily difficult and and The Gatekeepers are the Distributors the Netflix the paramounts the you know you can attempt to create your own platform and distribute It Yourself YouTube digitally whatever it is but it's expensive and difficult to build audiences and then you're really looking at those Distributors as The Gatekeepers to the quality of the asset that you're creating and whether or not someone will make it to decide that you're worth the purchase all of that incredibly difficult in my opinion to to make happen you know perfect answer exactly I was looking for Rob this has been amazing one somehow uh where should people follow up where do you want we want it on your pod your Twitter email list how can people get more rob you know Rob's just at Rob Dyrdek a cross-social you know on a.com and just you know I got billed with Rob but really I'm not out pitching nothing I'm just out trying to figure it out keep evolving but one day I'm gonna come back on with my software when it's done well first I'm gonna send it to you guys first and and then when the book and the philosophy are out and the software is out then it's gonna be like how do we convert the listeners into changing their lives from being erratic in the harmonious high quality existences with the existence operating system you know but that's off in the future now I'm just glad to reconnect because I'm thankful for you guys um for kind of starting the spark of the whole thing and really I'm even thankful for you posting all the data and using the customer acquisition from the stuff that I sent you you know I sent you all the new stuff so you know you know what happened Sam man I know so basically he came on he did the rhythm of existence he sent us the the Excel PDF we post on Twitter and it was kind of over and then like a year later I was like all right I'm gonna start building my email list and I was like um how do I get fans of the show The the like-minded people how do I get my type of people to subscribe I don't just want any subscriber I want the right type of person I was like what would the right type of person be into and I was like oh dude the Rob the Rob Dyrdek the that that rhythm of existence sheet the time tracker I think they would be nerding out about that like that's my type of nerd and so we put it up as a lead magnet which was like hey come you know put your email in and get the he'll share his uh thing with you and uh we start spending a bunch of money and Rob emails me like I don't know six months ago he's like bro you're blowing me up with this sheet you know it's all good but you got to update the photo you're using the wrong photo from from over here and so we updated the photo and I was like oh man I feel bad we take the whole ad down we start putting something else up but it was a it was a moment of embarrassment don't feel bad because it it to me just perpetuates like like for me it just continues to push The Narrative of like level of discipline and commit and data driven so and Rob you said well you said you subscribed it was good in that we we we're preaching your gospel and it makes you look like a badass so there's nothing bad there I just should have asked you first and I had forgotten to do that I didn't do that and that's why I felt yes I was like oh my bad yeah don't hey I appreciate it and thought it was funny but I was also like like this is great then I was like interested in the data from your perspective of like okay well I wonder how many it converted just to kind of understand like how many well there was nothing to convert to right like since you had the DocuSign it was just the views of the uh the the PDF was like what I was interested in right and yeah I don't think it ran for too long I think it had maybe five thousand ten thousand hits something like that yeah so you know a good amount for sure but um yeah and again I love that as just another data point from my perspective that's why I was like Hey use the new stuff make you feel more inviting like make it feel more exciting for people to see it to because I want to you know continue to lead to perpetuate it but again Rob's getting triggered now by the way this is him working on that trigger of not getting angry yeah I was talking to somebody yesterday about triggers they were like they're like man he just pushes my buttons and I was like dude you're like a Blackberry you're just covered in buttons I was like you the problem is not that he push a button you've got so many buttons to push like you want to be an iPhone no buttons nothing to push what can someone do to you now you're unstoppable okay and it's possible for everybody to get there awesome well we appreciate this dude uh last time maybe video and audio had like half a million views I have feeling this is gonna uh crush it so we appreciate you okay till we meet again till we meet again see you guys thank you foreign

so so that was the other thing that sparked drama now you've got leaked phone calls you got the CEO calling a guy crazy he said she said and so that raised the profile of what was otherwise kind of a small thing as the thing on Reddit small things could turn into big things that's like part of the beauty of Reddit and that's what was happening here dude all right first of all your energy is gonna be psyched this is a this is a great story because I have a little more for you here are you ready this is the part that that's the background okay now let me give you some foreground right let me give you a little future future play here okay foreplay that's okay [Music] all right what's up we're here um dude have you seen this Reddit Revolt that's happening are you aware of this I am aware of it and uh is it gonna matter really so basically what happened is there's this app called Apollo right Apollo yep here's kind of the I would say the zoomed out version of the story so what's happening today is If you go to Reddit right now the whole site is down so they broke all of Reddit what they were trying to do was just a bunch of subreddits of these communities on Reddit were trying to protest some new Reddit policies so it started with a few of them that said you know what we disagree with this policy change that's going on you know we're going to do this 48-hour blackout we're going to go to private we're gonna go dark and they called it Reddit go this suburb it's going dark and more and more started joining to the point where 7 000 subreddits including some of the biggest ones on there like r slash funny and r slash picks and stuff like that and I believe that's 30 of Reddit that's what I read yeah it's basically it's a huge amount like uh you know this there's there's this couple of cool websites that you can go to in fact uh we should go to to one of them right now so um go to this site so it's red dark so red dark dot untone.uk very strange site but uh you can see in real time this thing's almost like this this tool is even almost broken because so many are going dark at the same time uh and Ben if you could share your screen so it says 7240 out of seven thousand eight hundred and six that's like 90 or something right 740 out of seven eight oh six ninety three percent of subreddits have gone dark um which is just an insane number and if you do it you can if you click the large thing there's like a live of feed it'll be like um animals with jobs has just gone private 5 000 members music music uh hoarder has gone private 5 000 members um crusty Windows has gone private and they just see like in real time and I've been watching this since yesterday it's crazy when I when I opened this up yesterday it was at 2000 and now it's basically all of them it's 7 000 out of out of 7 200 out of 7 800. so almost every subreddit has decided to join this protest and so you say well what's the policy what's so bad and what happened is Reddit wants to IPO so Reddit wants to go public in the future Reddit is not currently profitable they make about I don't know somewhere between 400 500 million dollars a year roughly and um they're still not profitable and these apps that other people have made called third-party apps were just used to like you could browse Reddit and they built like special features into them that made them maybe easier to use for certain types of people power users or moderators things like that so that's why people loved Apollo is because they had some power user features that were great for moderators and the Reddit made the mistake of not they were thought they were picking on Apollo but in fact they were pissing off moderators and that was a really really big issue and I'll tell you why in a second so Reddit goes and says hey look we can't keep giving these third-party apps full access to Reddit this has a couple problems first they're hitting our servers with a bunch of requests that costs us he said what the CEO said was tens of millions per year in server requests the second thing is though server requests are now serving Reddit content onto someone else's app so that person could monetize their app and Reddit doesn't get a piece of that so they were like all right we want to cut costs we want to increase revenue and they had a third problem which was they didn't want their data going to all these different places because basically open Ai and chat GPT had the scraped Reddit was like one of the key sources to make chat gbt so good and Reddit kind of was asleep when they did the first scrape but now they're like oh no no no if any other AI company wants our data you're gonna pay us a huge amount of money for it so to do that they needed to to basically pay all the data they needed the data only to live inside their own their own walls so they upped their API pricing they basically said for every server request you do it's now going to be whatever 10 cents and uh a fake number but but the result was that a app like Apollo which is made by this basically this one dude who made it you know as a passion project at a college he would have to pay 20 something million dollars a year just to maintain Apollo and so he's like dude that's unfeasible like he's like I have uh 50 000 paying users they paid me 10 bucks a year so he's like I make 500k on this now I have to my costs are gonna in 30 days my costs are going to go to 2 million a month and he's like uh that obviously kills my app and it kills not just my app all of all the third party apps and reddit's answer was basically like shrug like you know all right well sucks to be you and um and then the way that they kind of responded well so wait hold on I want to ask you a question about how the word got out but first we had to get background here which is even though so I just looked it up Reddit is like the ninth most popular website in America and even it's like you know it's like when someone says uh no one you know says they use it well it's like uh you know no one goes to that restaurant anymore it's too crowded it's kind of like that so Reddit is basically an uh uh I don't even know how to describe but basically a hundred thousand plus forums all on one website and the reason why this matters is because each Forum which is called a subreddit and there's basically a subreddit on any topic you can ever imagine in most viral news in America or viral memes start at Reddit and it's subreddits are forums that are owned by volunteers so someone comes up with one and they create it and they run it and then they run it and I didn't realize how much autonomy they are giving given and the reason why this is poor is important is now like this has happened before apparently Reddit fired one woman named Victoria like eight years ago and she was a community moderator and everyone loved her and so all these other subreddit it Forum leaders like did the same thing but where they shut it down a little bit now the result of that was the CEO got fired they got two back then they got 200 000 people to sign a petition saying Ellen Powell needs to get fired and so she stepped down like I don't know a week later or days later after that happened so they you know they they do wield a lot of power they yield a ton about it so but here's what's crazy a Reddit doesn't make it that much money for how large it is if you look at the top 30 websites in America I bet you I I'm not researchers but I would make a bet that it's on the very very low end of Revenue or even value created per user per user and part of it's because people are Anonymous and redditors are typically horrible with clicking ads and things like that uh and the other part of it is that they're kind of in a weird way this guy Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian they created this company Reddit and it's amazing and their users own the platform a little bit and that's what we're seeing here is these people basically set their channels or set their subreddits to private so you can't access them so that's what's happening my question to you is when this guy will call him Apollo an Apollo guy announced that he was going to shut down his app how did he get word out that it happened and how did all these people rally around this well again the people that use this app were power users and so when he said hey guys you know here's what's going on and it actually happened in multiple steps so the reason this got so much heat is because it happened in multiple stages he said they announced the they announced that they were gonna update their pricing he's like hey we're gonna have to keep an eye out for this but I'm optimistic like I'm sure reddit's not gonna they're not gonna like just do something that doesn't make any sense and right it's like for sure for sure we're obviously gonna take this and take everybody's needs into account but we will have to update the pricing and he's like you know what that's reasonable I can't wait to hear back what you guys have in mind that was like post one and he shared that but where'd he share this he shared it on subred on Reddit or maybe in Apollo subreddit plus some others and so like the mods summary because again a lot of moderators like Apollo and because it helps them do their job faster um because these guys they're subreddit owners make money no they make nothing so Reddit has this huge Fleet like of the moderators that are in the dark one I think right now there's 28 million moderators I think that was the number um that are that are like participating in this some some insane number let me see uh I had a subreddit it was called like apartment hacks and I was like trying to get people and it very quickly got like a thousand people but I I quit working on it so I got the number wrong 28 000 moderators on the 7 000 subreddits so that are participating in the in the in the blackout basically so these moderators basically they're constantly fighting spam so when you have a site that's as popular as Reddit there's a huge amount of people that are trying to get you to buy their crap that are trying to get you to subscribe to their only fans that are trying to get you to click this link and install this virus and or just doing clickbait like just making it where they post something super outrageous just to get clicks and engagement upvotes in a big battle in the comments but then it kind of turns off people who were there for like you know they wanted they wanted the entertainment without it getting ruined without the party getting ruined and so the moderators with the people that were keeping this house party working where it's like yeah we want people to come here and have fun but no dude you can't bring 17 kegs in here no you can't just come here and flyer your own party inside my house like no no you can't do all that crap and they're fighting this constantly and they do it as a giant unpaid thing now what they pointed out during this protest very reasonably was that dude where red is one of the only networks that's all run by unpaid volunteer moderators so for example Facebook has a huge moderation program they spent about 200 or 300 million dollars a year just on moderate content moderation Twitter spends a bunch of money on content moderation um and so content moderation can be a very big cost center it's of the moderators are like hey you're trying to save 10 million dollars by shutting off these third-party apps have you thought about what happens when we stop doing all this free work and like now you have to pay for Content moderation or this whole site goes to [ __ ] like uh what's gonna happen then maybe you should listen to us and so that's the that's where this is escalated to but I'll but just to finish the story so he goes he said he says up front Okay Reddit announces change it's going to affect us but hopefully it's all good and some people in the comments were like dude you're being naive these corporations are they're like just like Twitter killed all the third party clients reddit's gonna do the same these guys want to go public they're going to want to own all they're going to want to you own the user experience for all all users of Reddit they're gonna kill you and he's like no no no they've they said like you know they said they're gonna be fair okay a couple months later it comes out and they're like here's the pricing it kills you and it takes into effect in 30 days and he's like what like First of all ridiculous pricing second of all 30 days like I couldn't possibly try to like change my app to maybe make less requests to your server or like I couldn't do anything in 30 days like you're just gonna kill my whole business and I took yearly subscriptions so I'm not only on my app gonna die I'm gonna have to refund like 250k to people who paid for a Year's subscription because my app's no longer going to work so he was in a world of trouble so he contacts Reddit and he does a call with the team from Reddit and he records the call and after the call you can you can you're allowed to do that in some states but not in every state did he do it the right way dude a neckbeard nation it's all good baby it's uh it's all legal you're the little guy fighting the big guy you can do whatever you want yeah and so so he uh at first he doesn't do anything with it then Reddit comes out and says this guy's crazy he's making outlandish claims he tried to extort us for he asked for 10 million dollars um in order to like keep supporting the app we can't do business with this crazy guy and they basically like kind of like just you know slandered him a little bit and he's like what are you talking about that's not what I said and what do you what did I say that was so outrageous he's like here's the recording people can listen to it themselves and decide oh man did you listen to it I even listen to the whole thing but there's a part in there where he's like look like did you sound reasonable yeah he sounds reasonable he's basically like look um you know obviously I'd love to just keep going independent but you guys are saying it's too expensive you want to raise pricing that makes it untenable for me but people like this app and they're going to be upset when this app goes down he's like you know you guys bought Alien Blue Back in the day and you made that the Reddit app like have you considered just buying this app so that you can like you don't have to pay for all these extra you know it's not some external part of you that you guys but at least it lives on and like it's a win-win solution potentially for for all of us and so he was like you know um he said something like you're saying this cost you this will cost me 20 million a year you're saying this costs you tens of millions a year like you could buy the whole thing for 10 million dollars and that's you know six months of my operating costs and you know like it could work out that way and um Steve Huffman on the call is like look like you know I don't I don't appreciate the threat type of thing he says something about like that's a threat he goes wait what's a what's a threat what do you mean because the guy said something like he goes um uh you know if if you don't want all that like all this noise about this like you could just do this and he kind of took it as a threat like oh you're threatening you're gonna make a bunch of noise if we don't pay you 10 million dollars it goes no no I'm saying um we have like you're saying I'm making too many API calls so if you don't want all this server noise for the API requests you could just own it and just use your internal systems to do it instead and he's like oh sorry like okay my bad uh I didn't realize you're talking about API requests like I apologize I didn't mean to like say that you were threatening us you're saying okay no problem like I just want to like glad we're clear on that then later he comes out and says he threatened us he's like dude even on the call you apologize saying saying uh sorry I misunderstood you and then you took that out of context and tried to make me sound like a guy who's trying to profit out of this um or like trying to make unreasonable requests so anyways that cross so so that was the other thing that sparked drama now you've got leaked phone calls you got the CEO calling a guy crazy he said she said and so that raised the profile of what was otherwise kind of a small thing as the thing on Reddit small things could turn into big things that's like part of the beauty of Reddit and that's what was happening here dude all right first of all your energy is gonna be sight this is a this is a great story because I have a little more for you here are you ready this is the part that that's the background okay now let me give you some foreground right let me give you a little future future play here okay so four four play um so Reddit may have forgot but this is how Reddit started so Reddit started because the the popular Forum side of the day dig made this big update and everybody hated it and dig said screw you guys this is better and they said see ya and they went to this little site called Reddit and Reddit blew up and that's how Reddit became what it is is that the Dig fumbled the ball released this anti you know this this anti-user update and they usually they're sticking it to the man yeah I stuck it to the Man well who's to say that doesn't happen again so I have a little proposal uh somebody should run with this idea I bought this domain and I think somebody should do this if not you know this is what I would do if I was uh if I was a little little younger and hungrier than I am today so here's what I think somebody should do I think that was the perfect time the younger you the equally conniving just a little bit more ambitious you my T levels were a little higher back there yeah I'm a mellowed out dad now you know my daughter paints my toenails I can't be doing all this kind of stuff yeah if you if you woke up at 10 A.M this morning and you wear a hoodie all the time you know this is for you neckbeard Nation this is the call out okay so I want you to just check out this little website here so Sam I don't know if you know what uh the CEO Steve's um handle is on on Reddit do you know what his his username is I used to yeah if you said it I would remember it dark something uh was it so SP easy and so I don't know I just woke up this morning 6 a.m and I just looked at GoDaddy and I just saw that specialist.com was available and I thought huh one cent for spezless.com so I bought it I said what's specialist I think it's it's Reddit without spez would you like Reddit without Steve well here's what we're gonna do well we're gonna make a Reddit that's very very very very very very similar look into this website but with one difference there's there's no steam there's no Corporation that's gonna dude the tagline needs to be same same but different same same for different exactly same same but different exactly so here's uh Ben threw this up while we were talking because I gave him a rant this morning I was like dude here's what someone should do and I think he just bought he told me right before we went on there he goes I'm gonna buy the domain I'm gonna put it up so he goes um it says I love Reddit I just don't like don't like spez uh somebody create a newsletter new Reddit it's called specialist it's read it without Steve uh here's the master plan it'll be very very very similar website to Reddit um it's going to be a non-profit and any Revenue that it makes will get funneled back into the communities or moderators um because this blackout like this this 48-hour protest that they said it's cool it's gonna get headlines but Reddit really doesn't care they're gonna lose about three million dollars by being down for two days and then they're just gonna move on with life and the the protesters made a big error which is they said how long they would protest for they said the pain will stop at 48 hours so all red has to do is just ignore it for 48 hours uh they're gonna keep doing what they want so when you're when your voice doesn't work you gotta exit and uh so here's here's a little little exit boat for you it's uh it's basically Reddit without the [ __ ] and um there's a little email signup box so if a million people sign up then uh who knows maybe we can create something here and so you know why do this as a non-profit your voice already rich we don't need it we don't need to make a profit on this we just create this for fun because it's fun to to see something burned down I don't even have a problem with CFO by the way I think he's you know I like Steve smart guy uh I think he's he's fair in his opinion but also this is the internet and in the internet you you really gotta know who you're pissing off and I think he's pissed off too many people with this move I can't believe that nobody's making the alternative to this uh the people that are trying to make Alternatives they're all trying to do it so different you don't want to do different it needs to look almost exactly the same change the shade of red by like two hex you know like little hex color over to the right and then uh it needs to be the same site with the same structure everything's the same except for who decides what happens so how the money flows and if you just change that you could do this as a non-profit thing and I think it would be uh very entertaining in lieu of your morning cup of coffee this morning you had a cup of rage and I and I and I dig it dudes first of all a few beautiful things neckbeard nation that was nice right that's our new that's our fan base so we hired this woman to help us with some T-shirts if she's listening uh she dude this lady but hilarious hilarious thing you did so listen to this this woman this woman sent me this beautiful uh remember you say the whole thing what does she do so you get something in the mail I get this thing in the mail and it's like this beautiful like 10 or 20 Page outline it's clever and it says what she's going to do for us to make t-shirts is it beautiful it looks like a giant giant PowerPoint deck that was just printed out because she knows like he might not click the link so let me just print the PowerPoint out on white and black you know paper and just put it in an envelope for him it's beautiful like when you see like a netbeard guy doing very neck beard thing where you're like I'm just happy this exists this is a beautiful display in that it's a beautiful it wasn't physically beautiful but it was very it was it was very clever and she said you can reach me at my first thought at gmail.com or something like that or yeah right yeah t-h-o-t thought which stands for that hoe over there and or she said you can just DM me on my first thought and so I talked to her and I was like this is awesome let's do something we'll work together it worked I email her with you on the line and I go I think I said dearesta or come on and she was like great I mean by the way uh you should look up my thought means and I was like I know what it means I thought that you you said it wanted to because yeah you said it first to be that was your Twitter handle I don't I'm not trying to disrespect you you said it not me I'm just repeating I'm just playing the game here by the way the funniest thing is you go all right thought let's do this yes and she was like I don't think you know what thought means otherwise you wouldn't have called me that she goes LMAO at being addressed as my first thought in your email Urban Dictionary below for your amusement yeah and I immediately replied I was like I'm sorry I thought I thought I thought this was a [ __ ] uh you're right I'll call you your real name my apologies so we didn't get off to the doctor a great start right away all right let's do this so dear thought we're gonna uh this is why we only have four female listeners because this type of behavior I was trying to I I you know I was trying to relate I was trying to like show that I read yeah it didn't work out well yeah it's like when you hear hear someone call their friend they're like yo Nikki and you're like what's up Nikki and they're like it's Nicholas okay just because he uh I was in uh LA this weekend and I went to like the La Tech week saying we went to this event and there was like 300 people and I'm not exaggerating I had 30 people of like the 300 people come up to me and like say like hey love MFM I'm a total man and so two episodes ago or one episodes ago Sean came up with this idea of this total man we got a lot of flack for it I don't know if you saw it but people loved it in general and I had literally 20 or 30 people like in a row come up be like dude I'm the total Man by the way you're doing it wrong it's not total man with like a space in between because then it's like yo I'm I'm the total man it's I'm a total man it's like one word it's like it's a it's a thing you're a noun it's a different type of noun you got you got you know mammals you got humans and you got total man it's just like a separate species get rid of the space it's cleaner I got you yeah and uh so total man that that that's a hit I think neckbeard Nation with you being the mayor I mean that or you being the president that that that's that's our new that's the new thing we did it we got a new thing uh yeah totally agree um question which side are you on I think I'm team Reddit on this one but they screwed up they shouldn't have done it this way in the first place uh you know their Venture Capital company they've got hundreds of employees probably thousands at this point they they fumbled the bag here not on the pr press or PR front which they did but like letting this get out of hand the way it has in the first place I mean you gotta you gotta pay the bills why are they what are they doing letting people build build the stuff on on their land right you know what I mean yeah I I get where they're coming from I think they uh like many tech companies fumbled the communication and execution um but I'm also horrid at that so you know I would have done this twice as bad if I was in their position because I'm always like I'm a very much ripped ended off type of person and also like because I'm very far on the spectrum of not easily offended like it takes a lot to make me feel like mad or upset I severely underestimate how easily I can make other people mad or upset and so uh I I get their position um I think you know most likely unless unless Bezos becomes a thing they're just gonna be like cool nice protest we hear you we'll take you into account in the future continue using Reddit you know like life will just go on and nothing bad will happen from this unless literally somebody seizes The Narrative that's the thing there's a narrative right now and somebody could come in and they could surf that momentum on the narrative though we are the thing that's hard Uber had the same thing do you remember when it was trending delete Uber like I think these things come and go like this happened in the crypto World crypto world is like the most like ruthless it's like just like knife fighting in the streets and so openc had some policy issue or some change I don't remember what it was it was like fee change or something why did it get people get mad at Open Sea when they I forget what it was they changed something yeah they changed like the royalty take rate or something where's podcasting etiquette ever to ask the guy in the room who's sitting like 10 feet behind you with no mic or headphones to ask him have you seen Joe Rogan Joe Rogan does it anyone can do it um so basically open C which was the big nft Marketplace by far the dominant 100 market share type of thing um change something in their policy people didn't like it and literally like in like a 48 hour period somebody spun up a competitor and they did what was called a vampire attack which was they in crypto you could do this thing where you could be like okay who are all the Wallets on that use openc I can find them they're all public that I can airdrop them tokens that say if you come over to our platform and claim them create your account here you get free tokens and people are like token might be worth something and so they just like they basically like vampire attack they just suck the blood out of one network to another and this happened several times in crypto where they've basically tried to do this now it's not always 100 successful but to go from you didn't even exist to like a million to two million users with like a shot at hey if you deliver a dope user experience you know this can work you know that's like better than nothing and so in crypto this has happened a couple times a couple of the like defy tools have had this app before oh we don't like your policy we're gonna Fork your source code rename it and uh we're gonna incentivize all the major players on yours to come over here and get like a bonus token if they if they come claim their thing here which builds the momentum in the narrative well I don't I mean like your energy I don't know how to like one-up you here uh you know like they say when you're like supposed to like meet people you're supposed to match their energy uh to like make them feel comfortable I don't know what to say I don't feel like I feel like I feel like we're going to a monster truck rally like Sunday Sunday like you're a Gravedigger right now I'm just in the stands trying to keep up with ear plugs you know what I mean but they said they said that's so awful how do you even remember or know that that's like they're radio ads right yeah Monster Jam have you been to a monster truck rally in the last 700 days is the pope Catholic of course I have yeah I would go to monster truck all the time I've gone like five or six times dude they do backflips now I'm not not gonna go see a big ass truck do a backflip um all right let me talk to you about something that you actually are know more than me about I think because you're friends with them yeah and then I want to talk about that's a lot of stuff okay I want to talk about the second thing about milk Road and and nothing and we'll leave time for that so uh turpentine is that what it's called the turpentine big time yeah uh so basically this guy named Eric tornberg he's been in the game for a while he's just done a bunch of stuff on the internet including founding a company called on Deck he launched this new thing called turpentine it was very nice he gave us a little shout out uh but basically what I believe it to be is just a podcast Network for business content particularly some type of like startup B related stuff so there's like one on media yeah yeah Tech there's one on media I think there's one on on fintech a few other things and he announced it have you seen this what what am I missing yeah I've seen this uh so Eric tornberg's behind this Eric's awesome guy um did he talk to you about this before he did it because I feel like if I was going to do something like this you're my phone a friend right no you didn't talk to me you're my phone a friend on that I've never talked to him oh you never talk so you don't know each other that well okay gotcha um because he's on our like friend group I guess um okay so I'm curious what your take is on this because I think you know a lot about this I have a strong opinion but I want you to explain it I mean I think you said it well he's trying to create like what uh I would say the easiest analog is like the ringer so the ringer was started by Bill Simmons so kind of like famous notable guy in the in the sports journalism landscape basically was like I'm gonna create a network of sports podcasts I'll have my show I'll have this guy do NBA I'll have this guy do NFL I'll have this guy do um you know pop culture I'll have this guy do whatever and so they created a network of podcasts ended up selling it to Spotify for a few hundred million dollars 200 200 something million dollars and um really that was mostly because Bill had the number one sports podcast and he's like very influential in Spotify had a strategy there so um Eric's trying to do that for Tech so he's like how do I be the ringer or how do I be Barstool but for the tech industry can I basically create uh like intellectual entertaining but also highly intellectual conversations about things that people care about um in Tech and then he's looking for shows so like basically if we were you know not the badasses that we were we could be like hey let's join turbo time we're gonna get their back office we're gonna get them helping us sell ads we're gonna get like you know help with production and we'll get cross-promoted um amongst um you know their their Network it's very similar to like work week which we've talked about on here before or group's doing this kind of with like newsletters and um turpentine is trying to do this with uh podcast plus newsletters plus other things that's kind of the thing it says his tagline is where experts talk so it's a network podcast covering Tech business culture and trans that are driving the future and he's got I think three or four shows right now oh looks like maybe five three that he's doing and then uh a couple that other people are doing but they're all like very like fancy schmancy like the cognitive Revolution um you know media Empires Moment of Zen and so they're they're kind of like I would say highbrow compared to what most podcasts are yeah so here's my opinion um I don't think anyone that you mentioned or anyone out there is really doing it perfectly but this is beautifully done uh you go to his website wow I thought you were going to be anti you're pretty anti-most media things no oh no it's gonna come it's gonna come uh you're doing you're doing that sandwich thing yeah yeah [Laughter] sandwiches always have it's not it's not I love your logo hate everything else like a sandwich is not meat cheese bread it's bread meat cheese bread okay you gotta it begins at it and it ends with that no I I do like it so here's the thing about these companies I think if he doesn't raise money I think it's awesome I think so long as he doesn't raise money I think this could be really really cool I think owning this outright is amazing I think that's really cool I think when I go to his website I think he borderline like if it was done a little bit the other way it would be really douchey but the way that he's done it it's actually quite awesome like for example he quotes Pablo Picasso and you know that could go either way that can go either way he went the right way I think when you go to the website I think the name is nice it's all like pretty slick it's upscale it actually looks really good I think that if you if you if you did that a little bit differently it would not work but he's done like what's the what's the quote for Pablo Picasso on there do you see it uh yeah it says when art critics to get together they talk about form and structure and meaning when artists get together they talk about where you can buy cheap turpentine cool I think that's cool I think it's cool and it's got a nice little picture of Pablo I think it's awesome yeah uh dude so on my next company I'm gonna get a quote from Benny Blanco it's Pablo Picasso I'm ready Blanco we can do Bugs Bunny next too I mean I think it's good man I think it's good branding so my opinion is I think it's cool if you own it I think it's cool if so I don't know if you know this you probably don't because who cares but business insiders writer the writers are on strike do you know that yes well a lot of like isn't Hollywood also on strike right now I think they're totally unrelated other than maybe they inspired each other I think there was like a contract up and uh Insider formed at Union or something like that and they are protesting and they're doing this thing called a digital PICC line I guess it's called where a digital picket line where they're like telling all the customers like not to click on Business Insider links now uh which is crazy I mean someone who follows a Business Insider journalist is probably not also someone reading Business Insider I would imagine so I I don't know if that's gonna go well but if you have to if so if you're gonna start a media company I think you have to be incredibly careful not to hire folks who will unionize I think that is actually an existential crisis to a lot of media companies right now um and I think that's like a real so if you're so here's the takeaways I think a it's awesome so you're going to do this I think it's cool I think you should own the whole thing B look out for Union types C him going B to B that's 100 the way to go and I want to give you an example but is this B2B I don't think this is B2B what makes you say this I think he just has uh I think he has uh probably he's probably going for like high-end customers more so than b to B right yeah but your ad sales people can spend that nicely to Salesforce uh like it's not like True Crime you know what I mean it's borderline it's kissing cousins with the with the B2B uh real B2B it's close but let me give you an example of a real b2b1 yeah it's Bish um have you heard by the way did you see that guy who's gonna getting in trouble his name is George Santos he's like clearly I think he's like from South America but he was um I'm gonna butcher it but he was some type of elected official out of Long Island and uh he's getting in trouble because he did a bunch of fraudish stuff I think but one thing that's funny is he told everyone he was Jewish and he goes well I didn't say I was Jewish I said I was Jewish like I'm friends with the Jews I was Jew itch like you know like uh I'm buddies with them have you not seen it yet all time all time excuse he like stole 500 000 so he's actually a crook but like the funniest part he goes I'm Jewish and you look at him and he's uh uh like from Brazil or something like what uh so that's pretty funny but uh anyway I think that instead of going B to be ish you gotta go all the way I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better have you heard of Aging media no okay so type in aging media it started by this guy named John John's a member of Hampton but everything I'm actually about to say I just kind of stole from a similar web but I have heard some rumors about them but basically if you go to aging media what's what what's the uh you've been on his Hampton application we're here to write his Revenue profits uh names of all his children and social security number you may you may have some info on this please I just clicked similar web on their site no info so I know you ain't getting [ __ ] from similar web right now oh yeah yeah so here's why here's I'm gonna explain it to you but you know listen aging media is their like corporate website so what's it say they have like their brands like senior housing news hospice news skilled nursing news that sort of thing those happen so what what what's the what's that meta tag on there is it like uh nursing home profession or yeah media for the senior care industry yeah so click like one of their websites and you can go to similar web each website only has something like 50 000 visits I believe it's like it's like not a lot but they're doing something like 12 or 11 million dollars a year Revenue and like three or four million dollars a year in profit and this is a B2B hardcore B2B site they make their money through Legion so basically I imagine they'll do like a webinar or something and if you like are in the nursing home industry you give them information they also have ads and I think I don't know if I have podcasts but they do have newsletters on their site this is a hardcore B2B this is yeah and I love it I love it I love this you just did this guy such a disservice by seeking for for four to forty copycats on them if I'm talking about how you know business this is on here well no so like the idea listen to this podcast so like if Sam or Shawn say the n-word I don't mean the n-word I mean newsletters if they say this is a good newsletter business the instant copy cop hats bro they're instantly looking for a new newsletter to club no no no I apologize and on behalf of whoever this guy is in the Hampton I go hey don't tell me anything but it just can I talk about your company and I I said here's what I see on similar way he didn't know what he was saying yes to no hey I got permission I go here's here's what I see on similar web this is what I'm gonna say are you cool with it and he gave me a thumbs up like literally a thumbs up emoji that's how I roll I get that emoji we're good um That's a hardcore B2B media company so anyway my point with this turpentine thing I think it's cool I like it I think it's cool I hope he pulls it off I've thought about doing this idea actually in the past I ruled it out for a bunch of reasons but that doesn't mean it doesn't mean somebody else can't do it I think I think it'd be great to do it takes a lot of energy and I'm totally with you that I hope you didn't raise money he's in his tweet thing uh announcing it he didn't he didn't say like so happy to have Marc Anthony recent investing in this so so I think there is uh I think there's probably a good chance he raised money but he didn't raise okay he didn't raise money so so I hope he is taking it that way well you probably learned from uh from his other company on Deck like that's another company where I think they raised a hundred plus million I forget but I think the valuation was 500 million dollars so I don't know how much they raised but I imagine it was the United figures that's another company where it's like that could be cool if you don't raise money basically screwing up your cap table is like one of the only mistakes in business that you can't really make up for um speaking of screwing up your money can I tell you what I did post milk road with the with the money that we made well I do know that you sent me a text I I have to go look at when that came and you said I've sold all my equities I think it's gonna go to the I think the Market's going down and since then do you've it's double it's about double yeah a lot of so I know you did that with your money so what else did you say sorry about my next best decision yeah what else did he do besides not make money off your money for the record for the record uh I've actually I would be about even from where I was with my equities on that because I kept well I kept a portion of it but I also uh the stuff I sold has not doubled you just look at HubSpot stock because you're like I got upside so you're like HubSpot is the market how's that is not the market exactly so uh so I'll tell you that so let me um let me tell you about what I did so we got this money so we sell milk Road now this cash hitting a bank account got a couple options so it's like do we just buy treasury bills make four percent on that uh what bank do you use what bank did I use what do you mean you use a Chase or one of the other ones security breach I'm not there's no upside and answer this question did you use one of the ones you you were using one of the ones that got screwed up no no no I didn't use Silicon Valley Bank no so money's sitting there as I could buy treasury bills uh no that's too boring um could do what Sam does I could just index into the stock market oh that's reasonable but like you know I think uh seems like we're coming off of a of a 13 year old bull market um don't really need to to put this the full amount in right now let me just kind of wait and see what happens there is there something is there something that can do better than the eight percent uh that I might be able to get on that I thought well should I just invest it in a new company we start uh I don't know maybe if we have a great idea we'll do that but but let me just let me not do that and so I started doing this process where I was like can I I work backwards so basically like can I get 30 a year compounding and 30 a year sounds like a high number but we have a few friends who have done it and the way that they've done it has been through buying private companies so they buy businesses and they own Andrew Wilkinson I think is the one that most people who listen to this pod will know because he's been on a bunch of times and talked about this how they built Tiny from a few million dollars into you know 500 million dollars by doing this sort of 30 40 compounding over over time the uh tiny annual report we'll have to talk about it next time yeah I I read this into a letter um yeah so so and we have a few other friends that have been doing this as well uh that are less public about it so I said okay well let me do that I said but I don't want to buy these companies and operate them so I thought what if I bought 30 Stakes so sort of like uh can I buy a minority position in companies so that they keep running them but I give them Capital so basically like the founder oftentimes was like not taking a lot off the table or they were kind of always worried like should I put this in my pocket and spend this well I don't know what if the company needs it um even if a profitable they were kind of worried about that so say here let me give him some money and then could I help them grow and so I went through this exercise I don't think I've told you about any of these but I talked to about 25 companies in the last I want to say six months to every company that you talk to DMS me and they say something of a variety of I was talking to Sean and now we're not talking anymore but they like they like messaged me to like talk to you and I just ignore it yeah you're like the wing man who refuses to win you you don't have to tell me which companies I already know probably half of them my funnel was this I was just doing a review of this I thought it was kind of interesting so talk to about 20 24 companies I think um got serious I like did like did diligence I would say talk to means like uh talk to me it's like I was interested you know obviously we looked at a little bit more than that but talk to was like oh this could be interesting maybe you could kind of squint and see a possibility then got into kind of like more serious talks and either negotiated numbers or diligence with about nine uh got to a Loi stage with three or four and ended up doing one deal and the last I want to say six months post uh post sale and so this ranged from everything from um so newsletter businesses only fans businesses Journal apps virtual events bookkeeping companies merch companies and then a bunch of random stuff that I know nothing about that were like oh that sounds interesting like uh some company that like does something called laser peening on machines to make the parts last longer and their clients are like bowing and stuff like that or um autism clinics that seem to make a ton of money but I'm like okay I don't really know how I would add any value to this and uh in each one I was like all right can I find a good operator where I can acquire minority stake of the business at a good deal and I could help them grow and ideally they're the category winner for for what they do and so that was kind of like my process I want to before I tell you about the deal that we ended up doing I want to hear any uh any thoughts or questions on my my Approach here because there's a bunch of learnings yeah there's no way you're gonna get 30 for that long right do you actually think that's possible what do you mean for that long that long between I don't I mean I don't know anything about markets I haven't read like a Warren Buffett biography but like what's he compound at every year oh oh okay yeah he's been at 20 for like 50 years or something okay but if he but if you got it he's putting billions and billions of dollars to work and uh that's very different right okay I think that's smart do you think you're gonna enjoy this I think you'll enjoy it right I'm not sure so this was a test basically to see like is this fun to do it's definitely fun on the learning side uh now that we made the first acquisition or the first I kind of I would say not an acquisition like kind of minority investment um and it's different than startups like we've done startup investing startup investing is very very different startup investing is you look at a business you're trying to figure out is this are these three dudes in this bedroom gonna be able to build like a multi-billion dollar company right like is this husband and wife couple going to be able to pull off this this gargantuan exit and like kind of right now they have usually nothing just an idea a product maybe a little bit it's way more of a lottery it's a lottery and you put put in a hundred thousand dollars and then you do that with 40 companies and you know that 38 of the companies are going to be kind of like just a write-off or cost of doing business and two or three of those those 30 or 40 companies are going to be your winners but hopefully they're winning at 100x or a thousand Acts or more uh returns and so it's very Lottery like and you you spend very little time with them so you're not like um they don't want you advising them you answer questions when they call you could proactively nudge them a little bit but you're mostly hands off I would say Angel Investing whereas if you buy 15 20 25 30 of a business uh you're a little more involved um you know you care a little more active these businesses are not like All or Nothing businesses they're like oh this is already a good business it's profitable and it's already growing so the question is can we accelerate the growth right so like the one business we bought is I don't know super profitable it makes millions of dollars a year in profits it's uh you know more than 50 margins and um you know we were able to buy a piece of that and I think that uh that's just so different than every startup investment I had ever done you know it's probably not going to become a multi-billion Dollar business I would almost guarantee that but it doesn't need to it's not supposed to it's a cash flow business and so isn't it funny how you have mocked me for like the last eight years about my slow and steady approach and now you're you know look you're still at first it was like laughing at eight percent I'm going for 10x every year or whatever right now it's it's coming down now 30 is really attractive which I agree that is really attractive before you know it you're gonna say no dude that's that's not true even in a startup fund even when you have your winners that become billion dollar companies the overall fund like a great fund is doing 30 irr or twenty percent it's still the same boring no it's not I I reject that I reject that premise I would say you used to make a live streaming app and now you're looking at uh a company that sells parts to Boeing but cash flow is always interesting it's always been interesting um and now it's more interesting than it was in the past I really didn't I really didn't have a lot of exposure to these types of business I lived in San Francisco you say cash flow and people think you're talking about like you know like a leaky faucet like nobody knows what the hell the hell that means and so uh once I just started doing this podcast we got a lot more exposure to like most people listen to this podcast are entrepreneurs all around the world and so when they reach out about their business it's like oh this guy in Minnesota with this you know marketing agency that does this per year or this person sells parts and this person does whatever uh you know they're rolling up bookkeeping services and so you you learn about different types of businesses more through this and uh so I've been getting my like MBA on on non-silicon Valley businesses look the cool thing is is that you know we research stuff and like if I really dive deep into a topic I'll research it for eight hours and I that's not enough to make an investment but it's enough that I say to myself oh wow this space is really intriguing you know I could see myself doing this you're doing that but instead of eight hours you're doing weeks and so It's oddly in the similar vein a bit uh of course you have to do more due diligence and actually look at the numbers and get to know the people but yeah it's like getting used to the space so the most interesting thing is what happened between the four deals that we signed Lois on and the one that we closed and I'll try to do this without giving away any info about the companies that we didn't do the deal with uh I could talk about the one we did but I can't talk about the one we didn't um but the things I though the reasons that the mistakes that we were making along the way here's here's trap number one that we already experienced um I can fix him like the classic girlfriend mistake like yeah he you know he sucks but maybe I could fix him it's basically like maybe I can fix this business and when you do this minority investing you're not the majority you're not going to be able to fix anything and so that was uh you know trap number one was getting really far down the road with the business that I thought had a ton of potential but for finally realizing I'm not going to be the one to fix it and fixing it is the wrong approach to doing going into a business like this that was mistake one mistake two was I can totally I can totally uh see this working but working at a small scale and so you have to remember basically like as you play the game it's kind of like this is how I felt about like your Airbnb which is like you do one Airbnb that's you basically can't do one Airbnb you can only do one as a test to see if you want to do a bunch one Airbnb is like a bunch of headache without the size of the prize being big enough and so we had looked at one business that was like yeah which is what I have by the way yeah yeah we all make this this mistake but I think you were at least looking at it the right way where you were like maybe I could do a bunch of these you talked to people that had 50 of these in their portfolio and you have to do one to know if you want to do 50. and so we got really far down the road with this one that like if it all worked it's like dude we could be making two hundred thousand dollars a year off this it's like wait what are we doing what why are we doing this like yeah it's a great deal and it's highly likely to work but it's highly likely to be very small and like not worth the Mind share of even doing this and so we pulled out on that one the one that we did was basically uh a company people probably know so it was in a cat so this one was not are you gonna name it yeah yeah it's official so we first looked at the category so I was super bullish on companies that let you hire internationally so specifically like how to hire the Philippines and laddam and you know this why were you interested in that what inside like kind of scar tissue like dude you came to my office I remember you you came to my office in San Francisco when I was doing bibo and you're like what's your burn rate which again is like a question nobody asks somebody else out loud it's like you know that's like asking somebody that's asking a woman their weight like ask a Founder their burn rate and see how they feel in my head I was like that's bubbly you had a bubbly burn man and I was like three million a year and that's what we were we were basically a startup that was burning three million a year pre-product Market fit because that's what it cost we had we basically had a team of Engineers so we had like you know I don't know 10 a month a month 2004 I think we were doing like 240 000 a month in burnt so you get like and that's netburn does that mean no does that assume no Revenue um we had revenue from one of our projects but like no I was just saying like the overall bill so um so we basically you hire 10 people that are 200 000 each you're doing 2 million plus you pay rent plus you have your Cloud bills especially whatever else and uh so that was really expensive and those were all Silicon Valley engineers and they were below market so those people if they were working for us for 200k they could have been making 400 500k at Facebook but they wanted to be a part of a startup so I did that and it was very stressful to have a very high burn rate uh for a company like I just didn't like it but I didn't know any better at the time and then afterwards as I got a little more Savvy like with our Ecom biz we'll do probably somewhere but like a little under 20 million this year in Revenue uh were profitable because 65 of our team is overseas so we have our like our our data analysis person Argentina our designer India our customer service Philippines are the person who's running our whole wholesale Channel like built it from scratch it did not exist and now it's like a new Revenue unit in the Philippines and we did the same thing with milk road we were profitable milk Road from day one like I remember coming to your office at the hustle and you had like I don't know 15 people running around there in San Francisco and like that's a bunch of San Francisco issues they have to go home and pay six thousand dollar rent so you got to pay them money and for us we had one person in the US for milk Road and we had everybody else in the Philippines and so it was again lean mean profitable machine and I was like oh um not just is this cost savings like if you hire some of the Philippines they're basically 10 times cheaper than the US so like you know you can hire somebody in the Philippines for a thousand dollars a month so 12 000 in a year that same person the US will cost you 80 to 120k um and these are skilled people like in Latin like the guy we have doing our data stuff he's like he's got his MBA like they're these are Highly Educated highly you know he's like a wizard with like you know power bi and looker and all these like data tools that I couldn't even do you get to know yeah yeah of course I'm talking to them all the time the one good thing is especially with the Philippines uh this sounds terrible but I'm gonna say it anyways because it's honest um I hate managing people and I love hiring people in the Philippines because they need so little management like I uh why does that sound horrible what did I miss there because I think what people want is for you to be like I'm a good manager and I talk to my people and I'm like dude it's [ __ ] great I only talk like for example my assistant I only talked to her on Fridays I mean or like it's great they don't want one-on-ones and like career trajectory coaching and they don't want like like the same like in San Francisco I had let's say I have eight direct reports that's eight weekly one-on-ones I had to do yes well dude I've had that's essentially eight hours out of the 160 hours a week that you know that that I have that I'm like uh you know I'm spending doing basically like touchy-feely stuff which is fine I understand it but it's really nice when you don't have to do that because it's not the Baseline expectation there's a bunch of roles where you don't want someone who's entirely ambitious like with totally an assistant it's like you don't want someone that's like no I don't want to give you all these other opportunities I want you to be great at this thing and not bail like I don't this is what I need this is the tool that I need and I want you to be that I don't want to have to promote you tons and tons of times I've hired a couple of people uh for like our hold code basically um and they're they're cooled or they live in San Francisco they're awesome they're super motivated to work with me I'm like great what do you want like I want to be you out of like wait what and then I'm like cool like you know someday they're like yeah but I'm also spinning up my own newsletter my own podcast my own investment arm like I'm like okay well like that's great you could do that but you that makes for kind of a shitty person to hire onto my team because like part of being on this team is being down for our mission not like your own mission necessarily and I totally get if you want to go to your own mission but you got to go do that on your own don't get you don't get to have both um you know at the same exact time you can do one and get mentored for a bit and then go do your own but you can't do it at the exact same time and so it has been very nice to have people that are just like they CL like literally like our management style is they log in they say logging in here's what I'm doing today if you have any adjustments to you you say something if not you just don't say anything at the end they say long enough here's what I got done today here's everything I did here's the files here's the here's the info login off so how much are you spending you know on on these on these folks I mean dude I have like in my own companies probably almost 15 to 20 people that are international now and so and what's the average salary um it ranges so like on the low end uh 800 I think about it in months monthly because that's like when I push payroll that's what it says so like you know 800 a month would be the low end and that's how you'll say most common so that's a customer support personal assistant things like that could be that low and then uh the higher rolls will be like twenty five hundred to three thousand and then there's one guy who's just amazing and I've promoted him up twice now and now he gets paid like a US employee because he makes the impact of somebody who's like driving a ton of growth so I'm like oh great like you keep getting rewarded you're at some point you break break through where you're if you're driving growth you get rewarded for driving correct and you also I got an email you you have a course on this now too I have a course on the personal assistant side yeah I just created it's not even a course actually it's just uh I don't like I don't go and teach it it's just a system it's like yo basically the best hire I made this year was I hired my personal assistant and I had thought okay personal assistant is uh uh you know personal assistants like for rich people for like Mega it's like for Jeff Bezos it's like Mega busy make a rich and uh and also was like I don't wanna have to tell somebody what to do all the time like that sounds like its own pain in the ass to come up with [ __ ] to do and then I heard a few friends talk about theirs and I was like maybe I'm wrong let me open my mind to the possibility that I'm wrong about this three people tell me three people that I trust tell me that it's like been a huge game changer for them let me just send it to me I want to use it I basically created the whole thing last week and I was like here's my system so for example like here's my my email system like I used to be terrible with email and now my email system is like super organized on top of [ __ ] here's exactly what I do here's the exact scope of work here's how here's how it works I just texted Ben I go I said send it to me yeah uh and so and yeah by the way there's a like a a funny offer we did with it but I'll explain the copy that we ended up investing in so I looked at all the ways you could do this I've done all of them so you can hire direct if you want to hire somebody International you can basically have three options you hire direct so you hire somebody on like a job board upwork online job something like that upside it's basically free you just pay the software subscription like in our 99 bucks a month so you know you pay a thousand dollars for the year to be to be a pro member on there downside you have to do all the hiring vetting training sifting through candidates yourself like you put up hey I need a customer support person or a personal assistant you're gonna get 200 applications I'm like good luck trying to find somebody good um you could also go on the high end and use like a managed service so this is things like um growth assistant or Athena they're great they do the they do the vetting for you but there's this huge up charge so those guys charge you three grand a month for somebody that actually costs 800 a month so you're paying you're paying 3x the price or more every single month forever that's how big are those companies how big is Athena I heard they're huge they're big and they're big because this is like a huge ARR thing for them and people don't really know about it people don't really realize like you didn't have to pay triple the price every single month and so that's like you know One path and but they're good at what they do I've tried them yeah I've tried a bunch of these um the one I liked the best was the one we ended up investing in which is Shepard so people have probably heard of Shepard before I think the URL support shepard.com why like Shepherd was it's kind of best of both so they do the like filtering screening background checks all that stuff so basically you just say I want a personal assistant they present you three great candidates or they present you five great candidates for you and they're they're filtered they're checked and they're basically like these are the best of the best so they save you a [ __ ] ton of time which is like as any business owner you kind of need that and the other side you don't have to pay the monthly up charge so they'll say great here's you know you can make the hire directly and all you pay is the one-time finders fee for us having found you the candidate and so it ends up being you know 10 to 20 times cheaper than these other ones in the long run because you just paid you know the one-time finders fee so I like that model the best I was like long term I think this is the most sustainable because if I'm making in my business like I did 15 hires internationally I want I don't want to be paying like this bloated cost every month from there on out nor do I want to do that all that work myself so that was the business we ended up investing in um super excited the The Branding on their website so it's support shepherd.com yeah you have to be one of the testimonials you need a testy on there but uh it looks good it's cute branding uh so Marshall Haas is the guy who started it Marshall I've known Marshall since 2012 maybe he's the type of guy who whenever he does something it's awesome it looks cool uh so like if you follow him on Instagram on Twitter he's got Showmanship he's got Showmanship he's got the juice he's got the juice so whenever like for example I think he just bought a new house and I'm like following the bill about us he also like he likes cars so like I saw him like redecorate his garage he owns like a boutique hotel he did this like e-commerce thing that was like super simple and actually like a really good like you know a successful successful econ business that was just like it was like a phone case and like you know it was just that and like when Kobe came out they came out with this little like hook thing like your Captain Hook that was like you can use this to open doors without having to touch the knob like a peasant I was like dude this guy's great he just makes these like simple little businesses and he runs all the reason he did this is he ran his businesses using international hiring as his like Workforce so then he partnered with this guy in the Philippines opened up a office on the ground there with a bunch of recruiters to do all the vetting locally on the ground is he going to the Philippines his business partner lives there and is has the the office open there so that's like how you that you got to commit if you're going to do these types of things and so he basically partnered with the guy who's doing that and that's how they created Shepard and it started off just like you know solving their own Niche but turns out like a lot of people have have this itch and so and myself included so uh so if he I follow I I'm not used it but I will I will use it I I would like to use I'm literally I just texted Ben I really actually want your course I want to figure out how you do this because I want this and maybe I'll use these guys but if his business is going so well why would he sell a portion to you like my head is I'm greedy I'm like get the [ __ ] out of here because I mean obviously we're gonna drive him a little bit or a lot of bit of traffic in the Pod will is that the only reason why he would do this uh yeah basically they don't spend any money on marketing um at all and so the way that it spreads is just Word of Mouth people coming back and then the other one is like entrepreneurs who have an audience saying saying the word so they first did this with Mick uh Huber and Nick Nichols drove them a ton of business because Nick uses it uh for all of his businesses and so he when he talks about it they get a bunch of uh they get a bunch of traffic so I think he saw the success of that and um basically you know we have a large audience now like through Twitter through this pod through other things and so there's obviously a benefit of I don't know like the brand Association like as well as like you know the the ability to reach you know reach a large audience that I think was appealing to him and I bought in I didn't get free shares right like I bought I bought into the to the equity pool but I agree with you when you have a really good business you're always hesitant it has to be like the right fit and so I think the other benefit was he listens to the Pod and so he's seen you know if you listen to this you know how we think if you can agree be like this person's great or this person's an idiot you know if you want to if you would want to do business with them if you've listened to the Pod regularly you you have a very good idea there's no hiding our personalities on this do they have a MFM like coupon code is it coupon coupon so if you go to my website if you go to seanbury.com remote assistant basically here's what I got them to do which is better than a coupon thing so I was like all right if you want to do the personal assistant thing the way I did uh I was all right here's my systems 250 bucks you get the whole like all the templates all the thing or whatever but I was like um I only want to make money from people who don't take action and so here's here's how it works basically should just buy the course you don't actually hire an assistant I keep your money but if you actually go to Shepard and you hire your assistant then Shepard will give you 2x the money back so basically you pay 250 you'll get 500 if you actually take the action and go higher and I was like that's kind of a no-brainer offer I was like Marshall we got to do this like do this where if people want their own assistant and they actually go like take the action and go forward with it pay them back not just what they paid for the system pay them double because uh like I bet a bunch of people are just not gonna take action but who cares like I want the people who who will take action to be rewarded for doing so and so that's a pretty pretty sweet deal basically it's like a you essentially get my system for free plus you make an extra 250 if you uh if you actually go go forward with it and make your higher so first I want if you're into this [ __ ] I have no stake in this by the way uh but go to support Shepard I do want them to sign up because here's what I want I want you to report back and I want to hear if this whole influencer buys companies thing actually is good I wanna so I want I want the results to be reported back in like a month and so I am curious to see like what the demand is I bet it's gonna be quite good number two what I'm curious to see is if you like this uh I don't know if you're gonna like it or not I can see going at 50 50 either way so far how do you feel I mean look if this deal works then this is like the greatest thing I don't know this one is a no but that's not the hard part this is always easy this is already a successful company I'm already religious about hiring internationally anyways personally in my own businesses it's like I didn't have to be convinced that this is a good idea like I already knew there's a good idea the question was am I going to start my own of these or should I invest in one that's already working that I like that I use and it's like okay cool let me just do the second one that seems like way less work you know to do that so I think this one is kind of a no-brainer in that it's kind of a proven business I am a genuine believer in it and whether we actually drive extra traffic to them or not I think it's it's sort of like I don't know like obviously for them they want that then and I would like that too but for me it was already you say it was already what percentage are you is that too much to ask or to review yeah I want to disclose that here because I think you know it's their business I don't wanna I don't want to give that away too much but you know it's a it's a good chunk I think do you think they'll ever sell the company or do you make your money just through dividends yeah just dividends like it's a profitable business um it just pays out dividends like I got our first dividend check yesterday it's awesome you did you got one already yeah it was fantastic this is going to be your See's Candy maybe I mean if this works out that's exciting I'm curious to see if you're gonna like this because on one hand I could actually see you loving this because you get to spend time seeing how things work and you get to use your skill set which is content to tell people about it like this segment that we just did I'm actually interested I want to keep talking about this just because I want to hear the story about it I think that's interesting and so it's kind of a win-win in that regard but I'm curious if you're going to enjoy all the due diligence like when I talk to Andrew Wilkinson he actually I don't think does a lot of the due diligence he's got a team to do right if you are able to pull that off I think you'll be in a win situation um so as long as you like like doing that yeah I'm gonna try with two or three this one I knew was on a slam dunk because I'm just like just a total believer in it what's gonna be interesting is what happens with ones that aren't like perfectly in my zone of like I get it I used it I believe in it like it's like this one was like Bullseye I don't expect every business to be exactly Bullseye so the question is what happens when it's not exactly is it still fun do I still believe do I am I still willing to talk about it like this one I'm willing to talk about because I'm like I literally wouldn't have my econ business work the way it does or milk red worked the way it did if I didn't use this strategy so I'm like I could talk about that now what happens when it's like one degree separated from that am I still Gonna Wanna to tell a story on it maybe it's not even that interesting a story I'm not gonna do it like I'm not gonna come on this podcast and bore everybody with like a story that's not that great so I can't I can't commit to that yet but I don't know if somebody wants me to buy you know a minority taking their business hit me up let's see let's see what happens I'm gonna try two or three of these and see see how it goes was there anything uh that you learned looking at the 24 other than what you said about the uh like fix me [ __ ] like was there anything any other Revelations not necessarily about what they had wrong with them or but maybe what they had to write with them any commonalities between the winners yeah uh yeah definitely I would say that the um the businesses that I was most interested in were ones that had a clear um a clear sales model I would say so they knew how they were going to get their customers now and in the future and um I don't want to say moat because it's like you're just trying to be Warren Buffett like it's not like something they had a moat but they had you know either recurring revenue or they had something that was like they're they're actually the category leader they're the go-to leader and that there's some reason why they're not just going to get copied into Oblivion by everybody else maybe it's maybe they have operational Advantage maybe they what's Shepherds I mean I think branding is actually a that separates them here I think they look cool is there anything else yeah I think Shepard's uh real Advantage is that they're they picked a business model that's actually more customer friendly like I said So like um if your two other options are spend a bunch of time have a bunch of uncertainty hire somebody unvetted and you save a little bit of money or pay a 3X monthly up charge like you're kind of nuts to do the 3x monthly up charge for a long period of time especially if you're gonna hire multiple roles eventually in your company like it's just not a sustainable path so to me support Shepherd's choice on the business model separated them from the current competitors now somebody else could try to do it but what are they gonna have to do they're gonna have to go set up boots on the ground in the Philippines and in latam and really be good at you know recruiting recruiters who are then going to recruit the talent to actually deliver on these roles and hire high quality people because they they don't really like the money's not made in your first hire the money's made when you're like you see the light and you come back to them for your next six hires like what I did with Ecom is like I started with customer support and I was like cool I need somebody to do inventory forecasting people in the US really expensive for that honey 140k for that that role here could I find somebody overseas that could do inventory forecasting can I find somebody that could do can run our Amazon uh ads can I find somebody who could do wholesale as a channel like can I find people that do influencer like you start to be like oh wait this isn't just about what it used to be which was like va's equals low-cost labor now it's like dude they're pretty talented people that could do these things they got three or four years of experience doing that at another company and so you're able to just pluck from the remote talent pool versus just your local talent pool dude I'm excited to see how this turns out at Hampton do you guys have any overseas people yet or no yeah yeah for sure we have like the guy who made our website is overseas and he's on staff we have our accounting folks that who like the they're called fuel Finance they're overseas if you go to uh like we have this whole back end thing built where people can log in it was built by a guy in Hong Kong um yeah we have a ton of overseas and Marshall's a member and so we're gonna actually thinking about starting to use them for some data analytics stuff so yeah by the way like the fun is all a lot of overseas when I was using uh for are you coming a lot of you come people use agencies I uh I'll hire an agency and then they like they're like great let's add can you add these three people to slack and all of them by their names yeah and I'm just like so like for example uh design pickle I think is like a 10 million dollar a year business to basically like design unlimited designer on demand uh we tried them out for a little bit every single designer is in the Philippines um then I hired this email marketing guy I was like oh you had to do our email email marketing and flows he's based in call Colorado every employee is in the Philippines I was like okay that's another one um I hired a website a web dev shop yeah owners in the US entire team is in India uh you know another one that did the entire thing in Ukraine and it's like it's so funny that people are basically this is now a business model is basically like owner in the US does sales fulfillment all done by it and they're good I'm not even saying this like a bad thing like they're talented but I'm like wow this is a whole business blueprint a template that they could use which would basically like make the margins work uh what are you gonna go there when are you going when's the Philippines yeah when's neckbeard Nation going to the Philippines we should host the next live pod there do we have a following there I have no idea uh unfortunately I don't think we do I don't think they give a [ __ ] dude you got to go there um I've been in the Philippines it's awesome tonight and I've never been I'll go tonight and tomorrow I'm taking a 15-hour road trip in my Tesla uh my first time doing it we're gonna see if I love it or hate it so I'm gonna report back on Wednesday 15th hour you said it normally takes 12 but you add three hours for charging yeah I did a charging road trip was horrible where are you going from where are you going to what's the distance uh Austin to St Louis okay I'm gonna visit my family uh would you get the x or the Y which one are you doing X long distance 350 miles is it a new one because the thing I screwed up was the one I rented on turo was like five years old and it just needed charging every 90 minutes it was an awful experience well how fast you go I mean it's like highway right so you're going like whatever 75 miles an hour I mean I speed usually is I mean I'll go 85 or 90. so obviously what's gonna happen crushes the battery uh it absolutely crushed the battery at least that one that I had it absolutely crushed it we had to tear we did a seven hour ride 14 hours because we had to charge so many times you know the charging thing it's not like you can't just like charge like there's like certain Chargers that are fast and some that are slow you know like don't you just use the thing on the screen that like tells you what to do well it tells you where it tells you where it tells you where the charges are but I'm saying some of the charging stations and some of the spots are fast Chargers and some are slow like there's a like it's like a gas pump where one will fill it up at twice the speed as the other so make sure when you do it you know that so you go only to the fast Chargers uh and none of the slow the slow ones are like you you had to be like I wanted to go watch a movie so that I could do this slow charge no I I use there's this app called a better route I think it's called like has built this whole like thing just on routing out people's electric charges and so I'm gonna use that but my wife's my wife's flying and I was like I'm driving I want to drive I want to see what it's like and so I'm driving and I'm gonna report back on Wednesday to see how it feels I did it so I I'm gonna leave tonight so I'll get a few hours in and then tomorrow that way I can like I plan my life around this pod because I was like it's we record 11 my time like I can't arrive that morning otherwise I'll be like tired I want better research right so I have to plan it so I get there Tuesday night but I need a full night's rest so I can like wake up and like research and [ __ ] do you plan your life around this pod oh yeah to an extent right like you know this is uh this is the one unmissable appointment on my calendar everything else yeah it's flexible this is the one non-flexible thing it's no days off I think I mean we've recorded on we missed Christmas yeah so I guess we can't really say that right now well wasn't there like an issue yeah we had a sound issue but uh we're like no days off people are like you missed last the last time that was like a technical error but we've done like whatever the most recent holiday is we're recording whatever I think we've done Christmas Eve before we always record big thanks to everybody who listens this is a fun thing for us to do thank you for listening uh yeah this is like one of the one of the the dope parts of our life and I think it's attracted a bunch of little like uh I mean neck beard Nation right so it's attracted a bunch of people who whose brain is weird in the way our brain is weird and uh and I think that's a lot of fun I want to end with this so I was at this I'll tell you a very very quick story I was at this La Tech Meetup first of all our fans are that sounds weird but our listeners they come in all shapes and sizes man all colors oh I like I love it like what does that mean what are you trying to say there dude like I had this guy that looked like he was seven feet tall guy like basketball player and I thought he was like a famous guy and he comes up he goes total man and he gave me like you know like the black guy handshake I'm like black guy you are a total man like that you didn't even need to say it bro no yes pure gaming like that got my handshake you know what I'm saying and uh and then I had this like 55 year old woman who was with her kid at the airport say what's up and I just want to say first of all if you're a fan thank you and second of all I can tell like walking by if someone listens or not because if they're wearing like Lululemon ABC pants or like if they look like they go to like Columbia uh like University and they like make eye contact with you in a particular way I could tell and I would love for you to come and say what's up so long as it's like a quick like what's up total man like you can say something by the way here's the etiquette you come over you fist pound not handshake or hug so let's do nuts that's the way we do it we're not trying to get a little too too much uh I'm not trying to be pumped upon with anybody and so uh give me the knocks you can say uh you can reference that you get no small boy stuff uh total man you could use any of the any of the isms that you want that just means I know you and I'm I'll give you the head nod back like yep you're one of us take the selfie together and then uh and then we kind of you know we keep the show rolling from there but here's the [ __ ] that I need to announce to people and they and we got with us in every episode because oftentimes if they send me with my wife they'll say what's up they see me with like my in-laws or up to eat with friends they won't say what's up and every once in a while they will and it makes me feel so cool oh my God yo the more people I'm with the more I need you to be over the top with it yes my wife doesn't listen to this podcast she's never heard a single episode so she doesn't think this is cool she thinks this is me playing video games up in the bedroom right now so only when she sees someone come up in person and then even you know I was with her mom there and they were like wow what my dad was there and he's like he my dad literally goes he must have thought you're someone else and family actually understand and so if you see us out there please give us one yeah if we're with friends you have to do it Bella make my day I love the short thing I was out to eat and like three different guys when I was about to eat I was at my co-workers I said what's up and I played it up like oh man I can't go anywhere in my head I'm like I'm like oh there's a forward I hope there's a fourth it's someone and my co-workers are like does this happen all the time I'm like ah I gotta say the most embarrassing version of this so uh when we were selling the milk Road I went to meet up with the guy who bought it Kendall at a coffee shop and we're at the coffee shop for a bit and I see someone kind of like looking like I think they recognize me but I'm not sure and I'm like come over just come over right now because he doesn't listen to the podcast and I'm trying to do this deal and I'm like I think it would help if he felt like I'm a big deal I was like I think that'd be a little nicer yes the guy doesn't come over right so we go outside we say I say bye he starts walking away and the guy comes over and he's like Sean and I'm like yeah he goes hey man you're like Vandal come back yeah I literally go I was like oh Kendall I want you to be my house I was like hey uh have you met Kendall and you guys like No And I was like Kendall yeah um this guy just he listens to the party I just wanted you to it didn't even make sense and I was like I forced it so bad dude validate me please how do you take a cool moment and make it the most lame was me being like hey wait you didn't hear that he recognized me come here have you guys met of course not oh my God I I've said that before I'm like hey say what you said again but do it in front of my in-laws so I just this is the public service announcement if you think you know us or if you think it's us even if you only think it's kind of us uh just take a chance and say what's up and uh feel free to be over at the top like yeah you know it's awesome we love it uh it makes me feel good and it more so makes me look cool which is what I care about more than anything so anyway that's awesome that's the Pod good episode [Music]

I launched the channel late 13 but the really big turning point for the channel was I flipped to two videos a week and in December of 16 I made 20 grand and I was like oh my God like this is a thing how did you get the initial momentum was it because of your following as a writer yeah that's exactly what happened I wrote for Jalopnik it was the most popular car blog on the Internet by far and I started inserting my videos into those articles the Articles drove people to videos which then started to put me in the algorithm which then started to get me subscribers and Joel I think was paying me I swear to God 25 an article which was not real money but the value was in the number of people coming over to my YouTube I didn't know that at the time but in the later years it became clear to me like I think I'm actually a YouTuber and not a writer anymore like I think this is a reality now

what else is traits of the total man the total man does not get caught up in BS drama um the total man does not act like a wussy so uh when things you know if like David Goggins is like uh I broke my foot good I'm finishing this hundred mile run like and though the stories they collect and pride themselves on are not about lifestyle balance are not about like someone came over to my house the other day and they she said this to my wife she goes it's okay to not be okay and I go total man would never say it's okay to not be okay [Music] you're turning into uh Sasha Fierce with that trying to calm down all right we're live I don't know who Sasha Fierce is and I bet she's amazing it's uh Beyonce when she goes on stage she has a stage character she calls Sasha fear she gets into that mode so no matter how she was before going on stage she's like that wasn't I'm a new person now and I'm doing my thing that I do with this it's hard when you drink your Topo Chico you take a big Swig of that and you become Sam fierce where do you want to go from here you drive all right I got a couple things that I want to talk to you about so I think I think this episode is not going to be for this for the faint of heart I think it's not going to be for the sensitive I want to talk to you about a concept that I've seen two concepts the title of this episode is gonna be I'm not racist but it's not illegal right it's like I'm not I'm not trying to be sexist but that's what this this episode so okay so let me show you something so I'm doing this um um Workshop that is clearly not a webinar today right after this with uh our boy Nick Huber and um how many people signed up yeah can you say I guess so you guys how many people signed up for a webinar hundreds five thousand people have signed up for this no [ __ ] really your boy pulls weight I think is one conclusion but the second conclusion is I saw I got to see up close and personal how Nick marketed this thing so Nick does something I call mob marketing he basically angers the mom Nick who Nick Huber um and he's on Twitter he's at sweaty startup and he's got a big following couple hundred thousand followers and some people love him and a lot of people hate him he's one of our only friends like we have this group chat of people who all got big on Twitter he's the only one of us I think that gets like death threats on a daily basis dude his home address gets posted people will post this on the dress they'll post pictures of his wife and they'll talk about how he's evil they'll post on LinkedIn separately not even tagging him the next day being like I couldn't sleep at night just thinking about how much this bothered me with what this guy said and he'll say things that definitely ruffle feathers he does it I would say it's some overlap I can't decide you know it's hard to get into the mind of like you know the Joker Batman what's an example post it's like so he'll be like um I've never met someone who has purple hair and also has their life together he's like I'm not saying it doesn't exist but I'm over eight and so it's like some people think it's funny some people are secretly kind of Nod along but they'll stay quiet about it and then a bunch of people are like dude what are you saying here and they're offended or they're like offended on behalf of somebody else and then he'll do that again he'll be like um you know he'll say I run my company um I have you know 20 people that are making five dollars an hour in the Philippines and it's the best decision I made um hiring my my International staff has has been you know an absolute Game Changer I'm never hiring entitled Americans who care about a b and c again um you know whatever and then people are like you're what are you anti-American and then they're like wait five dollars an hour in the Philippines do you feel good taking advantage of this labor and he's like well you know I'm paying them double what they were making before this otherwise they wouldn't take this job like I'm not forcing anyone into anything but okay if that if you want to protect these people who like this job okay sure um but the point is is he posts stuff that he knows he knows Ruffles feathers he takes a very polarizing approach to it and I would say in our world in the business world this is not common um Elon kinda does it but not really and he's the only he's the only one I could think of uh that's like maybe there's a bunch of other examples but on the bit on the business side it's not that common in the pool political side you see it right Trump did it before he he was doing it as a business person well I think it was I don't know maybe because his whole business career was kind of pre-social media so it's hard to say right like I think he always was this guy but you know when you do it in dinner parties it's very different than doing it out loud on Twitter where anybody anywhere in the world can follow you and hate you um Tucker Carlson is like this uh all of the like kind of media pundits that get really big Hannity and whatever they take a very polarizing view on things Ben Shapiro right and then you have Andrew Tate and this kind of leads me into a um so first I kind of noticed this mob marketing tactic I was like this is very effective um I don't know if I would want to do it it sounds like it you know is a lot of like kind of firefighting um and I've been able to make it work without doing it so I don't I don't really intend to go do this but it is one tactic that does work the other thing that I've noticed with this is it ties to this idea I call Total man and I think total man is a new lifestyle that is popping up and I'd like to tell you about it so here's the idea with total man is this a trademark uh phrase I tried to buy the domain it's taken I'd like to own this domain um and I think that this is going to be is either already is or going to be the next big kind of Lifestyle brand trend is whoever owns this total man thing I think Andrew take kind of did it so I'm a little bit late to the to the game here but basically if you look at the following individuals David Goggins Joe Rogan uh Jocko willink Andrew Tate Donald Trump even Nick Huber to an extent they all subscribe to this like total man lifestyle what is the total man lifestyle so here did I get did I get left off that bullet point you you are you're like half of them um like I think I think you definitely you're not total man you're half man but yeah you might be two percent milk yeah you might be trying to get to that to their level okay so here's so my trainer even said this he's like he's like I'm just trying to live the quality like I want to be a quality man and I want to have this lifestyle I thought quality man that's a good phrase that I said let me just sharpen that a little bit total man I said what do you mean by that he goes he's like I just want to have my finances like set I want to have I want to be wealthy I wanna I Wanna Be Fit like I don't want to be out of shape I don't think it's cool to be out of shape I'm gonna push myself to be in a phenomenal shape um and you know I found some other characteristics that he didn't say these but basically somebody who's Unapologetic so you see this with Nick when the Bob comes at him he never apologizes or backs down he pushes back again Trump does the same thing Andrew Tate does the same thing they doubled down instead of backpedaling so they're Unapologetic why because they live by a code I think you do that too they live by a code it's an internal code and the internal code could be a little bit flawed like entertain says some wild stuff but the fact that they have a code is actually quite admirable I think people are attracted to somebody with a code because they themselves don't have a code and so you it's sort of like life is easier when you just uh around people who live by their kid um what else is traits of the total man the total man does not get caught up in BS drama um the total man does not act like a wussy so uh when things you know if like David Goggins is like uh I broke my foot good I'm finishing this hundred mile run like and the stories they collect and pride themselves on are not about lifestyle balance are not about like someone came over to my house the other day and they she said this to my wife she goes it's okay to not be okay and I go total man would never say it's okay to not be okay Lifestyles right I think there's one lifestyle and so let me keep going he knows what he wants out of life and then he has it so it doesn't matter if what you want is a Bugatti and uh you know uh three model girlfriends what matters is that you wanted it and you sort of whatever quote-unquote manifested it I think that's another trait of the of these people that do this total man lifestyle and lastly they have strong Hobbies Joe Rogan goes bow hunting uh you know Goggins does Pull-Ups for fun uh these people have strong hobbies and lastly they are charismatic and they care about being charismatic so to me I think that you're gonna see a bunch of Mega influencers and a bunch of Brands being built like in the same way that there's like right-wing conservative like that became a lifestyle and an identity and then a bunch of Brands got built for that population I think you're going to see a bunch of people you're already seeing it with Andrew Tate and others David Goggins and others that are trying to do this total man lifestyle and then build a bunch of products for other guys who want to be in this want to be a part of this religion and I think about this and this isn't anything this isn't anything new I'm reading like the biography of Arnold Schwarzenegger right now and but you know he likes something he would be in the church if the total man would do is go read Arnold Schwarzenegger biography yeah well he's he's an Eclectic person but he was uh you know he was selling workout plans and things like that because people are like oh you're on the he would he would do these photo shoots in Fitness magazines of him holding a surfboard on the beach in LA and he in the biography he's like I've never surfed in my life like I could barely swim look at me like have you seen a bulldog swim like it doesn't happen a lot and uh like he's like you know I don't really like I'm not like that but people wanted to look like him they wanted to be around these hot girls they wanted to live in LA and he would sell these plates so of course this isn't anything new we're just seeing a different generation here's what I think is new um I have this belief that like almost everything that becomes a big trend is in response to the world being a certain status quo in the other way it's a pendulum that swings and so you had an era where it was like the world was very conventional and traditional and blah blah blah and then you start to see a bunch of unconventional untraditional things and this is people having different genders and pronouns and purple hair and all this stuff and you see a big movement in that direction and then you see um like I would say therapy and empathy and all these words have never been more popular and amongst men and women um and I think in response to that I think there's an undercurrent of people who feel like it's all too soft the world's getting too soft we need Hard Men we need we need the total man and and so here's how I know it works everything I described is the opposite of toxic masculinity it is basically uh being a man became something that got labeled as toxic masculinity and now I think there's a bunch of people trying to take that back and be like hell no we Embrace masculinity and so that's what I see happening is people basically flipping that on its head and be like I'm not I'm not gonna apologize for being manly in fact I'm gonna double down on it and then there's this wave of people who have been craving something like that and I'll give you the example I remember when Snapchat came out and I underestimated Snapchat at first I thought oh disappearing photos for kids and is this just for you know bleep picks like you know what what is this is this this is gonna be a real deal what I underestimated was that Snapchat was the response the pendulum had swung at when Snapchat came out Facebook was basically at the peak of its powers um or it had like sort of like was was uh Facebook and Instagram were like the top and what Facebook and Instagram were were every photo is public every photo is permanent every photo looks good and just trying to make you look look cool and what was Snapchat it was the exact opposite it was every photo is private every photo is impermanent and it lets because of that you get to be silly you get to let your hair down you get to just send Goofy pictures instead of pictures that make you look cool and so that there to me the need for a product like Snapchat only be only came out because the world had got so instagramified so facebookified where everything was public permanent and uh and and pretty and so I think that you see this anytime you notice that the world goes in One Direction you could sort of anticipate that two or three years later the counterculture response is going to be there the opposite is going to become popular and so uh this is like a way for me to get like when I think about how to be ahead of the curve on Trends I start to think about what what feels dominant today and in three years what would be the opposite because I think there's going to be an emergence of that counterculture what do you think of this am I just am I just doing fake astrology there trying to piece things together uh no your theory I think is is exactly right you know there's been things that I've been interested in like um have you heard of the the Light phone it's l-i-t-e phone because I I believe that why because we're so well I guess explain what it is but it's like we're so excited the microphone is it's like a 300 phone but it has the screen of a Kindle so no colors and I think you can only download I think it's gonna only do spot I think it's just Spotify I think it's just Google Maps and then phone calling and you might be able to text but you can only text like a Nokia type in like yeah in order to do c you got to hit one three times right and it's came out like maybe 10 years ago at this point eight years ago and it didn't really hit right away but it's getting more and more and more popular another one that I've been preaching about forever and it hasn't entirely taken off yet is DuckDuckGo so DuckDuckGo is a search engine it's just like Google but it's uh you can't be tracked and so if you Google DuckDuckGo internet searches they actually have a graph and you can see like the number of searches per day it was growing exponentially right um yeah so your theory I think is totally right I think anybody fashion or whatever is going to know this they're gonna be like yeah duh like when everything goes to skinny jeans guess what's guess what's coming back next and whatever the you know the baggy stuff the high-waisted loose stuff or whatever um but you have an issue here's a here's a flaw with this premise this particular one it's not a flaw you're stuck in this California bubble man you gotta you gotta come to where I'm from in Missouri I think like you know this is this has been gaining momentum now for a little while I think the difference is is that um California types you know the people like if if I'm from like a place that's generally right of center now the left of center people I think are also craving a bit more than before right before it was like kind of cringy guys um and then they start evolving a little bit to being a little bit more holistic and so for example do you know who Andy frisella is yes so he's in our world and that technically we compete against him in the podcast charts but I had no idea who he was but he was the he was the he's the number one business podcast typically in the charts each week and he talks at a ton about like politics and stuff and I I believe he's right of Center but it's that's mostly a stereotype of just the way he looks and some of the phrasing that he uses his podcast used to be called the mfn CEO right and then I started listening to him and I'm like oh you're way more eclectic than I originally judged you for and you're actually really interesting and I think that that's what's happening is that there's uh people who don't entirely fit into the previous bubble of of of whatever I would stereotype these guys as being right which is like lower IQ big ass Meat Heads it's like Oh no you're actually way more thoughtful than I thought totally uh yeah I think that's that's totally true um so yeah I think this uh I'm keeping an eye on this and I think that they've been very successful like David Goggins is kind of like stunningly popular now and um same thing with did you see Andrew take came out of prison and did an interview did you see this interview on BBC it just it ended mid-interview didn't it well there's the full thing got posted on like rumble or something like that like what happened yeah no I didn't watch it I mean it's kind of a headache the thing about him is like he started out like if you listen to his messages like maybe 70 is like good like you know a man is someone who exercises they get what they want but then like there's like 30 where I'm like ah bro like I don't want to be associated with that like that you cross the line there but uh yeah some of the stuff he says is awesome so for example yeah the the BBC so it's a woman she comes into his home and she's interviewing him and uh she goes you are you know um how can you say these things that are you know toxic and dangerous and whatever you've been named by the UK um commission uh Committee of whatever as the most dangerous man in the United Kingdom you he's like dangerous man in the United Kingdom he's like oh he's like he's like what am I preaching that that is so dangerous he's like he's like I don't I'm Muslim I don't drink I don't do drugs I tell people don't drink don't do drugs I say work out I say work hard get rich um and you know like build yourself into a quality individual who lives by code and he's like you know that's what I that's what I preach what is dangerous about that and she's like well you said on an interview that um if your wife does only fans you're entitled to half her earnings or whatever um or like that you know if your wife is your wife that she is your your property as a man or whatever and he's like he's like did you listen to the actual interview and she's like you said that that is that's what you said he goes yes but what's the context of the interview the context interview is uh are the context of the podcast is I'm me and several women are on a podcast we're joking around because one woman says um if my man owns a car and I'm dating him that's my car I own that property too and then he countered as a he's like he's like I basically as a joke counter if I'm dating a girl and she hasn't only fans then I I get half of that too and uh he's like well the same logic right and he's like so that's what I said and she's like so are you saying it's a joke he's like yeah I'm saying you're taking it completely out of context and he's like you know he's kind of like trying to defend himself and they're arguing back and forth and he's like he asked her a question and she's like no I'm asking the questions here he goes no no you're in my house I invited you here I'm doing you the favor you know you're begging me for energy views and I I let you in here we are equals uh there you do not hold any authority over me we're equals if I ask you a question you you can choose to answer if you ask me a question I don't have to answer either you know that's how this is gonna it's a conversation and she like was like rejecting that premise and then you hear their handlers in the background that are all like getting really nervous about how the whole thing's going because it's like going off the rails uh the BBC Handler or the Handler because it he he has them yeah he has people who are like you know I wouldn't say maybe Handler's not the right word but like you know he has this like kind of whatever is PR type people that were like he's answered the question already like why like you repeated the same question six times like just move on to the next thing like you're stuck here like he's answered it he's not going to answer it any differently he's answered it five times now just move on to the next question and so they were like you could hear these voices in the background in the unedited version like even they take a break they're like hold on we gotta the camera camera died we gotta reset the batteries hold on and then you can see what happens in the break she like immediately is like no it doesn't make eye contact she's like looking at her notes only it's fine it's fine no this is good actually I want people to see how this goes he's like I want people to see her uh like you know how how the mainstream media how they don't they don't do their research they live online he's got his like Spiel but during the break there's like maximum tension it's like that's actually probably the most interesting part of the whole interview so I uh I'm not con I'm me personally I'm not convinced I'm willing to sign up for that I don't want to I'm not I don't want to deal with that headache agreed I'm willing to make sacrifices to some parts not of my code it's just that my code is like not that hardcore maybe it's the right way to put it but I've met a lot of people who run companies that you know that are worth hundreds of millions and some that are actually worth billions and I'll see them like do certain things that are common now about like uh uh like they use phrases like bring your whole self to work which is like kind of like a funny controversial statement to some people because some people like no just bring your work self to work like we don't we don't need it yeah or no there's like a crew and then there's like they'll do like certain things that are typically like uh that you see a lot of better get categories as woke and I'm like dude I know you don't believe that and I I see them say they'll say things privately like yeah but I want to win and this is the game I have to play in order to like hire all these people and I don't know how I feel about that when I hear about that I'm like I had a funny uh experience with this so when we got acquired by twitch um now in a 2000 personal organization and twitch uh literally I think uh you know five percent of the staff has like you know purple hair like and that'll be that's a knock I just mean like we're in San Francisco We Are The Stereotype of when people talk about like kind of like left leaning social media companies like people think this about Twitter or Facebook I would say twitch is probably more like that than um in terms of the staff so I'm in a meeting and I joined like three minutes late as I do as you know that I that tend to be three minutes later every time and um there's a presentation on the screen I don't really understand what's going on I'm like what is this presentation about and I'm I slack somebody and they're like oh it says like a you know just kind of like updating our copywriting whatever I'm like oh copywriting I love copywriting what are we talking about and it was talking about like how we use uh genders from now on it's like we only say they and then go off and then they were talking about uh women they're like we don't say women we say um and they spell this word w-o-m-x-n and I was like how do you even say that what makes it I don't know what is that or is it just women like what do you say for that and like this is now how we say this and I was like I was like what does that mean like sorry dumb question like like what is it who's if who's offended and what does this mean it's like oh this is inclusive of like people who were maybe not biologically born women but now are women and so this is like the inclusive term and I was like so I was like I was like how do you say this and and like all of a sudden I could see I could feel like a bunch of heat on me like why are you asking all these questions and like there's kind of an undercurrent in the way I'm asking the questions which is sort of like is this are you sure like that's kind of all I was I was like I was like wow this is overnight we're just changing like this is we don't say that and now we say this like this is a pretty big change no and um and so I'm hearing this and I'm like okay I guess you you know that's cool and um and then they the funny thing is the company then tweeted out for international women's day they tweeted out International women's day or whatever right like they tweeted it out like that and then they got tons of blowback from the translator like the lgbtq community being like don't do don't use that phrase just call us women why are you trying to make it seem different I was like oh my God they're back like their attempt to to like you know placate actually backfired and I was like wow this is really like this is there's a bunch of landmines like you know you don't even know but then what did the executive were you like hey executive team what are you thinking you can't ask that but I was like I said it in a different way I said uh we're talking about like you know questions it was like um Amazon has this thing where when you are doing your yearly planning one of their questions is what are the dogs that are not barking yet it's from this old Sherlock Holmes story of like a crime occurs in a house there's a break-in and there's no clues until I can't figure it out and he figures it out because he's like um well the dog was here right so surely the neighbor heard the dog and they're like no the dog didn't bark he's like Ah that's it that's the clue Watson and he's like what he's like if the dog didn't bark it's because he knows who the Intruder was that means this was an inside job and so he figures out who it was because there was the dog not barking so they have this thing in Amazon which is when you're doing your annual Planet they said what are your dogs not barking basically like what are you not hearing that is actually telling you something um or it's a different way of saying like what is a something what is something that's not being said out loud but could signal something that's worth yeah yeah and um so I said I go I think we should decide how woke we're gonna be and like where like is there a line and what does that mean and who do we want like we should say it out loud what we want to be um my slack just blew up it was like DMS being like like abort I [ __ ] don't don't say this like don't break this up like um what are you saying dude like this is like you know uh a suicide mission and one girl goes she goes she goes um I didn't appreciate that we don't use the word woke anymore and I go like a wee who like there's a company policy you can't use the word woke I was like I didn't even mean it as an insult like I thought it's just like yeah because at the time it really wasn't this was many years this is like four years ago or five years ago now and bulk was woke became a little bit more derogatory over time uh at first it was stay woke it was like a the kids were saying it as like yo you if you're not you're not like awake to what's really going on dude I think Twitter had t-shirts that said stay well yeah it was like a positive thing and then it turned into a criticism later so somewhere in the middle of that and I was like we should decide and she's like we don't use the word woke anymore so I you know I appreciate if you don't do that okay who's we is there a committee that decides what words we can say like that sounds pretty non-woke to me and uh and she links me like a Vox article I'm like oh you read this Vox article yeah you decided that I can't say this and I was like oh this is just too much for me and I was like there's only one piece of advice that I needed it was a piece of advice I got on this podcast from a guy very early on Daniel gross he's super smart guy he got acquired by Apple and I go what was that like in that acquisition and you were there for three years what what was the best advice you got about navigating that and he goes don't give yourself brain damage and I go what he goes yeah when you get acquired there's a really tempting thing as an entrepreneur to like I'm gonna I see things that are wrong in this organization or that I want to be a challenger voice and not just like another another person who just follows you know the company line and I'm gonna challenge you know maybe our Innovation cycle or our policies or anything I'm gonna I'm gonna be the one who brings change he goes it's just brain damage don't don't try it and I was like oh I'm doing it I'm giving myself brain damage how'd the woke story end it ended with that one person telling me that we can't say say these words anymore which was backed up by nothing and I was like oh cool so you read this article and so you decided that I am not allowed to ask this question again gotcha just clarifying great uh thank you you know whatever head of important thing inside the company like yeah I'm glad that you're uh I'm glad this is how this this works and you know what do you think without calling out well Emmett is the CEO and he seemed I don't know him but he seems like an awesome guy but I don't know if you can answer this without calling him out but what do you think he thinks or someone like him can I say someone like him someone in his position someone in his position with his name and face what would they say yeah I don't know I can't speak for him but I I guess my impression of it was basically I think he's mostly shielded from this stuff so like I don't think the most of this gets to his plate and that by the time it does he's he's a total man he doesn't care about drama like I think he's he's like a renaissance man he's a little different um I think two things I think one I think he's mostly just like um he I think he's gotten a lot of CEO coaching to where he doesn't let his first reaction be his response so like something comes up and now instead of reacting he responds and usually responds with the question and he'll just ask them tons of questions and he's like I'm in the spirit of literally understanding what you're saying and trying to figure this out tell me what does that word mean like and they'll be like it just I mean it means inclusive means that you say well like no like can you please like use an example or can you uh like from can you explain that from like you know base principles like what are you talking about where what are the boundary lines like let's make sure we're all talking about the same thing and uh he does look kind of like a Socratic method where he would he would end up just like fatiguing out anybody who wanted to bring something up and he would get his understanding of it and the decide is this important or not but um I think most people are sort of intimidated by him and then in the process of trying to debate him on something would sort of like nobody could really a very few people in the company could really like hold up to any debate or any scrutiny from him in in a conversation I saw it just many many times and he was trying to dial that down because he knows that that's like you know already he's in a position of authority plus he's like uh you know world-class or debater who's got this like wide breadth of knowledge to like pull from so he already knows he's like you know if he does that she's gonna shut people down so he's trying to tries not to do that but I saw you know most people didn't want to bring it up to him dude I just avoid all of this this [ __ ] like I can't stand this stuff and it's just I just don't care is it really what I guarantee it's just the worst part of the job for Zuckerberg or anime or anybody who runs these networks like the one percent of trust and safety or like angry people that's constantly angry about something that's got to be the worst part of the job that's not why they created these networks is to like be a public policy maker in their own like Kingdom but it is amazing how they uh get around it uh because I could I could tell Zuck doesn't care about that stuff but he still plays the game yeah and sucks a man he's never had a controversy he's never done anything not a lot of these guys haven't uh like they've done pretty good with navigating some of these topics and I'm amazed that they don't react by saying oh you guys want to form this Union or you want to like protest over this you're all fired like this is a machine you know we don't need this we don't need this this is right like didn't he he say something in an email which is like you know let's not do it this way and then he got fired from his own company what happened I don't I don't know what happened he he was he wrote an email to the staff about a trend he noticed in the workforce which was new hires had to introduce themselves using their preferred pronouns he says this is completely unnecessary for a woman who is clearly a woman to tell us that her pronons are she and her and a man who's clearly a man to tell us those pronouns are he and him um he understands that the practice is Root in kindness but he says in the long run this approach does more harm than good because you're forcing people to behave a certain way and that's the opposite of inclusion um and then and so then uh he says first there's a tidy number of P of people at uh well he says peeps so you know already that's a fireable offense it's a tiny number of peeps at pale chimp who would consider themselves transgender forcing either with orders or guilt the other 1390 other peeps to adopt the can you communication the humanity has never had to use in our 300 000 year existence and our 150 000 years of spoken language in order to make things slightly more comfortable for an extremely small group of peeps is completely illogical um so then he got fired it was probably for the peepsieg to be honest like into it whoever bought the company was like look man we need to talk yeah he's like but I didn't mean to hurt the the trans people he goes what no I'm like we need to talk about this p pig yeah he stepped down as CEO shortly after and uh voluntarily uh and then also then somebody came out I was like by the way there's no policy that says they have to do that it's like [ __ ] this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better we um one time at the hustle we wrote an article on Sasha Gray Sasha Gray used to be like this famous porn star and we wrote about how she was trying to change her image around to not be that and every single night at like midnight our time I would get all this traffic from Japan because I guess that was morning time in Japan it was all people searching for Sasha Gray and they were fighting our articles yeah and I found out that she had hired this company called like reputation.com to like boost that article so it showed up first so we're getting all these people searching Sasha Gray XXX and they didn't get what they wanted to but whatever you're like photos at the bottom of this blog post it's photos inside our newsletter if you subscribe dude I didn't realize I guess I realized it but someone posted this infographic on Twitter of the biggest websites and it was like Google was just like the largest it was like bigger than everything combined but then like I think four of the top ten were were porn sites and uh it's it's wild I mean imagine working at one of those companies can you imagine that what would that be like just sitting in the office we imagined it many times no um so I've been I can't talk about these but I've been I've had very interesting conversations with a few people that own only fans based businesses recently and they're absolutely crushing it to the point where I can't talk about it because I would be kind of like it's like do you mean do you mean the the stars or like the ancillary things oh most I'm talking about the ancillary things right now but they're all crushing it the platform is crushing it the stars are crushing it and the the cottage businesses that get built around this to help this either to be a part of that ecosystem but they're doing so well that I sort of if I talked about them I would be coming between them and like millions of dollars because people a lot of people would want to compete with the the strategies that they're doing but I will say one thing that I have learned that was pretty interesting so I always assumed that only fans was popular because um you're sending like I don't know nude pics or videos to guys and that's like the thing that's what they're paying for and I was always a little curious I was like porn's like free on the internet why would you pay for this like uh there must be something I don't know and I just kind of wrote it off as that do you know why they make so much money do you know what the actual Money Maker is inside of a of an only fans account when these girls say that they're making like a million dollars a month you know what actually drives that I've never I've never subscribed to one I guess you probably have subscribed to a few now that you're like researching it but I've never subscribed to one you know I'm a married man and I did not do that but uh you didn't need to because I talked to the people who like run they like run the accounts or whatever like what a lot of people don't realize is that a lot of these accounts are just they're bought so like uh uh girl has a public Persona she doesn't only fans she kind of gets exhausted running the thing because it's like a lot and it's like emotionally exhausting dealing with all these guys and uh whatever so she's uh so somebody come approaches her and says we'll buy your account for um yo I'll give you 200 000 right now for your only fans account and then I'll give you you know X percent of the profits and I'll run it you just have to put pictures in a Dropbox folder and uh you give me good content and I will give you money and that's how it goes and then uh and so what what actually people so I was like why do people pay for these pictures and videos like again porn's free that's like one of the rules of the internet is porn is free uh so what what do people really want and it turns out that they want like the girlfriend experience and so yeah they not through the content but through the chatting and that the chatting has all kinds of weird things like is it one group chat or individual no individuals and so they hire Farms of chatters so basically what only fans is built off of like a lot of the the money is made through is giant like customer support you know uh call centers uh essentially in the Philippines talking to you know it's basically like Dunes in the Philippines talking to dudes in the U.S pretending to be the girl and so they it's just like they have this Army of chatters that will chat with these guys and tease them and flirt with them and then upsell them and boom to Ching got the sale there and they're like sales people they got to they get commissions and all this stuff it's insane and what how within that okay so one of the highest ticket items what's the you know if this was the the county fair what's that top stuffed animal at the top and it's basically like the number one is pretend to be my girlfriend for like you know a month and it's like text me as if you're my girlfriend um and it's like that's the that's like the top prize but there's other weird stuff underneath we're so weird that I can't even say this this is a family show um and so I can't even say some of the weird stuff that they want but it's not what you would think it's not like super crew is it just like sending sending pictures back and forth like I'll give you one example one example is the guy who's the customer sending pictures to the only fans person asking for their opinion a rating of them and that's like the service that they pay for and so there's stuff and and I guess like the two things stood out one is it's like the free market at work baby it's like you you can really see what humans are all about when you talk to this to these people because it's like man people are into all kinds of crazy stuff these are like their real desires and these are desires they wouldn't admit and I bet a bunch of these people are you know they're the person they're doctors and they're the CEOs and they're they're other people like you know human desires got revealed they were always there and they got revealed because only fans gave a a a better Avenue to to realize those desires which is kind of crazy to me the second thing is I think it's wild how much money is being made in this space and um my reaction to it is not kind of like like I think you were asking what's your reaction to no my my question is not who cares if it exists my question is uh you getting involved into it what how does it make you feel and how does it make your wife feel and are you like involved in it well okay you're you're contemplating I'm learning I'm talking to these people because I find it fascinating uh I have contemplated investing in some of these because I was like I would not want to operate this but yo if you're if you're already down there in the sewer let me know if you got something I'm gonna hand it up here you know like I I will I'll provide resource dude do you realize how hypo that's so hypocritical why is it hypocritical I'm saying I don't personally I would not personally enjoy operating this I I also would not like in operating a deli or an ice cream shop or whatever but I'll go I'll go eat a scoop what's the problem with that if they need resources they need capital or they need advice I'll give them those things I don't want to operate so to me that's fine um my wife it's also hypocritical of Me by the way if I consume porn into also [ __ ] on it so I'm not acting like I'm holding I'm not acting as though I'm holier than now but it is a conundrum I told my wife by the way I was like hey I'm thinking about this and she just goes okay don't tell me but if it makes money that's fine um yeah I would also say that it's really funny uh I find it like amusing the way that the ecosystem Works where it's like what you think it is is some woman with an account who's putting up content and guys want that and then she's chatting with them and it's like actually this like whole other thing there's agencies that control the accounts the agencies are 90 dudes uh the Chatters are like you know these call centers in India and the Philippines and um I find it amusing I'm like that's hilarious that that's what this like that that's how this like evolved and I find that dude and I always I always get their reels on Instagram at night in bed so like I try not to keep my uh so I I like if I'm scrolling on my phone at like 10 pm it's normally like rip guys and dogs in the day and then even in the evening it's hot girls that pop up on my real or you know like when you're scrolling through your Instagram right and I'm like wait what is this and then you click on their profile and it links to a link tree which goes to well the funny thing is you see it because what they one of their main growth tactics is they pay meme accounts so accounts that just post funny jokes 99 of the time the way that those accounts make money is only fans people will pay a lot of money to get posted one time at night on those accounts and then you can delete it in the morning um and that's how they grow their their own social followings and so uh through these meme distribution channels and so that's a funny part of it but anyways I don't even know didn't plan to talk about this one but that's a funny little tangent so all right listen I don't know if this actually is going to interest you but I'm going to try to make this interest to you because anything that uses the H word history you're not into the right that's not but the total man should understand history because history he actually listen he actually you know has been alive through all of history so I'm reading this book it's called like killers of the flower moon it's basically about the 1920s Osage Indians there's Native Americans they were given this plot of land when they were like you know like the government was like Hey you know we're taking this [ __ ] over here's your plot of land turns out it's sat on all this oil and so they all got rich and white people take advantage of them and kill them and to steal their money and I was reading this book and they keep talking about the pinkertons have you heard of the pinkertons Never So they well I kept talking I was like why don't they go to the police and they're hiring these guys called the pinkertons so pinkertons it was basically a guy named Alan Pinkerton he started this company in 1950 and he started it because he was walking through the woods one day and he saw a bunch of like counterfeiters and he got curious so he starts watching them and he starts figuring out what they're doing and then he calls the police on him and they're like well we can't really solve this he goes give me a few weeks I'm gonna I'll keep an eye on them and I think I could figure out what they're doing where they're going and I'll be your detective he does that and they get arrested and he's like I love doing this this is very fun and so he keeps doing it and it starts like a small like little mom and pop business where he goes to other people he goes hey do you want me to help you solve this crime just pay me a little bit of money and I'll go and I'll go and do it and we'll report it to the police and we'll give them all the evidence that they need so he does this for a handful of years and eventually he works his way up to like the uh the government American government is paying him money and it gets to the point where his people this is pre-secret service his people uh protect a blanket so we didn't have the Secret Service back then Secret Service was invented after Abe Lincoln got shot didn't do a great job yeah it turns out yeah I want them all get what I'm all turns out yeah that is actually totally true he's had a bunch of losses but uh so he so he was like uh uh failed to protect the president but for some reason the government still liked them so they start giving them contracts so anyway fast forward to the pinkertons are still around and they've done a bunch of controversial [ __ ] so like as they grew companies like uh Andrew Carney like the titans of uh industry would hire him to basically like when they were uh unions that would go on strike they would literally sit outside of a gate of a factory and like like protest and [ __ ] and then also fight and so the Pickerington is at one point killed like 24 of these like protesters it was like a huge thing and so they're like bring up a note here that says at their Peak they had more agents than the standing American Army is that true that's insane dude they had tons of people and their motto was pinkerton's don't sleep we don't sleep and their logo wasn't was it was it open eye and so they like it was just like we're we're there all the time uh and we will always find out what's going on you know I thought that Mighty Ducks ducks fly together was the top but uh this we don't sleep might be better than ducks fly together yeah we don't sleep but so this company was created in 1850 I think I said I was reading about uh coincidentally this other thing going on with like Amazon Amazon was having some issues with Union stuff and dude Amazon this company still exists and Amazon hired these pinkertons so basically what they do now so the company was sold in like 2005 or something for like 400 million dollars so not a significant amount of money for how long it lasted but because it kind of peaked in the early 1900s look at their website have you been to their website it just says our story and there's literally a picture of Abe Lincoln that's the heroinette do we have a home about owning you're phoning your failures these guys love it yeah yeah it just says whoops we've learned from our mistakes nobody nobody feels faster than us yeah they took fail faster a risk advisory investigations protection embedded smes I don't even know what that is that sounds dude so listen to what they do so they basically they'll hire these guys so Pinkerton like there's like guards now I guess I don't know what they wear like balloon jeans and a plaid shirt and they like go to like they'll go to Starbucks hire them and they'll go to the Starbucks to get a coffee and they'll just try to listen in and you'll hear like one guy talking to his co-worker like hey we should unionize or you know [ __ ] this guy let's do this and that and they go and report it back to like corporate headquarters or they'll try to figure out like when uh Amazon was launching a bunch of stuff they'll go and just walk around the office and be like is anyone talking about some [ __ ] they shouldn't be talking about and they like report it they still exist Google hires them Facebook hires them they still like monitor monitor this stuff and it's a really it's a fascinating that a company has existed since 1850 or whatever it was and they're still like working and B I started thinking about like private police and security companies and there hasn't been that many like interesting security startups so one of them that I actually invested in it's called Deep Sentinel do you know what deep Sentinel is it's the security um it's the security thing where you're like it's a security camera where uh it'll talk it'll like there's like a human watching on the other side uh deep sentinel's whole thing like they make a joke they go Ring's awesome for watching your [ __ ] get stolen and uh like I I have deep Sentinels at my house and like one time a drunk guy came up to my front door thinking that I was we were his Airbnb and like the camera like catches him and he says Hey sir what are you doing here and they call the police so I walk down at like 3 A.M and I see the cops at my house like taking away this guy and so anyway that's kind of cool another one is called Banner man have you heard of banner man I have heard of this it's like bodyguards right dude we used to do it all the time so it was a company that went through uh White combinator and one of those conferences well I don't know I'm trying to figure out the site's still up but basically when you host a conference by law as well as like practicality like you need it you have to hire security you need security guards and we would use bannermen and we would hire like and they have like a menu it's like armed guard 200 an hour non-armedgar 150 just a huge scary looking guy 100 an hour like you could like hire them by the hour and it was so easy it was like uber for security it was awesome but there hasn't been that much new startups like in this space By the way here's the pricing unarmed guard 59 an hour armed guard 98 an hour off-duty police 145 an hour and they're armed that's it that's it so I just get a big scary guy to walk with me for 50 bucks or 80 bucks an hour or whatever it is I'll do it for free um uh so anyway I'm just like interested in this space and I thought like the Pinkerton think it was wild that this [ __ ] still exists you know how much they sold for is that or do you know anything about their revenues or anything like this is a crazy no and I've looked everywhere and the founder uh he he says uh on his LinkedIn he goes I don't use LinkedIn anymore that's like what it said on his profile so I Founders alive yeah his name is Johnny chin um how is he alive 1850 Oh Oh I thought you were talking about uh [ __ ] Banner man uh no fingertips no dude for sure Dad uh how much does it cost I don't how much well you said sold to somebody right was it 400 million dollars in 1999 400 and like 99. um but it's pretty fascinating that it lasted that long it got sold so basically and I was doing even further research on this that like there's this like the security industry it appears as though it's like a handful of big players and then tons of mom and pops but the handful of big players there's like three of them and they each do like 10 billion dollars a year in revenue and what they do is they just acquire tons of like mom and pop businesses and so now the biggest ones you'll you'll probably recognize a lot of their T-shirts because they'll see them at like um concerts and [ __ ] like that but then there's a bunch of private ones I've heard of Blackwater no that sounds good though so dude this guy his name's his name's Eric Prince very controversial guy uh I haven't read his book but I want to but he was controversial because he started like a it was basically a private security company but they did [ __ ] for overseas so they would like uh protect like princes and Saudi Arabian [ __ ] like that and then also when Iraq and all that [ __ ] went down they would do government contracts and so they would eventually like you know do army [ __ ] so they would like protect like a convoy and eventually kill a lot of people and they're like hardcore and Eric Prince uh became a billionaire doing this and he eventually sold it to private equity for billions of dollars it's called Blackwater very ominous name I love that name yeah there's like a there's like a bunch of interesting players in this space but not that much like of these like Tech startups so I think it's really interesting and fascinating industry uh I'll give a quick shout out to this genius restaurant uh so this guy Joshua Goodfield tweeted this out there's a restaurant that basically named all of its like the number one the number two the number three um office supplies so it'll be like mini dry erase board or like pack of pencils so that's hilarious you can expense on all meals from this restaurant it's called a USB Wired Mouse five dollar french fries yeah exactly I thought that was a genius little uh little marketing hack uh so shout out to that and then um dude are you watching the NBA Finals I get a little little human interest story for you uh no but but tell me about it it's pretty crazy so the two teams that are in it Miami Heat Denver Nuggets so um the best player on both the teams have just like crazy backstory so um one there's a guy in the heat Jimmy Butler he um have you ever seen the movie The Blind Side I love that movie that's my favorite movie it's his life so the guy got kicked out of his house at like 13 and was crashing on Friends couches and then this white woman just took him in and um she just like joined their family and he's like yeah she's you know she didn't have to do that she just did it um he calls her mom like you know his brother her her real kids or his brothers and sisters like that's just like the way it was and he was not like unlike The Blind Side with the Blind Side it was like it was pretty clear this guy had like NFL Talent like he was just like a freak athlete and it was huge and so any coach would kind of tell you that not to say that's why she did it but like it was kind of like possible but Jimmy Butler was like he wasn't like he went to a junior college then he transferred to Marquette and then he barely got into the NBA and now he's a star but like it was not obvious have you heard do you know who the real parents and blind side that you know it's real people he owns he owned a shitload of KFC's and like Long John Silver's and [ __ ] when I Googled him he sold it for 400 million dollars all of his franchises this woman that took him in single mom also so single mom with seven kids did this took him in basically put a roof over his head and uh he ends up grinding his way to the NBA and his you know doesn't make the thing he also is doing something really really funny so back when covet hit the NBA to keep the season going they had to create a bubble many sports had to do this they created a bubble which was like a basically at Disneyland yeah they did a Disney World I think so they did it in Disney World in Orlando it was like you live on on campus nobody comes in or out like if food gets delivered it gets delivered in a like sealed box 30 feet away and it gets you know like given to you and they just like tested everybody daily and if anybody ever had anything they got kicked out and so during during that process Jimmy Butler realizes yo Supply demand is out of whack so he starts he's making coffees he brought it he brought a fancy coffee machine and starts making coffees and um people are like yo can I get some coffee like the coffee here sucks I want the good coffee he's like yeah cool man it's a hundred dollars hundred dollars he's like what's the price to go he's like these are NBA players who cannot leave this bubble and so and they're like all right man [ __ ] it they just are giving him a hundred dollars for this coffee and so he creates this brand I think it's called big face coffee uh he and now he's like so he he and during the bubble people want to know what it's like in this a lot of the guys are like vlogging so this was like one of the story lines yo Jimmy opened up a coffee shop he's just like you know killing us on this coffee and he's like yo I make the best coffee it's best coffee in the world 100 and uh and so now he's like creating a spin-off brand of actually that that coffee brand there's nothing kind of cool that big white guy the giant white guy so uh yokich dude he looks mean that guy looks mean I saw he got into it small town in Serbia he got into it with some dude on the on the sidelines too I saw uh yeah that's funny that was the owner of another team he basically like bullied an owner of the another team so um so this guy's he's awesome so he basically his story's even crazier I think so this guy's born in the middle of nowhere Serbia he's got two older brothers and um his he's even though they're really tall he only likes one sport horseback riding so he's just falls in love with horses he's always on the horse track or whatever but because he's so tall like uh you know when he wasn't on with the horses he starts playing basketball and um what's interesting is that nobody would have ever known to this guy except for the fact that um there was one team that had a business model and their business model was basically let's find prospects that might have like NBA we don't care if we win now but let's just find like big dudes he's got a lot of potential that like might get bought out by the bigger clubs and let's they're like kind of like house flippers they're like let's buy this guy let's see if we can turn like you know polish up the asset and let's flip them to a bigger team in Europe or let's hold their rights and maybe we get their maybe the NBA team will have to buy buy us out and they've done this with a couple of guys and so the guy's reading the newspaper one day and he sees it at some youth basketball game like says some eighth grade game some kid you know had like 25 points and 25 rebounds and he's like huh so he goes and he finds this guy and he's like hey you ever thought about playing pro basketball he's like no and he's like come with me so at like I don't know age 13 he like leaves his hometown and joins this like team and they're like and so you're so then you think the story is because he's the best player in the NBA now so it's like he must have been he's the best now he's the best way in the world right now and so it's like how tall is he he's like seven seven foot one something like that and so they're like you would think oh he must have been dominating in Serbia and then like you know he went to the these like you know tier four League he must be awesome no he didn't even play the coach was like this kid is so fat he is just so out of shape I will not play this guy and so he's only allowed to go to practice and they're like until you can run like until you're in shape or it's not gonna work he's like uh what do I do like well what's your diet and the guy was drinking like two gallons of coke a day he's just who's addicted to Coke he just loved Coke drinking Coke and so they were like you gotta stop that like first of all and um and so he he stops drinking Coke he loses like 30 40 pounds in the course of like a few months just by changing that like one habit and we're going and running every day in practice because he won't they won't give him the ball he just have to run on the side while everybody else practices and so he's doing that finally he um starts playing he becomes like the top player on his team team like as soon as he like was able to get in shape he was the top player on his team and he gets drafted in the second round like basically he's like one of the last picks in the NBA draft if you go watch the video of like oh I want to see when they got drafted like you've seen when LeBron gets drafted he gets on stage he shakes the commissioner's hand he smiles the light bulbs are flashing like people know this is the start of a star is born what was he just like walking by and they're like uh here take this hat here just take that one even better they just cut to a Taco Bell commercial and at the bottom ticker it just said pick number 41 Nicola jokic it's just like it goes across the screen it goes away and it's a Cheesy Gordita Crunch if anybody would have that starting moment because nobody thought this guy would turn into anything and then he's basically become you know the best player in the world so how old is he it's only like 27 28 something like that he's pretty young still and um he actually wouldn't have even made it to the NBA like this team in Barcelona was gonna buy him that was going to be the flip it was like he goes from the Serbian team to the Barcelona team and the date like the day before he was supposed to sign the contract like it was already the lawyer just had to finish one thing he played in a game he was so terrible that the team backed out so he had no choice but but to go join like the NBA team that had bought his rights or drafted his rights he's like I guess I'll go to the NBA then like you know I I don't really know if anything's gonna come up this but whatever and so he goes and he's this very stoic guy like in all his interviews they're like they have these the media has all these narratives they're like how is becoming a new dad helped you become a better basketball player he'll just look at something like what it doesn't that's that's not how that works it's just like he's like just very matter-of-fact like you know like you like the kind of like dagestanding guys in the UFC he's kind of like that but for basketball so he's a fan a fascinating character it reminds me of this quote that I heard from this this VC I was like you know what's uh he had this Twitter bio um this guy Nico uh Nico I don't know how he says I know exactly how you said from uh General Catalyst yeah from GC exactly the guy he invested in Snapchat super early on and um I was like Nico why is your bio why is your bio quote what it is and his quote was um Talent is everywhere opportunity is not so his talent is evenly distributed but opportunity is not and I was like why is that what does that mean to use it because it's true he goes Talent is everywhere but opportunity's not evenly distributed and if I do my job right we're going to distribute opportunity to more people who have the talent and I think about both these guys the two guys that are starring in the NBA like you know they're kind of like one little bounce of the Plinko chip away from it being a zero and instead they get to be world famous basketball players it's like if this guy didn't get discovered while playing in like a youth farm league in Serbia or Jimmy Butler didn't get you know adopted by this woman like who knows if they would have ended up actually even getting their shot um it's like that's how fragile like you know like success and failure can be dude last night I wouldn't uh hung out at this like uh have you heard a float track or flow Sports sorry fellow Sports yes so flow Sports uh started as um uh it was basically this guy would go they started out of UT University of Texas this guy would go and film track meets and wrestling meets stuff that wasn't going to be broadcasted otherwise thought that wasn't going to be broadcast and he was just like uh he was a track and field athlete and I think they had friends that were wrestlers and he's like but you know I'm I'm a fan of running and like people love that [ __ ] but just not on TV so he starts filming this and then he puts it online and he forms a company and people start buying it and paying like 100 bucks a year to watch this stuff and it's been around for 13 years now and now they do over 100 million in revenue and I was like what's the fastest growing segment and he said uh uh um Motorsports and I was like oh like NASCAR and [ __ ] he's like no it's like these like it's like the pre NASCAR so it's like where the 18 year old kids they do this thing called dirt track so it's like it looks like a buggy kind of it's like he's like it's Grassroots but he didn't say it but it's like redneck [ __ ] and he's like that's our fastest throwing segment but we have like 18 Sports I think they have wrestling grappling running across country trying to feel whatever all this stuff and so he um I went and hung out their office because they had a little party and I was with like three different guys who had won gold medals in the Olympics one guy in the decathlon one guy in the mile and uh some other guys and first of all here's what was interesting one of the a bunch of the Olympians I was like hey do you still run you know they're like maybe 40 now and like you still run and they're like not a chance like it was my job and like I don't want to do that at all anymore like I'll exercise and go for walks and I'll lift weights but I don't want to like run like I used to run I'm done with that and the second thing was interesting is like dude these guys are all freaks like one guy his name's Trey Hardy you can look him up his body is crazy and they are freaks of nature but it's cool being around people like that who are a the best in the world at something like they are literally if they won a gold medal at that point they are the best in the world at what they do and it's so fascinating to like hear the stories like they would tell stories they're like dude that guy we used to go to the hotel and he'd be wearing flip-flops and he'd be like hey I bet you could touch the ceiling and the ceiling was 15 feet high and he would just jump and just touch the ceiling and they were like we just would see little like things like that this guy would do [ __ ] all the time or he'd be like watch this I bet I can backflip but he would backflip but he would jump so high in the air and like we would just see these like freakish stuff all the time and so I was thinking would you give up any of the success that you've had so far in order to be a broke but Olympic medal winner or like the best athlete or whatever in the world because I was thinking about that and I think I would no chance on the uh the gold medal well best athlete in the world yes I would do that that's but there's a lot of sports where you could like be the best like NCAA wrestler or best like an overall athlete no no if it's if it's uh I'm I'm the fastest Miler or NCAA you know uh Nation you know National Champion or whatever no chance I've said this before the Olympics are for suckers oh you are so crazy because I'm hanging out with these guys and I'm like congrats you are the best bobsledder the world has ever seen you've dedicated your entire life to this absolutely arbitrary thing that got you that got you nobody that got you uh you know no no skills Beyond this dude I'm so I so disagree because they were asking me advice on business [ __ ] I'm like hey just so you know I'm like the hundred thousandth most successful person in America maybe like that's what I want to do I want to play a game where the hundred thousandth person wins and has an awesome life not where I have to be the best person in the world and even then I gotta start over at age 27 and create a new career because I'm done with the thing and my joints don't work anymore these guys had shaved arms and shaved legs I was just scared at those calf muscles and I was like dude I could see every video Forum that's so awesome I would kill to have that I want some of that vascularity like look at that vein pop like I just love this cool uh his business advice is great but then he said he wants to put butter on my chest I didn't understand that they kept saying I had a really nice and ball cast at the top of my leg like dude their calf muscles were just so solid a little tennis ball was stuck in there I just saw that I'm like I remember I was thinking of this one guy and I told say after I was like dude I bet that guy's wife is so hot like she just she's like you said to your wife they're so lucky well and then she's like well he worked hard and I was like no the wife that wife is so lucky can you believe this she gets to see that bad like I was just thinking about that [ __ ] man and I just love these Olympians man I don't give it all up just to be to be a gold medal in the high jump so I don't know where we go from here this is The Tall Man episode of loving men I do I like I can't you see a guy with like you know like some sick calf muscles you gotta admire it you know yeah I guess you I guess you do you don't do that yeah definitely not the way you'd like there's been several people that come on this podcast and I'm like I'm pretty sure Sam's just imagining them without their shirt on right back yeah you got some sick pecs bro how'd you get some of those things yeah if I see a guy a big packs I just want to ask him a bunch of questions uh I don't know where we go from here [Music] laughs

what's the fun version of this for you because I feel like if somebody actually wants to know an answer to something it's been published you got a book you got a Twitter you got you got a thousand YouTube videos like if you're motivated you can go find the answer like I tweeted out yo Alex is coming on the Pod say what would you like to know they're like I'd like to know his thoughts on offers making a offer that's literally his book and I think the book is like free or 99 Cents so like that's just a lazy lazy question at this point um but I know whenever I do interviews there's some version of the conversations that are more fun or I'm like yeah when when we talk about that stuff it's more interesting to me and that kind of Lights me up in a different way what what is that for you well I'll say there's two things that I've been um probably focused a lot on on one is obviously acquisition. comom and like what we're doing and and um kind of clarifying the mission between well all the stuff that we're actually doing every day um and then the other side of it is just that the leads book is coming out and so it's tough because I'm sure you guys have had stuff that you've worked on and uh it's like been on its way coming out and all of your energy is going into writing it or building it or recording stuff about it and then you can't talk about it because I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to talk about all time until it's like ready to to go off and so the six weeks beforehand is when it's like we have all this pre-recorded stuff I've got like bull courses like I've got all this [ __ ] that's gonna that's going to drop um when the next book comes out but I haven't talked about anything leads related for like two years because I've known because I've been working on it for two years uh for the next launch so those are the two things um that are like top of mine for me like what we're doing on the mosy media side and acquisition. comom and then and then the the lead stuff what's the split between those two so you got media you got acquisitions.com give me the time split so given on a given month you know what percent there a pie chart what are you spending on on the content versus Acquisitions and then also on the money side like uh are you making more off the media or you making more off Acquisitions what's this what's the relative difference between the two yeah we we lose money on media um so no we we don't make money I think I think between like AdSense and if you consider Book Sales a part of that um but I give the book away for 99 cents actually Amazon updated it because we reuploaded it with like some fix hits and they wouldn't let us go below 190 which now makes all the times I said 99 Cents like people like he's trying to get us it sucks anyways um but no I think the book does um the book does about a million bucks a year in profit in terms of like what it what it makes um and then and then AdSense is probably like 500 Grand a year so it's like one and a half million and that that that barely covers the media team uh and so that's how big's the team right now we've got 10 and then we've got vendors are you enjoying it yeah I dig it it's fun right now we do I record one so to answer your question Sean about time split uh we do one recording day every 14 days that's like the direct to camera stuff and then you know if I do a podcast like I got one of my guys here Trevor um who's reporting you know our our side of it so that they can this stuff later so are you enjoying like the celebrity that comes with this you know getting noticed and things like that um enjoy is probably like because I feel like there's some people who love attention and there's some people who hate attention I'm like right in the middle you know what I mean like I was I was purposefully deliberately not public because I wanted to be rich and Anonymous and that was kind of like the mission for a long time for me um and then now that we are on there I would say that there are pros and there are cons of increasing you know fame or what do you want to call it recognition um I think the pros outweigh the cons but there are cons like what uh you get weirdos you know I mean like we're we have we have security you know what I mean like we go to like I can't I can't attend any event like I can't attend an event like I can't go to somebody's like small group meet up like I can't like it's it's very hard uh because I can't enjoy anything uh because I'll have a line of people were you know asking for advice or signatures or pictures or whatever and like again I am [ __ ] to everybody to do that it just like it's a different experience so I just have to I have to if I'm going to go to something I go into it knowing that's what my experience is going to be not whatever or whoever is on stage yeah it makes the online experience dope but it makes the real life experience less different it's different that's fundamentally just changes what the imperson experience is like if I walk out so like what's interesting is that I was able to or I have been able to to to Mark how social media and like the the audience has grown by the number of real world interventions I had pre-unit of time and so like I remember the first time I recognize public and then it was once a month and then it was once a week and then it was once a day and then it was every time I'd walk outside the door and now it's about five times or six times every time I walk outside um I get I get recognized um and so like I just imagine that that just continues to compound you know with time and with distribution so it's just it's different but here's the praise we get the best talent for our portfolio companies and for acquisition. comom because so many people want to come here um we get them for at market rate or or below because of all the learnings that they want and the other people who are also Pro players on the team uh we get the best deal flow that's all proprietary companies that want to work specifically with us they're not trying to exit to anyone or sell to anyone they want to work with us deliberately to scale the company so like I continue to do it because I'm more rewarded for doing it than I am punished for doing it but there are definitely you know you get weird letters and you get you know weird attacks and things like that like it's just you know it's it comes with the territory and it's to be expected and so um for us the pros that way the cons but there are cons I remember talking to uh Tim Ferris and you could just tell from the outside but he I don't know if he's mainstream famous or not uh or if I'm in a bubble but he's popular enough that he has all these people listening to him and all that stuff but he well the cool thing about him was he had high-profile people and people who like a lot of people who listen to you you're like uh I'm thankful that you listen but I don't exactly want to go hang out with you but he would actually have a ton of listeners who would reach out to him who were like you know like the Matthew mccon of the world or or some like football coach or Ryan holiday has that too where it's like someone who's like a big deal who you're like oh my God you listen to me that's amazing I would I would be honored to go and hang out with you and he had he had stories like that and Sean and I have had that a little bit where like some like business person who we both admire will be like yeah I heard your pot on this thing and I'm like oh wow you listen to that has that have you crossed that threshold where you have people who you admire who are messaging you and being like man what you said was really cool what your you know I have a question about XY and Z you're like oh man that's amazing My Heroes want to talk to me now yeah um what I mean yes I don't want to put anyone last but like there have been some mega mega influencers who like followed me and like hit me and they were like dude this was awesome and I'm like well now I think less of you because you follow my content so big red flag there you know I I told Lea the biggest red flag I had with her was that she was in um and um no I'm kidding but um but yeah like some NFL players that I used to like you know really look up to like huge MLB stars like and uh like huge huge podcasters that that you know followed me and uh yeah it's been cool one of the one of the reverse situations is when I like go to like see I'm like oh yeah how is so and so celebrity and I click and it says like follow back and I'm like oh [ __ ] uh but no it's it's cool I mean it's it's it's surreal I'm sure you guys have had it's surreal it's very um well I grew up like admiring Lance Armstrong I'm big into Endurance Sports and one time I got an email and it was like uh hey just let you know I love the hustle uh and he signed it with Lance and the you could tell it was Lance Armstrong by his Gmail and I was like I don't believe this is really Lance Armstrong if it is here's my phone number call me right now and he he called me within like three minutes and I was like like he called he goes Sam what's going on and I was like Lance is this really you yeah and I and then I had a couple other athletes holler at us and I remember thinking like growing up playing sports I would have kill to had athlete like this recognized me and I could never achieve the athletic greatness enough for them to acknowledge you know my talents and then now you just take this total like outside path and you get to it or like one time we had like this was really weird but like the lead singer of Lincoln Park uh Mike he like tweeted out that he likes our pod and the hustle whatever and I was like oh that's sick like I never I would have wanted to have met you but there's no way I could have gone down this normal path but if we went this weird way we finally kind of met and I found that to be very strange and awesome yeah it's sort of that uh be so good they can't ignore you as a general advice for Life uh like what whatever you want is on the other side of you being so good that you can't be ignored uh anything at anything and also um like it doesn't have to be I think that's kind of what you're saying Sam it doesn't have to be the thing you expect right um like oh you want you know you want to meet Warren Buffett someday you don't have to be a stock picker that's not that's probably actually the least likely way that Warren Buffett's gonna want to gonna want to know you and in general you shouldn't really pick based on what they want you should just pick based on the thing you can actually get so good at that you can't be ignored and uh it's hard to do obviously that's hard to do do but it's like more of the it's more of the right guidance than uh than many other bits of advice you could take as far as like a Northstar for how you're G to like you know what you're going to go for right exactly um and so anyway it's cool that we're all kind of like seeing that and reality uh come true Al ask Alex um sorry go ahead Sam I was gonna say are you enjoying acquisitions.com because I know when we first talked to you I think you were maybe only a year or two years in you're relative new I think you had just sold um gym launch are you happy with like is it what you thought it was going to be and do you actually like doing and by the way explain what Acquisitions yeah what that is yeah so it's acquisition. comom the reason I I emphasize that is because there's somebody who bought Acquisitions plural.com and it's just not it's not me it's different but acquisition. comom um is our portfolio of companies and uh so I'll give the the tldr 90 seconds so I had a chain of GMS took that licensed the IP to 5,000 locations started a suppl company to sell through that distribution base and then started a software company we exited all three of those companies in 2021 uh we taken about 40 million in distributions prior to the exit and we sold for 46.2 million and the software company I did separately or sold separately in a strategic deal that was all stock um and I I said that because you guys are probably laugh because like I I people were like I Googled alect M net worth and it says 15 million it's like well I sold the company for 46 and I'll cash so like I don't know where we got that and the only reason you do that and get that money is because it was making money so so anyways um that was pretty much 2021 so we closed December 2 5th or sixth I can't remember it was it was one of those days it was right around it's 24th Christmas Eve that's was Christmas Eve we is we closed um and then we started acis.com the next day uh and so that was when we like made our kind of Declaration at that point though I had already made three uh minority Investments uh that had done really really well and that's why I wanted to make that kind of my next big thing if you started it the next day that means you kind of had this idea cooking so what was the what was the Genesis why did you why what made you realize oh this is what I should do next I should buy these minority stakes in in companies like the one I just built and I should get this domain name uh which I assume you had to buy so how were you so ready to do that what was the thought process so um during Co CU obviously gyms were affected by co uh you know we took a hit right we took a major hit we were still profitable but it was a it was a big you know it was hard um and so to kind of get some space because there wasn't a lot like I couldn't do more you there was you mean like obviously we you know we we push things harder but like I was on above the business enough that there was nothing I I was I wasn't going to do anything right um and so I kind of just needed to take my my mind off things and so by by happen stance uh a guy who owned a photography a single photography studio um made his way on my calendar and in the first and this is not how you do this everyone like do not do this uh but I was actually still taking some calls for Allan because I wanted to do some like testing and this was before I had a big brand so I was just kind of like founder talking to customers to get an idea of what was going on but he knew me enough from just like I had written a small book in the gym space called gym Lun secrets that he had read that book like loved it applied it to his photography business and he took a sales call through my software company because he knew I was taking the calls and so he hopped on and was like have no interest in your software he's like but can you please give me 20 minutes and I was like sure man all right I just liked his Vibe and so anyways we ended up doing a deal uh and so we took a minority uh percentage of the business and um that business I think had done 1.6 they were doing 1.6 million a year out of single single location uh which pretty awesome for a tiny like photography studio and he had I think he had taken and this isn't all the book clearly because there's a million thing but he had taken some of the concepts from the jimer book applied them um and it had grown the business a lot and he had an agency uh for photographers to kind of like do the same model for them right and so we were having a conversation um and he was like yeah I did exactly what you said and all the photographer Studios add 400,000 a year uh to the Topline uh when they use our thing I was like they add 400,000 year he was like yeah on average and I was like okay uh how much are we selling this thing for and these like pennies and I was like okay so um let's not do that and uh let's own them all and so that kind of P so he actually and this is where like the the trust factor of what like the inbound deal flow which is what I love about acis.com is we have a lot of trust and so he actually shut down a business that was making him I think 500,000 a year in profit uh that agency side and shut it down to zero um because he like believed that he believed me enough to to go all in on this other direction of private ownership of all the locations and so um as of today and that was 2020 as of today we have 36 locations um in that business you know just 30 plus million a year and it continues to grow by one or two locations every month and so and what's what's that business do enchanted fairies so it's children's photography right dude that's insane and you so when when we last had you on I saw I went to the website and I was like okay cool what what are Acquisitions great what do what did they acquire and I saw basically like uh enchanted fairies and I was like okay cool they're doing like the gym launch Playbook on the other space that makes a lot sense and if I go there today they're still those same companies so how come you're not putting new acquisitions up there uh I assume you've made a bunch of Acquisitions like you know in the last 24 months or whatever uh why not put new companies up there you're pretty open about other stuff but in this case you're not putting them up there and then also let's start with that yeah main reason so there's two big reasons why we're not public about the Acquisitions number one is that it's my brand has grown to such a degree that that like if I say hey this business is awesome and it and it has a national ability like in Chain of fairies is less of an you know like unless you're in one of those 30 market and also my audience isn't like moms with kids so like it's it's it's you know it's it's arms length enough that it doesn't affect the business but as you can imagine a lot of the businesses come to me are business services and uh they're you know they're National they're International whatever companies and so like me endorsing uh a company would 5 10x the company overnight and so comes with a couple things one is that I haven't negotiated those deals with brand endorsement included if I include a brand endorsement then I own major I'm not going to like I'm not going to risk my face on something I can't control and so these are most of them most of the Investments we have our minority we do have a majority investment as well um but that was one that came in as a minority and then I just bought more of excel of the business um and it was up our wheelhouse um the second thing is that if we were to exit those businesses and I had done an endorsement in a minority position then guess who has to go with the deal me right like I would as an acquirer if there's some massive influencer that's associated with the brand like he's not getting out in a deal and so our whole goal is to build value in the in the business so that the business is sellable and more valuable um and we use my face to bring deals in and so that's why I've been really really tight lipped about um the businesses how many deals have you done so far we've done right now we have 11 portfolio companies is it all your own money or you raised a fund no it's all private it's all mine damn dude so you're you're going all in on this and so I asked you originally are you happy with how this is working out is it what you thought it was what's he gonna say no well yeah it could be like well he's like well I I didn't realize like uh this is actually just mostly a due diligence game um and I don't know if I love what's the worst part about it what's something you didn't kind what's downside you didn't fully respect UPF front so I think there's like knowing something and then experiencing it are two kind of separate things and feel like I know that in a minority position we have to use soft influence to to to to try and move things forward um I know that but I would say the the most difficult part is is is half listen to advice and so I'll give you an example so if I say hey we think that this operator in your business and we need a new operator person says okay and then we find them a new operator and then they hire the new operator but then they don't fire the old operator like what the [ __ ] right right very hard to win at that point right it's like well I listen so like it's kind of like listening to half of someone's diet advice it's like yeah yeah I'm doing the cheat days rushing the cheat days it's like yeah but there's the other days that you're in a def yeah yeah but you said cheat days raise your metabolism like yeah yeah but you also need a deficit you know what I mean and so it's it's it's listing in completeness and so um I don't know we may move to like because like the business that I I would say transparently that I enjoy the most is the one that we have complete control of and so we bought majority of that business and we were growing that one like Gang Busters and the speed to action is so much faster um that being said you know we've you know I would say like the biggest wins we have with a company that came to us that did 16 million the year before now you know did 50 last year um 20 million e h that's the biggest company that we have in the portfolio um we've had you the the enchanted fairies is obviously one that you know that at two-ish with you know combining the two things they'll they're pacing two and a half million a month right now or 2.7 something like that um so we have a pretty ridiculous deal right like I had a friend messaged me that was like dude Hero's Playbook is uh obviously amazing but he's like this deal that they offered us he's like I don't know who would take this and uh you know he's like there's I don't know if this is actually the deal or not but he's like basically was like no money we give you no money but we get ownership above if we grow it above X so it's kind of like a I I think sounded like more of a risk risk-free strategy in a way but um is that is there a standard deal structure and is that it where you're not putting capital in you're basically saying give us the equity we guarantee we grow by this much and if we don't some I don't know some some clawback we've iterated it honestly a bunch of times so one of the one of the so this is to answer your question Sam like probably even more poly now that we're getting into it one of the hardest things about like the investment cycle is that when you're making a product right or trying to sell a service you can ideate it create an MVP pitch it see how it goes within like 60 days like the whole like the whole thing Soup To Nuts you can you can do that whole cycle 60 days for deals it's like you can think of and you know an idea for a deal structure it takes 90 days to six months to close the deal and then it might take a year to see even just like some preliminaries of like how do we like this structure how does it work etc and so like I still feel like we are most in our infancy in the deal structures that we have so like uh in terms of no money in there are deals we put money in there are deals that we don't put money in it depends on the deal um like the big one for money is it depends on what the need of the businesses so like if we're opening up a lot of brick and mortar locations like we're about to I think we might have actually closed today or tomorrow uh on a a 28 location chain um that one requires Capital to open more location so that one I'm like I know where the capital's going I see what the returns on Capital are let's go right if it's a national based service business so let's say it's a you know mortgage sales like they don't need there's no cacks like they just need recruiting they need guys right that's how that's how sales gets increased and so like that's where that's where where does the money like where's the money going and what is it used for like what I don't want to do is just like someone guy go buys a mansion after I write a CH like that's not the goal here like the goal is that we're both together wanting to grow this massive thing um and so it just really depends on on what the what the nature of the deal is so that's number one um in terms of uh how we structure them uh originally I had Grand Slam offer type thing now it's just much more straightforward of like we were you know we're Equity holders in the business it's interesting because it's actually gotten less cute and less clever as time has gone on like it's just much more like this is our deal like we own a big chunk of the business um and we're going to grow it and I mean the thing is is that for us based on my holdco costs like I put 500,000 a year in labor into the businesses and like that's if I wanted to like not mark up labor like that's hard cost and so if a company for example uh you know is doing whatever 5 million a year in iida and I'm and I'm buying a you know a onethird stake or a % stake in the business like how like what am I valuing at and how much of that value is going to come in the for in the form of of just work that we're going to do and so that's where that's where the valuation and how much cash in ETC kind of becomes more like per deal uh basis but yeah so the long story short is one is soft influence has been something that I've been learning we may in the future just do more Maj deals um where the founder stays on because like what I wanted to do is show how much more we grew this I mean we do have obviously some minority ones that have crushed too but like I I want to murder this majority deal and be like wouldn't you like to have 49% of something 10 times bigger or 100 times bigger uh and so that's kind of the the the angle but yeah we're we're learning every day we talked to our good friend is Andrew Wilkinson he's done a similarish thing as you and then um we've had a handful of other friends that have done something and they're like well I got really inspired when I read uh the Swarm Buffett book uh and like taught me a little bit about compounding growth uh and other people have cited other books or things that they learned where they're like oh no this is the way to go and that's what I that's why I got into this what about you what what transitioned you from going to this like almost PE model versus just one brand model yeah and I definitely if I were if I were to give us a name it would be like a the merger of a family office and a conglomerate uh because family office in that it's literally just family money like I don't I don't have any outside investors and then conglomerate in terms of like our business model like I'm not trying to exit anything I would like to continue to compound the Investments we have if a Founder absolutely like needs to or wants to or you know gets divorced and has to cre the asset then like we will go down that that that route but longterm we're long-term holders um but in terms of the inspiration um it was actually because gym launch has there's only 50,000 micro gyps like in the US at least and we had already got on the phone with 20,000 so like if you're micro should know who we are probably and I realized I went to this um this little Meetup of entrepreneurs and it was like six or seven people and the whole room was doing in aggregate like 500 million a year in revenue and I was you know I think I we doing like mid-30s at the time and uh I was like I was really excited to go because I was like what do these guys have that I don't have like I wanted to you know like what am what am I missing right and we had been there for like three years we'd been in mid-30s for three years and I felt like I was like something was wrong and the big takeaway I had was not that they had better systems or they're better at marketing or better at sales or better at product they just were going after B Mar like every single one of them two men had a market that was 10 to 100 times the size and so I said that whatever I wanted to do next was going to be was going to go after a much bigger Mar and there are significantly more businesses than there are James uh and so that was kind of the big thing is like okay what's something that can compound forever and that has a huge T and so we kind of like walked backwards from there and then in terms of like the the doing this model like we believe that people like build the people and the people build the business and so like Lelo you know when we're it was like 18 months of ideation I know we're we're going full circle but like how did we start the next day well these were the things that we were thinking through um and I said Leela if I were to die tomorrow what what business would you start she was like I would TR a recruiting fir I was like I don't want to start a recruiting firm I was like huh I want like is there a way that we could combine what you like what I like into something cool and so for us like the most Hands-On valuable thing that you can do for a business is find a players because if you find a players you put them in the business then they grow the business and then that value stays inside the Enterprise of the business not hold Co like not the goose but the egg right and so for us we just recruit crazy talent because we like our competitive mode is that we have more influence than they do and so we have a whole culture Community mosy Talent where our head of people like continues to bring like we have tons of people every single day that are applying for portfolio positions and then we can screen them vet them and then because we know the company and because we're long-term incentivized we don't just want to like put a body in a seat we want to find the killer that we know that if we that we we we only want to fill the role once right we want to fill it with somebody who matches the culture and matches the skill set of the business at this level so a lot of times like first-time entrepreneurs they're at whatever a million a month and they're like okay do I hire a bookkeeper do I hire a staff accountant do I hire a controller do I hire a CFO do I hire a Director of Finance like where like who am I hiring right now and what does that person look like and so like we've done this enough times to be like okay at this level you probably need a controller who has experience going from a million a month to three million a month and great and like at that point they and we'll tell them upfront that we will bring a CFO who has transaction experience in the future so they're not jostled when that happens right same thing they're scaling out the sales team they're like okay well I've got three good guys it's like cool we need 20 so like you can't just take your best closer and make him manager because he's never done this before so we want someone who's build at least one or two sales teams specific to let's say it's inbound or might be outbound depends on like the sale process of the business and they've built those types of teams and like cool we'll bring that guy in we have our playbooks then we say hey on our interview process we're like this is how we do things during Aline with that and if we do feel like there's alignment and they can they have the chops because we do skill tests then we can say hey I think that you'll match and obviously the founder still has final say because they have to like the person otherwise it's not going to work um but we do a lot of that heavy lifting because you know we might take a hundred interviews at holdco to find one one guy for one specific role for one company and that's where that labor cost comes in for us but what must be put like the reason we took majority and a take majority but majority of the uh of that business was we had built the entire executive team we built the entire executive team and we're like okay cool and the fatter was like you know what I kind of want to do other things for the business like I know it's in good hands trust you guys and so it was like a very friendly deal and now he just gets checks every month and like likes his life a lot and we just continue to grow the business which were cool there's this really cool video where you're with Grant Cardone and I think you were like in the process or pre uh process for selling gym launch and you were like and he said something like rich people sell their companies wealthy people never sell and it's cool is that I've sold a company before Sean has sold some companies before for you've sold a company what's so funny is a lot of first time Founders and second third time I a lot of people their whole business is selling but after they sell they go through this period and they're like [ __ ] I shouldn't sell ever again actually and you said you sold the business for 47 million you said you had taken 40 million in distributions so in my head I'm like that's a pretty [ __ ] sale then do you wish that you would have just held on to it and and and never sold that that company no because the person I was then wouldn't be able to do what I can do now could I do that could I today would I hold on to it yes but I don't think I could have done it then and so a lot of the re like transparently if I had I got more credibility from selling gym launch at 46 and it was valued at 150 before Co so to your point it was a [ __ ] sale um but I was done I was emotionally done with the business I just didn't want to do it anymore I still own a third of the business so like when they crush the exit the next exit at$ 250 million I'll still get my $100 million check from that um but I was I was emot I moved on and my big thing is like all my friends all my close people were like dude you sound depressed as far like you're not interested and I was like dude I want to do this new thing they're like dude you light up when you talk about this new thing and so um I actually walked away from the deal during the deal process and then came back uh and so like yeah it was not like it's funny because people people me a lot of I'm glad you brought it up because a lot of people give me praise for that but they don't have context like it what like you know we had done we done 30 million in Eva the two the 24 months prior to the deal so like you know selling a 46.2 is not like like I I told them I needed to be public about the number because I do know that the vast majority of people don't get it um and that that that is enough to give me credibility for [ __ ] Tik Tok um but it's not like the transaction itself isn't necessarily that I'm like proud of I'm proud of what we built that the the company's grown 40% since we sold it um it's said they're going to kill on that deal but now that I also understand how debt Works which I didn't understand that like again this is like knowing ver experiencing like I understood that they were going to get debt but when I realized that 80 or 90% of the money that they put in they then just immediately pulled right back out leveraging the company's books I was like well [ __ ] I could have kept the whole [ __ ] thing and gotten 90% of the money not personally guaranteed and der risk myself but with that created the same story of something that is sellable from a personal brand perspective and I think the answer is no and so um I don't regret the sale I think the sale was required for that step in my journey I think that now because we have the credibil like no one cared that I Tak 40 million in distributions no one gave a [ __ ] like it didn't matter like the day I sold my neighbors were like oh I saw you on for like congratulations I was like I was richer before I did the transaction like I was wealthier before that point um but like it allowed us to do acquisition oncom because I don't think I could have my my brand was still so I was still the CEO as far as people were concerned of that company and I needed to have that space so that I could create acquisition there our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best hub spot grow better Sean would you have done what do you think would you have done that I I think he explained it beautifully I think he explained it exactly beautifully and honestly which was that two two things you just said that I resonate deeply with me one this is the last thing you just said which is to have what you want sometimes you just need to make space and so this is like I learned this through relationships you're dating somebody you kind of they're not exactly what you want they're not bad there's nothing wrong there's nothing terrible about it so most people just stick with it for years and years and years and then they're kind of like well if there was like a much better option then yeah like I would feel more comfortable just like going being single but I've always been very quick to just if I know this isn't it I'll break up I don't need to have another great option ready uh or or or like shown to me to make it real I know that if I make space then great things can appear and sometimes you just got to do that like I've taken like when we sold bio it was the same thing I had i' had been doing this thing for six or seven years and the business was doing okay at that point and thought like you know but in my heart of hearts I knew this is never going to be massive and we had all gone into that business with the basically like yo let's do something massive so by other people's standards it might have been a good business by our our own mission it was going to be a failure I knew that and so it was when I was out with a friend and he was like I don't get what you're doing and he's like you just need to shake things up and um you know I was shook I couldn't sleep I was like he's right like I've been doing this for too long I need to shake things up and so I went into our our investor the next day and I just said um I think it's time we change things up I said I need to change things up I said you you know if you want to keep going uh I will help you hire a CEO and you can take have somebody else take this over I'll give you back my shares I don't need a thing from this like I I I will do whatever I can or give me 30 days I'm going to see if I can sell or I'm out like those are the this either way in 30 days this is going to change for me i' I've just decided to make space basically to for something he's like well what do you want to do next and uh I was like I have no idea he's like well no really like you know usually people when they're you know they they come to me it's because they already kind of lined up something else I was like no honestly I have no idea I just know that I need to make some space and so that part resonates with me and also the idea of like you like when I look back now and I'm like oh like before I sold our company if I didn't if my company wasn't going to be the next big thing I would just shut it down literally just turn it off take a zero on it and then I just started looking around and I learned this word Aqua hire in silica Valley like oh people just sell failing companies and then I learned like you know they asset sale it's like oh you could just sell the code in the assets like wait who are these buyers and I didn't even really understand what my options were and so when you talk about basically I could have refinanced I could have just refinanced basic on the business assets took 90% of the value I felt that same like stupidity later but like that's life life is basically looking back and being like I was such an idiot and that's how I Mark years of time not by like the calendar days but by number of times I look back and say God I was so dumb I didn't even understand this I was sitting on something I didn't even really under I didn't really know what I now knowing what I know now I know exactly what I should have done and at that time I didn't I wasn't even aware that I was making a mistake well the difference is like I think that we all us three actually have done where are tacticians so like I understand how to grow [ __ ] and I understand like you build this page you do this thing uh you write these words here's the customer you talk to him whatever I think the the the Gap you have to bridge is becoming a uh from tactics to strategy and I used to like make fun of all my buddies who are in finance I'm like dude you're just like an Excel monkey you don't know anything like you're just this stupid [ __ ] headphon and maybe it makes money but you don't know [ __ ] and then I realized like when they talk about debt and stuff I was like I'm not going to pay attention to any of that because I think that stupid and then I realize how it starts working and I'm like oh my God that's the strategy so it's like that's the strategy and that and I was like oh I used to think I've got good Vision I understand how this [ __ ] works and then I realized how money worked a little bit more with debt and borrowing other people's money to do this and like taking money off the table and all these like terms that I kind of heard about but I didn't exactly understand I realized [ __ ] if I'm going to be like really good at my job I I got to be good I got to understand the tactics you really also have to understand the strategy which Alex it seems like you're actually now now you get the strategy of how money in business works not just the tactics which the whole hundred million offer book which I read I think it's awesome that's mostly tactical but the Strategic [ __ ] is what you're saying of like oh you can borrow other people's money and to do this that that's some big picture [ __ ] yeah without a personal guarantee so because I be like why do I dead on the business because I don't want to risk that I was like you are not risking it like the the business is risking is it and if you're willing to do a sale for X it's like well are you willing to do like because the business is going to take the risk on either way I mean depending on the acquire but if you're selling a private Equity like I know you have a lot of a bigger Tech audience but I probably have a bigger like uh like s like I would say everyday business audience you know guys who have massive Roofing businesses or you know a huge chain of you know Teeth witing Studios you me like just just those types of businesses are the ones that tend to to follow more of my stuff and like that's usually going to be a rollup or a private Equity acquire for the most part right maybe a strategic if you like have another big teeth whitening machine that wants to buy you but like that's about it um and I I think I I resonate with what you said Sam I was thought those guys like I was like you don't even understand business and I to aggree I actually don't think they understand business but they understand the macro level of business and I think where you get really dangerous is when you know both play both games like you can because what they do is they do almost purely inorganic growth they try and staple [ __ ] together that okay we bought four companies that do you know 3 million in iida and so now we have 12 million IA and we're going to have some Equity Arbitrage and going to be able to sell this thing fincial engineering yeah saddle them up with debt and then it's just then it's just a math equation like it doesn't even matter about growing the businesses but it's like what if you do that and you could also triple all the businesses and then like that's when you create these like breathtaking home runs and that's kind of what I mean that's what we're trying to do with acquisition and I don't I don't have I don't have a I don't have a a huge need for more money unless it's a an enormous like there's nothing I can do I'm I'm have you heard have you heard Felix dentis is like how to be rich I think that's the name of the book we love it we talk about that table a lot like the comfortably poor you know comfortably Rich then you get to like rich rich just super resonated with me it's like I'm the I'm the the comfortably rich but like not the Super Rich not the like so I like everybody here we can all consume whatever we want so we can fly whatever planes we like you know you can fly private you can stay in the nicest hotels get the nicest airb go out to dinner every single night of the week at the fivestar restaurant at the michine star and you can do that for the rest of your life like you your personal needs as a human being are satisfied but I can't buy that skyscraper right there and I can't buy this huge company and so what happens it's like the things that you want to buy change and so you create a new deficit for the amount of wealth that you want again this is just assuming you like the game and so like I like the game and so I just want to keep playing it the the funny thing is that what you actually like is just playing the game and if you just said well I'm rich enough then you'd have to stop playing the game you really love and so instead you start to come up with like things you want that in actuality sound a little bit silly it's like actually I don't even think you want that skyscraper or to buy that you I I don't even think that's actually what motivates you it's just that I I'm actually Peak loving the game right now and the game only works if you care about the score and so you know it is impossible to to enjoy that you can't play the game if you've said I've already scored the maximum number of points then the game becomes kind of silly and so it's funny like this is with all of our friends it's like well why are you doing this don't you you kind of got enough money man and it's like yeah but I don't have enough enjoyment the enjoyment that game is infinite and the thing I enjoy the most is playing this game and um you know I'm so I'm GNA continue playing but in order to do so I have to like construct these silly like dreams that that I I'm not even sure I really care as much about as far as just playing the game dude that was huge and um as a side note it's like if you think there's there's kind of like I feel like two ways you can create a deficit right so one is like you create a financial deficit by saying like I want this thing it's costs a billion dollars and so I need to go make a billion dollars there's my deficit between where I am where I want to go the other side is what I was say like when you as like what are you like excited about because I said like what are the worst Parts but like I'll tell you what what's good right now is that we have finally separated mosy media which is basically like my my Lela personal brand and like the the content we put out I would say the books kind of fall under that like the courses the books all the materials we give out to um to mosy media and so what we originally were saying when we started acquisition. comom is that the mission was to make real business knowledge accessible to everyone like that was the that was the mission of the company and that is still very much the mission of mosy media what we realized is that hold Co team so like our EXC Consultants our our people who who recruit Talent our heads of sales who build out sales teams our heads of marketing who build out marketing departments and marketing functions our head of customer success who build Out product in client experience Etc like those people didn't really resonate with making business uh education accessible everyone like that wasn't actually like what their mission was and so we got really clear on what the mission of acquisition. comom is which is and this kind of came organically so it's like really exciting for me um but one of the things I've always envied about Elon is that like every company he gets involved in basically saves the world like what like he finds a way to tie the mission of what he's doing to saving the world it's like even Twitter he was like free civilization needs free speech and it's like boom I was like M how did he take a a meme platform with with tweets of arrogant dudes you know and turn it into you know free speech for civilization like that's where I think a lot of his genius is um and so for us I was like what's that thing and so we have the external gap of like yeah I want to hit the billion or whatever um but I think the internal one is that we want to build a company off of praise and not punishment and so we have this huge how we try to build things is like you can punish people or you can praise them and we believe that you get more performance out of Praise now you look at Goldman Sach you look at JP Morgan you look at McKenzie you look at Bane you look at these massive companies even some of these like huge ones and it's a lot of people are like man it's a tox toxic work environment it's really hard blah blah blah and so those are usually P punishment driven cultures and so we want to and so what's happened is like by doing that that has aligned all of our holdco team in terms of how we want to build these companies and the billion dooll Alex Lor is basically irrelevant because like to really win by their standards we need to build something that's 10 or 50 or 100 billion you know what I mean and that might take the rest of my lifetime and it'll probably happen after I die but if we can do that then we can prove one thesis which is like people want to work and most environments are set up to punish people and all you do is you raise the bar of what it takes to not get punished but what happens is people turn out of work they burn out they hate their jobs they hate their lives and I think that there's a better way and Lea and I are going to try and dedicate the rest of our lives to try to prove that and so that is the mission of acquisition. comom and what we do with the companies and we can show that that it's not just like floofy stuff and I think if it were just Lea it'd be a woman driven thing people like oh it's a girl who's saying you should be nice to people but I think I given how I look how I talk I can probably deliver that message um and it may take the rest of my life to do it but like I haven't felt like [ __ ] amped about anything in a long time the last time I was this pumped was when the mission of gym launch was to take the gym industry from its knees to its feet because the average gim owner takes home $36,000 a year in personal income um and has like maxed out credit cards and has like 18 days of cash on hand and I was like I want to fix this and what ended up happening is like I because I wasn't emotionally mature enough um I took enough licks from people really close to me both clients and employees um that I just like I just needed to put distance like I had 17 different people who worked for me try to start their version of my business you know what I mean I had uh clients try and you know like start their like because it was a it was a business based on Consulting right it was a Consulting business so like once you had kind of the models you could in the trying to beat with us now no one has succeeded um but it was enough that I was like dude you were bankrupt and like and like on the brink of divorce and you used all the stuff and like you scaled to three locations and sold them and now your family's financially set off and like now you want to attack me like it happened enough to your feet and then you kick me this is how I get repaid for this well that's how it felt that's how it felt and so I wasn't I like I think now I could handle it a lot better but at the time I just like I felt so disenfranchised I just felt hurt honestly cuz I really poured my soul into trying to fix the gym industry and so when I felt that way we created space and then it just became an asset we owned and that's why I was open to selling it um but like I haven't felt like that until now it's so funny you mentioned the Elon big mission thing like this guy he did it with Twitter too which was really funny and then uh while he was doing that deal news came out it's like oh Elon Musk impregnates like this woman who worked for him and he's like he was like he's like overp population underp population we we we were at risk of population collapse it's actually the biggest risk of all and he's like I'm just doing my part and I was like this guy Teflon dawn like how did he get away with this he spun that [ __ ] like a like he did a full like 540 on that thing spitting that to be like actually actually I was also saving the planet with that one too welcome I was like this man you're welcome like what's that thing they call it where it's like just like the male male [ __ ] like the abilities for some some men to just absolutely [ __ ] their way out of everything and uh elon's got that like he is the world he is the world leader in that I think there's wisdom in it though like in terms of like because even thinking if I wanted to create a stronger narrative because like I'm already amped about this narrative but like again it's like I think there's there's power in reframing what you do to be something that aligns with Humanity because to be fair doesn't matter what you do if like you if if you chunk up enough like people people need food right you want to feed Humanity like like a lot like a lot of these things that are necessary for civilization all like chunked up enough like are pillars of society yeah it it's all what story you're telling yourself because then you'll tell that story to others and if that story serves you then then great I mean I think I personally I think this is the Silicon Valley like uh what like PTSD or whatever where it's like anytime I hear a mission statement I'm like just shut the [ __ ] up like tell the truth you want to make money great you want your life value to increase and you realize that in order for you to get that value you had to create more value in the world and so you identified some people that needed something you provided that value in Spades whether that was dentists need better software or that's uh you know the world needs a social network or we want to send disappearing photos back and forth to each other's phones like um you know that you hear Evan Spiegel like you go look at the original landing page it of Snapchat or the emails that he sent to the sororities and fraternities where he's just like the landing page is like two chicks and a white bikini like kind of like do like taking like a naughty selfie basically and then the there's a giant timer where like the the the the photo is gonna disappear and same thing when he's emailing the the frats and swor he telling he's not saying I'm trying to you know reinvent the way that humans communicate actually you know 75% of our brains is wired for images not text and so I wanted to make a messaging app that was image-based and that you know and and then you hear him do the the pitch and he's like um you know for too long images have only been used for memories but I wanted to use images for communication the way we originally did with hieroglyphics and [ __ ] it's like bro it's okay that you thought this app was fun and cool and like that it might be a hit and it took off in like you know these like schools and because people wanted to get around you know their teachers or parents being able to see photos in their camera rooll like that's okay and uh but they always do this they always tie it back to some now the word is now it's the dword it's democratized oh yeah we're democratize access to private limos really over like and then of course what does it become right as the marketing teams get in there and the consultants get in there they're like we're we're our mission at Uber is to make Transportation as readily available as running water that's that became their mission statement it sounds [ __ ] awesome yeah but Amazing by showing up in a black limo yeah you didn't start and literally the early stories of anybody who knew Travis and Garett at Uber was like they like dude check this out push a button while they're at the at their like Michelin star dinner and be like watch this car shows up and they're like yeah that's right baller right I could see where he's at on the map like this is amazing this is my private driver you know I summon him through my app and it's like there's there's always to me like the disconnect between what I think the truth is which is a little bit skeptical and jaded and then like the revisionist history story that like sounds really admirable and Noble and like I personally have just come down and I've landed on like I'm okay with the truth I get the human nature we're kind of just Primal animals and it's okay you seek pleasure you avoid pain you like status and you you you don't want to be low status like it's okay but Alex's Alex's uh like Miss so like you know Alex maybe it start as like the mission of our company is to get your money and to put it in our bank accounts you know what I mean that like like we're changing our bank account $1 at a time and we're starting with your dollar I think you get our dollar [Laughter] like I because inevitably or I imagine it started with I just want to get rich and do dope [ __ ] to and then it changed to uh you know this pretty Grand thing of changing work through instead of using pra when did that change I think it's a yes and so Sean I'm like like the [ __ ] ometer Etc like I I I full-heartedly hear you on that and I think that one is that the truth can change and what I mean by that is because it's not like we're not talking about a fact we're talking about truth of of why someone does something and so like why someone does something can change so like when I started gym launch I I've said this the time I like the mission of gym launch was to not be broke like that was the mission of gym lunch but what happened is after I saw the lives that got transformed from it and I was no longer broke the mission had to change because I had accomplished that mission so the mission had to get bigger in order to continue to expand that because I had families relied on me employ employes Etc customers and so it did truly become to take its KN uh knes from its knes to the gym industry from its knees to his feet right and so like acquisition. comom started with the thing that I was passionate about because the only thing I was passionate about was just spreading like good business like I love talk about business it's like my favorite thing in the whole world ictures about business I write books about business I make cours about business make content about business like and then I do business in the meantime like I [ __ ] love business and so that was the only thing that I felt passionate about and so that's what I made the mission about but as we've walked the path realizing that like the reason the business business have done really well for us is because of the cultures that we create and we believe that th those cultures um create better businesses and honestly also better working environment like generate really good bottom line but also really great experiences for the people who who work there and so like I haven't been amped about it and so like the truth of why I want to go there now and now I see that a much bigger picture than I did when we started it two or three years ago um I think that I think your reasons evolve and so I think that it it makes sense that I think it's both honestly like personal goals he was like he had transferred money from that person's account to his to the degree that he could buy whatever he wanted and so I think you just think more about it and you're like why do I want to do this because you have to have a reason otherwise you just you you go into a ball of nothingness and so yeah well look I mean and the I think the best way to actually learn that um we were talking about the last episode we talked about uh what's the uh restaurant Panda Express guy yeah yeah and then and we were like you know he he he just sells like orange chicken like that's not exactly inspiring but like he he he employs like 20,000 people and he like gives these guys I think he we were talking about I have my notes here he gives them all like he pays a little bit for them to go to toony Robbins he gives them like the Think and Grow Rich books and like all these books and he's like yeah like the whole chicken [ __ ] like that's kind of cool and all but like I'm actually like taking an hourly wage worker and we're trying to like Elevate them and so I'm like oh I can get behind that I'm I'm in on that and if you look at like a lot of non- tech or non silic like companies who employ like 30,000 people and they're like yeah you know we sell tires and that's cool but I'm really just trying to like where we we create jobs and that's very fascinating and that's really exciting and that's cool it's better for the economy or like you know some of these like really boring brick and moing brick and morar businesses I think that's actually where you see a lot of really cool missions or like um if you I've read the have youever read about the Coke brothers um Oh you mean Coke like Coke Industries yeah yeah yeah yeah Coke Industries so basically it started with the dad he was like an oil guy and then they Ed the byproduct of creating oil to create all types of plastics and whatever and so now it's arguably it goes back and forth of the biggest privately owned company in America and he was like no like my whole thing is like freedom for people you know and I want to like teach them that they have autonomy and like through working here he's got a whole book on his Management systems and he's like that more so what I'm inspired about is like uh is like giving empowering people and so anyway when I read about those like older companies I think that that's a bit more inspiring than like some dork saying that he's changing the world one like computer ship at time when it's like uh I don't know like that's not exactly inspiring you know what I mean maybe it hasn't played out yet yeah yeah yeah like if Bill Gates said he like when he started was like I want to have a computer and everyone's like okay and then he did it yeah and so I think I think part of it is also like what snapshot on the timeline are we looking at but d i 100% agree with you like I love like you it has because basically it shifts from internal to external like in the beginning you do it for you obviously you do it because you get you get praise instead of punished like you have good more good [ __ ] than bad [ __ ] so you keep doing it but once the thing that was good no longer like the diminishing Return of the pleasure of more money isn't there anymore then you have to find a new you find a new goal like you said and then and if it also coincides with other people being motivated by not making Alex rich but by proving a point that we can create companies that reward instead of punish and actually have better returns like I'm Juiced and like we haven't proved it yet that's fine we haven't proved it yet we will I want to ask you two two questions the first is around people you admir so we talked about the Panda Express guy on our just our own last episode because we were featuring it was like crazy Rich AG basically was the third of the episode and then uh it turns out he lives near you or whatever like you know you're both in Vegas um who are some people that you admire so um I always find this interesting to hear who kind of like stands out and why uh for for different folks so who are some people that you admire either past or present you know people that you've met um because I know that this kind of like getting famous on YouTube thing opens up a bunch of doors you meet a bunch of cool people that like you otherwise you expand your circle of people you you get to know um through this stuff so who are some people that you admire well I definitely admire Andre Patron uh from Panda Express because they're a married couple who built this whole thing and they didn't they never took out outside money and they've owned the whole thing privately they 2600 locations they do 3.7 billion with 27% net margins and they take $935 million a year in personal income and I think that's only possible because they have created a new vision for what they wanted the company be about which is about their employees um I am inspired by Warren Buffett you know what I mean I mean I I I am because of the long-term mentality he has and he built Berkshire hathway and in some ways I feel like he he built it he has like a beautiful life story of like just believing in the power of compounding and patience and like that's what I feel like his virtues are that he's demonstrated in rational decision- making um I would say that for us it's like if we can build something like that but just with our own our own spin our own zest which is around praise not punishment and building companies that like we can win by their scoreboard but we do it our way um so that's the Warren angle and um I mean I admire Elon a lot um a ton you know just like what we were talking about earlier like his ability to see vision and connect to a larger Mission he's seem he's been able to masterfully do that every single company he's been a part of um and his track records incredibly [ __ ] impressive um and he just continues to like defy the laws of like what seems to be like normal or possible over and over and over again and so I think just like II just like stares into the abyss and says like let's do it I think that's something that I really really admire um he obviously has flaws like all of us do but I think he also has been really good about like owning his flaws um and being public about that he's just a human and I think he may create a new model for how big public CEOs rod and maybe that you know maybe were in the beginning of of That World um and uh I think on the totally other side of the point I think I admire what like Mr Beast has done from a personal branding perspective um I've been able to to get to know him really well um and uh and Jim's Jim thinks really big and uh has tremendous work ethic and I think seeing the merge like seeing where all these things are like Elon has been able to build a personal brand and you know in a lot of ways like if you're a fan of Elon you want to buy all of the things you just happens to have enormous monetization vehicles um and to your point Sam about like how they use like yeah sure we make tires yeah sure we sell orange chicken um like in a lot of ways I see like all the companies that we have in acquisition. comom is like yeah of course we transact we build businesses but like the reason we do it is this and I think that's um really dope and so that's that's like those are probably the like if you were to if you were to mix like what are the things that I'm drawing inspiration from at burn it's a and if you look at what we're doing it probably would make sense to see all three of those as the three biggest kind of influencers you got like Mr Beast on personal brand side here you've got Warren Buffett on the investment side then Elon from like the big vision and I feel like those three things are probably where I draw the most inspiration from in terms of like our day-to-day and what we trying to do what's interesting about you is that you're pretty good at you're very catchy so like the whole knees to feet thing is is pretty awesome um and then uh what was the line for your current company it was uh reward versus punish yep you're pretty reward we would have beat him we would have beat him at their game and we wouldn't do it our way well you said we want to beat them on we want to use their scoreboard but do it our way so you've got you're quite lyrical um you've also done a few there's like actually a handful of things that you've talked about very uh like casually that I've caught on to that I really like so for example you say uh you say dessert what do you say dessert every day or never skip dessert never skip dessert and then you also because your whole like dieting thing is you eat all of your protein earlier on and then you're like all right now I have uh I fat and carbs I we can go big on those uh and like you've done like a few things outside of buiness bus that I find like almost more impressive or I actually use on my daily life more so than your business stuff which I actually found is pretty funny um you also have I don't know if you've seen the Sean but if you Google like there's this like 23y old Alex who does a thing where he's like I'm G to do a bulk over the next like eight weeks and he has like before during and after photos and like that stuff I look at significantly more than a lot of your business stuff I find that some of your Fitness uh and diet stuff like more interesting and applicable in my day-to-day life than the business stuff um I'm shocked a living for like I like I I joked about it in the comments once I was like people like admire our like my way of thinking about things in business and I was like for a decade I did that with Fitness I just don't talk about it because everyone feels entitled to opinion because they have a body and I just and I hate I hate getting into the they're like well what about salt I'm like dude just [ __ ] off like just you know me like I I've so little patience for it cuz I'm like look at you and like if you were more in shape and by the way no one who's been more in shape than me has ever criticized any of the content ever it's just like people who are wealthier than you never say [ __ ] about business ADV like about you know like no one ahead of you ever shits on well the cool thing about it is like I I use the fitness analogy ton in business because I'm like well it's hard but it's simple and that if you lift this much weight and eat like this for a year you're not necessarily going to look like Arnold or lean or whatever but you're going to be pretty good or better than where you are now and you just got to do it for like two years and you got to like be fairly strict about it um so like that's why the carryover I is quite fun watching you do both of those things yeah I appreciate it yeah I mean simple not easy I feel like is the the [ __ ] theme of of so many things like Fitness Nutrition marriage business like simple to do or simp simple to understand conceptually very hard to do what's the uh simple not easy for marriage I think it's it's reward more than you punish I mean it actually comes down to that so like okay if I want my wife to scratch my back more I have to wait until she scratches my back of her own valtion and then I have to reward her immediately and then she will want reward more and so she will do it again uh and then and I reward again I reward again very pavlovian of you well yeah I mean I think we're all that you know what I mean fundamentally there's three things you can do when anyone does anything around you is that you can punish them for doing it you can ignore that they did it or you can Praise Him for doing it I've heard um the Tony Robbins like I forgot what he calls it but it's like the four uh the four styles of being in a relationship he says something like this I don't know have you heard this thing it's like um the first one uh let me see if I can remember it off top my head so basically he goes uh you know F first one's like a baby it's like uh I need love and I don't have to give anything to you so it's just like I cry you give and that's it like uh you better be happy with that Arrangement so that's like one relationship you can have one style of relationship you can have and it obviously like doesn't work out very well once you're an adult um you can't just cry expect to be given everything you want and then then not have to do anything in return baby love so that's baby love then he has uh the next one which is basically Tit for Tat so it's this is where almost everybody falls into so this is probably going to sound familiar at least to like to an extent and is probably the root of all problems in relationships is Tit for Tat which is you measure what you get and then you give based on that uh when when you're giving a lot you give a lot but then as soon as somebody breaks a cycle and they short you consciously or or unconsciously they they they don't do what you what you wanted um you also withdraw or pull back some amount of giving and then they reciprocate uh give they they also measure and pull back and both sides do that you end up with a sort of a race to the bottom and so that's tit fortat and that's where most people stand and they it's just a cycle that resets over and over again um the next one is unconditional love which is basically I give regard of what you give back uh I give because that's who I am uh I give because that's how I that's how I want to roll in my relationship and I control what I control and uh obviously that's way better and like to me that's the simple not easy in of being in a relationship is just go go unconditional mode rather than tit fortat um and then he has like some Higher One which is monk monk love or something like that he calls it where it's spiritual love it's like I love you even though you hate me uh like a monk can be like I I I pray for and love even my enemies and those trying to hurt me and like you know nobody gets there but like that's aspirationally what you could what you could get to as well is like you know love like a monk who who loves even their enemies um and those who try to cause harm and so that those are the the four levels of love I remembered Alex do you ever so like I saw this video of you the other day and now everyone's like giving you a hard time or they're just teasing you in a good way about like your outfit because you wear the same clothing all the time so you made a video about it and you go instead of just saying oh it's comfortable you go dude I'm just more dark W did them these shorts you want to go work out I can go work out you want to go to a restaurant yeah that's that's what he said he goes you want to go sliming these are waterproof you want to go uh out to a restaurant these look just good enough that I can go and do that I can do anyone I can do anything I'm darwinian you're not I win you lose I bought the shoes you had mentioned because you you were like these sandals these are the perfect sandal for working out running through you know like walking through rain climbing a hill or like being at the office and in the comments everyone's like yo what what's the sandal what's the sandal where's the affiliate link we can't find it and then some dude like 50 comments down he like dude that's what the it's this brand uh the the The Nightshade color of this thing I was like all right respect to this guy for finding it I'm gonna go buy this thing do but do do you ever like does your mom and dad ever like hey quit being such a douche and just wear what we bought you because be nice like at what point do you like are you like this makes sense for me and also like it's good for the brand um versus like live a little and like let's just [ __ ] around do you know what I mean I think um yeah like good for the brand is is actually not like really a thought when it comes to it like I I believe that like brand comes as a result of rather than like conscious you know what I mean like like people were like so when did you think of never skip dessert I was like I was making fun of Fitness people because my original audience was Fitness people who obsessed about like not eating cookies and I was like [ __ ] off yeah be like eat dessert you know what I mean but do it in a way that you S have a sixpack the all the time so that was why I never skip it was always like never skip BL day never skip Monday I was like never skip um like the Cavs thing is because like I genuinely have started training I started I start every training session since since a girl told me that she thought that my calvs weren't big uh it's been like 12 years 14 years that I I start every session with caves um and so like my calvs had grown a lot and so everyone's like oh Janette like my calvs were sticks and I train the [ __ ] out so like is it part of my brand yeah because it's in some ways like it's true Lindsay yeah thank you for motivation Lindsay 14 years of fuel you gave me and and it's the the outfit thing is actually because my it's my content team that wanted to make content about it because they're like dude you're [ __ ] Maniac with this like I feel like people should know this because everyone who knows you like in person knows that like like when they walked in for like almost a year and a half there was stacks of shoe boxes and I would wear different shoes for a day an hour a day a week and they kind of graduated to like if they're good enough I can walk around the apartment then I'll walk around for their day if I can walk around with them for a week and I still like them and most of them never got there so I have a few finalists that got to that point but like I think I just like obsessed about making things better same things like if I do end up doing a you know if there is a good enough company that does no strips like I'm going to iterate the product a bunch of times until I think it's absolutely Untouchable and then I'll say this is the one I use and I can say that say that with confidence because I I did the the work on it for me I hate I just hate having to change like I don't know what it is it's like it means that I started my day like not thinking about what I was going to do so I was like okay well if I can create a setup or a uniform for myself that I can be in the most environments so for me I'm really never in less than 40 degree weather like ever because I usually tend to be in warmer spots of the country in general uh and so like this this outfit goes 40 to 120 degrees and so and I can go to the gym I can go to the pool I can walk for hours I can walk all day I can go to a nice restaurant I can do all those things so because if they need but that's crazy because your wife who I've seen she dresses lovely she like it's it's fashionable so her hair always looks nice you know what I mean just said it goes 40 to 120 like a like a car goes Z to 60 and like this flannel this jacket right here this thing goes 40 to 120 once once it's once it's below 40 I get CTS I have to put pants um but like up until then I'm pretty much good within that range and so like I can I can Buton think like this thing can go full full sleeves and like I'm like that's when I'm in like mass cold mode or if I go to a restaurant there fire sleaves I can have that right but otherwise um you know like I'm in Beater mode like we go to the gym you know mean we go to the pool we go to beach we go wherever I'm gonna be in Beater mode you know what I mean this is Ive put you sport mode like a car yeah well my whole outfit has sports mode people are like Pro Sport like my whole outfit has sports mode and comfort mode and weather mode and I can I can do that and so I mean like I I enjoy I enjoyed finding each of these things almost as much as I enjoy wearing them and I and I every morning and this is like every morning when I put this on I get like a little a little boost where I'm like I know that I've picked every single one of these pieces out and I have no doubt that this is the best thing for me like for my day and so like I know that the brand of white Beaver that I have on right now I tried 40 or 50 other brands on and I want I knew this one sat where I wanted to sit it wasn't too thick on the shoulder or too thin it didn't drop into some string on the back some people like that I didn't want that um like beaters themselves are thinner than tank tops they're ribed so that they fit right I think even like have you ever seen those Under Armour tank tops or those like shrink WRA ones like they don't look good like I think they look synthetic and for me I think they look like kind of synthetic like I don't like it I like cotton better um and so like there's just a number of iterations like talked about the shoe I could tell you a zillion things that I looked at like I mean I just I I have like an Excel sheet that like I was I was like breaking I thought you would have I have a few friends like that I'm not as extreme but I like buying and testing like a ton of stuff I think SE did Sean wears ordered like 20 of the same shirts what products this is actually interesting this is I don't think this is like too inside baseball but what products and Brands uh do you obsess with and love like uh in your daily life well um I won't say them because I'm in talks with like Hass um to try and figure something out um but I I will I will caveat that with I think that in general for people like my life might be different than theirs and I think just being delivered like so many people just like sleep walking through life that like they're always sitting there with their pants that just don't fit just right or always don't have this thing like a lot of stuff I modify so like I like my gym bag like there was a video about my gym bag like I tried out a bunch of different bags and finally found a bag that I liked and then I modified the [ __ ] out of it and like that bag now every time I go to a gym people are like dude that bag's awesome I was like I know because I made it for this function and it's great and I love it it's really good you know so I think it's more just like finding the like whatever you're 40 to 120 is because maybe you live in Michigan and it's always cold it's like well you're gonna have a different standard standard wear what shorts are are they I thought you used to wear just Jorts I used to make fun of you for wearing I used to wear Jorts but Jorts the so I'll tell you I used to wear Jorts because they were more comfortable um and I could do more casual settings with them right they're like always showing up in like athletic shorts you mean just it just it looks it looked like almost too casual I think um and a lot of restaurants are like no athletic wear and so I was like okay well that's annoying and so then it went through this whole thing where I had to find like the best short and then while I was doing that like the ones that I have have back hooks on them so that if I can hang them too dry I've got an iPhone pocket in there that's built in so like cuz I hate having to sit and then you take it out of your pocket yeah every time like it's such a pain like there should be a pocket for this everyone has one right and there's like a little place that I could put like an IP iPad pencil in my shorts because I I use my iPad a lot um like I've got cargo on the other side and these are stretchy but not too stretchy but they're stretchy enough what Freight you hauling in there buddy what do you got what type what do you need the cargo gummy bears no a lot of times it's mic packs so a lot of times it's mic packs we're getting like right now my mic packs in my cargo pocket um but like I could fit a water bottle in here if I need it um or uh or hotel Key like Hotel keys there whenever we're traveling uh where I use my nicat because I chew Nicorette so I'll have nicat in my pocket if I go on podcast so I just i' like always have the stuff that I I need there you know well it's we the best the best way possible man this is these are my favorite kinds of PODS when you you find out you know it's like I want to see you're weird uh that's when I know you until I see you're weird I don't actually know you I feel this is my this is my personal my personal thing and uh I'm glad we went down this Rabbit Hole cuz I got to see you're weird it's funny because we light right now my actually I'm not going to show you the brand but um I've got this backpack here right and this back guack I wore um I can wear it like when we travel I can wear it everywhere and it has everything that I used to travel and I can travel for for four weeks with that because all I have to pack is three pairs of shorts that are identical that are multi everything and then I just have an amount of tanks that is whatever the laundry cycle of the trip is and that's it and I could put one flannel on top and I'm I'm good like and I don't even have to use the expansion part of that backpack which I have options if I need it uh and so like and it has a cool front thing for all my wires that's flat so it doesn't take up space like there's just a lot of like and I went through a zillion different bags to find that I went through a zillion different bags to find the gym bag but like now when whenever I pick it up I'm like this is the best bag for the job what the best uh way you spend money for you personally like not like a business investment that uh you know you're you think it's a great Roi or you get a bunch of joy out of it or it's like uh dope for you um that is let's say not your content team and not like something that's directly in the business yeah I mean I would say jsx is is wonderful since it's in the southwest so it's a uh it's like semr private flying yeah it's pretty good oh it's great I mean it gives you so like I the only reason we fly private is because it's safe it's the only reason we do it like and you a lot less hassle but jsx allows you all the benefits of private flying this like a [ __ ] jsx plug but it's really good um and a ticket's like 300 bucks when it would normally be like 50 so if you want to fly jsx from Vegas to Saw Lake or Vegas to Scottdale or Vegas to to LA um it's 300 bucks it's nothing right and you really you walk up to the plane you get on the plane and then you walk off the plane like that's it you know what I mean like it's it's just like private there's just a few other people there and private flying in my opinion has the most benefit for the shortest travels and the least benefit for the long travels because like long travels you want to fly as high as possible as fast as possible the bigger you know the bigger the plane the better and um and by percentage of the trip you know the the going through security and dealing with the hassle if you have a 5 and 1 half hour flight 5 and 1 half hours versus like 7 hours of of Transit doesn't like the day scw like it's kind of like it doesn't materially change a lot but on a short travel where you're going like sub I would say sub two hours like you can you can double the length of the trip or triple the length of the trip by going in reverse cut it in half or by a third by flying private and so that's where I feel like you get the the highest marginal benefit it's also the cheapest uh private flight to the shortest ones CU it's by hour so that's kind of like when we when we when we go back and forth and uh usually the only times we'll fly private is if we can't get a direct uh jsx flight well we'll wrap up in a second here but last time you were here Sean asked a a question about your portfolio um and I want to follow up on it what's your portfolio looking like in terms of like your um both your private Investments as well as like what are you doing with your money are you keeping in equities bonds cash I think last time you were super heavy cash if I remember correctly or yeah that's what it was it was treasuries you're like I'm almost entirely treasuries what's it what's it looking right now in terms of like a if you could do like a pie chart in percentages probably still half treasuries except now they're a lot better than before yeah so probably half treasuries probably have a quarter in just like indexes um and the other quarter is in private companies so pretty simple yeah probably not by value over time that that treasury part is going to continue to decline as we do more and more deals um but yeah I I still think that like I mean I don't know what the future looks like so I like I I tend to like having lots of cash like I feel good I I never want to not be able to do a deal that's going to 10x because I don't have cash like that like the the cost of missing the 10x is well worth the quote inflation that I'm suffering for the difference between the treasury yield and the inflation cost well thank you for uh coming on again you um if you go to our YouTube page my for sman you're actually like the I don't know what they call that video but you're like our main page pinned video for a while yeah and it's like a quote of like I've come to the conclusion that I just like to work and I don't like when people ask me why am I working all the time or something like that but uh thanks for doing this again and uh uh we really appreciate it no I mean thank you guys for having me on and thank you to the audience for maybe making requests to have me back on so I I I appreciate it and it it means a lot to me so thank you guys for just being awesome host in general awesome well that's the pod [Music]

I'm gonna blow your mind ready so Scotland you know Scotland you've heard of that country Scotland right you've heard of that place familiar land of kilts and sheeps but also redheads but okay and redheads but it's also home to one of the coolest SAS businesses that I've ever heard of so it's called petroleum exports uh they it's known as uh pet tax [Music] let's jump in we got a bunch of stuff today we're gonna do what's called a business breakdown duel Sean and I you know is that a western duel I guess is uh we both did a business breakdown and we didn't know that the other one was gonna do it and so now we're gonna compare I'm gonna go first which gives you the advantage because the person who goes last always usually wins in rap battles because that's it's always like when you you know like when I do you know when they do the Applause or like person a person B if person B always wins I get to hear you say your thing and then I can make fun of what you said yeah so anyway you're gonna you get the advantage but that's okay so I'll go first okay but before I go first I've got to give a shout out to Andrew Lynch from net income um it's a sub stack it's where I I found uh this particular business and I'm just and I'm stealing uh a lot of his numbers but I'm gonna blow your mind ready so Scotland you know Scotland you've heard of that country Scotland right you've heard of that place familiar land of kilts and sheeps but also I think they're sheeps there I don't actually know that's how little I know about Scotland but also redheads but okay and redheads but it's also home to one of the coolest SAS businesses that I've ever heard of so it's called petroleum exports uh they it's known as uh pet tax pad tax it's a challenging name I know and it's a highly technical specialist software crucial for oil and gas operations you can go to p-e-t-e-x.com to check it out so pull that up but pet pet tax it's a highly technical specialist software that's the backbone of some of the most important operations in the oil and gas industry and it sounds boring and that's because it is however they last year they made 78 million pounds in Revenue which is about 100 million dollars USD and on that 100 million dollars in Revenue about 67 million of it was profit and of that of that profit they basically took out all the money so they paid a dividend of 41 million pounds which is about 60 million dollars and that was paid to the owner and it wasn't even retained to the company which means for every dollar they took about 52 dollars went directly to the or 52 cents went directly to the owner's pocket now here's the cool part none of this is rumors this isn't hearsay I'm not like telling you I heard a story because in the UK If you're a privately held company that hits a certain threshold in Revenue you have to submit your reports and you could just log in it's called company's house you can just go there and you can log in you can see all this information and so I went and looked at many many many years of their data and I'm going to tell you a story about how this company came to be so it was started by this guy name we're gonna call him Aid his name's Abe his name he's he's a Muslim guy very very very challenging uh first and last name can you see his name can you tell me how to pronounce that do you know how to pronounce that is the first name and the last name it's very challenging there's a d and there's a j together that's a very challenging okay so you are calling him ape or he goes by Abe I'm calling him Abe his last name is if you look at it if it meant many Muslim AES but uh we're gonna call him his last name has a d and a j next to each other I don't even know how to pronounce that sound so I'm sorry it's a very challenging name to pronounce so he started the company in 1990 it was based in Al Aberdeen Scotland which is basically like a hub for oil industry it's kind of like similar to what Houston in America is and the company originally served as a petroleum consultant for in uh Consultants to the control petroleum industry as well as retailers and they would create these mathematical models to help uh people in the in the oil and gas industry manage their projects and so today they've kind of pivoted from Consulting to providing software they only have 420 customers and their core product is composed of complex products which are complex features that with descriptions like a multi-phase network modeling and optimization and thorough Dynamics fluid characterization package so pretty complicated stuff so as I said they started as a Consulting business and they did have done 78 million pounds in Revenue last year which is about 100 million USD 58 million USD in profit and 50 million in dividends meaning the company doesn't require much capital x so they made all this profit in most all of it 58 million profit 50 million came out of the business and went directly to the owner's pockets and he's been doing this for years and years and years their business biggest expense is employees so because they're based in the UK they pay UK software engineer salaries which are lower than the US making their average all-in cost per each employee of which they have 86 of them only a hundred and one thousand pounds per year so the which means that they are doing 911 pounds 900 911 000 pounds in Revenue per employee so 9x 9x basically Roi per person that they hired so yeah this company absolutely kills it and I want to tell you when I was analyzing this company and um if you look up Andrew Lynch his sub stack he does a really good job of explaining the technical details of the company I want to explain some of the entrepreneurial takeaways that I had so if you go to the top uh link Sean in our doc um or at the beginning of the story you'll see the sub stack where you can it's his Andrew Lynch has a thing called net income and that's where I discovered this so I want to tell you some of my takeaways takeaway one Focus plus time that's what this guy did so everyone talks about Focus but what does Focus means you basically in my opinion need to focus enough to turn your idea into a machine and then after that I think you can deviate some attention away from that if you want but the company needs focus and that Focus took takes time so I went back and I looked at a lot of their uh revenue and so did Andrew so if you scroll down Sean you'll see a graph of the revenue and what you'll notice is that it took them 15 years to get to 10 million dollars in Revenue 10 million pounds I'm going to call it dollars so 10 million dollars in revenue and I know a lot of people I think maybe you have done this with one of your businesses got to close to 10 million Revenue in like 1.5 or one or two years actually and so 15 years particularly in like the tech Internet space it feels horribly long but I think that's okay that's the right feeling and so what I try to do something I've been thinking about for a while is I ask myself in 10 or 20 years will I be happy if I started this today and that's a really good quote but that answer is incredibly murky more often than not sometimes it's like a I think yes it's a very murky thing and there's this famous story about Jeff Bezos when he started Amazon he has this thing called the regret minimalization framework where he says this story about he's like well even though he had this good job I decided to start Amazon because in 80 years when I meet or when I'm 80 years old will I be proud that I started it today the answer was yes but in that same story he also said that he thought at most Amazon could make is a hundred million dollars a year so he he's not like he had the full picture so it was like yeah I think this can work and so I went and talked to darmesh who's the founder of dharmesha the founder of HubSpot I also talked to Kip who was the CMO and Kip joined HubSpot in year five I asked Kip how big do you think HubSpot could be when he joined you know how big did he think so HubSpot today is worth 25 billion dollars when I asked him he said I thought he could hit a billion dollars in valuation there's a little bit of a stretch but I thought we could do a billion dollars uh in valuation meaning like what's that 80 million in Revenue I don't know how that's something like that and then I asked darmesh I go how big do you think he could get he goes really I didn't have any idea but I knew that all I wanted was a thousand customers who would each pay 250 which by the way this is only three million dollars a year in revenue and I thought that would be a pretty cool Milestone and so the reason isn't all we or the outcome isn't always clear of is this worth it now the reason this is important is because the biggest pain in business is not just failing but it's failing slowly and spending like a decade working on something and wasting your the most non-renewable resource there is time wasting that time and I mean it's significantly worse I think than losing millions of dollars a year in one or two years and then quitting and so that's where the it's kind of an art it's a skill it's an intuition it's Talent that's where all this stuff comes into place so tactically what does this mean Ben Franklin said a small leak will stake a great ship Warren Buffett said so you find yourself in a chronically leaky boat energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks so the point being only work on [ __ ] as long as your boat ain't leaking as long as you don't got any holes in that boat but here's the thing every early Safe Company yeah everything's leaky at first so I went back to darmesh and back to kit and I go guys tell me about this HubSpot right now your guys's net revenue retention I don't know what it is exactly but I think it's like a hundred and five percent meaning for every dollar that someone spends at HubSpot now the next year they're gonna spend a dollar and five cents and he said uh and Chip and uh Kip they said a few things so I'm gonna mix it up a little bit but uh or I'm gonna kind of interchange with what they said but I believe it was Kip who said our churn at first was terrible it was beyond bad at one point we were losing 30 percent of customers on an annual base on an annual basis I then asked uh darmesh I go was your guys's churn really that bad he goes yeah it was definitely really bad it took about five years in order to like get it to where it was a good place and I said well what did you do to fix that and he said our goal was not to make customers happy was to make happy customers meaning everything from our branding pitch Marketing sales service everything should be thought out in a process where the outcome was a happy customer and that meant it was everyone's job marketing needs to be reaching better fit customers who are less likely to churn sales needed not sales shouldn't oversell and make sure they only qualify that these customers will likely succeed which helps reduce the churn products needs to make sure they don't just build new features but build a feature that reduces insurance and they have to make these features make sure these features get adopted and churn is churn reduction is a team sport you also have to remember there's a power law which is 90 of stickiness will be driven by 10 of the product and Company features and not to add 100 features and instead just find ones that work and double down on those so the point being All Ships are leaky at first but hopefully you can figure out a way to do it and last but not least my takeaway ten dollars a month it's rarely gonna feed a bunch of hungry mouths so our listeners including you and I sometimes I do this as well I had a 25 a month product a lot of times what we do is we look for arbitrages or we look for like small little hacks that's neat that's all cool and all every once in a while it gives you that dopamine hit but this company the reason I like it is you know how much they charge per year 300 000 a year for a license to their company they only have 450 clients and Andrew in his sub stack article he said something great he goes imagine you're running an oil rig that extracts hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil per day Brent crude is currently uh crude is currently trading at 75 per barrel so every 100 Barrel is 75 7 500 in Revenue your it guy comes up to you and says boss attacks just raise their prices by 10 I think we could save three thousand dollars annually if we switch software providers to another thorough Dynamic fluid characterization package instead you tell them to piss off don't touch a thing just make sure nothing breaks it means like three thousand dollars there's nothing in the grand scheme of a huge Capital intense business so they put their price up 10 and everyone moves moves on and goes on before because look it helps them solve their business so or it helps them solve problems in their business it makes your business better so this is my breakdown of this company I love it I love this company I love these Scottish guys Jonathan's giving me a clap what do you think about this one yeah Jonathan you like that one oh yeah that was you you kind of touched it all you got the opening story hit with the impact and then the three big takeaways at the end and that like q a with Kiff and darmesh was a nice touch yeah that was a good touch I like how you brought that in the um there was a a bit of a spelling and pronunciation challenge at the beginning but you overcame that and I'm proud of you for doing that you know what I say I so I went to speech class when I was a kid by the way and I always used to tell people I just got a big tongue my tongue's real thick I got a thick tongue it's something I'm big tongued yeah I got I got fat Thug a pet see I give it a fat tongue it's like a it's like a it's like a snail in there it's like a slug I got a slug of a tongue I got molasses in my mouth I don't know what to say it's hard for me to say some words sometimes it's like the further away from St Louis a person gets or a company gets like the harder it is to explain them um that's interesting you know I I guess two days on mine right now I bet there's opportunity to create like another pedex basically which is uh with machine learning and AI you could go into these kind of like Old School Big dollar type companies and be like hey look we have the ability to process your data or to give you insights that's going to save you money like yeah 10 efficiency gain 20 efficiency gains and I bet that these opportunities you know have existed but the the more powerful mlna I get the more those opportunities open up and the bottleneck is people who even understand what problems exist inside of uh you know some Shale gas company or inside of Exxon Mobil and then being able to go sell into them there was a guy who I met very early on when I was doing my startup I didn't really know any other entrepreneurs but there's one guy who also went to Duke and I wonder what happened to him I haven't kept in touch but I think his name was Evan Anderson and he was building a company that was um selling to I was called osberg yeah this is exactly right let's see what happened with this company um so it was selling to um companies that were in Oklahoma so I was like well you moved to Oklahoma and he was like yeah this is what our customers are and I was like who's your customers and it was like all the oil and gas companies that uh that are in America and what he was doing at that time was basically quote-unquote Big Data uh big data for oil and gas and I was like that's a great idea I'm looking at it now he's still there CEO 14 years later so I've got this company's been been pretty successful and I was like I would check in with him and be like you know what's the challenge and at this time I'm working on a sushi restaurant chain and he's like you know I'll spend six months just courting the right guy the right suit at this uh at this company I gotta take him to uh you know a football game I gotta invite his family over we got to get to know him we got to get him comfortable with this uh you know the software but once I get once I close that deal these deals are going to be worth millions and millions of dollars over time they're never going to rip us out once we get in and so um I I'm curious how this company is doing today but I know that you know 15 years ago I was like this is a great idea and I just I I intuitively knew it because I was like the same effort it's taking me to do this silly sushi restaurant thing he's spending the same amount of time he's just working for a much bigger prize with much more defensibility and a much clearer value where he's going into an industry that's like never had uh you know doesn't have this this sort of software capability he's like I will sit here until I understand your problems and then I will build solutions for this and I just love that approach I think that's a like if people are willing to kind of like eat [ __ ] and go outside of their like kind of comfort zone of problem areas they understand there's pretty big opportunities yeah and it's cool did you see this graph from Andrew Lynch of this company's Revenue yeah it's just like a perfect hockey stick but over a long period of time over a really long period of time I mean that's something you want to talk about like this 15 years to get to 10 million you know respect for continuing and making it all work that's not for me what's the boys quote uh why is everyone make fun of getting rich quick it's the best way to get rich and I'm going to tell you about a company in a second here that said in their first week they did a million dollars of sales and never went less than that from there and you think that that's not true correct I think it's I think it's a lie but I love a good lie I love a good life tell me about this give me a good underestimate how much of uh startup stories are just lies okay so here's my here's my big business breakdown I see your duel and I uh I raise you um In My Head by the way we were doing an old-fashioned Western duel but now I decided it's American Gladiators and your laser non-blazer and we're going at it on the chest but so this morning I was thinking about who's lying out there who's lying men's problems that way okay so most people have heard apparently you got a little you got a little situation is that the issue no no no that's not how we got actually here's the here's the actual train of thought I was thinking about um these T-Shirt Company a little segue here to tell you how my brain works so the thing about these t-shirt companies I don't know if you've seen this but basically in the last kind of like four years there's been a bunch of companies start started that succeeded that did the most obvious thing and I've seen this happen again and again that there's these windows of time where Big Ideas are just hidden in plain sight and so basically in the last four years a bunch of companies have started to do such a simple thing they just sell basic plain men's t-shirts and these were the Big d2c Ideas so like anybody who wanted to do e-commerce or Drop Shipping or d2c build a brand the opportunity was sitting right in front of everybody it was just men's t-shirts so you have Cuts fresh clean tees true classic tees built Basics all of these companies that in the last sort of four year window have built 100 million dollar plus companies so some of them do about 50 million a year in sales some of them do 100 or 150 million dollars a year in sales so this kind of range but to go in like a three year period to get to 150 million in sales that's what true classic tees did is just bananas to be honest and so um I'll tell you the uh the numbers for True classic so year one uh let's see where the video so I think go okay you're one 15 million you're two 90 million you're three 150 million in top line revenue and um and they did it all through Facebook ads selling plain you know white black blue men's t-shirts and that's the same thing I think fresh clean teas is somewhere like 50 million north of 50 million in Revenue uh I think Cuts is over 100 million um it's crazy that these companies all scaled so fast doing this such an obvious thing where is the there was no massive Innovation and so I was thinking about this I was like man there's these windows of time and then I thought about what what are other windows that I've seen like this and I stayed in the e-commerce world and I thought about oh back in 2017 both Roman and hymns launched doing basically the same thing and they launched within like a couple months of each other basically people had the same idea at the same time and both of them became Billion Dollar Plus companies doing the same thing what they did was you know I guess the summary is they took advantage of a uh what do we call it an inflection uh Sam blows this regulation inflection in this case well this was a regulation inflection this is a regulatory inflection and so what happened was um there was proven market demand for drugs like Viagra uh or Propecia or Rogaine and so hair loss or erectile dysfunction there was a proven like business there and they started like in the early 90s and so by 2017 the patents expired for those and when the patents expired have you ever taken a Viagra or anything like that haven't have you no but if someone if someone told me it's awesome I would but I've never thought it's awesome go so so the patents expired and basically now there was like generic versions of these and so what and at the same time there's another regulatory inflection which was that telemedicine was becoming more and more things were getting opened up for telemedicine meaning you could prescribe drugs without going to the doctor so drugs without a doctor was the key kind of like just you know frame uh framework for for this type of business and so they both launch and the hymns guy says this guy Andrew uh dude him he goes we launched and in our first week we did a million dollars of sales and we've never done less than a million since then I was like wow that is incredible and it is true that him scaled really quickly so their revenue a week so he said they never did he said they never did less than a million a week after watching yes oh is that and I was like that's insane I was thinking about that because I was like I've launched many things the first week is you're talking about patching holes on a boat that's how the first week is it's like you don't even have inventory you don't have you don't have a million dollars of inventory you don't have like to do a million dollars how much are you spending an ad did you just blast like half a million dollars of ads in your first week Facebook ads doesn't even let you ramp up that quickly so I was a little bit suspicious of this and uh the revenue did ramp quickly so they launched the very end of 2017 2018 the full year they did 27 million dollars in Revenue with 27 million dollars in ad spend so they spent 100 of Revenue on ads so they burned a bunch of money uh 2019 they did they went from 27 million to 83 million and they spent 50 million on ads 2020 they were forecasting about 140 million and then I have the actual so check out this Revenue girl it's pretty insane 2021 they did 270. 2022 they did 540. 2023 they're projecting to finish at 800 million in Revenue so this is a pretty crazy run in uh what six years to ramp up to 800 million and and revenue so they can get a billion in Revenue in seven years exactly they're burning money this whole time even now even at 500 million last year they only have two percent even a margin and that's the adjusted ebitda the rule they actually burn 10 million but the the adjusted is that they you know they they made a a small two percent uh margin and so super Capital intensive they raised like 200 something million dollars before going public and they didn't going public another to 300 million dollars went into the business I think and so it's taken them a lot of capital to get here so I would say three things Amazing Story just in general like props to them for pulling this off like they built this out of an incubator I ran an incubator for six years and couldn't get one thing to even 10 million in revenue and they this was like a big hit that came out of a a incubator which is very very rare Roman which now rebranded wrote also came out of an incubator at the same time so they're the two biggest incubator hits were sort of the these two companies that did the same thing essentially one did it for hair so I think uh hymns did it for hair hair loss and Road did it for Ed and then they both just added the other product as they went um so impressive in that way the revenue growth impressive the ad spend and the money burned incredible I now question is this even a good business so like they basically showed that their their CAC so their cost to acquire customers uh is really high like their cost to acquire customers is basically what do I have it here it's like 100 plus dollars to acquire a customer let me grab it um I think it's like 150 on average to to acquire a customer the lowest it's been is like a hundred dollars to acquire a customer and um they basically think they think they 3x their money in three years which is actually not very good for Ecom like my Ecom business which is nowhere near the scale of this is way more efficient than this like they're trying to pay back essentially you know a little over a year uh you know we're trying to pay back in in two months and so like you know it's amazing what just pure aggression uh they approach this business with they were just like yeah we're gonna scale this thing and we're gonna pour a bunch of money in we're gonna burn a bunch of money but we're gonna ramp up and like we're gonna try to thread the needle to get this business to work when it's at the billions in in scale and um they kind of pulled it off because they went public with vs back and they got liquid before the business really worked this week I had to chop down a tree at my farm and I didn't have an ax so I just used a sledgehammer instead and so my wife was like oh do you you chopped down that tree I was like I I gotta smashed it down and uh I just sludged him hammered it down and that's kind of what these guys did they just kind of sledgehammered their way into into the market have you seen this guy that's on Tick Tock that just chops the tree and all like it gets like a million views and it's all there's like hundreds of thousands of women commenting like like just like gasp like I need him yeah shirtless no is he shirtless and hot is he shirtless and he just chops the tree perfectly like it's like it takes them like 10 Strokes to crack down this giant tree is that like a innuendo for sex or something literally like I'm watching this thing and I'm like I don't even know why I'm watching this this is like just from a purely objective level this is very attractive I'm just gonna say this this is hat he just wears like suspenders he looks like a lumberjack but he's like gq'd out so he's he's like a groomed lumberjack that's super like with a CrossFit body that chops down trees instead of going to the gym since he's incredible so um you're kind of like that you're like that but like you know [Laughter] so that's basically what these guys did they kind of brute force their way but why don't you think this is a good business well I think that the I mean just the amount of capital it took to get to this business value so it's worth 1.8 billion on paper um and they've taken 500 million to get here so like if you just zoom out it's like we three and a half extra money like that's not the most impressive thing but like when you frame it the other way which is like we're gonna hit a billion dollars in sales and we've done this in seven years and like you know we've built the largest telemedicine Health company for men and women and you could frame it one way or you could just kind of look at another it's like now here's a business where if I have to pay 150 to acquire a customer and give takes two years to pay it back if if that we'll see how it all projects out it's super sensitive to like you know they pour so much money into marketing and what if you know Facebook costs change like you know How's that gonna affect them like there's all these factors I'm not saying it's a bad business but like compared to that pedex company that does 100 million in sales and dividends out 50 million to the owner I know which business I would want to own right uh the business that didn't need us back to to succeed as the business I would want to own the one that's dividending out like a mega yacht every year to this guy like that's sick and it has like you know one one millionth of the notoriety of a brand like it some others you say about the uh yeah tell me the the other interesting so so other cool things so so there's some notable things for the research I want to put these on the screen so I put the put the images on screen on YouTube if you're listening to the podcast just pause go to YouTube because you got to see these so if you go back through their history uh first take a look at this thing I have on page uh what is this page like three or something of this the p l do you see this p l um this was in their S1 to go public it's literally it just says Revenue 27. gross profit eight adjusted Ebina minus 68. that's the p l they shared in their investor presentation I was like what kind of a kindergarten level of detail is this what kind of crayon p l are you doing like this is [ __ ] ridiculous and I was like this is why spax this is why spax went to [ __ ] because it's like half the p l is just projections what you can't do if you go public the traditional way but in spax you can do these like forward-looking projections and that's how all these guys got away with it it's like we got a shitty business now but like five years from now we're crushing and that's like you know they were able to tell that story whereas you can't make forward-looking statements in the traditional way of going public and then I was like this is some absolute basic beginner looking thing I I was just stunned that this this is like on the SEC website that's a that's an embarrassment uh all right second thing you can go to their website and you can find in the web archive their landing page from the beginning so check this out this was their first landing page this is like the month that they launched it just said guy against staggering odds two things happen one the universe two you you let's walk at our full height honor our forebearers have a smile and for God's sakes floss shop now and it just go it just Scrolls down and it just says sex this is this is simple you need erections when you want them and not when it's convenient for your penis and there's an eggplant Emoji it says shop sex and there was another one for hair like that was like the same it was like she needs to run her fingers through your hair a lot and then it just says our best sellers and there's just a very basic bottle that says finasteride and that's like the the generic name for Propecia or like you know for like the hair uh male pattern baldness like drug or whatever and they were just selling it for 28 and then there was they only had two skews finasteride and vitamins not even like vitamin C this is yes but here's some vitamins and so incredible to go see I love love love looking at successful businesses early landing pages just to see like how did they get their business out the door one thing that's interesting is from the beginning they actually had a pretty strong like branding and brand identity so if you go do this with like Snapchat or Uber the first websites are just absolutely fugly like um I have this blog post on the internet that's called like you just search Sean Prairie uh early startup landing pages medium um 10th okay it's called 10 throwback startup home pages um when did you write that article I wrote this in 2015. so this was one month what month June oh you beat me on October 12 2015 I wrote an article that said proof that your favorite startup started out awful and it's a list of 10 landing pages yeah to each other then so uh you can go look at airbnbs it's like literally plain black and white and it's just says forget hotels stay with a local Uber it looks like a you know janky thing everyone's private driver but it looks like a old school car service Snapchat it's got one of these like yellow bubbles that's like the like buy now you know like you know half buy two get one and it just says free download inside and it says introducing Snapchat real-time picture chatting for iPhone and it's two girls and they're like bikinis and it just says seven seconds on the screen and like you know a self-destructing photo so you can see what early startup landing pages look like what's interesting that was unique in the hymns case is that they actually had their branding from day one which I think was a smart move by them and they specifically branded it the opposite colors as every other male Wellness product so every other Wellness product is essentially blue and they were like no we'll go all neutral color scheme lowercase like lowercase font for the for the brand name and we're gonna make it subtle because there's a stigma and a taboo around this it's not something you want to brag about we don't want bold we want like we want to be able to give you this package in a discrete way and you know and I know and that's all who needs to know and I thought that was like a smart thing for them to get right from day one all their models are like it's usually like a cool looking black dude or like a racially ambiguous guy it's like some it's like oh I I can see myself in you I'm a young cool guy with like I wear like cool jeans as well were your parents all of the Power Rangers why are you also like that's what happened here it's usually like a like a pretty racially ambiguous good-looking guy with nice teeth yeah yeah the tea throw is on point versus like a Viagra is always like Brett Favre looking guy and then this was one of their early um early ads so it's just uh it just says get hard or get your money back and it's just a guy holding a tiny pill um and it's and then what ethnicity is that guy oh dude his hand is like a gradient in Photoshop it's like all all colors are easy here uh so it says eggplant Emoji rise to the occasion for Less so one thing that they did really well was they figured out how do you advertise on Facebook with a taboo product so they would do stuff like they would show a picture of a cactus that was limp and then another and it would be like with hymns you don't have this problem so like how do you and so they were very clever with their marketing they also did stuff where they would create ad inventory so they would go to um like stadiums and they'd be like all right a bunch of guys who are in our demographic are at the stadium we could either spend like four hundred thousand dollars to get on the Jumbotron and uh along with like you know BMW and a bunch of other big brands or they went to the stadium facility manager and they were like hey how much for the urinal space you're like what it's like yeah we want to put a little ad on the urinal and we'll give you guys like you know X price to be in every urinal and they're like yeah dude we got like 30 seconds of guys focused time while they're touching their thing like you know looking at our ad this is actually kind of perfect and so they would create new ad inventory that didn't even exist before just trying to figure out how do we spend 100 million dollars in a way that's going to be as efficient as possible so they're you know really just like very they're like a very Advanced marketing agency essentially [Music] worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better and another thing that they did I did a big breakdown on this one time was so if you Google Viagra alternative or cheap Viagra or buy Viagra online they show up number one and what they did was they actually sponsored a ton of twitch people and somehow that like got their links out there and they like they got tons and tons of backlinks really early on so hymns.com ranked quite high so they were able to get like it was I think if you I think it's Viagra alternative might be like their word I forget which it's one of those pages and that's where they got most of the revenue early on oh wow that's interesting you know there's another cool thing I'll put this graphic on the stream um it's this graphic from have you ever read Sakura by the way I don't know if that's how you say it yeah yeah like the research thing I like it yeah they're pretty cool uh I don't think people know about them but it's uh like really good research s-a-c-r-a yeah so they had done a thing and they had this great graphic which is basically they were like telemedicine was like this like Trend like this like there's a lot of opportunity in telemedicine right now and they just showed this picture of like a guy and a girl and it's a diagram and basically it's like you could look from like head to toe literally from head to toe and you just go down the body you're like okay hair there's hymns there's keeps there's Roman okay then you go down to like eyes and it's like there's a prescription contact Hubble um you know it was it was a DVC startup doing prescription contacts through a phone app instead of going to the doctor then you go to their bicep it's like trt uh there's a bunch of trt companies like hone health and others and then you're like and then you go to uh you know their abs like weight loss you go to the crotch it's like here's the erectile dysfunction you go down to the toes like here's toe fungus he's got a little putt next to him it's like hey here's pop it's it's insurance for your pet so you have like instead of going to the vet for everything you can use pop and um and so it's like uh and then they do the same thing for women and you could just literally see like if you've seen those diagrams that were like there was a big opportunity to unbundle Craigslist and they took Craigslist homepage and they showed out every little section of Craigslist became its own billion dollar startup they did the same thing to your body every part of your body became a billion dollar startup essentially from one d2c wellness company and uh or or multiple in some in some areas so from Skin Care all of their logos look exactly the same lowercase font pastel colors hymns I think it's oh by the way one one other little observation a lot of these DDC successes came from a certain type of founder not all of them but many from NBA found like Founders who went to like Business Schools which is funny because like in the startup World Business Schools kind of like our easy punching bag because you're like punching up at the institution it's easy to make fun of them like bro you don't learn business from school you learn business by doing business and that's how I feel to be honest with you so I'm like that's true but there is something interesting that a lot of DDC companies Blue Apron Birchbox Stitch fix Warby Parker um Rent the Runway hellofresh um and then this you know this guy who did uh uh hymns he went to Wharton as well so it's like a lot of these big I think there was something about the type of person who would do well in a business school and the types of things you learn in business school where you like do this Market landscape you like figure out the opportunities you're like okay good I just need to be like good in marketing and then good at operations in order to like like put cash in here and get thing out it's not like very software based it's not in it you don't have to be the the innovator who's like you know the one inventor of something um I think it lended itself to that type of entrepreneur which I found pretty interesting too well here's what our listeners need to do they need to either probably in the YouTube comments they need to let us know I actually want to do who on The Duel I actually want them to I want to know if they think Kansas is a good business but also who won the duel so you'll have to vote by saying our names um we'll include a Spotify poll as well so you can just vote in the app and we'll do a Spotify poll as well if some guy in the YouTube channel said um um who's this blonde host and why is he so annoying so just for the record the blonde annoying guy that's what someone said in the comment the the blonde annoying guy that was Sam I went first and Sean is the brown less annoying guy he went second for him so let us know who's the winner here of the of this duel um I'm very eager to hear uh what people gonna say I know which one I would rather own but I think they're both quite interesting for sure for sure you saw this post by Mark Zuckerberg that he did the Murph I tweeted out the picture of it and it got like five million views it kind of took off and I don't know so do you know what the Murph is I had never heard of the Murph until I saw this and then I was like I must do the Murph it's named after lieutenant Murphy I believe context clues leads me to believe that he died uh in the military and uh his favorite workout I believe it's one mile run 300 squats a hundred push-ups and 100 pull-ups and then I'm one mile run all while wearing a 20 pound weighted vest is that the workout that's exactly right run a mile 100 pull-ups 200 push-ups 300 squats run another mile while wait while wearing a 20 pound vest and uh Zuck basically takes a like bro gym shot I gotta use the Blackberry for this he's got the phone down here not smiling got the mouth open just and just snaps it with himself drenched in sweat and he's like just did the Murph um he's like me and my daughters dude he's got a picture of his daughters doing like push-ups and he goes I this year I got it done in 39 minutes and 58 seconds and I was like I read that and I was like hmm that sounds like really fast if he had just said I did 100 pull-ups today I would have been like man what a day fantastic forget all the rest I was already impressed by 100 Pull-Ups to say he got that done weighted Pull-Ups so say you got that done in 39 minutes I was like that sounds ridiculously fast and sure enough all the comments were like that's an insane time for the Murph have you ever done this workout I haven't but the world record holder of the Murph is this guy named Hunter McIntyre who's dm'd me on Twitter and Instagram and I've talked to because I like him a lot or I followed him and I feel like I like him is that what fit guys do they just DM each other yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like a club you know like once you can see the sixth app you start smelling each other yeah I'm one of us good to see you and he DN me he listens to the pot he's the world record holder and I think his world record is like 34 minutes and zuck's time was 39 minutes which means he would have gotten like 10th or 15th Place at there's like a Murph gains or something like that I mean I had so many thoughts brushed through my head when I saw this first I saw 39 minutes and I thought I've taken shits longer than that like that's a that's a crazy fast time then I thought I don't think I could even do a Murph in an infinite amount of time I don't think in my life I have done a total of two miles running 100 pull-ups 200 push-ups and 300 air squats like with a 20 pound vest I have just never done it period uh so my time is currently 35 years then I thought this mother this guy has he decided yo you know what I'll just become one of the richest people in the world one of the most powerful people in the world and the one of the fittest guys in the world like he's basically wholesome top point one percent wealth top point one percent you know intelligence top point one percent power and now he's top Point top one point one percent Chad also I am all before the age of 40. yeah exactly and he's got two kids or something like that I'm like I mean David Goggins should go to sleep listening to Mark Zuckerberg videos for motivation this guy is incredible I went I bought more stock and I bought a plain gray you know cookie cutter t-shirt in his honor I was like this is I'm gonna retire this is the rafters of my office I'm gonna put it I'm gonna hang a gray shirt just to honor this man he can get so much [ __ ] and man he's really turned his like public Persona around like do you remember he was he was the biggest dork like not just like oh when he was young like recently he was the biggest dork is that he tried to do something cool like he would do when he did that like Hydro foiling thing and he painted his fight his face white like a geisha and like it's like man this guy's like and hit American fight it was just like it was like oh man like you know what keep all your money I don't want to be here and now he's like you know just got off work did a quick Jiu Jitsu tournament came back you know [ __ ] deleted Snapchat off the Earth I'm like wow this guy's just this guy's making power moves all day he's incredible he's he's a very inspirational dude he's done it Scandal free so Zuck is only 37 now you know probably fifth or sixth is he's only 37. something like that I mean he's still in his 30s how old is he 39 39. so he so basically he uh been married to the same woman been with her since college has two kids seems like his family life on on paper seems awesome there was a time when like the most scandalous thing that he did was he had a video where he talked about smoking meats and every year he sets you remember that because every year he has goals no no that's not the scandalous thing that was just like hilarious that he was a robot trying to be like hello humans I am doing a barbecue with I have flesh on a grill with fire and I was like bro this is the robot the most scandalous thing he did was when he was in college and the the his aim messages got leaked that was like you know a real wonderful day in my household as I like was like Hey cancel Netflix I have my entertainment for the week I'm reading all of Mark Zuckerberg's aim messages for the next week that and it wasn't even that big of a deal what he said was pretty on par with an 18 year old 19 year old person like well maybe it was one part was a little bit like uh is this what we want like this guy's this is the guy running Facebook where he was like he's like yeah he's like he's like yeah just tell me if you want anyone's like you know name do you know date of birth you know address whatever he's like these dumb [ __ ] just just trust me they just put everything in the system and so yeah like something a 19 year old kid who invented this stuff would say yeah I would say that was the last time I was relatable with Mark Zuckerberg ever since then he's created a gap and he's outpaced me from there every year he sets these goals one year it was he only wants to eat food that he killed or grew and I think he did it and then another year he was like I'm gonna learn Mandarin because I want Facebook to come to China and I think his wife is Chinese and he was like I'm Gonna Learn man and then he goes and he gives a talk I think he does it gives a talk to a Chinese Universe he gave me an interview they go he they fly him out there they're like thank you so much Mark Zuckerberg for coming we are so happy to have you and he's like he's like yo well Mitchell and he just starts speaking Chinese and they're like blown away it's like really great Amanda where he's basically fluent and so the guy kills it man he does great and like when he did the E4 so he got into e-foiling which is basically surfboarding without a wave and he is doing it with an American flag and he has too much sunscreen on his face that's my guy a guy whose biggest like flaw is that he's goofy it's not the I know my guy and then now that I said you're zagging the other way you're saying Zuck bad move unrelatable too too good no vulnerability no no relatability now he's no longer Girl Next Door hot now he's just super model hot it sucks the best man he just he you know our friend Nikita beer uh has this joke where he said something like I would never I forget why he says this but he says never ever ever bet against Zuck how he's just a complete killer and he is wrong sometimes but not in the grand scheme and this is for the proof well the funny thing is people will hate this segment because I think it's popular to really hate Mark Zuckerberg um because they hate Facebook I think because they're like my data or like the Russians hacked the election I'm not even sure I'm not even sure what the what the exact reason is for hating Zuckerberg at this point I just gotta say like this is I mean he he is inspiring in that he is excellent and if you appreciate Excellence that is kind of inspiring it's kind of like people who hate LeBron it's like okay I get it you don't have to like the guy but uh I mean you gotta respect that puts a perspective on this guy's name is wrong either by the way like people played sometimes yeah exactly yeah it might yeah he switched teams when he was a free agent um my real estate agent told me the story that she was driving my she's like that's Mark Zuckerberg's house in the in the mission kind of like near Dolores Park type of area and I was like he lives here and I was like that's not like I thought he'd live in some private gated community and she was like well let me think he has like many houses but this is one this is one and this is like his main one for a while and she's like and he made it private I said what do you mean I don't see any fence and she's like no he bought the houses next door like he just bought all the houses in the area so that like you know whatever and so he he knocked on someone's door himself so somebody opened the door and it was Mark Zuckerberg outside and he's like hey you know I love this house and I would you sell it to me and they're like no I mean it's not for sale we love this house we're so close to the park you know my commute it's only seven miles he's like I'll give you 10 million dollars and you're like okay here's the keys basically he bought the house for 10 million it was probably a two million dollar house uh and the house next like the house is nearby two and a half three billion dollars and he paid ten and just got the house right away dude that person who sold their house to him would be the best dinner guest imagine that story we'd like to have you on air if that's you we would like to have you come tell that story because uh obviously I'm reenacting what I was told by a real estate agent I don't know if that's that's true or that's [ __ ] um so yeah Zuck amazing Let's uh wrap up with this last thing this Nike thing did you watch this movie uh air yeah I did I thought it was awesome it was pretty sweet right like uh not the best movie but like a just a solid base hit on a Thursday night a Friday night you know you just need something that's I don't want to sit here and browse Netflix for the perfect thing all right I'm just gonna go on I think it's on Amazon and I'm just gonna go watch air and like this just watch the story of how Nike signed Michael Jordan they made Phil Knight look like a doofus yeah why did they do that I didn't understand that they uh well he does like appearance-wise look like a doofus but they also made him act like a doofus yeah which I don't think he was like that when I read true dog I didn't get that idea he he he he he's more I think uh they made him look like when he wrote his own Memoir he made himself sound cool well I've read a lot I've read a lot about him he he they just kind of made him look like a like a like a ditzy person like an idiot yeah he's not an idiot um but the guy they feature so a couple things so so first uh anything stand out from the movie air but then I have I want to go deep on this guy Sonny Vaccaro because I think he's actually more interesting who was that the main character I don't remember his name that's that's the main character so that's Matt Damon uh Matt Damon in the movie but um you know in in Nike in the air movie I thought one one is something I didn't know was they're they're talking about just do it which is the just do it's the slogan that you know everybody knows it's the Nike kind of like iconic slogan and they were talking about like at the time even people internally were like just do it like they got that from the Ad Agency Wyden Kennedy and they're like I don't know what what does that what does that mean do you like it it's like I don't know it's okay I guess they weren't like yes this is this is gonna be this like marketing Masterpiece and they go what does that even mean and they go dude it's from an inmate on death row who was about to be assassin about to be executed and they were like any last words and he goes just do it so that became the Nike slogan which is uh honestly kind of Genius um so I want to talk about this guy Sonny Vaccaro because he's kind of a gangster that I've seen for many many years in the basketball scene and the movie was about him and he this guy's pretty fascinating so what uh in the movie he's famous because he's working at Nike at the time Nike is the last player it's just a running shoe company and they're the smaller shoe company uh Adidas is This Global brand that's crushing it they own most of the sneaker Market uh I believe it's pronounced Adidas yeah Adidas which has its own interesting story then Reebok is like number two and Nike's like a distant three but they were doing like 27 million a year in sales through their running shoot so good but not like nowhere near the kind of top tier uh of shoe companies and so Sunny meets Phil Knight and he's like hey I got an idea for a basketball shoe I want to create like a basketball Division like you guys are all running shoes which is great basketball shoes and he's like okay like come on in and you get this little basketball Department like go ahead try to make it work and the movie is all about like one breakthrough thing he did which was they had a tiny budget and in the 1984 draft they decided to sponsor Michael Jordan and Michael Jordan was not interested in Nike he was going to go with uh I think Adidas or somebody like that and um he was known as a hot Prospect he's like the number three pick and they were like well we still want and and Sonny was convinced we need Michael Jordan and so the movie's about them trying to go get Michael Jordan on Borden and what ended up what they what the pitch was was basically they put her entire Budget on one guy instead of spreading across multiple players he relentlessly pursued Jordan and like met his mom and like just like drove out there to North Carolina to meet them and try to build a relationship and then they didn't even showed Jordan's face in the movie which actually was pretty cool it was basically the whole relationship was how do I impress his mom because I know his mom will have my back she's making the decisions and so they were like well um we're gonna pitch him on his own signature shoe from day one and we're gonna name it after him um so it'll be the Air Jordan it'll be a whole product line named after him and he ended up negotiating a royalty on every pair of Jordans sold and that's how Michael Jordan became a billionaire not through basketball but through his shoes so that's the movie part okay cool this guy Sonny actually did a bunch of other interesting things that I thought were pretty cool so as a marketer I just respect this guy's hustle so here's some of the things he did to make Nike win um he created so he was like all right we gotta create like um like a kid's strategy it's like how do we get him while they're young and so he created a high school All-American Game so he was like he called it the uh the Dapper band round ball classic he goes throughout the country he's like I'm inviting you to participate you're going to compete against you know the the 12 best players um we're gonna have 20 best players in the country you're invited to come do this thing in in Pittsburgh or Philadelphia or some [ __ ] like that and it was like uh and so he flies them out there and he puts this thing together now he's got the players so then he goes and tells all the college coaches hey if you're scouting you need to come to this round ball class you can see all the best high school players at once and so then college coaches start coming so now players are like oh if I want to get seen by college coaches I gotta get to the high school All-American Game so he just like created through Brute Force like a conference essentially that would uh bring together the kind of the core supply and demand and then he could find at that age the best young players and so he that's how he found Kobe Bryant that's how he found LeBron James they were part of his high school All-American things in his Camp so the second thing he did was he created a summer camp for only the best players called ABCD any brand this is when he was with Adidas so this guy worked for Nike then he worked for Adidas then he worked for Reebok so he just this guy was just a hired assassin that went from company to company and would just try to get them to win in their Market using whatever advantages they had and so when Nike needed something he was like all right you need to get them while they're young we're gonna do this camp but also what we're going to do is we need to get college players wearing our stuff they all wear Adidas and uh because it's the most popular brand so that's just what they choose by default or they choose Converse and so he's like you know why don't we um you can't pay College athletes but nobody say anything about coaches and so he just started he would go to the coaches and he'd be like hey I'm gonna give you 10 grand and here's 26 pairs of shoes give them out oh they happen to be the sizes of like most of your guys uh they don't have to wear them you get the 10 grand either way but we sure do hope you would uh you know you would go ahead and uh and um you know encourage them to wear these shoes and so he went to Jim beehive and he went to like you know all the top college coaches and he basically bribed them and it was like in this gray area where it was allowed and in one year he just traveled like he would just fly City to City he would go to the campus he would make the coach and offer and at the time they were buying this equipment for their program they're like our kids need equipment so we got to buy this the stuff so we turn to cost into revenue for them and gave them free stuff and sure enough all of them started wearing Nikes for free so all of a sudden now Nike's being worn by all the best college players and it's on TV and in one year he just did a land grab across the country before the other companies could could react he got all of them and I thought this was just like a genius uh genus strategy he started how far you can go with Brute Force this was a sledgehammer this was a sledgehammer and you can get pretty far with the sledgehammer then then he did another thing he sued the NCAA so he went to this guy Edo Bannon and he was like hey we should sue the NCAA they're using your name your face you're like this to market the tournament and all the stuff and you're getting nothing from it and now college players can get paid through this nil rule this name and like this thing and it's because he won the case with that uh lawsuit uh against the NCAA that was like you know it happened the lawsuit happened the last time about five years or so then the rule came into effect like a year ago or something and so um so I thought that was awesome uh there were some great quotes about him some guy goes uh when Sonny dies he's gonna sneak his way into heaven and uh and when he gets there the first thing he's gonna do is he's gonna look for a six nine kid to make a deal with like he's like and the other thing they said is there's only one man on Earth who could tell you who the best sixth grade basketball player in the country is and it's sunny Vaccaro and I just love that this guy just like owned his Niche and just absolutely like went balls to the wall and really built like I don't know tens of billions of value at least inside of Nike Plus Adidas plus Reebok with these athletes and he would have also gotten so he signed Jordan he sang he he got he poached Kobe away from Adidas and that he would have got LeBron too when he was at Adidas and LeBron was ready to sign he goes we need to offer him 10 million a year for 10 years 100 million dollar contract to this 18 year old kid and rabon's ready to sign and then Adidas gave him the 10 million but they changed the structure last minute they got a little cold feet and they're like well we don't know if this kid's gonna work out why don't we make it part of an incentive based and so they offered him seven million guaranteed and 3 million a year of incentives and LeBron turned it down ends up going Nike never looked back and like just a huge blunder like basically this guy's whole life he was fighting bureaucracy inside companies and then doing like black market and gray hat [ __ ] in the like you know in the streets and every NBA player is like no sonny their parents know Sunny because this guy was just working the streets and like there are certain companies that have had this Tinder kind of had this with um what's her name the Whitney wolf who started bumble she was kind of doing this from college campus to college campus like going into the sorority houses and the Frat houses and just brute force onboarding all the guys and girls in one campus so that Tinder was useful and then throwing parties and doing stuff like that and like you need these people these are like game-changing people for your company I remember when coinbase went public uh Brian Armstrong did this long thread he did something you never see somebody do which was company goes public they usually just say generic stuff he actually talked about like what led coinbase to be successful and he called out one guy by name that wasn't his co-founder wasn't his main investor it was just an employee and this guy Dan Romero and he's like and you know it's basically special thanks to Dan Romero who like just kind of like Brute Force built our relationships with banks and he he basically got them their relationships with banking partners and like I think maybe some stuff overseas um and it was just kind of like one of those things like dude I don't know how we're gonna do this I don't know Dan that's your mission send them on a mission to go do that and Dan basically joined coinbase coinbase as an employee ended up making like 100 million dollars plus through this process um and I knew this guy I met him in college he was in my case yeah didn't he uh didn't you like used to make fun of him call him with dweeb I didn't make fun of him but in my head I did he was we took a class called computers again I was going through campus looking for the easiest sounding classes I took getting rich I was one class I took another computers and in computers they were talking about like that's an exclusive class it's computers and they were just talking about like the internet and like internet I remember like to talk about net neutrality a ton I was like I don't know what the hell these guys are talking about like I couldn't give less of a [ __ ] about this and there was one guy that every class had like strong opinions was super informed I was like man who is this like teacher's pet that's just like is he trying to impress him I was like no I don't even think he's trying to impress him I think he actually is just nerdy about this stuff he just listened [ __ ] just loves the internet this guy like wants to make out with the internet I just remember sitting in the back of class like I was like thank you for talking so much Dan Romero because I don't have to say a word in this class and um it's sort of like you know Revenge of the Nerds in a way it's like jokes on you like this guy's passion and enthusiasm about the internet and technology is what led him early into crypto was led him to pick coinbase and ended up you know like his passion for that led him to be a key person there this guy made 100 million hundreds of millions of dollars probably is retired and uh and got to do what he loved the whole time and so like you know I I used to make fun of people who were like you know overly enthusiastic and now I preached that you need like enthusiasm is massively underrated and more people dude and he's got a super handsome uh headshot now in LinkedIn Dan Romero does because you can afford a whole you know glow up if you uh if you get that coinbase IPO and early Bitcoin money he's got great hair this guy's definitely takes him he's a good looking guy power himself and he just bought uh 13 million dollars worth of a 13 million dollar property in Venice and another one in Park City Dan Juan yeah down one for sure and you can tell that he's ripped too like this guy's definitely has abs Dan won good job Dan I'm just like you just Google him and see his face you know this guy's fit [Laughter] no nfts uh just lift up your shirt six inches I'll tell you qualify so um dude this guy's Sunny sounds awesome I I did see the movie and they made him look like a guy who could just put up with a whole lot of pain that's what they made him look like um they made him look like a guy who like he would just get [ __ ] on constantly and he always pulled through that's what they made him look like uh and they also made him look exhausted and terribly unhealthy which is the price it's kind of true yeah they made him look horrible and if you look at photos of him granted he's like looks like he's he was born in 1938 I think so like you know you are what you are at that point but like he he definitely looks like he smoked a lot of cigarettes that sounds very old is that I looked him up on Wikipedia I think it's 38. he's 83. wow yeah so he you know he's alive and and by the way the guy's name is actually John Paul Vincent Vaccaro change is sunny God damn I like you have to have a nickname that everybody in your town knows you by that's like to me that's like one of the great honors of life it's like yeah his name's his name's Sean but everybody called him Sonny whole life everybody called him sunny it's like that's just like such a cool I wish I had a calling card like that that's an Italian thing that's like I feel like all the there's always a sunny in the mafia movies that I watch yeah he operates like a monster for sure I like this this is a good find I saw that movie and I thought I don't want that guy's job it sounded like an exhausting exhausted existence it sounded very challenging but yeah I did like the movie they made him they made Phil Knight look a little goofy which I'm a big Phil Knight fan so it kind of hurt my feelings but uh no I thought it was a good movie and this is a good find all right that's it that's the Pod let us know who won this the The Duel the annoying blonde hair guy who went first or the less annoying Brown guy who went second that's the pot [Music] foreign

AI is obviously All the Rage um the entire menu was created by chat GPT so those basically just typed in I appreciate that I'm hosting a dinner for a bunch of tech people X number of tech people create a menu um for an epic dinner party and it created a full menu okay that's cool and then it's like uh cool like uh generate an image using dolly or whatever and then basically created the whole menu that way and the chef had to cook whatever chat GPT had created which was which is pretty clever [Music] what up uh before we go into this episode I gotta say I'm doing a workshop with our boy Nick Huber do you see this uh just stay the w words for me it's a workshop it's not a no say that otherwise it's on the web well it might be a webinar I might be doing a website similar to a seminar on the web site yeah I'm doing one of the lamest things one man can do with another and that's a webinar all right well what's this webinar about basically both of us are total um I don't know nerds are just obsessed with with hiring internationally like for both of our companies I think we both had a moment where like wait I'm pretty sure I could find somebody for 10 times less you know it cost 10 times less and the secret part that most people don't realize everybody gets that if you hire somebody overseas they're they're cheaper um what I found I don't know if you how much you do this but they're way less overseas mean like um like across like the Mississippi River in Missouri [Laughter] best deal uh like overseas like review at the California you're gonna come into uh you know like Hannibal Missouri no basically I have let's see I got in one of my in my e-commerce business I think I have six or seven people in the Philippines plus two in Latin America so those are kind of the two hot spots Latin America you get the same time zone um and they're good for certain types of roles like we have like data analytics and stuff like that and then the Philippines we have all of our customer support plus like anything that's like sales and Outreach so we'll just be like hey we want to go get every influencer on board I'm not even going to talk to you just go go make that happen in every morning report how many of how many influencers are on board show me the pipeline show me the hey we want this many wholesalers to start selling our stuff go make this happen and they're just like an automated Sales Machine which is pretty pretty amazing but anyways we're doing this webinar because uh yeah we just want to give it away kind of like yeah you got to call it a a web in our yeah yeah we're gonna do it on the web anyways we decided we'll do one we'll teach anybody who uh it's like delegation 101. uh but if you want to do if you want to join or whatever it's on the sixth I think a 6th of June well how do people find it go to all right we're gonna put on the screen a giant Link in the description it'll be the top Link in the podcast description and uh or the YouTube notes but if you don't see any of those places you can just go to my website seanfree.com and it'll there'll be a little Banner if you want to do it because for doing this thing might as well if we're doing it for free might as well have as many people as we can set up and if you sign up even though you can't make it live you'll just get the recording so if you ever want to then hire internationally you'll have the recording and all of our like kind of uh our cheat codes of after doing this for I don't know 10 years here's what works here's what does it all right so we've started on one end of the spectrum can we please go to the other end of the spectrum and tell me about a dinner you had yeah I had this dinner I thought I already talked about it but I don't think billionaire dinner is a great way to go when we started with the weapon yeah exactly see what happens is you hire people for low cost then you go to this billionaire that's basically what I did so I went to a dinner at a Billionaire's place and I can't say exactly who but I want to share three takeaways from this thing are they a billionaire from being early at a tech company or for starting something amazing starting their own tech companies so do they sell it or is it still yeah at this dinner there was somebody who sold their business for I think I could say some of the people who were there so uh let me let me try to do that there was uh the guy who created figma was there so sold his company recently for 20 billion so he was there uh there was people that were like really internet ogs like they were like their first internet company was in 98 or something like that and so I well that's the part I actually loved I was talking to them so that's the story I want to show those people are the best they're the best because I was like what was it like back in the early days and I'm gonna tell you one thing that he told me but before I do that a couple of interesting things now I've done a couple of these didn't run yeah how did you get invited to this I know one of the people there so they they what they do is they host these regularly um with the same crew but then whoever is the host for that month gets to invite guests so they were they get to invite three or four guests that are not in the main group to kind of spice up the dinner but then the main group is like been going for 10 years plus so it's kind of aspirational I was like oh I'm gonna start one of these too it's a a once a month dinner with a red with a core crew and then whoever's the host for that month gets to pick the food um and I think you do like a special gift like um Reid Hoffman who's the creator of LinkedIn was in the group or whatever and when when it was his turn to host I remember that uh he created like his own board game of uh like an anti like is it Cards Against Trump like his own version of Cards Against Humanity but it was just Trump jokes and he gave one to every guest right so just like baller like that um so anyways I'm at this dinner and I would say three observations I've been to a couple of these dinners somehow every dinner I go to in San Francisco is like at least 30 to 50 percent people talking about psychedelics and yeah your boy's never done psychedelics sober is a cat not once no no not once way too scared to do it uh have you ever done psychedelics I don't even really honestly know what would count a second I think it's like LSD I think it's like MDMA I think it's DMT these are all the letters but I I don't I don't partake in any acronyms like this and one time I met this girl uh and we went out on like a first or maybe it was the second date and this is when I was still drinking so we were a little drunk and then we also took shrooms and a little bit of a ecstasy or Molly or MDMA or I don't even know any of them so I felt I definitely felt a little bit of all of them but I was also like pretty intoxicated too so I like it was you know a little bit you know maybe 50 of the potency but that was the only time I've ever done it and that was uh you know 15 years ago the only acronym I have done is dare and that kept me off all this so but but I gotta say so I've done three of these dinners now in San Francisco with like entrepreneurial type successful silicon types and it's crazy how much people talk about uh psychedelics like half the table is our regular users of psychedelics or like you know regular meaning it wasn't a like your story of like I did it once and you know it was it was cool but not not for me or whatever um dude I wasn't trying to like find myself I was just trying to like you know have a freaky night find her yeah yeah we're trying to find something but it wasn't myself I was sort of by myself like you know like with each other later that evening but that's about it and so in these conversations to me there's what what's coming up is not like it's not bro I got so drunk it's not a brag like that it's I the the conversation is like this weird intellectual thing where it's like one-third talking about how psychedelics or else he's cool one-third talking about public policy like I can't believe these are outlawed it's crazy this is there's and then one third is science it's like there's dude I don't give a about any of those topics there is so much research about how this can like cure PTSD and like blah blah and it just keeps happening every dinner I've gone to in San Francisco three in a row now half the conversation is talking about this which tells me one of two things it's a potpourri in the middle of the table like fart flavored is that like is that what this place is like I'll tell you about that in a second they um the the thing with with these is is I've had this experience once before or twice before where a lot of people in Silicon Valley are talking about something that I'm like ah this seems weird and then like five years later it's the norm or seven years later it's the total Norm so there is this thing that's like um Paul Graham says if you want to invent the future you first just live in it and and I think that's one of the things that silica Valley is pretty good at is people here will do things like whether it's like like what you're doing biohacking where you're wearing continuous glucose monitors like Tim Ferriss was wearing a continuous glucose monitor back in like 2008 or something like that and then a decade later now it's like a thing that a lot of Fitness people are doing this whole startups that are built around uh letting you do this like nutrisense or levels whatever and uh but it was very strange at the time but there were this like small community of people doing it same thing with crypto back in 2012 there was people going to these meetups that were like all about Bitcoin and then they seem like you know the biggest kind of freaks at the time uh 2011 2012 and then a decade later it's on CNBC every day so like I've seen this a few times in Silicon Valley where they're somewhat ahead of the curve but of course it's like anything uh that's at like you know a little bit contrarian it's not always just because it's weird doesn't mean it's always going to be a thing but the Psychedelic conversation that was cool 10 years ago now it's it's I mean you can go to I mean I see everyone on Facebook saying I just got back from some country where we did an Ayahuasca Retreat I mean like I don't think that's normal for most people I think that's like your circle uh and our my circle a little bit more than it is the average person all right so that was one one piece of it second AI is obviously All the Rage um the entire menu was created by chatgpt so it was basically just typed in I appreciate that I'm hosting a dinner for a bunch of tech people X number of tech people create a menu um for an epic dinner party and it created a full menu okay that's cool uh write the whole thing like a Shakespearean uh Shakespearean play and I said I just translated the menu into like this like very flowery poem basically and then it's like uh cool like uh generate an image using Dolly whatever and then basically created the whole menu that way and the chef had to cook whatever Chad CPT had created which was which was pretty clever uh including like the drinks and whatever um so I thought that was that was fun and then the last thing I want to say is I was talking to one guy and I didn't ask him if I could say this so I don't want to uh say his name necessarily uh but he's one of those internet ogs and I was like I was like so what's your story and he's like well I started a business back in he says the name of this company that like I've heard of from the.com boom and then like you know disappeared after that and I was like oh wow like um that's interesting and I was like so what was it like back then you know doing a startup here he's like he's like it was crazy he said I knew every single person doing a startup he's like he's like we used to have like uh like in San Francisco here we used to have these meetups he's like we would meet up once a month and he's like it started out with just me and this one guy he named the guy who I think I can name this guy who's the guy who started next door um this guy nirav tolia and he's like me and nerve were like hey let's get together a bunch of anybody else who you know that's like interested in this Tech like internet thing like our fellow nerds yeah like if they if you know anybody doing internet stuff let's invite him to this thing and then they created this group and he's like dude the group was insane he's like it was the guy who went to go you know like the guy who created um Zynga then the guy who created LinkedIn the guy who created YouTube the guy who created PayPal like all of them he's like we would just hang out like it was just like like you know we used to those Mastermind dinners in San Francisco he's like it was like that he's like at that time you didn't know who any of these people were you didn't know who's special who wasn't you just knew we're all super interested in the internet to add three zeros to like our success and that was it was basically the same thing exactly and so he's like um he's like we would get together and it was just like debates about like what's going on with the internet and like what cool stuff you're seeing and he's like we would just shoot the late until the night he's like and then afterwards uh it started growing he's like so I started growing then we had like too many people for one table so we made two tables I was the host of one and the other guy was the host of the other table let's lead that discussion then afterwards we would compare notes and be like who should we invite back he's like the key was the internet started growing in popularity like crazy like a lot of people wanted to do internet companies the way that we made the community work was we started pruning hardcore so he's like we were like the bigger the overall Community gets the more high level this one needs to get so let's let's only invite Pac people that we think are like the most dynamic the people who are going to do the most interesting things he's like so dude he's like this would have been the best Venture portfolio of all time like it was like every internet company that's big now they were there and then even the people who were like you'll have like a Jack Dorsey or something like that it's like they hadn't even done their big thing yet and they're kind of the junior guy at this thing hanging out right that's I don't know if he specifically was doing it but he gave me some some names of some examples of people that were there because I was like like who could you tell at that time was gonna do something like who did he say he's like I felt like half the group he's like basically we as he's like what we did was when somebody's like stood out of somebody that that really kind of knew where the puck was going we made them a table host so they would host their own table by the end we had like eight nine tables going and did he say of anyone the question I would have asked was the opposite is who's a mega success who you thought oh that doofus I can't believe he he turned into something yeah and I he did tell me a couple of stories but on both directions people he thought was just this person's an animal they're gonna do great things and somebody who's a little overrated I don't want to say because you know if they figured out that I don't want them to be upset or whatever but I would say like one of the things he told me was it wasn't it wasn't the people who were working on ideas that sounded big so all the people that ended up with a big thing the things they were working on weren't the things that sounded like important businesses from day one and they became important they became eventually iterated too no no like it was a bigger space than we all realized um it was like it was basically the person that was like kind of like doing the thing that was most interesting to them and not necessarily they're like okay internet's gonna be a big deal so therefore I'm gonna create this important sounding real world business on the internet it wasn't that it was like okay yeah this is cool that people are doing this like like social networking at the time was not seen as a space that was going to yield 100 billion dollar companies right like it wasn't that wasn't a thing that was uh that sounded like the frivolous fun thing it's like oh cool you like you can like create a profile like take a quiz yeah you can like write something silly on their wall or whatever like that didn't seem like the big ideas and like all the Big Ideas seem like you know even like things like um so it was like breaking the three categories like things that you didn't think were gonna happen on the internet selling cars booking travel like you know it wasn't like it's like are people gonna do that or maybe like home home buying it's like I don't know maybe that seems like something you really want to do in the real world it's like those seemed like kind of Fringe because I don't know if people will do it it was social networking that seemed Fringe and small and that's fun but not not that interesting because we don't it's free how are we gonna make a big business out of this um you know what are you gonna do with all these free users that are just going on there and goofing off and then then there was like you know the things that were actually like important sounding businesses so I thought that was kind of interesting too and it reminds me of have you seen this uh clip this is my last thing on this look up nfx on Tick Tock so nfx is a uh is an investment fund an NSX inside insights that's exactly right yeah okay I'm on their page watch that first video we'll put this in the YouTube video but uh watch this first video real quick of James Courier standing there all right it says everyone in that stuff is all in on generative AI so there's an underground scene of startups this kind of Revolution happens every 14 years and Builders are here to change the world and it's James carrier who's on a stage or like a he's on a chair in a room full of like 20 guys chair your exceed performance indicators with each other and he's saying to people share your ideas the speed of which you move is what gives you and this town and this community it's Advantage and it's uh 65 of all money invested in AI it's being invested in San Francisco right now so he's given this pump up speech where he's trying to say like you know years ago there was like the Facebooks but just let you know this is happening right now with AI and he's in a room with people like giving this cool speech and everyone's like staring up at him they seem like they're super into it it's it's so cool so he's literally like you could see a staircase coming down so he's somewhere downstairs in like a basement he's standing on a chair and he's in a room full of people and he's like basically gives them a rally speech of like look this is where the magic happens he's like you're in this town you're in this room you're with a bunch of Builders and what he says is every 14 years or so one of these waves happen and they last somewhere between 24 to 36 months and he's talking about AI he's like um he's like we've seen this before with mobile so mobile comes out and there's this three-year window between kind of like 2009 to 2012. it happened with the internet and I was like you know kind of like 99 2000 to kind of 2000 and 3 2004. and he's like you get 36 to maybe 48 months Max to um to take advantage of this moment and you're in this room you're with other people there's some like basically like there's somebody in this room right now who's building the next big thing I you know I hope it's you but you want to trade ideas trade strategies trade what you're like doing find interesting people work on projects with them invest in each other like this is your time to focus these windows only open up for a small period of time move as fast as you can and I thought it was pretty I thought it was pretty dope uh to see this kind of like I don't know this this like I don't know rally cry and it really does seem like that's what's happening with with artificial intelligence right now like there's a window the big shit's gonna get built right now the the next kind of Facebooks of the world are are being built right now and um it's just kind of re-highlights the intensity of the moment if you're an entrepreneur have you heard that parable about like there's this guy who uh he's uh there's a big flood and he's on this roof and a guy with a boat comes by and goes hey uh come on get in my boat I need to save you and the guy on the roof goes no no I'm praying to God and I'm a religious guy he got to save me and he goes all right another guy comes on the boats it's the same thing and he goes no no I'm not gonna get in that boat I'm gonna wait for the uh a guy to come and save me the habits two or three times the guy eventually drowned and dies he goes to heaven he goes god what the hell why didn't you come and save me and guy goes dude I had four boats come and get you like what did you what did you just hop in that was me this video the reason it's similar to that is there's this like James carrier who he's wearing like pretty much an ugly shirt that's like a he's wearing like a he's wearing like a tucked in t T-shirt into blue jeans kind of dad Gene I mean he looks like a dad he's probably he's a dad yeah he's a deep five so he looks like he should and he's wearing like kind of an ugly shirt and he's like just a normal looking guy I guess is what I mean and he's giving this really nice speech but in a basement and it's that same thing where like everyone's looking for some big opportunity and from like Grand like Epiphany moment it's like no it's just some guy who dress like dresses like this he's in a basement yeah he's telling you like the message is here the message is here and the message is clear he's trying to shake you by the he's trying to grab you by the collar and Shake you and be like hey this like play time is over the window is open go and uh I love it I think that's I think it's 100 true and I I want to leave with two controversial opinions it's a video with 6 000 views this is this is the man in the boat trying to save you from drowning yeah but by the way the best stuff like the best content I consume the most insightful meaningful content I consume is all like this it's got like 1200 views on YouTube it's got you know 6 000 views on Tick Tock the best stuff is not the most popular stuff when it comes to like business stuff you used to host hustlecon and people had to fly out to San Francisco pay a couple hundred bucks for their ticket spend all day do that not everybody could do that nobody could afford to flight the hotel the ticket take a day off work blah blah you put all the talks up on YouTube every single one of them was on YouTube it's in fact it's on our Channel on YouTube Just scroll back all the way to the oldest videos all the talks are there and all the talks have like 400 views it's crazy it's like oh you want to be successful oh really the same thing like Harvard's whole curriculum is like online you can go take any Harvard class you want online and people will cry about not like not having the the opportunities that the rich Harvard kids have what are you talking about all the classes are online you can take off YouTube right now yeah have the same education that Gates had that Zuckerberg had access to you got access to all of it and they'll have like 900 views and it just shows you that like the the the real ones are gonna go do the thing the those 900 views are like the valuable people like I want to go meet all 900 people that are that are watching those videos because those are the people that are actually finding so that's take away one that's Oh no you're two my two two controversial things San Francisco is back baby and the second thing is this whole like idea of moving away to lower your taxes and moving away to be remote the best teams are going to be working together they're going to be in the room with each other especially pre-product Market fit but I will take any team that's co-located over a remote team any day just head to head if it was a competition I would take the the team that's going to be in there every day having a bunch of serendipitous conversations whiteboarding ideas getting to know each other better because they're just spending a like absurd obscene amount of time together I would rather have those people that are willing to commit and go all in like that over a distributed remote team where you're spending half your day actually you know walking your dog and taking care of your kids and doing all this stuff I think they're just gonna outperform and I think that San Francisco is going to outperform I think that going to the the dense city as I the people who care about the extra 10 in taxes or the people who are like oh I don't want to live here because um you know I don't like the DA's policy on crime you know I I just think that that's I think it's insane that people in a in a game where the upside is like thousand X returns that people optimize for a 10 break in state income tax it's crazy to me yeah but bro you don't even live in San Francisco stone's throw away as they say I'm across the bridge one person can throw a rack that bar I don't know catapult for them I'm one easy pass away [Laughter] I agree with everything you're saying and find this client info have you heard of HubSpot application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better all right this next statement we're gonna call it three killer Asians and it's about three people uh one of those two of those people is a couple that you're gonna talk about but I'll go first and the reason I'm breaking this up so this week so let me preface by saying I don't know anything about like public markets I I I'm a I'm a index investor I don't do anything like crazy and so I don't know much but this week I paid attention to my portfolio did you pay attention to yours there was a nice little bump I have not checked what's going on so stocks are doing well the tech sector is doing well and I emailed my banker I texted him I go Griffin what's going on man why uh why why do I have so much more money than I did the day before and he said Nvidia just crushed their earnings and like a lot of people out there I know the name Nvidia I know that Nvidia is a company but I don't really know what they do do you know what Nvidia does they make chips they make the chips that go into your uh like you buy a gaming PC the graphics the GPU in there is going to be made by Nvidia it's like Intel bikes chips and Nvidia makes chips and AMD makes chips there's like three companies that make chips okay so do me a favor do you have Google up Google Gary Oldman so the word Dairy and then almond o l e-m-a-n you know you see who that is old man like old man you see it uh it's pulling up it's an actor very old yeah you see it you see it yeah you see you see Gary all right you recognize Gary yeah see this guy around yeah okay type in another guy named Gary Cole you see Gary Cole yeah another actor okay and and what's your reaction when you see him um I have no reaction to this guy what am I supposed to be reacting to you just like seeing them around right oh yeah sure it looks like he looks like a guy Nvidia is like the Gary's uh the tech world has no idea where you're going with that so Gary Allman for those of you who watch the computer Gary Oldman was the chief on Dark Knight like the like the top or in the Dark Knight the guy who puts up the bat signal yeah yeah he was also uh Whitson Churchill and like that The Darkest Hour movie He plays all these roles for like you see him and you're like oh that guy's great he's awesome he's always there he always has a good performance and everything he's in it's probably pretty good but like he's never like the guy and he's never like I can't tell you who he is I don't have to look it up same with like you know there's a bunch of these actors who are like that that's what Nvidia is of the tech world so basically and this isn't going to sound like obvious to anyone who's like is in deep Tech but for someone like me who's not I had to like figure out what Nvidia is so basically the story is is that they create GPU as a GPU chips or the GPU they invented it so prior to Nvidia there was like these other chip companies and uh they like intel was one of them just like the big dogs who you have heard about the 70s and 80s and they just make chips that ran your computer whatever but then as computers got a little bit better uh Jensen hung the founder he was like look we need to have a 3D chip for 3D or a chip or 3D video and graphic process so basically like we can like our screens will be more interactive and all that and so he invents this chip and he runs the company now for 30 years so he's been CEO for of this company longer than any other like newish tech company and he made this bet and it wasn't that big of a bet so when he launched in 1993 he raised a two million dollar round of funding at a six million dollar valuation so this wasn't like some like you're gonna crush this like it was just a normal startup at the time but he makes this bet that he thinks that um that uh ctus which is what people used to use that that's going to be like a little bit less popular and gpus which is for graphics and like more General use that's going to be like the thing and so the first people who start using it are Gamers so in like different gaming PCs people start using it and then Apple Microsoft whatever they're like oh man we actually also want some of these chips so we're going to use that but now it's expanded Way Beyond that so like Tesla uses their chips so like when you want to like do self-driving they've got an Nvidia chip that helps them figure out like where people are uh um you know the camera will will use the GPU chip and then it will put like you know when you're on a Tesla you can see people walking across the street uh and then now they're even using for artificial intelligence so anyone who's using like open AI Amazon web services things like that they're also using GPU and so this company it's one of those companies that you don't really think about because it's a B2B company but at this point and this is what shocked me Nvidia is now either the 7th or eighth largest company in the world is that insane well and so like this company because their stock did well the whole NASDAQ which is like a tax uh a tech based um index the market cap there's almost one trillion it's 963 billion right now it's insane right so because Nvidia popped the whole NASDAQ the whole NASDAQ which is a a tech-based uh a tech forward like Stock Exchange that's what I meant not indexes they're killing it because of that and so I have no idea I like heard that name and me I'm like what is this little like gaming company how is this like moving the stock market and that's what it is and this guy uh the founder the um the acquired guys have a really good episode on him his name's Jensen he's like really interesting so he was a Taiwanese immigrant and he his parents didn't have any money so they sent him to like a boarding school which is like a reform school for kids who had issues and like his roommate was this guy who had just got out of prison at the age of like 16 or 17 and he had been stabbed like 50 times and so the guy was like Hey keep me out of your work computers and I'll show you how to lift weights and so if you look at this guy now Jensen he's like a pretty buff guy and he also has like the word Nvidia the Nvidia logo tattooed on him and he like says I'll be like really wild things like he'll say by Will to survive is greater than almost anyone's will to kill me and like yeah all these phrases where he just says like I'm all in baby and so he's a really interesting entrepreneur but he's like the Gary Oldman of the world where we don't actually like he's not up there like we're not watching videos of him like Mark Zuckerberg doing Jiu Jitsu because he's not like a mainstream facing guy but now I think it's gonna change because they are absolutely crushing it and I'm one the many people who probably had no idea what they do yeah when the acquired guys came on our pod I think you asked them you're like hey you studied all these companies you studied all these these epic Titans of business um and I think you said like who would you not want to compete with or who would you want to compete with the least and uh they said this guy Jensen Wong they were like Jensen the guy from Nvidia the leather jacket wearing CEOs got the Nvidia tattoo on his shoulder who has just been like you know a monster for like you know 20 years with this company and that was not the answer like I wouldn't have guessed that that's who they would have said um and it was it it was an unfulfilling answer because I was like well I don't know anything about this guy and I bet most of our listeners were like Oh I thought you would have said Mark Zuckerberg or someone famous and this guy's just quietly kind of behind the scenes although he is like a loud personality he's not he doesn't seem obnoxious but he wears like a cool leather jacket and he looks like very confident but he's just been quietly behind the scenes kind of killing it I don't know what his net worth is now but I bet you he's one of like the top 30 or 50 richest people in America or uh in the world at the moment and he just gave a talk at like Taiwanese like National University or something like that and he I haven't seen it yet as I guess commencement speech um and like you remember this the Steve Jobs like the great one like the the one he did at Stanford that was like just like incredible um he that he gave a talk I haven't seen the whole thing but there's a couple of lessons some people have tweeted out I want to share a couple with you so he's like uh he goes lesson number one humility he goes confront failure head-on and ask for help so he says back in the day or the uh one year in the early days of Nvidia they got their first big chip contract and it was with Sega the video game console and he goes after a year of development they realized that they had picked the wrong technical strategy to make the chip that was going to do the things the Sega needed to fulfill the contract and he's like we realize our architecture was the wrong strategy he's like uh you know we didn't know what to do should we scramble try to make it work should we just deliver something that's not great like what should we do should we start over we don't have time he's like so I just called the CEO Sega and I was like hey I think you have to find another partner um but I also need you to keep paying us on the contract these are these things like I hate to even ask this I'm embarrassed if you like if we don't have this money we're gonna go out of business um like if you just please pay out the rest of this contract like I'm embarrassed to even ask you this but um we need these six months to survive and uh We've we screwed up uh you know I'll do everything in my power to help you do this and I'll try to make it right after this but like if we don't have this if we don't pay this contract it's over the show's over for us and the CFC uh Sega agreed he actually paid it out they gave him six months to survive he's like you got to confront your mistakes head on with humility and ask for help that saved it video um he's like this is the hardest thing to learn for somebody who's the the smart and successful type they try to uh you know avoid failure or be a denial or uh or hide from it what else did it say he goes second is uh lesson number two you have to endure the pain and suffering to realize your dream so he goes uh in 2007 we announced uh Cuda this like new way to like kind of like program your gpus I think that's the real key for NVIDIA they don't just make the chips they make the pro they make the this Cuda thing is important so especially the way that people developers can use gpus and like uh control the GPU to do what they want so by the way they don't even make the chips they like design them and they have a partnership at this other time which is why like sometimes they'll say like you'll hear things like well Taiwan gets invaded by China we're at risk the eighth largest company in the world is going to be kind of screwed which means XYZ for the rest yeah especially all the companies that need chips uh like oh all of our cars need chips all of our computers need chips all of our phones that need chips if we lose control of the chips it's like losing the nukes or it's like losing access to oil it's like a big deal so anyways um so he goes he goes you know we basically we tried to create this thing back in 2007 uh it was super hard super expensive our profits took a huge hit and we had many years of poor performance and our shareholders were skeptical like dude why are you spending all this money on this stupid like gpus Cuda thing like you need to improve profitability blah blah he's like but we just said no we're gonna keep doing this and basically it took like 3 four years before there was even a market for this but by the time there was a market for this they were so far ahead he's like so then the phone comes out the phone phones become a huge success now phones need gpus and by 2010 they had the lead in the mobile chip market so uh chips for phones and he's like that was huge and um oh no sorry the uh I screwed up the story The gpus Thing becomes a big deal as gaming continues to go that direction and like all the AI machine learning stuff but like that was it took like you know almost 10 years for that to come through but they like stuck to their guns and stuck with it even though the shareholders and the the public markets were punishing them for it and then last one he's like you know we were in the mobile chip Market we were the leader and he's like um but it just became so competitive it was so many people fighting for the same pie they basically decided to like sacrifice um sacrifice the mobile market and leave that in order to do to uh to go for like you know a different Market this kind of AI machine learning market and again it seemed like a terrible strategic bet it's like you're leaving the biggest Market cell phones in order to go for this like unknown like you know risky thing and that strategic bet paid off because they became you know the by far the leader in this field and uh and now that became like you know the biggest Market the market everybody's bullish about and the reason their stock is up so much is because they like gave guidance like they had like a revenue Target or forecast or whatever there was a revenue forecast and they like just came out like uh actually we think we're gonna Crush that by like 30 and they're like wait 30 on a number that's already in the multi-billions and they're like yes and so the stock took off after that dude it's awesome so I'm a big fan I'm a big fan of the sky soaps is it huh or or I don't know the The Silent Age there are always a challenge for me but Mr Jensen I've been in media you are today's killer Asian number one shot tell me who are killer agent number two and three all right we're going from a guy who makes gpus and and AI artificial intelligence to orange chicken I butchered the joke it was too good excuse me you heard to MSC so I met somebody who was like a real estate person and they were like uh I was like yeah you know how's the real estate thing going they're like oh dude it's going great we're growing growing growing I was like so you're still just doing this all with your own money and he's like yeah although there's one person who wants to put money in that I'll take and I was like but you've always said no to anybody's money like why who's this one person and why why are you interested you guys it's the guy who started Panda Express this guy's a billion like multi-billionaire and he's got so much money he's got an unbelievable amount of money that he doesn't know what to do with it I was like you know he's like he needs a place to invest this money and I was like Panda Express like how much money are they making and I kind of looked into it so this is this segment is Panda Express the 10 billion dollar Mom and Pop so I don't know how much you know about Panda Express but a bit it does uh I know you've uh you've tested the the goods so so basically it's a privately owned company so it's just owned by this husband and wife it does about 5 billion a year in sales 5.3 billion last year there are no franchises like of this thing so they kind of independently own I think almost all there might be like a hundred that are like in international territories that they don't control but for the most part they've grown this thing to a huge International chain it's I think the third biggest fast food chain or something like that it's like you know just behind uh you know sort of like the the the huge ones the McDonald's and Chick-fil-A's of the world and um they're on track to become a 10 billion dollar mom and pop company which is just kind of insane and my friend who I uh who who was telling me what other names what's that uh Andrew like churn I don't know how you say it exactly it's like a churn it's c-h-e-r-n-g or something like that uh it's him and his wife and they they vote this thing they've earned this thing so he started the first one it was like called the the Panda Inn back in the day it was like a normal restaurant I think he was not I think he started it yeah I think his dad had one his dad was like so so his dad was a was a chef and he he opened up panda in and his dad was the chef of that restaurant and then he then fast food started taking off and Andrew got pretty fascinated with this idea of fast food and was like okay what if we did Chinese fast food and so they the second or third location they did was this like Express this like fast and it was in California right yeah but there was more agents and they um and they start doing a bunch of things that are smart so some of the Strategic smart things that they did was uh um they opened up a bunch of locations as they grew in airports and military bases which a lot of people weren't doing at the time but they were like oh this is a great way to build awareness like these are like huge hubs that a lot of people come through if we're here we will become like known and normal as like uh as like a Cuisine basically and so they did those even though those aren't the most profitable locations they did it kind of like for the brand the second thing they um the uh his wife was like a food engineer or something like that and so she was one of the first people in Chinese restaurants to use a whole bunch of tech so Tech to monitor inventory or measure speed for for operations and that's why they became so efficient and they called themselves McDonald's of the East because they're as efficient as a McDonald's even though almost every other kind of like Chinese restaurant was it was a traditional mom and pop they didn't you know they write down the orders by hand they you know they track inventory by going to open up the fridge and eyeball and everything and being like I think we need to order more eggs um whereas they turned this into kind of like a machine and they would find things that were working in one store so like this guy in Hawaii who owned one of the who's running one of the stores the chef there he created orange chicken and he's like oh I think I could take you know that one beef dish that's an appetizer that uses the orange peels I think I could use that orange thing on the general Style's chicken and like combine the two have this fried chicken that's got the orange flavor so Panda Express invented orange chicken that's what it sounded like for my my reading now I don't know if there's others that are debating that but that's that's how they frame it at least and they sell 100 million pounds of orange chicken a year it's like the same crazy number and so uh yeah just the same thing so I think they do almost like like 800 million dollars of ebitda incredible amount of money I know someone who knows him and he told me the same number yeah he told me he goes he goes knocking on the door he goes they're knocking on the door of a billion in ebitda exactly what do you do with all this money and people have asked him like are you going to take it public and the cfo's like never this is going to be a family business they'll pass it down from generation to generation our job is to make this a multi-generational family-owned business and uh I think that's really cool like there's so few of those that like refuse to go public and why do they need to they're rolling in profits right like they don't they don't need the liquidity of the markets they don't have investors that they need to pull off I couldn't find if there was like some Angel Investors early on that there probably was something I don't know if they own literally 100 but it is uh it seems like it's either 100 or close to it in terms of their ownership which I think is is kind of insane he also does a few other things so um if I remember correctly I might get some of the details wrong but I think that piece the day you start working there I believe he like even like at the I think this is like as a cashier not just like H2 but as like a a retail worker I'd say he buys you the book um How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie because he said that when he I don't know if he is I think he might be an immigrant but his parents were for sure immigrants and he was like trying to figure out how to like assimilate and how to like be more likable and charismatic so he could like uh get along with uh Americans and he read How to Win Friends and Influence People and it like changed his life uh I also think he read like they can grow rich and so he like gives people these books and he also sponsors tons of his employees to go to Tony Robbins stuff so he's like all about this like self-help stuff which is cool we got a bunch in common we have a bunch of comment and he likes that for his employees and so I think if I if I had to guess when you get to be the size of uh a hundred million pounds of orange chicken you're no longer like a product company or just like a restaurant company you're a collecting people and making sure that they all behave in a very particular type of way as well as like a logistics company and so in terms of like you know like there's a reason why McDonald whenever they know something it's like oh that's this huge announcement just because you have to make ribs like dude because they have to go and like get like a you know 500 pounds of pork in order to like make this it's like a huge ordealous but in terms of treating his people well and like collecting people and he like invests I heard uh into them a whole lot so he's kind of like a really interesting guide I don't know if this is like PR spun stuff where all uh you know he looks great all the time uh just from the outside but he seems like he does a lot of really good good stuff there's a I I just asked uh Chaturbate for some fun facts I said give me some some fun anecdotes about them and they said the thing about the the books said he buys uh thousands of copies of uh of his favorite books one is like Awakening the Buddha within and gives it to his employees another thing that it says is according to Forbes article um staff members often start the day with affirmations like people are depending on me to be at my best I believe in myself and my abilities opportunities are everywhere and I don't know if that's that's truly how they start their day but it's a hell of a lot better than just saying the Pledge of Allegiance I think we should put this in schools um yeah it's crazy I mean 2 000 Plus stores as a kind of family owned and non-franchised out business is mind-boggling level of scale to reach um he also understand his wife Peggy that just like still kind of like owned the thing and he does the total opposite of what you just said before he moved to Nevada um he now looks at the best friend because he's making so much income but yeah I know that he I think Nevada's now it was like a big deal when he left California and to Nevada that's his physical state I think it's about tech entrepreneurs if you were if you are gonna build a uh silica Valley style Venture startup this this is the place to be for that I'm not saying everybody in the world should live in California if you're if you're uh if you're if you're slinging 100 million pounds of orange chicken you live wherever the hell you want that's that's rule number three I want you to tell me we're gonna move into the last section here I want you to tell me you got a little ambitious here you titled the section famous people who are back with new companies I don't want to call them famous maybe noticeable somewhat popular notable notable notable is a better one let's do notable tell me what you got I don't know if you've seen this but there's a few people who are well known in our industry for for a bunch of reasons that are doing interesting things I want to get your quick reaction to each of them so I don't know if you've seen all these but uh but we'll start with uh Naval so Naval is uh kind of like the I know one of the Godfathers of uh Southern Valley's been here again since that kind of like pre.com boom days he did a startup that went public and then he uh you know famously got a big dispute with a bunch of people about it he created a a Blog that was called Venture hacks and then him and his partner nivi and they that became that eventually sort of led to angelist which is a multi-billion dollar startup that's like LinkedIn for the tech industry and he's known he's got like a million plus followers on Twitter because very insightful guy so Naval is awesome he's like a self-appointed guru which is brilliant but he's actually I think he's a non-self-appointed guru I think other people appoint him a guru and he's like that makes me a little uncomfortable but I kind of like it he lead he leaned into it but I've as somebody who's consumed I think every word that Duvall has said somehow like I've watched all his live streams his podcast all that stuff right love his stuff he um many times we'll be like people you know people be like why don't you do more or have your own things and he's like I don't want I don't I don't like this playing this role of this Guru thing I don't like how much I like it and I have to be very careful that I don't fall into that um I don't want that to be my life and my identity and get excited about oh I'm gonna I'm just excited about learning this thing because I'm gonna go tell everybody about it and then everybody's gonna think I'm so smart he's like no I don't want that I want to learn the thing because I like to learn it and that's it um and he's like you know he's like I you know like it's like junk food when he's like I get on here and I give random advice to people it's my junk food it's not what I want to be eating and people base their lives on it but it is far yeah Justin's got the Nvidia tattoo I got the naval tattoo on my arm okay so what's air Chat thing have you seen it have you played with it okay yeah isn't it just like a little bit but is it it almost felt like an AI friend is that what it is no not at all so it's a app it's kind of like a social media app so you open it up and there's these like rooms so you can go into a room that's like it might be people talk about Ai and it's sort of like uh it's audio but it's recorded so I could go on there and I could be like you know I was playing with this chat thing one of the cool things that I've been doing is this has anybody tried anything that's uh blown their mind that blew my mind and then another person who follows me can just reply be like uh dudes are totally right here's what I did and you're hearing their voice it's like voice plus the transcription of it so it's kind of like a a way to have almost like a podcasty style thing where you're having a conversation but it's it's open like anybody can kind of hop in that you allow into your room and um and the conversation goes wherever it is wherever it goes so I had a little bit of like a dinner party in a way and so there's like for example one of the rooms I liked was the guy nivi telling the origin story of angelist which I had never heard before but he was like all right I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna tell you the origin evangelist and it's actually like not what I thought he's like we had Venture Venture hacks the blog and that was kind of popular and then I was like I was trying to figure out what to do like how do we turn this into a business and so I emailed Naval Naval had owned 10 of it and I was like all right well uh hey I don't know what you think about this but like I'm thinking about selling this PDF like okay Venture hacks is a free blog but then here's this PDF like we're joking about like the webinar thing it's like dude even some of these awesome people did it he's like I'm gonna sell this PDF that will uh like just give people like templates and Naval is like okay that's cool um you know for my 10 just keep it with how this like this awesome PDF thing you're gonna try to do like go ahead and hold on to my ten percent I don't need it you need it more than I do and then he's like he's like then we're driving home from some events uh after I had told him about the PDF thing I was like ready to go do that and Naval had this like I you know like we were shooting the and we had this idea like oh you know what I really want is like I want a list of investors and just what they invest in what check size because people are always asking us due to venture hacks like hey do you know any investors that would invest in my startup he's like I just want a list that I can refer to as like here's all the investors I know here's what they invest in and here's the check size so when someone asks for an intro I can go look at the list and make the intro and then he's like yeah that's cool I don't think that's a business like it's gonna that's gonna make less money than my PDF but like you're right that would be really useful for us so he's like so I went home that night he's like I made a form and I emailed it out to every investor I know that was like yo what do you invest in um what's your average check size and what's your email address and like you know are you open to people contacting you about like for introductions for deals he's like and I sent it to people and they immediately filled it in it was the ugliest form I didn't even pay for the premium he's like just a reminder that like you know you just need to start you need to get it out there and like get momentum going and he's like now um I I with any project if I can't like launch some version of it in the first 24 hours it like kind of like it bothers me a lot like I don't really want to do projects but I can't do that he's like so that was the first that was V1 of angels we got this these people back and then we put it on a we put it on our website and then we like got some like press coverage because it was like oh here's a list of all the angels and it was like on all their emails were there so that was bad so we had to take that off and then hide their emails because people were just getting spamming them he's like and then that became like the precursor to what Angel list was which is now this like multi-billion dollar company was like just this list of Angel Investors and that was the simplest like useful thing and he's like uh and so he's telling the story in the air chat and he's like if you guys want by the way like I could tell you the two other ideas that we like you know two other paths that we looked at that like turned out to not be not be a good idea is but um you know let me know and then you could see that this now I'm like oh okay I'm gonna follow along I kind of want to hear this oral history of angelist and so it's cool in that way right like it's a it's a cool new app so he's coming out with this and he's like I'm a co-founder of this and the other guy I think who's behind it is that guy Brian norgaard I don't know how he says last time exactly yeah yeah yeah um who's kind of like well respected in the tech scene uh as like a product guy a product designer guy and they like work at a Tinder or something yeah he basically like he started a couple things that like had a bunch of hype but didn't fully pan out but we're cool products like didn't work but we're cool and then ended up like had a product at like the match group or something like that at IAC and so then he like ran Tinder um and now he's like doing this I guess so that's kind of like one one app so give me your you haven't played with it so it's hard to get your quick reaction well I yeah you gotta like stand up for a weightless do do you think that uh do you think that this is gonna be like a thing I do not so I I think it's gonna be it's actually reminds me a lot of Clubhouse um in that early on clubhouse was awesome it was awesome because it was such a curated community and it was like they brute forced only dope people onto the platform because that's who their friend group was and so early on with Clubhouse you would go into any room and it'd be like super interesting conversation you could just hop in and meet people and you could build and I told my friend this there's a guy who used to work for me Jason and I was like Jason he was still at twitch after he got Acquired and was kind of like you know spinning his wheels a little bit and I go Jason you should just forget about twitch I said every night you should go on clubhouse and hang out there for like five hours you will build like the best network in Silicon Valley in the next two months if you just do that because I was like you're an awesome talker people love you when they meet you but it's just hard to go meet like the Power Players Clubhouse is this place where all the power players are hanging out and they want to be talking to randos because that's what Clubhouse is and that they're excited about Clubhouse therefore they're excited about talking to randos I was like you can go in there and go from Rando to a friend in like two months and he did exactly that he went in there he started hanging out and he built this awesome friend group They still hang out in real life today he ended up raising a fund out of that group of people like dude you seem like you know a lot about crypto like can you invest some of my money in crypto and he's like uh I don't know and ended up raising a few million dollar fund invested it made these guys money triple I think he doubled or tripled their money and paid it all back and gave away stop the fund within like a year which is like incredible and um yeah he just like had this awesome Network experience so to me air chat's like that right now you go in there everybody's smart and awesome and like the who's who of the tech world and so it's great for me as a user right now I don't think it'll stick like that and I also don't think it'll catch on to be a mainstream social media thing because for one reason audio is too slow people can like scroll and read I don't know some crazy like three or five times faster than audio and so there is uh it's too slow any social media you're now competing with Tick Tock it's like how do you compete with the entertainment per second that you get rate that you get from an Instagram or Tick Tock or even a Twitter it's all short form bite size just instant dopamine hits and it's like podcasts it's very hard to compete with that it'll never be as like you know billions of people are just opening this thing up all the time because the audio is too slow and you get too few like hits of Awesomeness per uh per minute that you compare to your other options and other buttons on your phone so that's why I don't think it'll become like a mainstream thing tell me about this tradie thing okay so Dom who was the founder of fast.com which was a funny what's the third what's the 30-second story of fast Thursday story fast the guy gets this domain fast.com comes out with crazy hype on Twitter of just fast is gonna be the like the next big thing it's one click instant checkout what Amazon did with one click checkout we're gonna do for the rest of the internet and they're just pumping on Twitter how fast it's gonna be awesome they raise a bunch of money at a huge valuation they're bragging about hundreds of millions right hundreds of millions hundreds pre-launch uh yeah pre-traction basically and a few of us were kind of like I don't know man I'm not sure like where's your customers why what's going on and uh sure enough the bubble pops uh people sort of realize that fast.com has basically no traction it had like I don't know like tens of thousands in Revenue as it had like you know almost a billion dollar valuation and uh the product doesn't really work that great the team is whatever it all just falls apart I don't remember the exact details of how it fell apart like but it fell apart they were burning I think 10 million dollars a month of investor money at one point something like that between three and ten million I don't remember the exact numbers but they were burning an absurd amount of money he couldn't raise anymore because they had no track no traction at a certain point the investors want to see traction and so fast just combust and then it comes out that oh this guy Dom previously had built a company in Australia called tow.com that was supposed to be Uber for towing your car and tow truck drivers and basically like that company also had a dope domain toe.com.edu and uh raise money it got a bunch of press got sub users but not a lot ran up a bill that he couldn't pay like a 13 million dollar bill or something like that he's getting sued for by the the government there because I like Towing contracts that he couldn't fulfill and uh ended up just like leaving Australia and like starting like you know he used to be Dominic Holland and he rebranded as Dom in the US and and uh and did fast.com so it's kind of like okay this guy's track record so now he's got tradie.com another quick domain name have you seen this thing tradie like uh yeah and yeah and so explain what it is and I'll tell you what I heard about it so it kind of looked on the surface like most of Dom's ideas it sounds kind of like a good idea I said it says the fastest way to grow your trade business and he just shows a bunch of like you know Blue Collar types oh this guy does like Landscaping this guy's got like a tractor um and it's like hey we give you a website we let you do your customers book you and pay for you online we give you easy way to do invoicing you know if you're a professional you know trades person uh you should be using trading that's the that's the pitch it's not a bad pitch I think it's a good idea now tell tell what you heard about because I think we heard the same thing okay so here I'll read it so someone tweeted they go looking at treaty.com um so far 80 of the businesses I've contacted from the site meaning there's a bunch of businesses that were listed as testimonials and I think he said it looks like Dom's at it again right that's the frame yeah he goes down he goes you got it again he goes 80 of the companies that contacted from the site don't seem to be real they're shell companies with fake Yelp and Google listings and ninety percent of them didn't poke up didn't pick up the phone uh trady said one treaty made their landing page without permit oh one person who was listed on the website said that tradie made the landing page without that company's permission and two so far seem to actually be using the product but tradie is giving it to them for free and sponsoring them and then he shows like all the domain names that the same LLC that owns tradie has also bought all these other domain names that were listed on the website of tradie.com yeah this has got Justin Mitchell J Mitch is the guy who uh who tweeted this out and so uh so yeah like straight off the bat and now by the way I think all those are gone from the tradie website so with that and again my takeaway is run I'm not not touching this thing instant reaction all right and the next two Tip Top uh and Bay Area times yeah let's skip that one let's do the pomp one so uh pop friend of the Pod is doing something interesting I don't know the full story I haven't talked to him about this have you talked about this Bay Area times thing no not yet do you know what I didn't even know about it I don't even know what it is okay so uh go to bayareatimes.com it looks like so pomp is famous for he was one of the early guys who was a very vocal about crypto he started a podcast YouTube channel and now he's a whole personality he's pivoted away a little bit from crypto so now he's just talking about business but also a little bit politics and sports and all types yeah his kind of relaunch I want to talk to you about which is basically like how do you think that's going and gonna go so he was the Bitcoin bull he he popped off in terms of uh he's built his audience around Bitcoin and saying how amazing crypto is and then people will know like you know the kind of like the the crypto kind of haters basically will be like dude look at this he removed the red laser eyes he removed all mention of Bitcoin from his uh bio um and now like he hosted a real estate conference the other day he's uh hosting like you know startup events um you know just like normal start of things he's doing this like his Media stuff is not about crypto anymore and so you know I think he's diversifying and kind of Shifting away from I think it's working really well too yeah and like I I would just say this I think for most people it's a very hard transition I would not want to bet against pump I think he is a very formidable smart person who is going to be successful and whatever he chooses to be successful at and I think he's chosen I'd like to build my old code to be about these these things instead of just this one and um I think it's a very hard pivot to make and he's making it very well he's doing it very well so far from what I can tell so basically he owns right now he owns I think he owns executive recruiting company a research company a course that trains you to get jobs in crypto and then one and then maybe like two more um and then I think he's investing beyond that so here's what he said he goes introducing the Bay Area times this is a new product that uses data and visuals to analyze what's happening across business finance and Tech on a daily basis so you go to Bay areatimes.com and he basically says narrative dominate the headlines on other platforms writers spend paragraphs regurgitating the same points over and over again these Legacy products take too long to read they bury the data deep into paragraphs and it's hard to recall the information but what if you just want cold hard facts what if you want to see the data in a single chart what if you don't have 10 minutes to read every morning that's what we built this for so every morning they send out a email that's got five big stories it's got a visual um which is like a chart or a graph along with a few bullet points no hidden agenda no Twist of facts no bias narrative that's his claim so he says he's been testing this with 20 000 readers and the feedback has been phenomenal um go for it right so you could see it looks like it's built on sub stack so let me go to the first one all right so like the one that he sent out three days ago it's basically here's the data it's like what's going on in the stock market what's going on with Bitcoin gold ethereum et cetera and then it'll be like uh here's a chart on life expectancy and it says life expecting has been stagnant for the past 20 years after the cover drop it's at 77 years old which is the same level as 2003 right so that's like the one big chart and then the bullet points underneath it so he's basically using visuals to and data to explain what's going on in the news I think it's cool I think the worst case scenario here for him is that this makes like two or three million dollars a year and it's very very profitable the best case it becomes hustle morning Brew whatever it gets millions of subscribers that make tens of millions or however much more um I think it's cool what do you think I kind of wish this was an actual printed thing I like people that are going into like newspapers and magazines right now I think those are very interesting so there's um Agora the newsletter company I always talk about they would say that they would charge like two grand a year and they would send you like a newsletter but it was a financial newsletter except when they say newsletter they would literally mail it to you and they still do that and it was just printed on like printer paper and it was kind of cool for that reason right and I actually agree with you I think that could be cool where you just like literally mail someone and it comes in like one of those tan envelopes and it looks like it's almost like uh here's like the here's like um like I think the president every day gets like a briefing it's like a presidential briefing where it's like here's what you need to know and like oftentimes I'm like just a piece of paper like just give me that but at my house totally and I actually do think that would be cool did we talk about this jumbo mail marketing thing what's up so I saw this on Twitter it's pretty cool so basically um they they go the tagline is this have you ever received a package in the mail and thrown it away without opening it neither have we and basically they're like 90 of people 90 plus percent of people who receive like a stuffed envelope like a stuffed package will rip the thing off and open it so if you go to um the Twitter is at mailjumbo it's basically the icons this elephant and it goes we create jumbo chunky mail that's guaranteed to reach your audience it's good for Real Estate Investors home services and business buyers um and basically that what they do is like you they just do Direct Mail like kind of like you know here oh we got a bunch of uh you know like spam in the mail like oh whatever we want to buy your business or we're a real estate agent whatever but they do it in these jumbo packages just to increase your response rate so they're like yeah it costs more but you're actually going to get more people to to read your thing and I thought this is like a brilliant simple like side hustle style business that I think also will get to you know mid seven figures in revenue and be a profitable bootstrap business of uh just jumbo mail marketing there's this guy named Sam Evans who've talked about that like 10 years ago he had this course called consulting.com and he would teach you how to become a consultant whether it's like how to do SEO for companies I don't know what services the consultant would do but he would teach you how to start a consultancy business and here's one big thing that he I don't know if he says he invented it but he goes this is like my stick is I do this thing called lumpy mail where I said just a normal envelope but I put something lumpy in it like I forget what he would put but like a figurine or a pen I forget whatever it was but it would make it feel like the envelope had a little bit of weight to it because the reason I do that is because when lumpy mail gets opened way more and I can get your attention way more and so what these guys are doing he used to call it lumpy they're calling it jumbo so I bet they like learn about it from him but and he claims that it was amazing well the guy who's behind it one of the guys is behind it is the same guy that does uh is the mobile mobile home park guy on Twitter um who also does like nine other businesses and is like completely he's like if somebody downloaded the podcast into their brain and then their brain said let's do all of them he just takes he's doing like nine ideas at once at all times he's kind of a Madman but this is one of his ideas and he did it because when he was trying to buy businesses like I think like the mobile home like buy these mobile parks mobile home parks he needed to do Mass Outreach and he wanted to increase his response rate of are they actually even seeing my my offer uh or that I want to buy their their their business and um how do I get them to reply and so I think this was part of the the inspiration for that I think we should wrap up here but as before we do it I want to give you Kudos you said something last pod that was very sunny that totally flew under the under the radar and if you made it this far 60 Minutes in I'm gonna give you a piece of gold that you can go to see Joe that you're going to tell your friends we said something about like breaking up with someone maybe it was like breaking up in the business really relationship I don't remember but I said something like it's not you it's me and you said yeah it's not you it's me in that I think you're horrible and I've regurgitated that joke this weekend killed

that is like a free joke I've just given you something all right um I've given you the listener something what do they give us when we give them something right nobody just takes right you don't want

YouTube and there's no feedback loop you don't get any comments on the podcast app but on YouTube people leave comments and now we get I don't know I don't know how many it is like maybe 30 40 comments per per video um I love I read every single one of them every single time like no joke as it's like my only way to kind of like interact dude they're all say they're all saying you look

interesting and uh and to that spammer out there that keeps trying to trick all of our people into a WhatsApp group I'm hunting you I'm coming for you because the YouTube algorithm can't get you I will get you I will find I'm sorry it's hard I have a unique set of skills that have prepared me for this moment to find you on every single video and remove your comments yeah 10 years of Googling has prepared you to reverse image search and figure out where they've made their mistake um all right we're at it that's the pot we'll see you all soon [Music] thank you [Music]

DDC hearing aids I think that's actually going to be a big deal and they're profitable I mean I'm just turning you on yeah they were yeah [Laughter] oh my God how far how far away from the coast did they live for the inland [Music] all right we're here Steph Smith's here one of the all-time all-time favorite guests uh this is I think appearance number six so if you love this one go go listen to the other five that stuff's done Steph's is great because she brings a dossier I can't even call it a document it should be on Google dossier.com because it is a 15 page document of Trends ideas uh small like you know observations that might you know half ideas that might become something which makes you essentially the perfect MFM guest um and you're also cool and fun to hang out with so thank you for coming back yeah good to be here every time I come on I get way more nervous than any other appearance because you guys hyping up like that Sean do you know how I met Steph uh no tell me the story I will forever take credit for Steph Smith's career it has nothing to do no matter what I do no matter how hard she works no matter how smart she is it's all of me I've I I'm a completely so basically she had this blog it's still is it Steph Smith dot IO yeah it was a really good blog and she had this headline and the headline was to be great just be good consistently is that it stuff basically uh what was it what is it exactly yeah it's like how to be great question Mark just be great repeatedly be good repeatedly oh yes be good and I was like I dm'd her I was like Steph this is the best headline I've ever read this is a really good headline like we're launching this thing called Trends do you want to join us and she was like ah maybe and I was like look come work for us for a couple years and I have a feeling you're gonna like go and leave us and that's totally cool come do like a tour of Duty now it's been about a year and a half for me a year since she's left she's uh at Andreessen Horowitz one of the uh biggest VC firms in the world how is that going it's going great yeah we just hired a producer which is nice because for a while I was kind of hacking it together myself but yeah I feel like the podcast finally is taking off and we're trying a bunch of different formats it's actually like I feel like I'm easing into it I'm finally having fun like when I listened to my first million you can tell you guys talk about it's like the best job in the world I'm finally easing into that which is nice what's it like working there I mean when I think about working there I think of like uh like the TV show billions you know like it's just like fun [ __ ] all the time but is it just normal company [ __ ] I mean it just like is it more normal of a job than I think or is it as spectacular as I would imagine I mean it's kind of both because day to day it's totally normal because you're just doing your job you're just doing work do you go into an office are you remote um I'm remote they do have offices I go on every so often just because I started working remotely I a year into my career and so for the last like eight years or so I've never had an office and so it's like a novelty for me everyone else is looking sick of the office and I'm like oh candy bars you're like oh you just sit here all day wow yeah you can't leave this box I know it's crazy I'm like oh it called like how special I think uh the way Sam talks about like when his wife Sarah worked at Facebook and he's like and you know when you work at a place you just sort of get used to everything and you kind of optimize for convenience and so like oh they're all hands meetings on I can either go down to the cafeteria and listen to it or they have like a streaming option because there's plays all around the world like all right whatever I'll just stream it from my desk yeah that's easier I'll eat my salad here and Sam was like no you need to go sit front row with a pen and pad and when he says any questions you need to like jump out of your chair and ask them a question every single week until he invites us over for dinner like that was basically Sam's like master plan until you're his best friend I kind of think you should be doing the same thing like what's the point of working at Andreessen Horowitz friends unless you're just like at the office every day just waiting for some like awesome Mark Andreessen moment to happen or just like you're there when he just yells at somebody and uh it just goes off or like you know they're doing a blood you know like the the 12 year olds coming to give them blood and like you're like yes this is the weirdness I came here for is like it's like every it's like every movie ever where there's like the big boss at the conference table and it's like who what channel let's put this together and then the manager is like oh what about guys bring your guy here let me talk to that person or like Mark andreessen's gonna say like you know who thought to do this the number on this is Blake could be blank and you say actually sir it's six four seven three what did you say it's six four seven three because uh this come with me yeah it's like for six weeks I've been leaving crumbs in the kitchen to see if anybody would clean it up and finally somebody did let's pull up the security footage it was Steph Smith you're promoted you're at the top now right these are the fanfic this is what I think is gonna happen if you but you just got to be there I can't believe you're not there every day you should be every day in the office that's the real upside of your job it's not your salary it's that you can go hang out with some of the smartest people in the world but you got to do the hangout part not the like just when we're on calls then I gotta hover yeah you're right I gotta hover around the office just like you do on the internet you gotta lurk you gotta be able to think about this if you told like 21 year old you that you would be in this position and you'd be like would you just stay home and just kind of do your own thing or would you like go be there and hang out and lurk and like you know just be serendipitous about like what's gonna happen you know the 21 year old you would be like Oh I'm definitely going in I'm going to meet these people I'm going to see what's up uh but I think it's easy later to be like casual about it yeah I gotta Embrace I feel like Sam if you're in the office you'd like go up to someone grabbing a snack and be like hey what's up how's it going and I'm like so awkward I'm like you need to be romantic comedy bumping into everybody and dropping all the papers that you're holding and then being like let's clean this up together not even for the romance just to like you create a little like intersection between you and me and these people when I was at twitch where we got acquired um I literally I even told people there openly I was like I'm not here to do my job I was like I'm gonna find whatever the most interesting things are happening here and I'm just gonna go be in those meetings and do that like you're not gonna but that works right like and it works differently like you're friends with Emmett yeah me and Emmett yo got I got to I was like this is the most interesting guy in this building so anytime it's like you need to go talk to you know Jerry on the fourth floor no I think I'm just gonna hang out in them it's I'm just gonna stay in the meeting like we do the meeting with them everybody gets up and leaves and I'm just gonna stay there on my laptop next group walks in I'm still there I'm just gonna hang out and see what happens like No One's Gonna say anything or uh I remember when ninja got poached to like the top streamer on Twitch got poached and there was like I know there's secret meetings happening about like what should we do should we like counter offer or what is like a code red moment and there's always but I wasn't in those so I just wrote up a plan and I sent it to like the three top Executives I was like here's the plan for Ninja I know I'm not even on the team but then they were like attend this meeting tonight at 8pm and I was like I'm in I got into the cool [ __ ] by just like not doing my job and uh that's that's my recommendation to you if you're gonna be around these like 9 000 IQ people that's the real upside of your job don't do your actual job do the job of hanging out speaking of speaking of which stuff are they actually do you think that the talent there are they actually significantly smarter than any other uh like pretty decent tech company um I would say yes I I would say I've worked at I mean not that many companies but it's a direct shot at you Sam I really ever worked for you and Marketplace typically like at least five five companies where I've been a full-time employee and I would say this job was a lot of checkers and now I'm playing chess what the [ __ ] do those Jesus know about newsletters well you guys have something that's the bigger this uh you were like oh I get nervous for this more than anything else I'm curious do you feel nervous when you are in one of these like a16z like whatever meetings like are you like oh these are yeah these are like people I used to follow on Twitter and [ __ ] like that and now I'm in this room yeah definitely I mean I think there's an element too where I don't represent the company running this podcast but in a way the podcast is like an asset to the firm and I'm like they hired I mean I'm glad they did but they hired a 29 year old who like candidly feels a little out of place amongst these people who have been you know like Mark Andreessen basically like invented the Internet like he created the first browser or the the wide skill browser and so I'm like I do feel sometimes a little out of place but I feel like I'm a year in I'm getting used to it I think you should give yourself more credit uh you're cooler than everybody I've met at a16c so you know I think I think they're lucky to have you as far as I'm concerned I'm gonna bring in one of those Nick Gray name tags that says cooler than you Sean thinks I'm cooler than everyone here exactly this is why I knew she was a good hire because I was like in my head I was like oh she doesn't she doesn't realize how good she is like this is a deal I got him she doesn't know yet um Steph where do you want to go from here um let's just start with the first idea so this one I think is really interesting um because right now I think a lot of people listening know that there's this issue with commercial real estate all these Office Buildings you know are up for sale or at least people are leaving and like the highest level of like vacancy ever basically uh and especially in cities like San Francisco where I think there's like 35 vacancy and going up as soon as people's leases roll off as soon as they can get out of their lease so they will so it's like uh you know it's just a it's a disaster so what is this thing so a lot of people think okay well then let's go change let's swap those that commercial real estate for homes apartments Etc that makes sense but I think there's this huge opportunity for fractional real estate so click one of where it says see here click one of those and tell me what you see all right sure you want to go I'm describing I'll describe it so it look it's something called Temple immersive and it basically looks like a yoga class of some kind it's like dimly lit candles looks like a hot yoga class but then on the roof is this like crazy visual where it looks like you're in the forest and the whole thing just looks super cool where do you think this is like what is this building I mean I have no idea this looks I mean this looks like the lobby of an office building in a way it's like huge but they make it look like a temple yeah so this is a club during the night a nightclub so I mean this is just one example obviously of where real estate is used from what Saturday Friday Saturday Sunday that's it from like 7 00 P.M to 2 A.M and then throughout the week it's not used at all and so the thing that I found fascinating I went to this called Temple immersive in San Francisco and I talked to the woman they just opened up and I was like how'd you find this like did you reach out to a bunch of clubs and they were like no the club reached out to us like I guess it makes sense but this club has just all this real estate that's being unused and I was just thinking about what other I guess one this could be applied elsewhere right like in any City someone can go contact a bunch of clubs link them up with yoga studios Pilates studios Etc um but then I was also thinking what else could this real estate be used for and another Trend that's been taking off is Rage rooms have you guys heard of Rage rooms no but I like smash it right yeah yeah there's there's one in SF as well um but basically they're losing their jobs yeah it's called like the Range Rover Market Street Market yeah the city is the rage room yeah CBS is doing a Rebrand okay what is this rage room [ __ ] so people will literally go and yeah like Sean said you just smash it so like they'll give you a bunch of plates they'll give you like old electronics they'll give you stuff and I think depending on what you choose you pay a different amount and you just get a session in this like empty room and you just get to smash stuff which you just don't get to do in normal life um and so I was thinking I was like you know not just do yoga studio but a lot of this real estate like go convert like a club during the week to like a rage room people we have um I always thought like these little things were it wouldn't be that interesting but we have this member of Hampton and he's tweeting about it his name's Raleigh Williams I was just going to bring him home yep dude so he he I think he's in Utah and he created uh it's like I don't know I thought escape room was like a brand but I think it's also like the style uh and so he created like a version of an escape room and what did he do Sean he sold it for about 30 million dollars he created a business he sold it for 26 million dollars and what he says is basically he's at a law firm and he doesn't love his job and he's like okay should I do something else like what should I do he reads an article that talks about the uh how lucrative Escape rooms were this is back in 2015 when the Escape rooms were really like just sort of like the new trend it was the new new like Froyo basically so he he looks it up he finds out how much money these make and he's like okay I think this is a good business but I don't have enough money to go build it out but in the true entrepreneurial Spirit he doesn't let the lack of resources stop him he becomes resourceful he's like all right can I build an escape room inside this like abandoned bus so he goes by the buys this uh 1984 Bluebird bus and he converts the inside into an escape room and now he's got an escape room on Wheels he could drive it up to companies offices and do the corporate off-site right there and so uh it wasn't perfect in the sense that like if it was a hot day or a cold day it kind of sucked to be inside of it but other than that it was like this like super efficiency is he ever allowed him to get real like cash flow going I think he said like the bus itself was making like um five or ten Grand a month of like you know free cash flow and so he starts opening up more and so he builds out his first real one he opens um you know five six more or whatever then he starts adding to the back of the so there's like real estate so he's getting the real estate with the escape room and he's getting more space and he created a trampoline park and an ax throwing things so basically just like this kind of like out of home entertainment is what we call like this category and so he just bundles these together and uh over that period of like 2015 to 2020-ish he's uh built this thing up and then he starts selling them off so he's selling off uh you know in chunks of pieces and he basically said that he made 26 million dollars doing this I think through a combination of the sale plus the distributions along the way but I might be wrong maybe it's both uh he said he had uh let's see he spent 10 million building these out and over the over the years there's about 20 million in distributions from uh that's crazy so you know kind of an amazing outcome an amazing return for this guy yeah yeah I didn't think that these would be good and then I like met him and I started learning about him he's a nice dude too people should uh go follow him on Twitter how do you know him I just don't through Twitter I saw some of it like I've been going back and forth with him a little bit and then uh he listens to the Pod so you know he had reached out at some point uh Steph talk about this pay transparency thing this interests me a lot yeah so in the last couple years there's been a bunch of laws that have changed across States I think Colorado is maybe the most well-known where companies have to depending on the state um disclose certain aspects of a job related to pay right so it might be a range that a specific job requires um also things like even if you're in a job you can request your band and you know why you're paid a certain amount and how you compare it to others across the company um and so that's changing it's still changing it's like very much in flux I think there's at least a dozen states that now um require you to share those pay ranges for example but this one girl Hannah Williams she's 26 um so super young quit her job um she's making like 115 000 a year and then in the last year has just been doing the kind of man or in this case woman on the street and all she does is she goes up and she just asks people hey what do you do how much do you make um but her social accounts have blown up so she has over a million followers on Tick Tock again in a year um 450 000 on in Instagram and she's on other channels as well and so an article was written about her in January and she had already made six hundred thousand dollars since her switch and so I'm sure she's made way more now with the accounts being the size they are um but this is one of the the cases we've talked about this before when there's like regulation change there's like a rule change a Line in the Sand is drawn and then that has implications and this one's so far-ranging right because it impacts any job Within These given States so if you go to her profile she's doing a really good job so you go to her profile and Tick Tock and you click that link that says Stan so check this out so here's how she's making money so the top link is an indeed link where it says get a job as a nurse and so she's getting an affiliate thing then she has a market research guide which is learn how you should do learn how much you should be making and I guess that's so she can collect emails but then click attend and uh attend LA and NYC workshops so she partnered with Capital One to do local of like seminars at their Banks like because some of their banks have cafes and then she also has I think I believe it's a subscription database where you can see individual salary data packed with contextual information this one is awesome this is how you do it also Sean this is how you doing Sam uh invested in Stan so good good use of Stan here for the uh putting a link in the bio that lets you let you make a bunch of money um yeah this is cool we've uh we've talked about levels that FYI on the Pod before which was a similar concept which is like crowdsourcing salary info so you can if you're an engineer at Facebook you can go find out am I getting paid what other L4 engineers get paid or should I be working at Google and what would I get paid if I was over there um I think they're they're doing an awesome job of this when we had mentioned this on the Pod somebody did this for doctors they were like uh we I think we had said you should somebody should do this for nurses and doctors and then they they were like Hey we're Med students and so they went and did this for doctors and created a database I think they got acquired by levels uh actually after after hearing it on the Pod uh and then taking action on it so definitely think that there's opportunity here and I like uh Sam what do you call it regulatory inflections uh breakage Reflections inflections is the I word the inflections which is anytime there's like a law change there's well there's like multiple inflections so there's like a tech inflection which is like uber exists because everyone now has an iPhone or and you have GPS in your phone then there's like um cultural inflections which is like teens feel comfortable filming themselves uh and then there's regulatory inflections which is uh this drug is now legal or this patent is about to expire or you now in Colorado have to disclose your salary ban therefore opens up new opportunities so this is there's another one you have here that I was gonna say the so you guys have talked about hearing aids on the Pod before so as of October the FDA relaxed their rule which basically meant hearing aids could be sold over the counter which is [ __ ] that they're not sold over the counter it's [ __ ] [ __ ] like it's been bothering me so much that and glucose monitors I'm amazed that they're not sold over the counter I've been trying to get a hearing aid and they make me go to all these appointments and I miss them really yes another fun fact around hearing aids which I feel like is interrelated to the fact that they can I is it now or already that they can be sold over the counter is it this coming up no they can okay so they already can but um apparently 99 of hearing aids um or custom hearing aids uh are 3D printed already and so there's a few companies that basically own this Market currently but the reason I love this is because 3D printing is the epitome of like Tech hype cycle started in the 80s then got way over hyped wasn't ready everyone thought it was dead but it's like come back in these really Niche places like hearing aids we talk to people on Trends a while ago that were using 3D printing for like dental implants things like that and so I feel like it's it's something that actually is like overlooked because people were like oh 3D printing is dead wait what do you Sean you said yep as if you know you know people doing this for teeth yeah one of my best friends uh one of my best friends from college he's a he's a surgeon and he's a ENT surgeon so ear nose throat and what he um I was like well he was in med school so this is like over the past like you know eight years or whatever he's been the guys has been in school forever and uh I was like how's it going he's like oh you know it's fine but like I'm having a the most fun because now I run Duke's 3D printing uh facility I'm like 3D printing like just like for engineering like you're making toys what are you doing he's like no like the medical 3D printing and I was like wait I thought Med I thought 3D printing is like not even a thing for normal [ __ ] you guys are already using it in medicine he's like dude I I surgically implanted part of a skull that I 3D printed the other day like uh you know we take your jaw shape and then we're able to like create like the perfect shape that we needed for uh this implant this uh this the surgical process and I was like wow I had no idea and they're doing this with like basically it's interesting some technologies take forever to get into medicine because it's like the high stakes spot and for some medicine is the only justification for putting in the time and the money that it takes to get the technology to work and I think that's kind of where where um uh 3D printing has gone where it's like it started as like this hobbyist thing but then the real commercialization so far has happened on the the medical side I think the same thing's happening kind of in VR people are trying to do the hobby thing for a long time but one of the better more commercial use cases of VR is you know doctor training flight uh you know pilot training um things like you know you know imagining instruction yeah exactly anything where you need to sort of visualize and and uh plan something it's worth the money to develop a really high quality VR simulation because it's cheaper than doing a real a real uh prototype of it I got friends in hospitals as they say well you're Indian of course of course you do you're the odd man now but you know you're you're chilling web three for years turns out you're a practical guy as well we put the blockchain in your brain baby um yeah do the uh do this well I also for this hearing aid thing I met these guys that were doing seven million a month in sales on their hearing aid brand that I had never heard of and I was like oh huh maybe uh this makes a lot of sense actually like DDC hearing aids I think that's actually gonna be a big deal um was it bootstrapped they I don't know if they're fully boots yet but like yeah they're not like Venture act it's like but they made bootstrapped and then like their uncle gave him some money to keep scaling it that's that same like that sort of vibe and they were profitable I mean I'm just turning you on yeah they were yeah are they Mormon oh my God how far how far away from the coast did they live inland [Music] have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better we have two things Sean you want to go yeah I gotta come clean I have a um like a very late disclaimer I have to give so a few episodes ago maybe like four or five episodes ago we had talked about a business idea that was like a children's play Space basically you go there and you like yeah it's just a place to play you pay pay membership fee and you go play with all these cool toys inside anyways I was like oh it turns out like interesting business it's a franchise thing blah blah blah anyways you you just went there you didn't know anything about I didn't even go there Ben went there but a business partner went there and he was telling me about it and he's like yeah like you know I was talking to the guy and here's their occupancy here's their if that's true then here's what they would be making well I went and looked at the website and uh before and after and basically meetings like bookings to like inquire about a franchise got booked out for like four and a half months after the Pod and I just want to say I have no idea if this is a good business or not that was a estimate that was a single experience it was hey this that's kind of cool huh that could make money I do not endorse this I don't know if it's good or bad I can't say either way and I really hope that a bunch of people didn't go buy franchises of this thing thinking that uh that I was vouching for this so I just had to say that because I saw all those meetings get booked and I got a little nervous I was like oh wait this is not a uh I can't co-sign this I can't vouch for this either direction and I just needed to say that up front so please don't uh mortgage the house and go buy a franchise of this thing did they reach out to you no they didn't no I don't think they knew well I don't think they knew what happened that MFM effect well and the second thing is so we have like these sources wherever like I'm about to talk about something health related or like I don't know in your case in that example the franchise related or real estate related we have like three or four buddies who will like text and be like hey we're thinking about talking about this what's your opinion on X Y and Z and they'll kind of give us some insight uh one of those guys his name's Adam Bornstein I met Adam because he was like he basically ran a lot of Tim ferriss's stuff and one time he had this conference called 212 he invited me to go and they would rent out like the Four Seasons and one time I checked into my room and it was so big I called down to the front desk and I was like hey who do I share this room with is that it was a 4 000 square foot Four Seasons Penthouse the presidential suite that had like a 16-person dining table a movie theater and that's how I met Adam and he invited me to come to his event and so I've always asked him for health stuff well he just had a book come out it's called you can't screw this up I'm trying to think of the best way to summarize it but it's basically so I have this thing written down it's basically Ryan holiday James Clear Tim Ferriss like that style of writing and like that like I don't know simple hacks but that's kind of a bad word but I don't mean it that way but like these simple hacks on how you can create healthier diet habits so the book is called you can't screw this up he also worked with Arnold Schwarzenegger and that's who got uh he got to write the forward so I just want to give a shout to Adam he's a friend of the pie so I want to give him a shout out but let's do this jobs of the future I think this is a good one yeah and I also love that you're branding this steps list well done wait a waiter if I had to I love Sarah's list um but yeah this all comes from I guess two things one people think AI is taking all of our jobs I personally don't fully agree with that we don't need to dive into that well what's the effect what's the official stance at a16z right now is there like uh money do they just like is there like a poster where it said like web3 is Future and they just like put an X over it they just wrote Ai No comments no comments but what I'll say is we even on this pod have talked about different jobs um that don't quite exist or maybe are starting to exist I've talked about Chief automation officers Sean you've talked about this idea of like a mental Fitness coach um and I guess this idea of Steph's list is partially I want to share a few ideas today but I also want to hear from the listeners like what are the jobs that you think are as you know some people might say a little more anti-fragile but also that again like don't quite exist yet or early the types of things we would have talked about start with the stat you have here because I think the stat actually makes it clear that these aren't just like like oh cute things on The Fringe it's like no this is the future yeah so um of employment growth in the last 80 years so AKA between 1940 and today 85 of employment growth came from jobs that did not exist in 1940. did they not exist because like AI didn't exist or did they not exist because it's by newcom new businesses like new businesses the job title didn't exist is what you're saying yep so even you know simple examples of this that I think anyone can recognize from even the last few decades before 2008 2009 the idea of a social media manager did not exist the idea of a ux designer did not exist and those are jobs that truly like what tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people now do these jobs and so there's going to be versions of this I think it's a little more brainwracking to figure out in the age of AI because you can almost ask like oh well is this going to disappear in three years instead of 30 um but I think actually there's maybe like Frameworks to think about this so for example I think drones are kind of hitting that we talked about 3D printing hitting that stage where a lot of consumers own drones but a lot of companies are also starting to use drones and so like what within that that industry could exist it could be like drone technicians there's a lot of drones people are going to need to fix those drones is there like drone traffic control there's aircraft traffic control so why wouldn't therapy right safety inspector charging installation exactly on your radar for like well let's start with the ones you ones you talked about before so you said it quickly but I think it's worth repeating because you were on I don't know a year ago when you said it so Chief automation officer when you said that at that time this was kind of like definitely pre-ai being like the thing that everybody's talking about um what does a chief automation officer do and why did you think that was a cool job uh like a job of the future yeah so I mean a lot of companies will have a CTO the CTO typically though is so wrapped up on like what's our infrastructure is you know cyber security what's our our um how are we tackling that and how are we keeping our you know our company safe our data safe what they often aren't focused on and maybe some people would argue this is the role of the CEO but is how do I actually take the technology that exists today like AI um and enable every single person within my company to understand how to up level their jobs right so like to become 3x more productive because most of those people unfortunately either aren't plugged into the technology don't have the like excitement to actually implement it within their job or honestly it's just one of those like you don't know what you don't know okay Steph can I give you let me give you a compliment I remember that pod that we did we talked about that at Hampton the first Tire we made was an automation expert really the very first hire his name's Grant all he does is automate stuff so he's basically a zapier plus air table expert yeah and because one of our values early on was we want to grow to be big but we don't want to have to hire loads of people so let's right away start automating stuff and it was because of that conversation so the very first hire we made was an automation expert that's awesome and you know what it is [ __ ] awesome it is awesome the bottleneck is not typically like you have to create new things it's that they're basically you're bridging a gap usually a duct tape a ton there's a process we're doing that's kind of tedious manual repetitive or uh low value ad but needs to be done and then there's tools that could do that if you knew they existed and you knew how to pipe them together and Stitch them together so that they actually work and what this person does and like I do this at our company almost by accident which is like 4 e-commerce companies like I just discovered yesterday there's somebody who just has to like spend hours a week just like Square cropping photos so that they look better in Shopify from what the photographer gives them and I was like wait you do this for how many pictures and they're like yeah it sucks and I was like you know there's this tool that will just bulk you bulk upload and it'll do that and then it'll put them it'll pipe it to you here in stock and you can see it you know we'll use a different tool to pipe it into slack and you'll see if there's one that's off because you could just kind of skim this with your eyes and and then you'll just be able to fix the one off that's not good but 98 of them will just be done well the first time automatically by this one tool and they're like oh [ __ ] that's like you know thank you that saves me a bunch of time and now I could go do things that are actually going to drive a little more growth versus just like some [ __ ] that had to be done and uh how many of those are there in every company there's a ton of those and and the problem yeah the problem is Sean is even let's say that hypothetically you only have 10 people even though you've been 10 people for three years just 10 people has created enough habit that even getting an automation persons in now it's gonna be like oh man where do I start so doing it with ten thousand people is like an impossible task that's why we were like let's get this right away let's do this right away yeah there should be like a ratio like for every 10 employees you have you have one Chief Autumn or not Chief automation officer but someone who knows how to automate you just pair them with teams and you they literally do use their interviews they sit down they say hey let me shadow you for a day let me just see what you do and then from there I bet anyone myself included who tries to automate what I can they would just pick up so many things of like why are you doing that at all so I think you should also have this for um team collaboration have you guys ever read this book five dysfunctions of a team Yeah by Patrick something I don't even know who's it's a great book honestly I love that book I think other people's like a narrative right other people I think don't really like it's kind of like Fiction it's a it's a business advice book but it's written as a fictional story which is cool because that's not usually how those are written it's basically describes like there's a company you know whatever Acme Inc and they go to this like team off site and they're trying to figure something out and then you have these like four personalities or five personalities or whatever and um and it shows the like different ways that a team can be dysfunctional and once I worked in a bigger like you know I've worked in kind of like two-person teams that's what I'm in now uh well I I think the takeaway of the or the what the you forgot the part where he says the point the reason the books called that is uh successful teams all look different but every dysfunctional company is the same and here's the five things that they all have exactly and you kind of identify them but it identifies it and the way the book's written is kind of cool I think it's a sort of like it's it's here's a situation they have two people who both have kind of like valid perspectives or one person doesn't realize that the thing that they're saying is causing the other people to feel a certain way and causing all these like second order effects um anyways it's a good book for like management I guess but what I the I guess my real takeaway is like I've been in a bunch of companies where they do these like it's like [ __ ] builds up and then they're like we need an executive coach we need a team off-site we need to like break down all this Scar Tissue that's being built and like dysfunction that's in the team and resentment that's in the team and what all these things are not allowing us to perform at our best I actually think that companies should embed this in the company so I think there should be somebody that floats around that's basically like the the chicken billions who's like the team psychologist or whatever it's sort of like that but instead of one-on-one what's her name therapy I love that lady yeah I stopped watching the show after season one so I I forgot but uh she's awesome she's Wendy Rhodes yeah so basically instead of that it's somebody that just sits in meetings and takes notes and every week they just deliver like Sam do you know that you do this and you say this and that that's making these did you notice that that makes these people feel this way and it and when they walk out of the room you know they're not going to go do the thing you want in the way you want because of the way you said it or this person just didn't have that information and they were put on the spot maybe you should put in a process that gets the information and a dashboard that everybody sees beforehand or whatever right like somebody that identifies dysfunction because let's say for every 10 people you hire if you can make that team 10 more efficient you've basically created one extra employee without that payroll and so I think that the numbers would the ROI would be there if you had this but I'm surprised this doesn't exist so I think that's a kind of a job in the of the future is basically like a collaboration expert so somebody that like is like a internal um you know Compass team Compass to figure out like you know how uh where are they like that word Doula you got to use that word Doula here yeah I guess I'll just keep you as a doula as a guy uh and pissing everybody off Sam what do you think any jobs that stand out to you what are you guys hiring for um I don't [ __ ] know uh but nothing that like uh some of the ones that are like [ __ ] that you see out there and then I see their titles and I'm like oh you don't you're not actually good at that is community manager it's like Community manager is like a title that I actually don't think most people know how to make community so that's kind of like a nonsense one here's one from the podcast that we've talked about like uh we have like a podcast producer uh Ben Wilson right now and we have uh you know people will have like social media manager they have like all these different functions but what I told the team was like I think we just need like a band manager it's basically like yeah if podcasts are as they get more successful they're kind of like a band you have the talent they're the face they get on stage they perform and there's all the [ __ ] that that needs to be done like whether it's like we're going on tour we want to sell merch we wanna um like develop this cult following of fans that just love us because we just do dope [ __ ] that like is fan service fan love then you have the recording stuff that's got to get done and you kind of just need somebody who's like a hybrid of a business manager or an agent as well as like somebody who's kind of got the community building skills of a community manager and that's what a band manager is for bands and I think that you're going to see this more for uh for podcasts and YouTubers is like uh it is a role that's sort of like the the band management like the milk boys and whatever they have that it's like but most others don't have it underneath them yeah for sure what are the what are the what's the what are the lists that you have here head remote and then cyber actuary what are those so head over much dysfunction at companies especially the ones that transition from being non-remote to remote totally just copy and pasted a bunch of things from the office and they don't actually know how to build a remote organization from the ground up how to do things asynchronously and so it's kind of crazy when you think about how macro a shift that is for like you know thousands of people to be doing things all one way switching to a totally new way and to have no like expertise from someone to actually guide that um so that's the idea of how to remote and some companies already have this like a remote work officer or rwo what would they do it's like well people like I know in our company it's like well first they have to it's kind of like I.T there's like well they need to have like a good home setup Sam you've talked about this like we need to not look like dog [ __ ] on camera with whether internally or with our clients and our customers so like how do we make sure everybody's got like a good zoom setup okay secondly like how do we create some best practices around remote working and and how to like you know do stuff that's different now that we're not all in the office I could just like look each other and talk to each other real quick and uh how do we set boundaries for different time zones how do we plan meeting you know like all of that I think is is definitely in occasion-based Pay I mean isn't this crazy like to your um idea with Hampton Sam of the nice background the same companies that had these really strict clothing rules like you have to show up in a suit and you have to look this way or letting people sit with their MacBook under their chin with like a dirty ass background behind them showing up to their business meetings trying to win a client and it's like where's your digital suit you don't like right they don't care they don't even think about about that because it's so outside of their field of view but that's just one example and I think do you guys do that at a16c because like when I imagine a16 they're like that's a khaki pants that's a khaki pants type of place well I don't think we have a clothing code but we do have like Lululemon's ABC pants is like the official pants of men here's something that a16z does do whenever like put together as related to this but like their design team will create every quarter of these beautiful Zoom backgrounds that the company uses and they actually look good you know I feel like a lot of Zoom backgrounds are like the company's logo kind of awkwardly like photoshopped in the background and it's just like around the corner um and they again they refresh them every quarter everyone has access to them so there's at least that visual consistency um but I don't know if we have a clothing code but I hope some of your bosses and employees listen to this and I just want them to hear me say this it is me and Sean making fun of you guys not stuff like a threat there that was awesome you're like it's like on TV with like put the camera on me put the camera play on me and you look down the barrel and you deliver some like wrestling promo that's what I thought you were about to do but you were trying to cover Sam's version is like look at me and he's like you're great No One Believes In you more than me I I had a friend that lived in China and I used to like text him all the time and I'd be like dude your government sucks what's going on with that and that I would reply with by the way whoever's reading this it is me saying this not him [Laughter] don't disappear my friend uh invest in the cool Zoom backgrounds and stuff you know they got the uh I think what like 700 million in management fees those management fees got to go somewhere so I'm glad they're putting them to good use yeah um but I mean just to summarize on the head of remote thing think about I think maybe the easiest way to think about it is there's all these macro Tech Trends right like remote work AI automation cyber security right like the idea of like a chief security officer didn't exist like 10 years ago right because that just became such an important um I guess concept within especially Tech firms so and what's this food engineer one well I wanted to ask you guys about this because yeah we never talked about this Hannah do you guys remember that yeah I know concept of like a food engineer will exist I think this one's a little further out so give this story Sean yeah so uh a lot of people know David Friedberg now because he's on the all in pod so he kind of got a lot more more popular or famous but uh this awesome guy I used to work at Google created this thing called the production board which is his like kind of incubator startup Studio whatever and they build things that are kind of like hard tech so it's like uh things that interface with the real world they have like Hardware they're making food or making you know biological you know substances or whatever like they're creating real world things and uh he had this company called Canna that he created that was basically like the coke freestyle machine in your kitchen so you would have this device this Nespresso machine that sits on your countertop that can make like a thousand different drinks exactly to your specification using basically like the equivalent of a printer cartridge so it's like you put in this cartridge that's got all these like micro flavors and then you hook it up to your water supply and it's like it just takes water it makes it cold hot or bubbly and then it pipes in the exact dose of flavor to create whatever drink you wanted you want tea here you can make hot tea you want uh sparkling water that's like flavored like you know Blackberry boom done and so it was this awesome idea because it will also be good for the sort of like the world in a way because a lot of the supply chain is basically spent bottleing water or soda putting it in cans putting it on shelves putting a cardboard around it transporting it to the store transporting it to your house then transferring the the trash to the dump I was like dude what if we just took the water spot everybody already has to their home and we let you make whatever drink you want very cool idea um and then out of nowhere just suddenly got canceled and they were like yeah unfortunately to scale up we needed a lot of money and uh you know in this funding environment we couldn't do it that's a [ __ ] excuse who can't raise I mean I mean they've got like the top Tech podcast yeah in the world um yeah they also maybe an interesting way of framing that idea was also it was it came from the idea that they had done research and they had realized that basically every drink out there whether it was tea whether it was wine whether it was beer 95 water like not just 95 water but even the chemicals that go into it I don't remember the number but it was something like there's only three like 30 or so flavors that you need to basically generate every taste um but yeah I don't know maybe something yeah we should get him on our tweet at him I want to know what really like not what really happened like there's a scandal but like tell me more because clearly he could sneeze and raise 30 million dollars for an idea so like I'm surprised if it wasn't like it must have been that sneeze his sneeze will be lovely flavored too I mean I I feel like he must not have believed meaning like the team must have realized it's not feasible or something like that or they must have proven that the thing is not feasible or non-economic in some way for them to not be able to raise money because just on the concept I feel like they could have raised more money um so so I think you know that's uh that's an interesting one what went wrong but he said that he was going to send us one and then like his assistant or someone at the company was talking to us and they just quit no not said this one they were like we want you guys basically their idea was like if you could make any drink flavor on the spot okay then what happens to drink Brands and his idea was like drink Brands become software so they just become Brands yeah yeah we would create a drink flavor you know uh Sam's you know uh you know Almighty root beer or whatever and it would just be like a specific dosage of flavors and that somebody could just buy it for a dollar on their own Canna machine and it would just like dispense the drink and we would make money for every one of those like flavors sold basically every one of those drinks sold um that was the the kind of the concept so they wanted us to make one and they were like come down to our facilities we never got around to doing it and now it's gone did you guys see the freestyle machine for condiments yes I did see this dude sign me oh yeah sign me up dude this stuff is it's have you been to like Hot Pot in Asia where they have the sauce bars no tell us that as well if you go to Hot Pot in Taiwan like they're literally there will be hot pot's like a like a style of food or like a yeah yeah it's like so basically you get a big pot of hot water um they give you broth of a certain sort and then you basically go shopping on this wall and you you pick oh I want some like some noodles I want some like beef whatever and you pick it out and then you basically cook your own soup but as part of that they have rice and other things and they have they typically have this huge sauce bar of like maybe like 20 to 30 different things like like garlic or Ginger soy sauce like ponzu sauce whatever and you make your own sauce and so when I saw this coming I was like this is genius because like this is exists in Asia but only in these like hot pot occasions right yeah I I kind of love this I really do want the future of food to be a lot more interesting I think I think it's going to be you have so in your jobs thing you got food engineer I got that one um cyber actuary what does that one mean did you ever explained that one Yeah so basically I mean a lot of people even if we relate this back to AI are worried that like you know there's just going to be a lot more cyber quote-unquote crime right people like replicating your voice like getting your bank details and I think this idea of being a cyber actuary is basically actuaries assess risk for anything right um how risky is it for us to deploy you know this celebrity's voice in this way how risky is it for us to um I don't know like open source our new llm like there's going to be all these implications of things um I guess be becoming a lot more online if they aren't already and so this idea of a cyber actuary is like there's already a ton of actuaries that figure out how much Insurance should cost in you know the typical world like if you buy flight and I think there's just like this huge white space around um risk that people have not calculated yet did I tell you guys about Eden data no yeah so I met him because he's joined Hampton his name's Taylor and he I don't know if he was playing up to my ego stuff but he told me he created this because of an article that one of us wrote on Trends I I don't know if that's true or not but he launched this thing called Eden data and uh in just two years it's now doing like six or seven million dollars in revenue and basically what they do is if you are a smallish startup so like 50 to 100 people you have to have a certain type of compliance in order to sell software to Enterprise companies and so the service that he provides is and this is like an oversimplification but there's basically like a 50 to 100 Point checklist of all the things that you need to do and a lot of these startups that can't afford a full-time Chief security officer and so instead they pay Eden data eight to or seven or eight or ten thousand dollars a month and he's got a team of outsourced people overseas who goes through your website and goes through your entire like the checklist and make sure that all 50 or 100 things are done and they have like templates to do it and then they stay on top of it and they monitor it in case any changes have to happen so now you when you go and Pitch like this Enterprise company to sell your software and even though you're a small startup you've already done all the stuff that needs to get done and and I think it's I think it's only two years in I think he's gonna do eight million in Revenue this year um and it's like a service that's it's subscriptions it's like a subscription consultancy almost and he's killing it it's a crazy company with huge marches damn yeah when I see companies like this I think like I'm in the room you're talking to somebody that was doing this so I wanted to do this for rich people it was like just overall security audit for rich people and uh like everything like your house security your bank accounts security or crypto security like just somebody who's gonna come in and try to uh like just poke holes in your stuff and at a certain dollar amount of net worth like it definitely makes sense and you're not the expert and you have more to lose than you have you know than the cost of the service like you have a lot more to lose like asymmetric downside basically and uh I think that I've reached out to tons of people I've reached out to tons of people doing it and the problem that I saw is that a lot of them for some like they're all like ex-military guys too uh and so like I remember I was talking to pop I was like pop uh after the show I was like what do you do for security like can you walk me through it he goes oh I got this guy named Chad we do this this and this and then I talked to Chad and it's a little bit mom and pop yeah it's not like just like I can just log in and you can just tell me what to do or it can just get done you know there's no like plaid or whatever that other software where you like you just log in with your bank accounts and it just does what you need to do it was very much a manual process and it was like 15 grand and like this person's gonna do this and so I do actually agree with you I think there's a star I do think this is like a um fragmented that's it's a fragmented service and I think that one great company can can do all this all the stuff you need to do let's hit some of these other random Trends you have um uh don't mention the one I wrote don't mention because I got something in that space so don't mention that one but uh do uh do some of these other ones let's start with a mouth tape yeah so mouth tape I first heard about this like six months ago because some guy on Twitter was like I taped my mouth shut every night for the last six months the best thing I've ever done the hot dude the hostage deep guy will not stop so aggressive with it uh we have this guy who's got a company he called hostage tape and it's just tape for your mouth and he told me he's gonna launch it and I'm like this is dumb and then six months later he's like five hundred thousand dollars in sales yeah I'm like great and then he's like a year later two million dollars in sales and he's like just rubbing it into my face I don't think he's an official sponsor but Andrew huberman has been talking about it and we uh in my household we like to call him father Drew as a joke but if father Drew promotes something and then age yeah he's like people will buy it bro Oprah in a way in a way like if he says uh Bro Science Oprah if he says it's good he's gonna you're just gonna get a huge Spike yeah so that's I mean these are just like I don't know where this goes I don't know what opportunity there is other than going and selling some mouth tape maybe rebranding it but that's one Trend this guy's company is called hostage tape and like I saw I was like oh this is the worst this is the worst thing ever like this is awful what do you do but he's privy that was your uh weight loss idea remember wasn't it called hostage yeah SF right kidnap you and just don't feed you for four weeks um you should partner yeah this guy's crazy so whatever kudos to him yeah but um I guess we didn't even mention do you guys understand what's good about mouth tape like what it makes you breathe through your nose and breathing through your nose is better for you than uh breathing through your mouth so Public Health haven't you been talking about this being forever for the last year I just I went into a I don't know all the American Grocers the high protein Bean yeah so it's got dude you've been talking about this to me forever you keep telling me about this Bean I've been out with you a bunch of times is that more protein than chickpeas two percent or two times more fiber than edamame 80 fewer calories than almonds 60 fewer carbs than pistachios 35 grams per serving obviously they cherry pick this data and compared to like the the best option um for them but these beans I think they're like originally from Italy or they're popular there um but I just have seen this over and over and over as someone who traveled a lot where like edamame edamame was not popular in North America 20 30 years ago like no one knew what it was right it came from Asia and so now when you go to restaurants it's like a very very short how would you like to invest in The Next Step Sam do you remember when Bobby at hustlecon um would go around pitching people to joke and he's like his picture no I thought it was hot dog water it was tuna water dude the uh have you guys had chickpea pasta of course I don't like it it makes you fart like crazy man it makes you it just it'll give you the number three seven forty percent of many calories as almonds but 70 more gas it's like that's the Lupine uh you know pitch um okay so you've been calling this for a little while I see I mean this seems like a good like d2c product idea to be honest um there's like one company doing it um this one or whatever yeah brahmi they also do I think the chickpea pasta um but I just think maybe there's something in the supply chain or like how hard it is to you know procure this stuff but to me they're they're pretty cheap they taste really good you eat them plain will they at least this company will do flavored versions so they'll do like rosemary garlic or does it give you gas I don't think so I didn't do an A B test so you're gonna well you can admit I don't think they did it's a safe space it seems like you can say it Sam farts every episode okay all right I'm gonna buy something I like this idea yeah I'm gonna try these out and see uh see how I feel about it um by the way this is the type of product that when we say on MFM there's going to be 13 people that start this for six weeks and then yeah nobody six months later we'll be doing it for whatever reason it's like and the same people that tell us they're gonna come back in eight weeks and they're gonna say actually what do you think about this idea yeah yeah yeah it's like if my DM history has four different ideas from you that you were pitching me for investment like it's probably not going to work out it's a no forever exactly you've got the forever forever no oh yeah I'm still on that line This is a no forever let's do can we do one more around these Advent calendars because I feel like that's another case where like I've I don't know someone in the community is going to jump on Sean do you even know what admin though is this some like Catholic [ __ ] what is this oh yeah this is this is as Catholic as as Catholicism is advent advance in December so uh so we Catholics I'm Catholic are you Catholic stuff no oh heathens sorry the camera oh yeah you're not one of us but it's okay uh the we have lent which is like 40 days and that was when like Jesus like walked around in the desert you're not supposed to eat meat and [ __ ] like that and then we have Advent which is the 30 days leading up to Christmas and oftentimes there's an advent calendar where it tells a story about like what Mary and Joseph Jesus's parents like what they did like with the donkey and the mule and how they got like all these gifts from people whatever it tells that story and each day you open up the calendar it's like the kids favorite thing there's a piece of chocolate in the calendar yeah I'm sure you've seen the Advent calendars like at some point it was a religious thing then capitalism got involved and then you know every day kids are opening a little chocolate I swear myself I thought the Advent calendar was those little calendars that are like you peel it and there's like you peel the calendar for each day oh yeah yeah I've been walking around because that's what an advent calendars with it for for a long a long time my whole life I would say this one you like peel back it's always chocolate inside that's the idea usually that's when you get it like Target or whatever and yeah it's like a couple dollars but it's like the most simple you know you you buy it for your kids so what's your idea here Seth the better Advent calendar five minutes yeah no so this comes from I Gotta Give this guy namazaki Paul um he doesn't sound like a Catholic no no no no so this is it I don't think this has to do with religion but I actually got this for cal um this past year because here's the thing Advent calendars yeah I guess it was tied to religion but they happen around the holidays and so people are scrambling to figure out last minute like what should I get my family as a gift that's kind of thoughtful but fun and a lot of people get Advent calendars but they get these like shitty versions that are like you know expired milk chocolate from the year before what Paul did is he created this socket calendar and so if you click um that's the best way to celebrate Jesus's birth too yeah we're basically every day for the month of December or you can use it after you open your little Advent calendar but it's not little it's like it's like the size of a printer kind of thing um and you get this like special sake that he has hand-picked from Japan this is partially like his job his existing business um and he sells them for 300 bucks and every year he sells 500 of them which he caps and you do the math that's like 150 000 just from that one one drop for him and he doesn't get that much traffic like if you look at his existing site it's like 2 000 visits per month so not something he would typically be able to make much money from um but that's one example that just got me thinking especially since we're like What six months ahead of Christmas what Advent calendars is the my first million Community what are you gonna make that is way cooler than the expired milk chocolate I mean I've seen some stuff like hot sauce calendars Lego calendars um but it's got to be something that like someone can open either for 12 days because some people do the 12 Days of Christmas or all of December I this is actually cool yeah I actually think this is a this is really this is really cute and cool and awesome um you have a picture of this person who has a binder full of condiments like individual packets and I see your vision here and this is actually cool I see I smell what you're stepping in and I think it's awesome well this so the Tweet you're talking about Sam what is that phrase is this girl Nicole Nicole who says her tweet just says organize my sauces and it's like do you guys remember you know if you collected uh like playing cards back in the day or um coins they had those binders yeah with the little I don't even know what they're called but this tweet got 468 000 likes um I think it's probably one of the most popular tweets of all time and it's just her organizing her sauces from around the world so these are not for use this is just like collections that one is for a collection I feel like the Advent calendar it would be for use yeah wow this is crazy what I like about you Steph is like you find things that I would just scroll by but you're pretty good at finding interesting things and applying them like connecting to like five other things yeah when I scroll past something and I think this is stupid you write that thing down and make it sound smart it's amazing I waste my time curating an Evernote that it's just full of random internet [ __ ] but but what you do something that's different is you actually remember it so I like bookmark so much stuff and then I just like forget all about it you actually remember it and then you like it's just the difference between like good and great in terms of like whatever the skill set is that we have you like actually are organized that the you know what makes someone good versus great is like being organized you are very very very organized with this stuff and that actually helps your like thought process I would think when are you um dude when are you just gonna bail and start creating some of this stuff like you yarded this train S I was working at a company here at that company said and I must have been what 24 or something 20 yeah around that I was like next this is the last job I all have right like after this I'll go and do my own thing but then ever since then I just get keep getting offered really cool stuff that I was like oh I get to more money well I get to be paid to like go research Trends and go down these internet rabbits acquired now I'm at HubSpot and I get to build this like cool Creator program okay great and more money now I'm at a16z I got to get to I got to be this interesting person with more money in my pocket it was amazing yeah you're learning this receptionist sitting there she's like how could I get the things that are in their bank account to my bank account she's three years old and she says this thing where she goes this is my best day ever like and I'm like she might actually be telling the truth this might have been like the best day ever like this is the one and that's how I feel stuff is whenever she gets uh a raise at accz this is my Best Day Ever guys Steph you and I were talking about like how much money like you've had like you're like we were going through an exercise of like at 20 we had this at 23. you've had a nice run you've had a very nice run a very very nice run compared to where I came from so yeah like you were saying earlier Sean if like 21 year old me would have said yeah like this is where you'll be this is how much you'll make these are like the opportunities you'll have yeah it's pretty wild are you even 30 no oh my God what would uh what would 200 year old you say like what would the reaction be well it's funny because I would I feel like I still have like throughout my whole life because I didn't grow up very wealthy a very like money orientation not that I need that much but just like oh my gosh like you have that much money like go buy a car like go buy nice clothes go you know go like use the money that you've always wanted but never had but it's funny because now that I have more money I'm still like just as cheap as I ever was so I don't know if that stuff ever leaves you Sean did you know that Steph's uh half Ty are you Ty my mom's from Taiwan yeah do you know that no I didn't know that there it was supposed to be super special or what why are you telling me this at our old company when someone found that out and I was like yeah I mean I I could see that there was like people like Steph why are you lying to us you're Canadian I've had some well Canadians not I know that was the joke they're like quit lying yeah why are you lying about being Taiwanese Jordan was like there so there's a huge Spectrum I don't know why like what it is about the way I look but some people when they hear that I'm half asian are like oh yeah of course like I knew that and then other people are truly shocked um Jordan was one of those and he went to Sam or no he asked me and he was like does Sam know this [Laughter] the way you look uh it's just like what is their level of exposure to different races versus anything to do with you um yeah yeah by the way this uh you're this think about being cheap I read uh I was reading the story yesterday about this guy who um made a bunch of money and uh they're like what was your first purchase he goes I hired a consultant to help me spend money and he goes uh you know I had learned over 25 years how to make money it took me a long time to learn how to make money and I was just very honest with myself that I have no idea how to spend money and uh I could shorten that learning curve if I get a coach to help me spend money what was this coach called a wife ah I'll be here on you gotta learn to spend it's like it takes reps what was the coach actually called I I mean I don't know it's just like I don't know his actual job title but you know a spending consultant let's call it I have no idea but what do they like teach you how to do I think it's I don't know I mean he didn't go into details on exactly what the guy said but let's just pretend for a minute that he did I would imagine he does two things one is um figures out where your psychology is screwed up about money because everybody's got like this it's like you know people like body dysmorphia I think everybody has bank account dysmorphia too like uh you know you think you need more money than you need you even when you have money you still act like you don't have money and like you it's like all this like weird stuff it's like dude you're fit now why do you still think you're fat like you know you have to sort of like retrain yourself to see something different in the mirror I think that's part of it like just just talking to figure out what are the ways your your brain is a little screwed up about money let's identify that first some people spend too much some people don't spend at all and then I think the second thing would be like all right what do you really want so uh let's try to outline your like dream lifestyle or your you know the things you you really want identify those and then let's calculate like okay how much those costs could you afford those now could you afford a step in that direction and like giving you the encouragement to pull the trigger on the things that you actually want or setting certain rules like you have to spend this much per month what are you going to spend it on and like also on the protect your downside so it's like hey we're going to set aside this amount of money so that you're like safety reflex is satisfied like we agree that logic biologic this amount of money being here untouched means you're safe okay cool so now we can talk about this other spending part without triggering your like fight or flight mode around your fear of financial safety yeah I want to look this up I need one of these things uh yeah you should look it up I don't know I don't know if this exists maybe it's a job of the future I don't know if uh is roommates early podcast episodes would Escape millionaires who are fretting about eight dollar blueberries at Whole Foods or like I remember one episode where this guy was like I think I had at least 10 million dollars and was picking up like a stroller on the side of the road um things like that where it's like clearly like yeah you haven't upgraded your thinking or your mindset to where you are dude I just made 400 selling used gym equipment from uh from like from some stuff I'm not using and I'm like this is my Best Day Ever 100 bucks yeah my best day ever like it's like I feel more happy about that 400 that I do making much larger sums yeah uh and the best part is that I paid 300 for it five years ago now I got 400 and it's like the best high I read this thing that was like um this guy timer who created he's got this company called causal and uh it's like this Excel competitor but here he has this blog post I really liked where he was like he was trying to figure out in a nerdy way how to decide if he should buy something or not and so he's like um he's like well I break everything down into kind of like I don't remember the the exact message but it was something like this it was like the frequency of like how frequently am I gonna get the benefit of this and then like what's the like magnitude of the benefit and so he's like something that's it doesn't have to be a big shift but if it's gonna happen all the time or like 10 times a day or something like that like you know like I bought a phone case that just feels better in my hand and it was like a great purchase because like the hand feel of my phone is something I'm I'm touching my phone all the time and just making that feel a little smoother a little better was like dude what what's that case called by the way I'm looking very good uh let me look at my hand feel so it's um do we know how much it costs yeah is it going to be free plug for you guys moaz I think is the name of it but it's got this like this is not like plastic feel so this feel right here is like uh it's almost like the feel of a basketball it's like a almost like a like a like a traction kind of like feel because I was like I hate the plastic feel of cases um like I think that feels cheap and uh and and I don't enjoy it I don't want the leather ones either so I was like what else is there and found that and so he he identifies like if you're gonna do it if it's gonna be frequent then the magnitude needs to be less if it's going to be infrequent then the magnitude of the joy it brings is going to need to be high and you can kind of multiply those two together to figure out like the value of that item and then you sort of say okay that's the value to me and then what's the price to me and you sort of use that to figure out you know where should you where should you spend versus not and what people mostly get wrong in that is they under count frequency so like a better pillow or something like that is great because you're going to sleep on it every single night versus a nice bad Louis Vuitton bag that's gonna sit in your closet like my wife's bought a Louis Vuitton bag and she literally never takes out she doesn't want to get messed up it's like wow that's the you know most expensive you know six thousand dollar thing that just sits in a closet for no reason um versus things that you get joy out of all the time and so I bet if you guys looked at like what's the best purchase you made or you're you're most satisfied with this year it's probably something that you interact with somewhat frequently or it was like a one-off life-changing experience that was just like crazy magnitude yeah what was that article called I want to I want to read uh I need some good money therapy in my life money therapists yeah yeah I need some good money yeah send me an article but Steph um appreciate you doing this you're always coming with fire your your Twitter you're a Twitter person still right that's better person's Seth Smith IO go listen to the a16c podcast we're doing some cool stuff there that's just what it's called a16z podcast right yes all right we appreciate you thank you [Music] thank you

and then we have another guy Larry Ellison billionaire guy you know 50 billion plus he started Oracle he says debt has never made any sense to me how can a person be there and just vanish and just not be there was he stoned [Music] dude I got a lot of stuff to talk about today do you yeah I'm excited to I'm excited about you know I want to say something um people have been a little bit spoiled by this podcast I gotta say like I said a little spoiled um people just expect that every single episode is gonna be a banger every single episode is just gonna just bring a little smile to your face put a little money in your pocket give you a little nugget of wisdom that you might be able to say to somebody throughout the day and they think you are you or that wise and I think people got a little spoiled and not every podcast is gonna be a banger not every podcast is going to deliver not every day is gonna be one of those days some days you just don't have it but today is not that day today we have it you have it too I just I just looked at the document I saw what you had on there I don't know what anything about these topics I'm excited to hear what you got let me bring up the first topic rich people and health and I'm talking like really rich people and the reason I was interested in this is Sam Altman all the rage right now Sam Altman you know uh helped run Y combinator and then now is the CEO of openai and he's in the news because he did this like thing in front of the Senate and he was very endearing he's he's incredibly likable not and and he's also very successful I read this article and it said something about two things that stood out it said something like he put all of his liquid net worth so he said in this article he goes I basically put 100 of my liquid net worth into two companies the first is helion energy he invested his own money 375 million dollars of his own money and the second business uh was called retro it's a health company he invested 180 million dollars so that kind of caught my eye and by the way remember we did a segment on Sam I don't know a couple months ago and it was because I had read this thing that Sam Altman led the round in helium with 300 something million dollars and I started texting people being like how much money does Sam have that he's investing 300 million into a single company uh is he does he have a fund does he secretly have a fund and some people are like no I he might have a fund I wouldn't be a surprise but I think this was I think this was personal right and it just didn't make sense and we did this whole Deep dive because that one number just sounded outrageous and now this is some new information that he's saying yeah I actually did put all my eggs in two baskets uh two two eggs in one basket in a recent article the quote is that or there's a quote from him admitting he goes I basically put all of my liquid net worth in this into that and so retro health kind of caught my eye and then in another article that just came out he said that uh he was talking about like his daily routine and he talked about his uh like he's obsessed with like everyone used to talk about how he was obsessed with the end of the world so he has like this property that has like gas masks and all this other [ __ ] whatever that's interesting but we've talked about that but then he also says that he's really obsessed with anti-aging and he goes it's mostly simple stuff I try to eat healthy I exercise I sleep enough and I take Foreman that caught my eye one of these does not belong yeah one of these is things my my mom advises me to do all of these are things my mom advised me to do except for one yes so the metformin they caught my eye and also that he put 300 million dollars of his own money he goes I take metformin and he goes I also hope to one day take retro Health's medicines which they haven't come out with yet have you have you heard of Metformin do you know what this is I've heard about this because um vitalik the guy from ethereum he was on someone's podcast and they they instead of asking about crypto at one point they were like let's talk about other stuff you're super into like oh longevity you're interested in health and he's like yeah I'm like kind of interested in it you know I've taken metformin and rap what's the other one called rap something rap rhaps yeah yeah like that that's another longevity drug I don't know much and he's like he's like I I don't think he said he takes it regularly he's like but I'm interested in that I'd like to I'd like to learn more about that so uh about a year ago I was telling you about semi-glue tied and I'm like this drug is interesting I think it's going to be popular and it got very popular I don't know say what you really said what did I say is a miracle drug you're like dude I'm injecting myself with this [ __ ] unbelievable I don't crave candy anymore yeah I'm losing so much weight this thing's crazy yeah you're right I tested it out I don't take it anymore but I'm I'm like a guinea pig I'll eject myself with anything to try it out and so I tried it out and so I got a little bit more interested in this and so everything I'm about to say I want to preference this that's saying I don't know [ __ ] I've listened to like a handful of Pop podcasts and read like some studies that's about that's the the education I have here but basically metformin is similar-ish to semi-glutide in that it was created in the 90s or was created before that but got FDA approved in the 90s and the whole stick behind it is that it helps uh insulin uh sensitivity which basically just means uh when you eat sugar or crave sugar or whatever your blood sugar spikes and if you're diabetic that's why this drug is important that's basically all I know but the reason why this is important for longevity is what people have found is that there is a huge correlation between your blood sugar spiking and how long you can live so basically when your blood sugar spikes like a huge amount as if you just ate tons of sugar and if that spikes a lot that's correlated with living less or not as long as it being like stable all the time so the reason why some of these I think they're called glps uh glucose like it basically limits like your glucose spiking is what these drugs do that's like the dumb Meathead version which is all I know of explaining it and the reason why these drugs are interesting is because they were given to diabetics and like oh hey your sugar uh blood sugar isn't spiking Oh weird a lot of these people are living like kind of a long time what the hell is going on and then that's when they're like man this drug actually might be good for making you live longer because it's correlated with keeping your blood sugar low which is also correlated with making you live for a little bit longer and so that's what this drug is and I started Googling it and all these like and they're there's definitely downsides but all these like biohackers and also like these really rich guys I'm talking like 500 million billion dollar folks it seems like a ton of them are taking this drug do you know anyone who's taking this personally I don't know anyone who's taking it but I don't um ask and I would bet that a good number of our friends I would say like I would bet that 20 of our friends who kind of fit this category of like they um they went into Chuck E cheese they got all the tickets and now they don't want to leave uh it's basically like really rich people who have won at life and now they only think about big picture things and they're trying not to die because uh they got they got it pretty good and so I would say it's it's probably very common in those circles and so like I first was interested in how like wealthy people care about health like years ago 10 years ago I read the biography of John Rockefeller and John Rockefeller uh you know was he probably died in 1930 or for 1940 so he basically in the book they're like he chooses his food super slow and he makes sure that it's like fully liquid before he swallows and like when he was like 80 years old he basically was like a vegetarian and if he wanted to eat a piece of chocolate he would like call his doctor and say hey is it okay if I have this and he was like anal about that and then I listened to Ben Wilson's how to take over the world with Tom Edison Thomas Edison and he did this it's some similar stuff and he was like I eat light and I try not I don't overeat I take a nap once a day like he like all these Health stuff so I started thinking like that's interesting so like wealthy people have always cared about it the difference between today's wealthy people and in 19 or 1880 is basically like we have a bit more science and so I've been obsessed with like what some of these wealthy people are doing and I want to read you a few quotes and tell you about a few interesting things that people are doing like incredibly wealthy people for example Peter Thiel he has the most Peter teal quote I've ever heard on death he says there there are these people who say that death is natural and it's just part of life and I think I think nothing further can be from the truth I he goes um I I believe that the acceptance of death is a psychological defense mechanism and I dismiss it as being weird and sociopathic and then he talks about like how like living forever will be bad for the economy he goes that's okay even if there are problems with that it's better than being dead and so he like talks about how he takes HGH human growth hormone and he's doing this other thing called parabiosis which I don't know exactly what that is but he's spending uh well and that's like where the the rumor of him being a blood boy so para biologist is like where you take younger people's blood and put it in your body to like right live long but that's all I know about it and then we have another guy Larry Ellison billionaire guy you know 50 billion plus I started Oracle he says death has never made any sense to me how can a person be there and just vanish and just not be there was he stoned it's like you know how like a baby is it takes them like six months to realize that like when you cover your eyes like you're you're like you cover like your own eyes it's like I'm here uh he's it's kind of like he's like Benjamin buttons for that like you know he's going in reverse I'm stunned by a game of peekaboo and then there's uh one more person that I thought was interesting that we've talked about Brian Johnson we've had him on the Pod he has this thing blueprint which we all know about but two interesting changes have come from that so the the background is Brian Johnson started Braintree which owns venmo and all this other stuff he sold it he's likely a billionaire and he does this thing called The Blueprint where he like is spending two or three million dollars a year and he like doesn't eat sugar he only eats plants he exercises in a certain way but he measures all of it like uh religiously and you could go on and see it well I found two things interesting with that that now that he's getting popular which I think you and I get like point five percent credit for him being popular we were we were early on that train which it gives me Pride but one uh one interesting thing is there's a subreddit now called like the blueprint and there's people mimicking what he's doing and I've been paying attention to the subreddit it only has like 3 000 people but the engagement is really really high and there's people testing it and when I read their posts I'm like I don't know entirely that if like being a vegan is good or not good for you but the way that you guys are describing this I'm all in you know what I mean like it's very intoxicating and whenever you see stuff and content like that it I you I can kind of feel like it's going to be popular and the second thing that's popped up is go to uh rejuvenationolympics.com so like okay what are the what are the Rejuvenation Olympics is it what it sounds like I mean how does this work so there's the leaderboard of which Brian Johnson is number one but there's thousands of people by the way the tagline is hilarious what is it so it says so Rejuvenation Olympics where you win by never crossing the Finish Line that's good that's amazing right that's good well done whoever that was nice one so the whole competition is to see is who can decrease their biological age compared to their chronological age so who can like and I don't understand how they make up like the the rules but it's hundreds of people and they're uploading like their pre-results and then they're like most recent results and and like I don't I think I don't know if there's a prize other than bragging and potentially not dying but it's really fascinating do you see that list it's cool looking right yeah so basically it'll be like Brian Johnson his chronological age 45 years old and then it's ranked on his improvement from the Baseline which I'm not sure exactly what that means but I'm guessing it's basically what his his chronological age versus biological age and What's the diff is it kind of my my guess What's the diff yeah yeah get it to death but anyway all this stuff about like what like you know there's like what's that phrase like whatever like Brian Johnson created this thing so oh he created it okay some guy uh Oliver um did it yeah so you know I also have a handsome indianolympics.com yeah I'm currently number one we're taking content taking nominations but dude it is like fascinating like what's that phrase like whatever like the Nerds are doing on the weekends it's gonna be popular it's kind of the same thing with like billionaires which is like whatever billionaires are doing like everyone else is going to want to do and uh this stuff is fascinating to me I I don't know like I don't know like a if any of this is true or [ __ ] and B like can any normal person ever have access to this stuff I don't know but I know that there's something here and I'm not but I'm not sure how it's gonna play out well okay let's let's do a couple of these uh kind of like takeaways I think you're right that this stuff like metformin and other anti-aging or reverse aging drugs are gonna get more popular I also think that by the way metformin and semi-gluto I don't think they're in the same category at all but kind of in that they're like diabetic stuff that now regular people are using semi-glutide it's sold out like if like you if you globally yeah like you can't it takes even like if you're wealthy it takes weeks to get it like so that has happened already like there's on Tick Tock so like Tick Tock I think is like a good barometer of what like the average person is doing like Lady Gaga what had a video and she looked skinny and they called and like the top comment was like damn she's got that ozempic face because apparently if you lose a lot of weight really quickly so like people are already like using that as like vernacular and phrasing so it's already there totally um the second thing I would say is I had never even heard of this concept of measuring your biological age versus chronological age like I didn't even know there was a there was such a thing that you could separate those two numbers uh but now that I know I don't want to unknow it and actually I'm very curious as to what my biological versus chronological age is I'm sure there are many many people who are curious about that and so I could see somebody creating a testing service that's either kind of like a Everly well whatever that's like uh you know draw your blood and give you some result or like even a clinic like a dexa scan place where you go and they take you through the battery of tests that you need to do in order to give you this report and uh so I could see that being uh you know a business or Trend that that takes place in the future that's kind of exciting and I think that the beauty of that model is basically um you can you could go low price on that test because I think you get your upsell will be so strong um once you give someone their number and they're sort of thinking about the big picture uh I think you could upsell thousands and thousands of dollars worth of either nutrition training medicine some combination of of whatever Health stuff if you had a low-cost like an at Cost basically um biological age test there's a company that's doing it right now that I tried out it's called inside tracker I first heard about them because Andrew huberman talks about them so I don't actually know like the science behind it and it could be complete junk I I don't I'm not sure but because he endorsed it I was like all right I'm interested but it's called inside tracker and I do it about twice a year and it's 600 and you go to like Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp and you get blood and then you get the results in like a week but it's called inside tracker it's 600 bucks or maybe 700 something like that still not like crazy cheap but like once I saw my biological age it was like a competition so now every time every six months I'm trying to like reduce it so what is your difference what's your chronological versus biological you have a big difference or no yeah nine years so my biological was uh 22 or 23 something like that I'm 33. uh so it was it was I I did pretty good yeah that's amazing the only thing I had to work on was my cholesterol I had higher cholesterol and I don't even know like entirely what cholesterol so what did you do you just gave blood in order to do that yeah yeah you give a fair amount of blood uh but yeah you get blood because I thought what Brian Johnson's doing he's measuring like each organ individually so he's doing he like what I'm doing is like the JV team what he's doing is like professional athletes yeah he's he's like going overboard or I don't know about overboard but you know you know he's crazy right like he'll eat like the same meal every single day and it's like nuts or uh like uh it's like a hot oatmeal made of spinach it's like crazy I saw this tweet so basically on May 15th this guy named Ben tweeted out that on this one website that buys and sells businesses there's a podcast for sale it does 2.2 million in profit it's an entrepreneur podcast the owner Works 20 hours a week recording seven podcasts so it's one per day the company only has three full-time employees and it's a podcast that's been around for uh 10 years and it has nearly 4 000 episodes and so a I was figure trying to figure out which podcast this is and I have a guess of which I'm almost certain it is with but this person has never confirmed it I think it's entrepreneur on fire by John Lee Dumas who's been on rpod and us on his uh but I have no there's no confirmation this is just a guess I would bet everything that it's him uh and then but I've got to guess I don't get my life on yeah but I have zero I have you know it's not actually confirmed and the second thing is he's asking 15 million dollars for this that's the asking price so my question to you is what do you think this is worth it's hard because if you buy it he's not coming with it correct so the way if you guys Google uh like uh so the guy's name is Ben tiglar so t-i-g-g-e-l-a-a-r and you'll find his tweet you get directed he's a good follow by the way he has good like buying businesses tweets so yeah like his Twitter he'll link you to a thing where you could see like the page that uh that that you'll see a bunch of high level details and then you can enter in your information and then make you sign an NDA we'll send you the whole deal book I purposely didn't do the NDA part so just so I could talk about it so I'm only referencing what I saw on the deal page which is like high level stuff so I don't know if he goes with it uh by the way if you go to his if you go to entrepreneurs on Fire's website there's a ticker at the top that shows uh revenue for April 2023. you click it and it'll tell you that uh in April we made 181 thousand six hundred and seven dollars here's the full report and you can see that since he launched it 10 years ago this podcast he says has generated 19 million dollars in net income them for him in the in the uh I guess 11 years now since since it is uh since it has been launched that's pretty stunning uh for for this podcast that I would say is like a good podcast but it's not like uh it's not like one of these podcasts if I said like name the podcast that you know your favorite podcast in the world the one that influences you the most the one that what's the most one of the most popular entrepreneurial podcasts I would not name this one I don't think most people would name this one and for this podcast I've generated 19 million dollars in net income since uh 2012 is pretty pretty stunning and you can see that it's basically 91 sponsorships four percent courses four percent affiliate two percent his book sales and my my opinion and this has nothing to do with John this has nothing to do with his business I think that this podcast is worth without him close to zero just about close to zero and what is interesting that's crazy no I and I'll explain why because what let's say that you own this what's gonna happen you pay 15 million dollars what's gonna happen like the first six months without him like you're just gonna make residual revenue and or and then what he'll go and start his own he'll go oh yeah well no I think you're going to have a non-compete here if he if you buy this thing from first of all nobody's buying this for 15 million those people what do you think it's worth I think you could buy this I think you could buy something like this for five to six million if you were serious about it um you would have to be betting on two things number one that the loyalty is to the because I think what he does is interviews correct I don't actually listen to the Pod I think interviews it's like 20 minute interviews so you I think you have to bet that his listeners are there to hear a certain type of person come on and speak and you have to be a good interviewer so they're not there for John they're there for for uh guest guest a b c d e um you'd have to be betting that and you'd have to be betting that he's not going to go create a competing podcast of the same ilk and draw away people who are used to him there if you were to do those two things and you bought this at a two or three x multiple of profits I don't think that's insane I also don't think it's what I would do like I don't think I would make that bet but I don't think that's an insane bet to buy it for 15 million I think is an insane move you think what do you think he'll get I think he's likely to get no offers period um because the number the subset of buyers is pretty small for something like this and I think he could sell it for between one to three x profit dude and I don't know why he would post it maybe we'll be wrong I don't know why he would post it on this site because a guy like Ben found it and immediately people were in the comments were like oh it's this one this episode had like they show all your Revenue I know how many episodes it has like this is just like the easiest thing ever you know what I mean uh like they like totally guessed what it was and I think that that's crazy I I I that's it was a tough mood and it's also like we appeal to entrepreneurial people who buy and sell businesses and so you're just getting like your audience is the one that's gonna out you you know what I'm saying does he say uh does he say how much uh how many subscribers like how many subscribers he has or how big the podcast is yeah in the in the listing I think it says how many downloads it's either gets a year or a month but I believe it does it say what it what it is uh uh it just says 145 million listens so I don't know how you would calculate that you divide that by at least too many episodes there's like 14 episodes or something so but it's something like a one to two million downloads per month on and that's a daily pod so I don't know how much each one gets but anyway kind of an interesting thing if someone could sell this like a personality driven podcast and then that reverts to not personality driven that this would be very very very fascinating yeah I I'm very curious to see how this plays out I don't know how personality driven he is I think that's that that's the question like if you're um like if it's the Tim Ferriss podcast it's literally called the Tim Ferriss podcast and I would say that the that Tim is a very branded interviewer um you know his voice his style his face is the thumbnail like I think that's like impossible to sell uh entrepreneurs on fire with John Lee Dumas I don't know I think it's I think it's possible but I'm not sure what the upside would be you know you'd have to come in and be like great here's what I'm gonna do let's see can I uh how can I make my investment more more valuable can I add more episodes well he's doing one a day already so probably probably not much room there uh can I launch auxiliary products well he's already got his journal his book his course his affiliate links it's like like no he's kind of squeezed all the the monetization juice it's not like there's obvious things that he just didn't do uh for this thing uh can I grow the audience not pretty much impossible to grow a podcast audience just by Brute Force it's not like a really clear clear way to do that so I don't know why you would buy based on that I think based based on the fact that there's not very clear growth levers I think that makes it a tough budget I guess we will see but he can tell us what he can tell us why we're wrong maybe tweet that as John tell us uh why somebody should buy this for 15 million and how they're going to make you know three times their money in uh in the next you know five years on on that our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobbled together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better the McGregor documentary you watched it yeah really good it didn't talk about his business stuff which I thought was kind of I wish it would have but it was really good what do you think about him okay so my is so I used to love Conor McGregor like at a given point in time he would have been by far my favorite athlete you know combination of entertainment uh you know success and uh the mindset so like you know I thought that that was like just an amazing combination I had never really seen before and his run up from guy who was basically a Apprentice plumber on welfare to richest athlete the highest earning athlete in the world global global Star 28 world champion in like a six-year period was that six years of following that was unbelievable to watch that kind of rags to richest story he was kind of like the equivalent of a redneck but in Ireland is what I've realized like watching that documentary I was like oh you like are really good looking but you are like a trashy like redneck person like that's that's basically what you were yeah exactly exactly and he's had many documentaries actually he's had many because from the beginning he was filming or people were filming him because he has like a sort of Charisma and a magnetism about him and he had a lot of self-belief he had like an unbelievable amount of self-belief where he's like hey record this record this and they're like who are you what you're not even you're an amateur fighter like why are we recording you exactly because I'm gonna be the best and so he's actually had I think three different things on Netflix this was the latest one um couple of thoughts number one special people are nuts and you gotta be a little nuts in order to do what you're doing and he's openly admitted to being a bit nuts in fact he has this quote in the documentary where he's like I'm like Vincent van Gogh I've lost my mind to the game uh I don't I don't know nothing about else except for this game every moment every thought is about as about this game I have lost my mind to it and I like I wouldn't have it any other way there was a there was an interview where someone was like hey what do you think about the Manchester United game and he was like oh it was good you know it's great look I'm gonna be honest I don't I don't even know what game you're talking about like I I don't know anything about soccer I you could ask me about politics I don't know anything about it uh I I watch none of this all I care about is fighting right exactly so he had like a laser phone that's all on the come up and then he makes it he becomes the high starting athlete in the world he's uh creates this whiskey brand that sells for 600 million dollars and he makes maybe 200 million out of that you think that you think that those that number's right yeah I'm pretty sure that's right um and then I uh and then he's got his suit line then he's got his his McGregor FAST program he's got his uh recovery spray he's got like all these other businesses right and so he um and then you know he starts to lose and he starts to get in trouble with the law and he starts to sort of he becomes his Larger than Life Persona so he's an interesting guy he's got a little bit of a screw this I thought two things stood out to me from the documentary one was early McGregor mindset was the best so the way they filmed this was they would take present day footage of him going through something and they would splice it with like before he was famous the things this guy would say and they put it together and when you watch it together it's like the perfect mindset it's like adversity and then him saying exactly how to deal with this adversity or how to avoid the this this problem but the problem was all of the mindset stuff was from him before it was like you know him 10 years ago and um I think you know the the editing made it look like a sort of in a way like very admirable but I I think what's interesting is actually how much it changes like the mindset that got him there isn't necessarily the mindset he still has because so like at the beginning his mindset overcame his environment like nobody from Ireland had ever made it he didn't have a proper you know like you know training setup he you know he was not even in the UFC and his mind it was like Mind Over Matter and then the problem is like then the matter got so big he's sitting on a Lamborghini yacht he's got you know everybody kissing his butt and you know he doesn't have to wake up at four in the morning and go run anymore like then at some point the search his own success became his demise in a way I think this is some poetic in that the second thing I thought was he had a quote that I really loved I think is very relatable to me at least they go so what happened did you just you know you stopped training everybody says that remember you got rich you stopped training he goes no no in training I was a hundred percent committed that was a hundred percent I gave every ounce of my effort in the training sessions it was outside the training sessions and I was not 100 committed I was 75 committed he's like but that was the difference he's like you know um you know the it like here I was willing to sweat but outside of this you know I would uh I would tell myself you shouldn't eat that then I ate it yeah you shouldn't drink that and I drank it you should you should you're gonna wake up at this time I don't wake up you're gonna go to sleep on time I don't go to sleep on time he's like and those little these like those were little losses and those little losses or it could have been a small win and instead it was a small loss and I was taking those small losses outside of training and he goes that's what deteriorates the mind it weakens the mind and he's like it infiltrates your your brain these small losses they don't individually they don't seem like anything but they add up one day after another next after next and my mind became weaker and doubt started to creep in for the first time and uh you know I started a slip outside of the training and I thought man that's such a good lesson and frame for like since I watched that now all day I see opportunities I'm like this is either going to be a small win or a small loss it's not gonna no one's even gonna know besides me only I know that this situation is even occurring you know I'm feeding my daughter she's eating mac and cheese I've eaten clean all day she doesn't eat the food and now there's mac and cheese in front of my face or you know do I take that bite or do I not take that bite it's a small win or a small loss uh you know going to sleep on time it's a small win or a small loss and since that documentary I started racking up small Vines I realized how many small losses I was taking and I decided not to take those out you want to know something funny yeah I remember that exact where he goes there was times I was supposed to wake up I didn't wake up I knew I shouldn't have ate that and I ate it I hate that there was it was so relatable there's this you know the thing about him is there's all these small details about him that were really fascinating for example he has a tattoo on his arm and it says slow low is smooth and smooth is fast and I thought that I thought I was like that's just a really good phrase It's a military phrase I don't know if you've ever heard that no I didn't know that and I thought that that was like um I think it's like a Navy phrase or something it was a guy who worked for us I was in the Army he used to say that he used to say uh I know we want to go fast but remember slow is smooth and smooth is fast and uh he goes that's how they teach us when I think it's for rowing uh like like if you try to just thrash while you're rowing you're trying to go fast but you're not actually gonna go fast what's what works in rowing is clean smooth aligned Strokes by the whole team and the boat goes fast and like that's kind of what you want to do yeah and he was fascinating and he also um I don't know if he explicitly said this but there was this one time where he does this famous thing in one of his I think his first UFC fight he knocked someone out and at the end typically one fighter of the 16 gets a 50 000 bonus uh if they have a good knockout and at the end of the interview he goes Dana 50 G's baby like he's calling out dated to give him the 50 G's and he was the first person I think to do that which is pretty funny and then afterwards they go all right fine you got the 50 G's and they go what are you gonna spend it on he goes he goes dude I was under welfare last week but I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna buy a suit I'm gonna buy this and then the next fight Ariel hawani who we've had in the Pod interviews him he goes Connor I saw that you just showed up at a Louis Vuitton like suitcase he goes and he said something like I gotta buy the best I feel like the best and if you look at his life I'm typically not a guy I don't like to spend a lot of money I don't like uh you know flashy stuff but he does something interesting where he starts leveling up his life to where he's like and like he'll wear like if like you and I if we think about like when we were younger we're like well businessman has to have a suitcase and a tie and then now we're older we're like who the [ __ ] would wear that you look like a fool he still kind of plays that part so when he goes to a business meeting he wears a suit and I look him in that suit and I'm like yeah dude you look like I trust you more like for some re like you know there's like you look more like a custom fitted tailored three-piece suit to the you know to the to the nines yeah and my takeaway from that was like you know like I used to dismiss like a certain dress or certain clothing or certain cars like but like man sometimes when you level up your lifestyle it's almost like there's this old story about a guy who wanted to sell like a Picasso and he's like come to my warehouse look at the Picasso and the guy looks at it and then there's and he wasn't very impressed and there's another story where a guy takes him to this like small theater where there's classical music playing and he dim the lights and he goes look at this Picasso now and you sit down at this beautiful like velvet chair and you like right oh man like it's so much more beautiful now and that's kind of like what he did with his life he surrounded himself with like this fancy [ __ ] which typically I think is bad but for some reason I realized it's kind of cool to like surround yourself with stuff and act as if it's like no like I'm here and I I must act as if or act uh you know act like I am here yeah he's talked about that uh in the in the thing he say you know what do you want uh you know do you want this you want that he goes he goes I like I want the common thing is he rejects the question he rejects the premise in many many questions so one example is they're talking about wanting and he goes he goes that's the problem want you want this want that I already have I always act from I I already have all these things I already have the Championships I already have all the money I already have all this that's why I walked away I walked this way I carry myself this way versus wanting is just pointing out that you don't have and he he's like he's like you know so from the very beginning I carried myself this way and he talks about like um uh he talks about like uh in rejecting the question somebody I remember once he was fighting Aldo and they're like on this world tour and they're just talking mad [ __ ] to each other the whole time and it was so it got so like kind of was basically bullying this guy verbally and uh one of the they go on some TV show some good morning America type show and they're like all right well you know we've heard you guys say this but okay let's play let's do it a little different Connor what's one thing you you'd like about Aldo or you respect about Aldo let's let's change it up and uh he just looks at the guy the Good Morning America person he goes this is not a therapy session I am here to hurt this man and like and whereas nine out of 10 people you're on a TV show lights are bright you're live on air and you kind of like I will say whoever's got the stronger frame is who wins and um in most situations you just accept the frame you're given the reporter says say something nice to you say something nice and later you kind of think back you're like [ __ ] I should have said this other thing but like in the moment you got taken over by their frame one thing I notice about him and the way he speaks is beautiful with words he comes into the thing with his own frame and because of that doesn't he doesn't get knocked off course by any questions and often we'll just reject the questions altogether uh I want to read one quote by the way about the about the Vincent van Gogh thing he said um he goes I heard Vincent van Gogh lost his mind because this that's happened to me but [ __ ] it when the gold belt is around my waist when my mother has a big mansion well my girlfriend has a different car for every day of the week and when my kids kids have everything that they ever want then it will pay then I'll be happy I lost my mind he's basically a rapper uh you know he's a poet he says uh he's he's taught he's so McGregor is about to fight the best guy from Brazil and he goes If This Were another time I'd storm his pavela which is like a Brazilian Village he goes I'd storm his pavela and pillage and take what his mind he and his head would be on a stake like he says these phrases and there's another time where he gets uh where he wins um and afterwards Joe Rogan's interviewing him and he like I I he must have thought about these lines he says Precision beats power and timing beats speed and he says that really quick and then like as an audience member you like think about that line and like it just certainly you're like wow that was like that's a very insightful thing like he says these really insightful things or he'll say like I told you we didn't come here to take part we came here to take over uh you're like the study I'm like dude you're a conqueror kind of but he's a very flawed person when I watched a documentary I'm like there's very there's a lot of traits about him that I you do not not like he's done a bunch of bad things he's hypocritical in a bunch of ways there's a bunch of things I don't focus on those because what am I going to take from that I well the takeaway is nobody's perfect yeah like everybody's flawed in their own ways the things I do take are the things that are going to serve me and one I remember all right so you know when you go into startup office uh in San Francisco every engineer's got like multiple monitors it's like uh it's kind of just like the flex is like how many monitors you got it's like you know the sysadmill I've always got three most developers got at least two so I used to sit there just on my laptop I don't even have the big monitor I was just on my little laptop uh and I was like looking around I was like maybe I need a big monitor so I got a big monitor which was just my laptop I plugged it in it's just bigger say okay should I get a second monitor all right I got a second monitor I was like what the hell am I supposed to put on this I don't I don't know I'm not trying to look at two things at once that doesn't even make sense so I just put and for five years there was one McGregor quote that just was on my second monitor at all times I only used it for this one quote and it just said at the end of the day you got to feel some type of way so why not feel unbeatable why not feel untouchable and um that always stuck with me because it was like I do it just I don't know it resonated it was like it's true at any given moment you're gonna feel some type of way so given I'm gonna feel some way why don't I choose what would be the best feelings I could choose and I'm gonna feel that way I'm gonna choose how I feel and I just left it there and I just left it there for five years and it really helped like starting yourself could be kind of stressful and most days I would say are like almost like down days it's like uh it's not growing it's not growing fast enough it's growing too fast this shit's breaking like there's a lot of reasons to feel down in a startup and like that one quote changed my experience over those five years so Steve Jobs if you read his biography they someone coined this term called the rat reality Distortion field which basically is like regardless of what the facts were outside of Steve's brain even though it showed like what you're about to do is not likely he would convince himself and others that it was possible and they called it the reality Distortion field and that's cool and all but the reason why this relates to Connor's when Steve Jobs was doing all this stuff he didn't have like a documentary as he was going iPhones didn't really exist and like easy footage didn't exist the reason why this is cool for a business person is because it's another example of which that many people have this but it's a good example of someone who does have this but there's cameras there catching the whole thing and so you'll see Connor and he's about to fight Habib and Habib wins the fight and anyone going into that was like yeah habib's gonna sock him he's gonna destroy him but Conor was like he was so certain that he was going to beat him that afterwards he's crying and he's like I had planned like here's how we were going to celebrate we're gonna like he totally thought that he was going to win when everyone else was like no way there's there's not a chance but the fact that he believed it so much it was really valuable even if the outcome was the same and I thought that that was really example but let me give you one controversial or opinion about Conor as well as a lot of other people uh in this space I predict that in 10 maybe 20 years but probably 10 I think Conor will file for bankruptcy and the reason I think that is I've been you know how like you'll read about like Floyd Mayweather has made a billion dollars or Conor McGregor made 100 million dollars from boxing I think all of that is 100 fake and it's absolutely not true and the reason I think this is this there's this guy named Chael Sonnen he's a former fighter now an analyst he went on Andrew Schultz podcast and he goes I can promise you that Floyd has never made a hundred million dollars from one fight which is what he says and I think that he is at most made 100 million dollars collectively in his career uh and he goes the reason I think that is when a lot of these people talk about pay-per-view numbers and how much money they're making you can just say anything like not like the CEO of DirecTV or whoever like handles pay-per-views has never came out and said this is how much money it made like no one says that and what channel goes he goes a lot of these athletes uh if it's not like you know spoken by the guy who paid the bill it's just completely made up and they say that to get more and I and he goes I know for a fact a lot of it is fake do you think do you have examples of people who you know who have just blatantly lied like you and I have one friend who like sold a company and let's just I'm gonna make up a fake number but it's something like this the headlines if you Google it say 200 million dollars I know it was 12. like there's like a there's like I I know of stories like that do you know of stories like that where someone has just completely lied well I can't think of off top my head somebody personally I know who's lied I guess the the versions that I've seen of this are almost like this the petty crime version of this where they're like um yeah I sold my company to whatever it's like you got a job from them right like you know it's uh like yeah how much cash was uh how much cash was exchanged up front for the assets that there's a difference um like versus like we you know we sold it to whatever Facebook and then you're like okay cool you you got you got Aqua hired and it's okay there's nothing wrong with getting acquired but like um or just never having done it to begin with it's like uh you know join something that's already working and then say uh you know yeah I I led blank at this company right like there's like lots of like career lies like that I can't think of an example of somebody who sold their company for let's say 10 million dollars and said it was 50. I personally I don't know I gotta ask you which friend we're talking about over here uh I have a feeling I have a feeling I know who you're talking about but most I would say um I I don't think they do that I don't know do is this common um well I think like it's common to round up which is no big deal because like yeah there's always like uh little details about it where regardless of how you look at it it could be true I'll tell you in our case we sold to Twitch um when we saw people to Twitch I've said this many times like I gave a presentation at your conference called how to sell a failing company right which was basically saying like we sold a company that wasn't like Instagram where it was so hot it was the next big thing and then Facebook comes to buy stuff for a billion dollars that's one type of sale there's another type of sale which is like a business is kind of working not really it's it's okay it's good but it's not gonna be huge and you find a good landing spot for it for for the asset and the talent and when we sold to Twitch um there was a reported number that came out that said uh we sold for 25 million dollars we did not sell for 25 million dollars we sold for who got that number uh I know how they got that number which was uh somebody I know submitted a tip to one of the thing one of the one of the news sites or whatever and I don't know if they put that number in or they asked them and they hinted at some number and like the journalists just ran with it so dude another person which I never told them to do they just did it they were trying to be helpful they were like hey this is whatever they asked for this or they they asked to comment and I just kept it you know I think they might have just been like yeah rumored rumored to me what you'll know like so for example with our sale there was like some numbers that were on in headlines it was way lower and then there was others that was way higher and I'm like right I have no idea how you guys got this information but what you'll notice is that someone will write an article TechCrunch will say this was sold for made up number 30 million dollars and then it'll they'll say rumor and this other person will say this person sold for this and then you get asked to a conference and your introduction is he sold for this right and then and then it's like this other person's like here's the 30 million dollar bad you know what I mean it's like well it's like it's crazy like this whole just this is just Sprints it's a spread and it's it's completely made up and so whenever I um whenever you see articles about this person's net worth when I tell people I go look Google this person's name net worth and every once in a while like I've written articles about someone's net worth like Ross Albright from Silk Road when I like wanted to test this Theory and so my article will came up will come up and I'm other people will Source uh cite it and I go hey just so you know I made that up it's completely fake and so whenever you read about these other people's net worth just know that the network things on Google are so far off so it's laughable I don't think I've seen one that's accurate to be honest with you I anytime I have any idea about someone's net worth and I Google it it is so far off it's actually like just completely misleading it's a if it tells you one thing it said it's not that number yeah a process of elimination we know it's not that it's last again that stuff but when we sold the even myself I can't tell you exactly how much we sold for why because the deal has like so many uh different numbers there's a up front you got this many millions of cash okay cool but then we also got a big signing bonus for uh first for agreeing to come on board and enjoy the team then you got your salary but that's not part of the deal uh in your normal rsus from the from the thing but then we got deal rsus on top and then you're like okay so which one is it and then by the time those vested the stock price had doubled so I was like well did I should count it from when we got it right but I made but I received more than the number that that was when it was granted but so which one is it and then for example we had another deal with uh Facebook and Facebook's deal was one extra year so like twitch was three years this was a four-year deal and so that number the headline number of what we got offered there was bigger but in actuality it's like well yeah you got to stay for four years to earn all those rsus are you gonna even do that uh you know like some of the rsus we got uh my co-founder bounced after one year so he didn't even get the other two years so you know which which number was it the number he got or the number that was granted or the number that it was worth on the day that yeah that's why I said that's right about what rounding rounding is different because it's like I don't feel like telling you it's complicated and explaining so I'll just like make something up that's ballpark or directionally correct do you want to go to some of your other topics or save them um let's do this AI body doubles thing so I've now seen this trend of people doing startups that are I'm calling like body doubles or stunt doubles so first there was a bunch of news the other day about this SnapChat influencer girl named Karen Marjorie and she partnered with some AI company and they created a um an AI version of her voice so her fans could text with her and they could get audio notes from her in her voice uh generated by AI um for a dollar a minute and she made 72 000 the first day off of a thousand users and so on then the news Karen's a real person right I'm looking her up she's a real person okay yeah her last tweet uh is a tweet that says because I looked her up just before this to just do you know some research and she uh last week was I love the ocean and then it was just a picture of her butt so so what's something about content creation from everybody so she like smoking but is that why she's famous just for being pretty yeah I think she's cute and that's like the fame I don't know maybe she has some other backstory I'm not sure a fellow ocean lover yeah I like the ocean too huh let me try this so so she made 72 Grand the first day the news runs with this why because anything that's like AI good or AI bad is gonna get like published in close City right now um but there's other ideas that are like this so I talked about AI Santa I was like somebody needs to make a a Santa Claus through um text-to-speech and then charge people you know 35 dollars forty dollars to come to the website type in a greeting saying hey wish my kid you know Stevie a happy Merry Christmas and tell him he's been a good boy and he did a great job with his soccer season and like just have Santa say all that so like I think that's a that's a business there's a more General version of that which is cameo through AI so celebrities like the idea of Cameo but can't there's a reason that Cameo is all kind of like c-list sort of celebs Cameo is the best place to see which which celebrities broke like it's like it's a real-time net worth calculator yeah that's the best place to go to see who who is a great place to go see upcoming celebrity divorces yeah who's got bills to pay um Kevin from the office so it's like there's a reason why it's see this because it takes a lot of time like you know uh George Clooney doesn't actually want to sit there and record you know uh birthday messages for like you know 33 year olds uh it's not not what he wants to do with this time but if you bought me a cameo by the way Gilbert Godfrey you bought me a cameo and he just made fun of my penis size and yeah a little too vulgar but yeah I thought it was great I loved it I thought it was awesome I thought it was a good wedding gift I couldn't make it to your bachelor party so I sent you Gilbert Godfrey the The Cameo so I think that what's gonna happen is celebrities are going to start licensing their name and face and voice to companies who will pay to be able to generate AI versus that and go sell it for them so now you get the residual revenue from your name and face just like slap my slap my face on a bottle of sprite or whatever and it sells more Sprite people are going to do that with can't like Cameo like Services where it's uh it's wish me happy birthday it's congratulate me on this um and you know there'll obviously need to be some rules and boundaries around what it can and can't say but whether Cameo itself does this or a competitor Cameo comes out and does this with AI like for sure this is gonna happen it's a like obvious idea we've been talking about this for a long time actually with like we said that uh somebody should do Cameo with like Pixar characters or like Disney characters and just get the licenses for it it's the same thing but now you can animate anybody not just a Disney character and before chat chat gb2 was a thing there was another company that we talked about that was doing uh like AI girlfriends and a replica how are they doing do you know they're crushing really crushing yeah I read an article that they like changed something and that one of their users killed themselves they update the model so like as machine learning improves or that when you know you go from GPT 3 to gpd4 they upgrade the model and then the users are like my girlfriend is different like she's saying different things to me what the hell and like sometimes it's censorship like she won't say this thing she used to say she says she's not allowed to say that or talk about that anymore or it's like her personality changed and I'm like heartbroken it's crazy like people are like you go to the Facebook groups or the subreddit it's people are losing them the Facebook group is crazy I've been on that for since it started and it's really really interesting I talked to the founders she was really cool really smart woman I think she used to be like a journalist um she was like a she was like a famous journalist in Russia or something and then she had to flea Russia or left Russia and then like reinvented herself and like created became an entrepreneur it sounds like a James Bond villain I like I like the beginning of the story like Russian journalists who flees starts AI company right it's not Natalia but it could be yeah this is great yeah she she's really impressive uh I really wanted to invest but the valuation is like super crazy so you you know because because they're like a consumer AI company that actually has a bunch of traction and a bunch of Revenue which is like pretty unheard of so so the evaluation was was like in the hundreds of millions pretty pretty quickly um anyways uh there's another version of this AI body double thing happening in the business space so people have approached me saying hey we trained AI on the podcast and so now if somebody wants people a lot of people want your advice or whatever um they'll pay and the AI will give them the answers and it'll give them it to in your voice in your style and you don't have to take time to do this what's the company called that does that Delphi like uh with delphi.com d-e-l-p-h-i.com uh so they're they're digitizing uh they're a digital cloning platform that can capture how someone thinks making their knowledge experiences and opinions available to others in a personalized way do they need your permission or no I would think actually no I think eventually they will so like you know they can get away with it you know right now and with a certain set of people but like if they get big and you realize hey they're using my name my face my voice and charging other people for it I'm getting nothing you know that's just like lawsuits waiting to happen so that they you know the email basically asking like hey are you down for this um uh like he was like hey I took your course I helped me land a job at my like thing um and then and then I started writing viral Twitter threads based on the what I learned in the course eventually my startup got acquired last week and blah blah blah I'm doing this new thing I was like wow that's this is crazy digital digital clones to AI clones of people AI body doubles I think this is a interesting little Trend to watch it's gonna happen I'm I think the next two years are gonna be wild I I don't think they're going to be as wild as people think but I think it's going to be wild I think darmesh said something like it's not going to be as bad or as uh great as you think and I kind of trust him because I think that he's very he's he's one of the few people that has like an IQ high enough to understand this but also has like a ton of EQ and like understands that like how people work he's not super biased necessarily like uh if you listen to the guy who runs open AI tell you you know it's pretty safe it's like well you do have a bias that what was interesting was darmesh so a HubSpot darmesh is the CTO of HubSpot um darmesh but they had an earnings call like three weeks ago or two weeks ago and he doesn't talk much uh on the earnings call he's not the CEO um but someone asked the CEO about Ai and she goes I'm gonna yamity goes I'm gonna let dharmesh uh say what he needs to say and he gives it gives his Spiel and he gave almost the exact same Spiel that he gave on our pod where he like explains it and then if you go you can go and look at the stock since he did that talk and I think it's up 15 or something I think it was like 420 or 400 a day before the earnings now it's close to 500 today and then Baron just came out with an article that said something like HubSpot is uh you know we think that the companies that are going to kill it with AI aren't AI companies but big companies that will use AI for example HubSpot this this and this and what's really fascinating is he's on this pod telling us his opinion about it then on this earnings call this Banker asked about it and it's like man we have access because of Twitter and all this stuff we're able to see like what's happening in front of our eyes and it's very very very fascinating to see like how he's handling all this like they said he he basically told us how he started chat spot which is like an AI thing within HubSpot he's like this is what we did and it sounds so simple but then he like talks about it a little bit more like corporate speak on the analyst calls and right you know created something like a billion dollars worth of Enterprise Value uh amongst other things but right so it's like really cool to see all this happening uh in front of everyone I wonder what he does after the call he's like well I guess my work for the day is done generated a billion dollars of value for the company okay uh you know actually after you sold the hustle to HubSpot I uh tuned into their first earnings call because I thought you might be on there just what's up fam uh yeah Sam here are we doing we're doing [ __ ] great what do you mean yeah yeah there's all these dumb companies out there Sam leading the earnings call dude there's one earnings call shout out to Marathon Ranch all of you analysts are welcome you guys will see a new tattoo with my dog on my leg [Laughter] one time before one of these calls he went into like the the slack of HubSpot and he goes all right everyone I'm gonna say the word I forget what it was but it was like penguin eight times on this call and so I was like oh [ __ ] I gotta listen to this until I tuned in and he said the word like he threw it in and I'm just like so funny like this guy he's the best man this is this is my type of guy just like he's he's winning the game but he's having fun he's having fun I'm a big fan of him um I think that's it is that the pod that's it that's the pod [Music] foreign

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so I went to school at Belmont University and it was like a southern Christian University that had low standards yeah that's amazing what it says on their website too does it like a home of mediocrity mediocre people exceptional prices uh like [Music] all right we're live we're doing a q a session we decided this kind of last minute it's like when a substitute teacher comes in and they roll out the TV on the trolley and they're like hey guys today you know what I decided I want a day off oh no no sorry I wanted you guys to watch this movie no it works out because frankly I think people like this and we like the movie too it works it's a win-win and so yeah we we have to do very little work and people like it let's just get right into it we're gonna keep each question at around three minutes uh which is not you don't have to worry about me going over it's Sean let's do it Ben what do you got let's do a little q a so basically the background is we both tweeted out what questions do you have and we got a bunch of them in the uh uh on the tweets and uh we'll see where we go we had we I think we have like a hundred hundreds of them and we selected maybe 10 ish of each uh or of from each of our twitters and we'll see which ones are interesting all right go okay uh from someone named new BET a pretty basic one what is your opinion on sweaty startups all right here's my opinion I think it's cool I think any way you can get your nut you get it that said that sounds uh the philosophy you've had since you were a teenager or what yeah get that nut uh I think if you can get it it doesn't matter which way you get it get it and there's lots of examples of everyone succeeding in all different types of Industry personally I think making money digitally is significantly better because it requires close to no capital in some cases you can work from anywhere there's been times I've sent an email from my phone and it's made a whole bunch of money and I think that it's way hard way harder to make a million dollars a year from a brick and mortar business than it does uh digitally I also think that the lab laptop class I saw Elon Musk call Tesla headquarter employees the lab laptop class I think those types of people of which most of you are including myself we want to do stuff with our hands and I think it's significantly better just to make money on the internet and then all your free time go get a hobby because if you go and talk to a blue collar worker they sure as hell don't want to be there um so I'd rather be in the situation of like being able to choose to spend my time doing it the other way versus in this question the guy said uh sweaty startup makes great this is Nick our buddy Nick Huber so Nick makes great points about not wanting to compete with Stanford grads generating real cash flow and getting rich the slow way I agree this might be the best video what do you guys think so I think this whole Nick is great and Nick and I think you're totally right that however you want to win win and there are many many ways to win if anything if this podcast teaches you one thing it's how many different ways there are to win um but given that given that there are many ways to win you better choose the one you really want and for me I'm like I might as well choose the one that is most ideal the most in tune of the lifestyle I want I don't want to go worry about the roof damage at my self storage facility or that the you know the the 15 an hour employee called out sick and there's nobody at the front door now to take customers today like I don't want those issues I'm happy bearing a different set of issues uh and so that you know I think you got to choose how you want to win and I also think this whole idea of like you don't want to compete against Stanford kids this is like a great sound bite but it doesn't matter it's one of these true but not important I used to say this all the time to pissed everybody off in the office I'd say that's so true and it doesn't matter yeah which it's like dude I just want to win like my high school conference Championship I don't need to worry about you saying exactly you know what I mean like if I get there nobody who's doing digital like an internet company is like God these wretched Stanford kids keep keep beating me it's like dude I haven't seen a Stanford even if I did see a Stanford kid you've seen those dorks that's not a problem like yeah give them a wedgie and push them out the way nerd like you don't have to worry about these guys Knuckles still work noogies are very effective but like it's not the Stanford kids that are the problem if you fail in the Internet it's because it's a noisy place and you couldn't get anyone's attention right you die of starvation not murder when it comes to startups internet startups and so if you're if you're failing it's not because the Stanford kids beat you it's because the market didn't want what you what you had to offer and I don't know I like sitting behind my laptop I haven't worn pants in you know 450 days this is the way to live and by the way you have or had you know you could talk about it whatever you want but you've had an e-commerce business which is have 20 uh brick and mortar as in you have like people you got to go see we have physical products we take a warehouse we have things like that more than 20 yeah whatever it is uh and then you also did milk road which one was better a newsletter letter that this wrote that we pushed one button to send to you know 300 000 people and just printed profits from month one yeah that's the one that I think that was the one I liked the best the one that after a year we were able to sell just like that because there was no none of that Sweat Right they call it sweaty startups for a reason so uh I've done both the one thing I will say though real estate has some amazing tax perks so that that he does have that going for it and we'll wrap it up by saying and this sounds like I'm making fun of Nick and Cody both of whom are my great friends Cody Sanchez so I'm not but ask them which one's making more money the digital stuff or the brick and mortar stuff right um I don't actually know the truth so at least 20 startup guys you guys are pretty active on uh Twitter and uh excellent courses and these online courses Revenue versus that laundromat right so I would I would ask them which one they think is better but who knows all right what do we got all right next up uh we'll take it from the top someone named it block mates asks what's the most interesting business you've seen that didn't take off and why do you think that was go for it so there was this app back in the day that I saw when I saw it I was like this is this is gonna hit it was made by these Russian dudes um and it's called povio and what povio used to do was every other social network was uh like I post photos so Facebook was like I go to a party I post an album of photos then Instagram was like yo I'm on the go I'm at a cafe I'll take a photo of my cappuccino and it all had this kind of like look at me uh I'm kind of bragging about my life thing and I've always said that social networks when a social network hits it's not because of a feature it's because of a change in the the privacy policy right so like Facebook was the first time you used your real name on the Internet because you would do it with other college kids who went to your same school that's why Facebook got your real name your real relationship status your real courses put you get you to put it online um Twitter was like hey you don't have to be my friend you could just follow me I can't even I don't even have to prove you just follow me that's a change in privacy policy uh Snapchat change of privacy policy I was like yo this is a disappearing photo that it's private so every great social network has a change in the privacy policy and povio had a genius one which was you would request a photo from someone else so I would ping you and it would open up your phone and it would go three two one and it would take a picture of where whatever you're doing or wherever you're at and so you could kind of be like yeah it's a way of saying what's up but the person would default reply with a photo and I was like this is genius they're getting people they're giving people even more excuses to take random useless pictures this shit's Gonna Fly and sure enough on the first college campus it started to work and it was growing and then it just kind of faded away it never really made it and I I still believe in this mechanic of if somebody made this app where you would you would basically be you're basically saying what's up and they're replying with a photo and you're basically pulling the photo from them rather than pushing it online I think that's kind of a game changer but I was wrong it never it never worked I'm looking at their app description and their app page in iTunes and it says that it only has like five reviews so it never took off but the funny part is is that you know how there's like screenshots of the app it's a very clearly it looks like a kid on the Stanford campus taking a picture and the way Stanford's in Palo Alto this is Santa Clara yeah I don't know well I don't know what's there but like you don't got to worry about those Stanford kids see it's no big deal it doesn't work um but mine is um Dorsey so it didn't work out it's door the word door then s e y um but I've always wanted I've been looking to invest in companies that have a good chance of making buying a home online possible uh I'm like I'm a firm believer that people will end up buying close to everything online and there's only a few categories but that's not the case it's like Hardware so like like Home Depot still crushes it because like you don't buy a screw on the internet and then homes it's another thing that people don't buy online no one's figured it out yet this company has not worked yet and I still think there's an opportunity for a company to work in the space where you can buy like you'll make hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollar purchase on the internet I think that's gonna be a thing do you remember when Mark Cuban bought uh a jet on eBay and it was like all the rage like all freaked out I didn't even know this uh yeah so when he sold his company broadcast.com he you know became a billionaire and he bought a 50 million dollar Gulf Stream jet on eBay and people were freaking out which it's not even that like that's not even that interesting if you ask me what's only interesting that it's a big purchase but like you know a jet like if it's the same model you kind of know what you're gonna get and like the condition is like Fair excellent you know what I mean I just asked Google's AI I think I said what percentage of Home Depot sales are online and it said 2022 60 of its sales were online so even Home Depot is selling the majority of products online versus well if it's if it's if it's Revenue then yeah I believe that because people will order grills but like when you want like a five dollar like bolt you usually just go there and you'll buy like 10 of all different sizes you know what I mean see like which ones actually fit uh but uh yeah I'm into like things that can't be sold or aren't being sold online yet that should be and I think that homes are one of them what else you got Ben all right here we go um this is something we've talked a lot about recently but what does enough look like for you you've got a much better answer than I do just just for reference I put a bullet point in and I wrote out what my answer might be or like a a blurb and mine's this like long thoughtful thing and then Sam's like Sam I'll just answer yours for you it just says I don't think there's ever enough whenever you explained your point of view that I'll sound like here's why I thought that there was like there's been multiple times in my life it was like a hundred thousand dollars five hundred thousand dollars where I thought I won't worry and I've hit a lot of different of these targets and I still worry there's times where I worry less for a little while but it like have you ever heard the idea of like have you ever seen um You probably haven't but there's like stories and studies of people who lose a lose a limb and they're pretty bummed for like six or yeah they're bummed for like six or twelve months and then they go right back to being they're like okay I'm back at it I feel fine uh I think it's the same with like a lot of money stuff where it's like uh you make it the amount that you thought and then you go back to like where you were and I believe that to be true that's why I said Never Enough well I'll say a couple of uh other other ways I think about this so yeah come on Indie and Guru yeah let me just I mean do you got your wisdom cups out everybody because I'm about to fill you up yeah are you gonna do you need to sit like a Indian style to tell the story exactly take a deep breath in first before I do this um all right so vipassana so so Paul Graham did this thing where he created Y combinator which is basically the most successful company in Silicon Valley besides like Google and Facebook and uh did he just retired he's just left and he moved to like the woods in England and he just writes code in his cabin with his kids and writes you know poetry and paints and well goes for walks and I was like this mother this [ __ ] thinks he's got enough huh and I was like you know dare he leave the rat race all of the rats we were shaking our fist being like you get your ass back in here and um and I got inspired by that and I was like okay so what is the like what's the enough State not money but like what would I what is my version uh so instead of thinking what number would I feel like is enough because I think that's a trap I just thought about like if I felt like I had enough or what I want to go do and then I thought maybe I could just go do that thing so here's what I came up with two things I said uh I heard this Naval quote which was retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imagine tomorrow and uh that hit home and he was like you know what that means is that the the moment you do things in your day that the act of doing them is the reward not like you're doing them today sacrificing for some future payoffs that are going to come at that moment you are free and uh and I was like okay that's the goal the goal is to be free meaning the goal is to on a daily basis do things that the act of doing them is the reward I'm not doing them for some future rewards and I said if I did that what what types of things would I want to do what types of things is the act of doing them the reward itself and here's what I came up with I said I think that having a big podcast is actually the best job in the world and I'm obviously biased here but I've also tried a bunch of things and this is the best uh if you have a big podcast that means you're famous but you're only famous amongst nerds which is kind of the not annoying way to be famous uh it's like all the good parts of being famous without the bad um you also get rich but you didn't have to chase money um you get to create content but you're not like the annoying 24 7 vlogger who's got their phone out and ruins like their actual life trying to create content for some audience because with the podcast like we sit here for like two hours a week in recorder three hours a week and record and that's it the other 165 hours in a week we get to do whatever we want we don't have to think about creating content and we don't have to get hurt while we're doing it like if you watch it I don't constantly one up myself and like like that dumbass YouTuber who crashed a plane on purpose for views and now is going to jail um you're not competing on an algorithm like Tick Tock where you get this hit of Fame and then you're forever chasing it um but podcast great you just talk you're unscripted you're unedited you're talking to a friend or somebody you admire like if it's a guest that seems like the best job in the world and then for fun I would basically coach a basketball team like Mighty Duck style and I would want to just [ __ ] like chill out and just shoot the [ __ ] in a writer's room for like a TV show or a comedian um or teach at Stanford twice a week I think those are the things that I would just do for the pure joy of doing them not for some future rewards and to me I'll have enough when my day is mostly [ __ ] like that why haven't you tried to get a teaching job or a coaching job I haven't put enough attention on it like this question made me think about it and made me think oh why don't I just go do that now and often life is that simple like it's not that there's actually any barrier in the way it's just I didn't put my attention on what do I actually want oh yeah okay I can probably just go get that one good excuse is you have young kids so it's like once they go to school maybe uh that would be it yeah I'm not a believer in that I think it's really just a matter of like I didn't put my focus on that's what I really want okay then go get it by the way there was a good Paul Graham thing so this guy tweeted out there are very few second times Founders because anyone smart enough to succeed the first time isn't dumb enough to do it all over again Paul replied he goes anyone smart enough to succeed the first time is still running that company and then our friend Akita go yeah wonder what happened with that washed up via web founder and what he's doing these days that was Paul Graham's first thing and he goes touche Paul so like you know even even the smart guys like Paul can can get things wrong once in a while so he says he's got enough but who knows I actually do believe that he does but um I think your answer is better than mine uh it is about enjoying the experience more and whenever I was like running my old company the hustle I look back at it and I'm like I wish I would have enjoyed that more during the process but it's a very challenging thing to do well I'll just ask you one thing are you okay with knowing that you'll never have enough before you answer that let me just put it the other way which is if you feel like you'll never have enough that sort of is to me that means you're never really free like the most fun interactions you know this is like when you meet with somebody you want nothing from them and you need nothing from them like those are the best interactions with people there's no more freeing feeling that just literally I don't need you and I don't want anything from you I can just be here and just have have whatever experience I'm gonna have uh versus the opposite when you want someone's approval or you need them to like you or you need them to hire you those are the most stressful interactions and so to me I think if you want to be free you got to believe that there is such a thing as enough I think we're you're thinking about it differently than I am so let's say that you're an athlete let's say that you're a weightlifter or let's say that you're um a comedian you're Hassan minhaj you're your buddy is he ever gonna be like I'm funny enough I don't need to improve my craft anymore I don't think so I think he could find a a bit of contentment of being like I'm on top of my game I'm doing awesome and I can always get better and that's kind of when I say It's never enough that's what I mean if my craft is building if my crap is building companies that means that there's always more that I can do to be better but that doesn't mean that I'm unhappy or not uh satisfied with where I am fair enough fair enough um all right Ben let's go to the next one if you could go back to your college days what is the one thing you would have done differently knowing what you know now that's from Sam Faber so I was a huge idiot in college and not even like the cool idiot I was like ah man I was I was just being dumb just going to parties having fun with my friends late nights you know it's like wait did you love it or are you saying it was bad it's like for me I was just I was just doing nothing I was a do nothing idiot and uh that's the worst kind um and to me now that I look back I'm like wow college is a gold mine you can make lifelong friends you can meet future business partners even just you know I'm a business junkie now I wish that when I was in college I had been launching businesses I got a captive Market of students who I understand who I can reach that are just living literally living in this bubble waiting to be sold products uh and I could have been working on my skills then versus I started working on my skills after college um you know there's alumni that like I didn't realize how powerful it is just to be like hey I'm I'm also I also go to Duke you went to Duke 35 years ago I go there now and they're like cool you want to hang out and it's it like it's that easy to connect and so now I look back and I would say I would mine that gold mine I was just sitting there eating Chick-fil-A on top of a gold mine I didn't even really look down and realize what I was sitting on um the only smart thing I did was I studied abroad which is kind of a thing you really want to do at that point I went to Australia what would you you didn't go to Sydney did you did yeah yeah man study I think Sydney Australia is the greatest City it is the greatest City it's the best place to be like a 19 year old it's the greatest place on Earth my biggest regret is that I didn't take High School seriously enough to get into some of these amazing schools so I went to school at Belmont University and it was like a southern Christian University that had low standards yeah that's amazing is what it says on their website too is it like a home of mediocrity Joker people exceptional prices uh like back then it was very expensive it was very expensive and it was like such a mediocre thing I like when you say you went to Duke like I I I envy you so much because at least you got like even the basketball guys were like the best and then a lot of your peers were very very smart and I bet you met like a lot of people from even though it was in the South I bet you still met like tons of different like foreigners people from New York City people from California I didn't get to meet any of those people so I regret that the first like Jewish person I met was when I moved to San Francisco at the age of like 22. like I didn't know like it was just like pretty much just white people and so I wish I was like around moral of like a global uh group of people and so that was one of my big regrets I also wish that I took seriously the idea that the things that you do in college aren't that important they don't have to be like the thing that you do but if you take your hobbies seriously um it's a really fun time to try on different personalities and things like that so I wish I had a little I took I wish I took that more seriously um I totally agree with that part which was I thought in college the thing is your classes and the result is your grades but actually that's completely backwards like the thing is the people in the environment that's the one thing you're never gonna get back and then if you really wanted a result you wanted to like you know take it seriously the way to take it seriously wasn't to get a pluses or like you know be an amazing chemistry major it was actually like hey this is four years and after this I'm supposed to figure out I'm supposed to be like doing a job and pick a career I should dabble I should go and like sample like it's Costco and it's noon and I should go sample a bunch of different way things that you could do meet a bunch of people who do that thing and I should take this time to figure out what do I actually like to do and I wish colleges were oriented like that because colleges are oriented around the opposite assumption it's like pick what you want that means you must know and then put your head down in focus and it's like that's the wrong time to focus uh you should be dabbling at that stage do you have good credit I'm okay credit like I have good enough credit dude I wish I would have um so I didn't like get a credit card until I was like 24 and then I started my company and I would Max it out constantly and then I would and I would always like pay it off like before I had to so my credit card utilization was always like a hundred percent and I didn't have a long credit history and so I wish I had there's a very practical thing I wish I had a credit card at the age of 18 and I used it for everything and always paid it off so I could build credit history I don't have like the most the best credit because of that did that come back to bite you why do you need your credit so bad you're trying to get loans or something what are you trying to do what when I tried to buy the house that I'm living in now I couldn't buy it my wife had to buy it one because my credit history wasn't long enough which is crazy uh and it wasn't like fantastic I think every once in a while it's in the 600s and then um be because you're a business owner buying a a house and getting a mortgage is really really challenging so I can I couldn't buy it fair enough all right what do we got all right this next one is uh have you had a deal not go through when close to finishing it if so what did you learn to do better how did your mentality regroup to start the process over not for sure but I feel like the sellers are trying to tank this business acquisition which is supposed to close on May 31st that's from Mackenzie Reed this is a great question and the I accidentally interrupted you but he said um I feel like sellers are trying to tank this Biz acquisition which is supposed to close on 531 I want to address that but first I had a deal go through I think my NDA is up but there's a recent Media company that went bankrupt that tried to buy the hustle and we got to a term sheet and it completely fell through or we got to an Loi and it completely fell through and there was like three others that I had lined up and it also felt through and I was devastated so I changed my opinion to uh this like any deal that I have it's going to happen to it will not happen but I will act as if it's going to but just assume it's not going through and then if it does I will be happy because most fall through but to address that last question of I think the sellers are trying to tank this Biz acquisition I have that exact same attitude when I sold the HubSpot and I and then one day I just told him I got to know the woman uh who is I was working with that HubSpot and she was like look you don't understand we're worth 20 billion dollars this deal is really not a big deal to us like this ain't gonna do anything for us I mean it'll do a little something but just so you know we already got like board approval to do it which means I told my boss and that boss told their boss and then that boss reported it to 12 people who are like billionaires and [ __ ] and so if this deal doesn't go through all that means all 12 of those people have to like change something and and then more so I'm gonna look stupid and my boss is gonna look stupid and this other boss is gonna look stupid so because we're a big publicly traded company if we say we're going to do something we're going to do it not necessarily because of it's It's a logical good deal but because I don't want to look dumb in front of all my bosses so we're going to do this versus when you sell to a smaller company or like an individual who's got money I do feel they will always try or not always a lot of times they will nickel and dime you or they will try to dock you but I don't necessarily necessarily think a lot of times they're trying to ruin something but I do think they will have ulterior motives which is like I'm trying to learn a little bit of information about this company so I can start my own or do all these other things but when you sell to a big publicly traded company I think nine out of 10 times it's not in their best interest to screw you that's a great answer I'm the same way I go into every single deal assuming the deal is not going to go through because uh as Emmett said to me birds fly fish swim and Deals fall through that's what they do deals fall through it is not a is it not a uh you know outlier or exception or like disaster when that happened oh a deal did what it does deals fall through that's what they do baby like what you're worried about sit your ass down why are you crying that's how that's my that's how I talk to myself when I when I get like emotionally attached to a deal so the emotional Detachment is key all right well how do you do that part of it you gotta you needed to be having a bulletproof mindset before you get into an m a transaction it's too late when you're in the m a transaction to be like all right guys I'm gonna toughen up this here brain to be able to like operate in a very like tricky circumstance where I might get life-changing money or it might all fall through and like you know that's a that's hard to do then you got to train before that um you know that's the first thing second thing is um I not only do they fall through that's also not fatal when they do um in fact every deal I've done has had a fall through moment if not two and so that is my my rule of thumb which is that every deal that does close both there's going to be two walkaways along the way you're gonna walk away or they're gonna walk away that's gonna probably happen twice you're gonna hit a wall twice before this deal actually happens where it feels like this deal is dead or it's simply not happening or there's just a very very low chance that we get over this this hurdle have you announced or have you said have you ever mentioned I'm not sure if it's ndi the other two people you almost sold to instead of twitch uh I think I said before like we got pretty far down the road with Facebook and that we also had a couple others that were Facebook we had that were were like out one hour away from accepting the deal and finishing it um and one of the good things that they did tell me was same thing you just said about HubSpot uh so twitch is owned by Amazon and the Corp Dev guy was like look I'm sorry we've been so slow and I'm sorry we're not the like we can't just give you everything you want in terms of price but here's the good news we will not retrade this deal which is what it's called when you come back and you try to get that that's what they told me second negotiation once everybody's fully emotionally invested and you're like but actually now I want to change this but then you think like oh you're just a doctor you tell everyone that their kids are like doing great or like they look they look cute like you know what I mean like you're just you're [ __ ] that's true who's helping me help me get through it and he confirmed that he was an investment banker he'd done 100 plus transaction he's like yeah these guys are both of them Facebook and Amazon if they give you an offer they're solid on that that will be the deal that goes through there will be if it doesn't close us because you didn't disclose something that you then come out later with or you change your mind it's not going to be because of them that's the good news of these big companies the bad news is deals get hung up or delayed for all kinds of terrible reasons um so so you know I just sort of expect a deal is always going to go slower than you want is most likely going to fall through and even when a deal happens it's gonna break up twice before it happens that is the rule of thumb and so I gotta do I got some great advice from biology when I was doing uh the milk Road sale we had a couple offers and one offer was higher on the money and the other offer was a little lower on them or like you know I would say what was it like 25 lower on money or something like that let's say and he goes okay well you're saying you're you know you want to take the hire deal that makes sense but let me ask you one question and he goes um are both of these deals at the same point meaning have they both been have you been talking about the same amount of time have they done the same amount of diligence so far have you gone back and forth the same amount of times with them I said no no the lower deal we've gone all the way through and this higher deal where it he just came on super you know they came on super fast and and they're really eager and we got the deal done fast I was kind of excited like these guys seem really committed because they're they're they're they're moving really quickly here and he goes okay so you need to apply a discount then because the offer is not 25 higher in fact it's probably half as high once you apply the discount of this deal doesn't doesn't close or falls through you're going to turn down an offer that's solid for an offer that might be a slightly higher but hasn't done the two fall throughs yet and so he's like you need to apply a discount he's like if I'm honest if I'm discounted this it's at least 50 based off of just the normal way that M A deals work this deal will not be the exact deal that closes if it closes at all and that was very Sage advice and it ended up it ended up playing exactly out we tried to go with the higher offer and then sure enough more stuff came out of the woodwork that gave us hesitation and then we were like look this is not as solid as we initially thought or like you know we can't just take the headline numbers we have to take into consideration the ability to close and The credibility to close and um that changed the calculus and the way you get around that is you say the bad things up front I think um as best as you can you say anything that will ruin it as early in the process versus as late in the process this was great advice you gave me you gave me this advice when we're going through the milk Road process you go um here's what you're gonna do because I was going to dinner with them and I said you said here's what you're gonna do you're gonna go there and you're gonna say the following you're gonna say awesome sounds like we're all excited now I'm going to tell you every reason you should not buy this company I'm going to show you every skeleton in the closet now to save ourselves some pain later and if anything here scares you I'm happy to either explain it or if it just doesn't work then you know you we can know now and I was like well that's the opposite of how I would have naturally approached it so so tell me more and then I did exactly that and after the deal went so we did that and then after the deal went through we did a postmortem like hey that's how you know these buyers are smart they're like what could we have done differently in our buy and I said same what could we have done differently in the sale and they were like one of the best things you did was at that dinner when you just told us anything that was bad about the company and you just proactively said here's all the skeletons in our closet or anything that might look ugly to you he goes that built so much trust for us that and he's like from there we we weren't even like we weren't worried about those things because it built so much trust and um it's a very selfish thing you got to do it in a non-manipulative way you can't actually do that and then leave out the real skeleton that that shit's like the opposite of interest um so so that definitely worked and got confirmed but it's a it's a it's a win-win scenario which is you uh get the deal done hopefully faster than than slower and also it makes them trust you which option which is you find out earlier that it's not gonna work and you move on you don't waste three months of time you know dragging it out when you would have you could have known that up front if both has been more honest I agree our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better all right Ben what do you say all right next question is do you have any updates to Sarah's list or any new additions so Sarah's list is this list it's dinner for my my wife because it's at this point it's just its own name but basically we made a list of companies where you could join and have a safe job meaning you're hopefully not going to get laid off like you would at a 10 person startup or go out of business you can still get paid a lot in salary and then still have like maternity paternity leave and have a lot of these perks and benefits and also your stock I think our requirement is could 10x is it 10x so basically so basically it's based off your real real story Sarah joined Facebook she joined Airbnb and she joined them not like super early when they were just still in their you know their apartment trying to figure it out it was like it was it was working this was a business that was already valued at you know let's say a billion dollars or more and um so a multi it was a multi-billion dollar company already you get the fat salary you get the oat milk unlimited oat milk on tap in the in the break room you get the maternity leave you get everything you would want but also you get a stock package that even if you're not even like a AI engineer like let's say you're getting uh 70k a year of stock um if that thing 5x is you could become a millionaire without ever having done the the startup route just in a four-year vest cycle and so and that was your your wife's story it was inspiring to me and to you is like I feel like nobody talks about this but you have to correctly identify the companies that can four or five x in the next four years and uh so we have this list so anyways they want an update on that list uh but there's a YouTube video of the last time we did Sarah's list and we I think we've done it it's done it twice and we actually updated that hey a bunch of the companies we said the first time sure enough I think the average multiple was like you know in exactly the range that we had talked about so now I actually think it's the opposite I'm calling it Sarah's Exodus basically there's a whole bunch of companies that raised money in 2020 2021 um that we're at valuations that worked when the economy was different the stock market was different inflation was different interest rates were different and now those companies it'll take you years to get back to that same valuation if that I said now I think it's Sarah's Exodus which is what are the companies where you just have zombie Equity you are so far underwater on the value of your shares that not only will it not four or five x it's not even good at 1X you won't even get what you think it's worth today and you're going to sit there for four years earning that useless stock and so I actually think you have to make the opposite list what companies raise too much at the wrong time at the wrong valuation that are basically upside down and uh and you basically will go to TechCrunch and you put year when did the bull markets basically say 2020 and 2021 as the peak maybe even a little 2019. and go through TechCrunch and do sort by like year search and anything unicorn yeah yeah and anything that became a unicorn in that era assume that the likelihood is is until proven otherwise right go to go to your CEO and say hey what is the fair amount market value what is the actual fair market value of this company right now um what's a lot what is the last money we raised at how much total money have we raised oh we've raised 600 million dollars okay so we'd have to sell the first 600 million if we sold would just go back to the investors it goes into nothing to employees and figured how much secondary did you take and what type of G wagon do you have yeah you figure out those things did I ever tell you the crazy so you were talking about like going to these big companies and you can get like all you can eat food and [ __ ] like that can I tell you about the craziest thing at Airbnb so if you go to their they have like a cafeteria their whole shtick was that every single thing from the ketchup and mayonnaise to the Coca-Cola to the all the condiments the trail mix everything was made in-house on premises when there was an office all the food was made right there on the spot and it was amazing there was a that's amazing I remember the same thing happened at um what's it called Zynga I went to Zynga I met the head chef at Zynga he ran this Chef was a manager of like 40 people that was The Culinary team the internal culinary team was 40 people at Zynga you show up at Zynga first of all there's like 94 dogs running around insane amount of dogs their logo is a dog and ever there's two dogs for every one employee there secondly 40 percent like a dog fighting pit in the middle like people like when time's gonna lay in games Facebook made the album change yeah there was a little dog fighting ring that brewed up and the second floor uh and I went into the kitchen and I was walking around he's like uh yeah we do our own butchering and he opens this like fridge that was like a 40-foot foot you know like fridge and there was just like one of the dogs there was just cows hanging upside down and I was like you're gonna break that down he's like yes I break that down every morning uh what's this on tap There's No Label he's like that's my homemade kombucha like we make her own we Brew our own drinks we make our own food the veggies that you see that mushroom it grows on the roof here and then uh during the tour I got a little hungry reached into the pocket had some Cheez-Its I opened up the bag dude they heard the crinkling of a of a packaged good in that kitchen the whole kitchen like it was like I said bomb on a plane dude I was like I'm so sorry I don't know how this got here I don't know what this is put this in my pocket do they still have it you think of course I don't now but although the building dude the whole building got sold buildings sold for more than the company was worth at the time I think if you Google Zynga building they owned this building in San Francisco and I think they sold it for 250 million dollars at the time when the market cap of the company was 200 million dollars yeah it was either that or more profit than they've ever generated it was one of those two and yeah now it's owned by uh take two who makes Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K they own Zynga now yeah I like those those Chef companies so like Sarah's list I I think you got to go get get yourself dating somebody who works at a tech company with all you can eat food what are you doing what's the point no perks bro yeah what are the attributes of this relationship you know what I mean you need to bring some attributes you better be uh you know the like Starving Artists extra hot or you have a company I've seen how many Clif bars I was like a like I was the Pablo Escobar of smuggling Clif bars out of tech companies for like a three-year period I had free prosciutto for a year I used to like I used to I used to call it I didn't even know what it was I was like find this proscotto in all the land dude I use a center to work with Tupperware containers make sure you stay till seven why are you home so early I know in that Facebook dinner didn't start until 5 30. it takes you an hour to get home where's my Pursuit uh Ben what do you saying what do we got do you have any Frameworks for maintaining healthy friendships especially when you're separated by distance mine's simple I'm in the phase of life right now I've got one simple phrase when it comes to friends No New Friends if you're in you're in it's a mental problem for you yeah say no to everything if you and you in if you ain't you ain't what's yours yeah I'm the same I suck at this uh I apologize to my friends I I'm a shitty friend to them they know it I I do feel bad about it uh but you can only try to be great at so many things at once and okay I got kids so what are you still picking which thing you're gonna be great at which one's you gonna be great dad try to make a bunch of money and then try to get into incredible shape those are the things I've prioritized right now and so uh you know friends had to take a little bit of a hit there all right you loser what do you say Ben what do we got if you were to start a business based on the quirkiest or most ridiculous idea that you've ever had what would it be and why yours is actually good Sean yeah did you have an answer for this no because I'm not like that quirky of a person say yours the IQ test is actually a good idea uh all right so I so I remember I met a guy who would sell Stars like literally like a star in the solar system for 25 he would name it after you and I think he would just name it in his own database and then there then I saw this there's this guy who's just been crushing on Tick Tock I don't know if you've seen these Tick Tock ads where you he will they own a small piece of land in like Dublin or something or something like that and you will officially be knighted as a sir uh like you'll get official title as sir and you will own a piece like a plant on this land we got one foot by one foot you know like plot of land um so when I saw things like that you know there's really two reactions there's most people who I roll and say this is what's wrong with the world and then there's me who's like man what's wrong with me why haven't I done this and uh that's kind of where I'm at so I would love to just take time to do some of these stupid things like I want to be the pet rock guy or like the Million Dollar Homepage guy I think that would just be a lot of fun as a challenge I have an idea which is uh I want to create a new IQ test because like who doesn't want to seem like they have high you know like a high IQ so I think you can build like a d2c IQ test that people would pay to see how how they score or just go all in on something super woo-woo like uh horoscopes crystals something like that I actually launched a d2c Crystal Brand like an e-commerce brand for a month and um now that I look back now that I know what actually how e-commerce works that brand was actually working I was just too big of a noob to even understand like is this good why is it good because people can't return it no no I just mean like it was working like I was acquiring customers at a good rate like the I mean all e-commerce is basically CAC for cell TV it's just what's the lifetime value of a customer the LTV compared to the cat the cost of acquiring that customer and uh and actually my my LTV attack was actually good I just didn't really understand it enough at the time I didn't trust it enough at the time but my first Ecom Biz before the one I made was a crystal one like in my garage right now I have like 4 000 rose quartz coasters still just because I didn't sell again I didn't move that inventory I shut it down how much did it cost for you to buy and to sell uh oh dude these are very cheap to buy like uh you know the gross margins are like 75 80 so you know you buy it for two bucks you sell for ten it's just like round math right but like in reality you're selling it for 24 and you're buying it for whatever that math turns out to dude that's wild but like also you don't want to be a fraud which hey if you're selling crystals I mean fraud is in the eye of the believer as I say and uh there are a lot of people who believe that crystals are good and help them uh like the reason I had this I got one of them was I but I'll sell it to him I went and I read I opened up a magazine like you know Cosmo or one of these magazines I was like okay I'm gonna go look outside of my normal box for new ideas so I went opened up like Cosmo and there's like this two two-page spread about crystals and it was basically like Adele will not go on stage until she like uses her rose quartz crystal thing Kim Kardashian after she got mugged for her four million dollar uh diamond ring I don't know if you remember this she claims that crystals are one of the like only things that kept her anxiety down and soothed her and she keeps one in her bag at all times Gwyneth Paltrow from goop I mean obviously huge into crystals do I even need to explain uh so there was like this huge number of like celebrities influencers well and there's the Adam Sandler movie with Kevin Garnett where he like buys that you know million dollar black Christmas that's right yeah that's right that came out late after I'd done that but but yeah basically saw I was like oh if if Kardashian Adele and like whatever Jennifer Aniston or whoever these people are like if they're all into crystals like trust me you know the perfect e-commerce customer a woman in the midwest is going to buy this stuff and it was actually some chick named Kinsey yeah so you know Kinsey in Idaho she wants to buy the [ __ ] out of your rocks yeah like if you have if you have like a sign that says simplify or I love us you're you're gonna be one of my customers um all right Ben what do you say where are we at all right that one was mostly for Sean this one is mostly for Sam which is what were the first five big boy moves you made at Hampton the first thing I did by the way bed you got to say these guys names so people who asked these questions just Joe Watkins yeah Joe Joe Watkins he asked uh about Hampton um I don't know about the first five but uh I didn't buy a domain name it was just Hampton at hampton.squarespace.com and I sent the link to a bunch of friends and then they sent to a handful of other friends and then I just reached out to tons of people people would sign up on that page which it was just a type form and then I called every single person and I interviewed them and and me and Joe Joe did like the back end stuff but I did the front end stuff of like calling all the potential customers and I must have interviewed a hundred to 200 people and uh I was the one that sold and got us the first million dollars of sales and so I called it uh I told I would joke and tell Sean my calendar looked like a zebra it was just like constant Stripes of like these 30 minute meetings with the 10 minute break 30 minute meetings ten minute break and I did hundreds of them and I got us to a million dollars um that's a good question probably just laid on the couch and think I hate this and I'm so excited when it'll be over one day um like I mean it's really hard work it's very challenging um and then another big thing I did was I hired a CEO because very early on I thought this thing is going to be bigger than I'm this thing will be uh exceed my personal capabilities and skill sets very soon so I should hire a CEO but getting the first million dollars in sales is what I did for like two months I would say the other thing you did is you uh you nailed the brand and the name um which is just art that's talent but I think that you know a name won't break you but it can make you I think Hampton is a perfect name because you borrowed The Prestige of the actual Hamptons and you uh hired an agency to do like a nice job with The Branding or whatever uh so I think that was also that agency I hired was fifteen thousand dollars and basically what I did was I sent them a whole bunch of really old Rolex ads and I also said my favorite color is British racing green because because that's like I I love that color it's like a lot of old favorite things also no it's a British racing I love like I've had motorcycles in that color I have all types of like uh Toys in that color I like that color I go make it look like an old Rolex ad and make it and use British racing green and that's kind of how it came to be and fifteen thousand dollars for you to spend fifteen thousand dollars like gift a lot of people a sense of like is that just nothing for you are you just like let's just say this you sweat that last Saturday I drove 20 minutes to return a spatula to Target for seven dollars make sure there's not a second one stuck on there that's hilarious um all right what do we got all right next up is uh this is from Josh Redd who wants to know what are the three most common small boy moves that you see all right so we have this phrase no no small boy stuff okay what what is small boy stuff the first rule obviously is if you think it might be small little stuff it is but besides that I would say there's the the three big ones the three big buckets are the three W's waiting worrying and wanting anytime you find yourself waiting to do something that you actually want to do that's a small boy move that's a small boy mentality you're focused on the wrong things uh worrying same way worrying hasn't done anyone a lot a lot of good you got to know how to do worry I think Sam's worried time is a fantastic framework for that so go go look up Sam worry time um and wanting wanting meaning like wanting what other people have uh and really like uh people are their happiest when they're grateful meaning they want what they have versus um versus you know wanting what they don't have um and so I think that if you find yourself in a state of mind you don't want to be in and that small boy state of mind it's because you're probably waiting to do the thing you actually want to do uh you're worrying about something that might might happen that might be bad or you're wanting something that you don't have that other people have you're being bitter you're being jealous or or so on and so forth so to me the three W's kind of capture most of the things that are small boy activities have you ever heard of this phrase this is we're gonna get a little Sigmund Freud on your ass uh external Locust of control do you know what that means I have heard this phrase many times and I never have any idea what this means Locus is a bug that's where I started and uh you tell me where to go from there yeah you're totally wrong um but uh so in internal locus of control means that uh well let's say an external locus of control meaning is means the way that you feel and the position that you are in your life it's because of everyone else so if you have an external locus of control you think I am in a bad mood because the traffic is bad and it's their fault or I am um I'm poor because um the the government won't help me or everyone's out to get me internal is the opposite which is I control how I feel and what I do and where I am in life and so I think that there's a direct correlation between like um like what I consider like a small boy thing of that internal versus external locus of control so anything that is when you say I am the way I am because I choose to be or I I put myself in this position I think oftentimes that's uh when you're more on that Spectrum I think it's better than when you are when you're focused on external so anything where it's like I have to wait until uh this is ready or or I have to um please these types of people or whatever that's typically I think a loser mentality yeah 100 I I was actually telling somebody this yesterday and uh I was like where where do you think the power lives in this scenario let's say there's a plant that's not growing um where where where's the problem and you know what do you suspect the problem is they're like well I mean it could be the soil all right so soil so it's the environment that's the reason that uh that's a plant sacrament no no maybe it was just a bad seed oh so it was kind of like the genetics of of the seed that that you would blame for for the outcome no no it's just not getting enough sunlight because there's other plants blocking it oh so it's others it's competitors that are taking the finite resource that you you can't have what what is it what is it that where is where is the problem and uh and the answer is really there is no problem you are the plant just [ __ ] grow like don't don't blame anything don't don't feel lack in any one of those areas um like you want to be ultimately you want to be the plant that can grow in any any one of those any under any conditions from any seed in any soil with any with any sunlight in any competition and so um what I find is that I get along least with people who really like over index on they always blame the soil it's always the it's always this the city's fault it's always the school's fault it's always the environment's fault or people who oh it's genetics I'm fixed it is the way it is all right or oh it's the competition they're always taking my things right it's like those are the people that get along with the least and even in myself when I find myself thinking that way I get along with myself the least I hate myself the most when I think that way see you you didn't know what it meant but you you came to the same conclusion that you know hundreds and of years worth of psychologists it took them to figure it out all the time thousands of years of wisdom I just sort of on an afternoon to just come up with a better version myself and then I then I find the words to describe it and use the better analogy uh all right Ben what do you say where are we at all right we got an emotional one ladies and gentlemen grab your tissues uh Sam what is in your opinion the greatest quality that Sean hasn't Sean same question what is the greatest quality of the Sam has that's a question from Griffin Humphrey Griffin good question Sean's greatest quality if it is uh I feel like I don't want to look you in the Island right now it just closed his eyes should I close my eyes too it's like it's like there's a ton of ways that I can take this analogy you're sitting at a table and somebody puts their palms out like this and then you're supposed to put your hands in there yeah yeah uh that's weird you don't look people in the eye when you're doing that just like complimenting each other and go to the bathroom I contacted it it doesn't exist yeah we need to sit side by side there we go yeah just the conversation when you ever noticed when you go to the bathroom with someone even if you're walking to the bathroom together as soon as the fly goes down the conversation stops yeah the flying or zippers like the off button and then you shake and you go back and the Fly goes up up right back to the conversations that's what this is like uh Sean best uh attribute is that his attitude is always uh positive so I don't think I've ever been able to not that I've done it on purpose but he's I've never gotten them rattled and he's very very very pleasant I think almost 100 of the time I've never seen them get upset about stuff and that is actually frustrating about him is that he doesn't get frustrated sometimes but at the same time I would rather have that because uh I'm fairly emotional and I get frustrated easily he never gets frustrated um and so I would say that's his uh best characteristic internal locus of control baby yeah you you control your mindset yeah the locus is inside of you all the time it never goes outside of you you you you it's in you so I would say that's easily your best attribute is the ability to stay calm and happy no matter what mind for you would be intensity I think you do a great job cranking the knob up whenever you are into something I admire that and when I look at all the things that I admire about you like the way you're self-actualized in terms of Fitness or the way you built the hustle or the way you're building Hampton right now um the common denominator is the level of intensity you bring to it so um I don't think there's really anything else like it's not like I'm like oh you know the reason saying again it's that internal locus of control it's not like I'm like Sam's Sam got lucky because of this or he's got people helping him and that's why he's winning or he's just born with some talents that others don't have it's like I think you just have a better job at cranking the intensity to 12 when it's time to if you're like I'm gonna get in shape you're like great inject my butt with trt build a home gym hire hire a personal trainer hire a coach buy the best equipment do the wake up every day do the program when I'm doing the workout I'm pushing myself to my actual Max and then I'm doing this I'm measuring everything I'm posting publicly so I'm ashamed if I don't do it you go the full way and it's like the same thing with Hampton I told you this like I had had a very similar idea for a peer group thing years ago I kind of dabbled with it tried it created one it was actually going pretty well but I was like I have Shine the object over here got kind of bored decided didn't really think it was the right thing didn't really see the big picture to see you take that same idea and do it at level 12 intensity is such a gift for me because it's like I get to see a without intensity approach to the same idea and a with intensity approach to the same idea and it just shows what the difference is and then like that is the difference and so to me that and I also wrote Sam's got a code and he lives by it I think you're a lot more uh honorable uh than than most and that definitely than me and so I kind of admire that too what code I I don't I don't view myself as having a code necessarily do you feel like when you give someone your word that it's done yeah it's for life do you feel like that if someone's your friend they should fight for you and die for you in any small slight is a like like a a loyal stab to the heart I feel like if we're in public and you get in a fight with someone and you throw a punch even though it's your fault yeah the the the person it is over and then afterwards I'll be like you're an idiot that was really inappropriate but yeah yeah I feel I I disagree privately publicly like we we die together yeah I'm just showing up on time like I really you have a code I don't even agree with your whole code I think you're crazy with something when you go chase down people that broke in because you're like no you broke in now we fight we duel I'm like that's stupid Sam you should not do that or you're like this guy's trying to charge me an extra hundred dollars because of whatever no we we're taking him to Petty court and I'm like Sam it's not worth it man let it go so I disagree with your code but I love that you have a code because I don't think I really have a code to live by all right what do we got all right really quick let me just tell you guys the last questions and you say what what you want to do what you don't so we got uh creatorpreneurs you're paying attention to we got pros and cons of building in public let's do creative one really quick yeah who are the creative crater producers that's kind of a weird one Creator preneurs you are paying attention to and why I like Isaac French because someone who's like creating content but they're also an entrepreneur they're building a business around their podcast or their YouTube or their Twitter whatever that's what it is I like Isaac French I hung out with him and I was like why are you so purposeful with everything you do he goes That's just part of our religion we feel that like we just have to be excellent and that's how we show that God's Great and I was like oh okay so like you're I'm not gonna Panic it's that yeah yeah I like Jasmine star they're just she's a woman who has a uh she's got a software company I've met her through Hampton and whenever I hang out with her I feel like uh I'm gonna cry like she's so intense um and she's like she describes herself as like a Latino woman from like I think East L.A and she's like so like I'm gonna like Crush all these Tech nerds and I love that attitude um and I like Jason yanowicz and Austin Reef Jason yanowitz ruins blackworks a crypto company that just raised some money I would never bet against them and then Austin Reef as I've got no Austin Reef the founder of morning Brew do you agree with me that guy's a straight Stone Cold killer I would never bet against us he's really impressive and actually my opinion of morning Brew because I was friends with you so same you know the Loyalty test I was friends with you Therefore your enemies are my enemies and when you were doing the hustle I was like okay so who are the other newsletters those are my enemies someone go look up their Founders and they're on my [ __ ] list and now Austin is a friend and I actually really think that guy's awesome and he's super clever and um there's a bunch of people that are like successful but stupid he's not one of them he's smart he is not he's he's he's real um so he's you know I give him my and he's young I always forget this I think he's only 27 still um I think he'll have north of 100 million dollars before he's 30 years old is my guess and he's got a mean Lefty hook shot all right so um my Creator preneurs I'm looking at so I try to look at people that are in different bubbles because I think if I just look at other business content creator entrepreneur people I'll become the the lame the lame Twitter thread boy copycat wannabe [ __ ] boy that's you know what I tell myself in my head so where do I go look instead uh I look at creators in other categories so I'll give you a quick example we had uh Danny Austin on the Pod recently and actually a bunch of people who were listening to it I saw a bunch of like feedback that was like oh this episode wasn't for me Instagram influencer who cares and I was like you guys are missing the point like um yeah she's way more sophisticated yeah I was like uh the gold there was a good there was golden nuggets there so first I subscribed to her content because when you look at what Mommy influencers on Instagram do it's a whole different style of content that you can kind of Steal ideas from and get inspiration from that's the first thing the second thing was every other mom influencer created like uh my fashion brand is here buy my dresses for the summer buy my swimsuits but whatever same same same same same merch and fashion apparel she picked an incredible business which is this uh scalpcare thing that was perfectly aligned with her story of why she's famous in the first place and why people connect with her it's this high margin thing with only a couple of skus doesn't have any of the headaches of fashion it's a beautiful business and it's crushing doesn't you know 40 million dollars last year in Revenue without even you know pretty significant without even like a lot of AD spend and so to me there was a nugget of gold which is what happens when you align the perfect project selection like that's an example of perfect project selection paired with awesome content creator what what could that business sell for that should be a multi-hundred million dollar business like that should be a 250 million dollar business if they just carry on um that is a it's perfect project selection I couldn't admire it more perfectly aligned with her and it's a beautiful business on its own all right uh others um that are more in our Niche so pomp I'm inspired by his level of output uh the guy's a machine I'm super weak and inconsistent with output and he is super regimented like I think he's ex-military too so like he is super like regimented with with output and I'm also interested in how he's like redefining himself he's rebranding himself outside of Bitcoin right now and that's something cool to watch so I want to see what he does and what works what doesn't there um Tim Ferriss also very different than me he's Ultra thoughtful about his brand which is the opposite of me like he's measured he's thoughtful he cites his sources he is like he does not say yes to a lot of things he's very picky and choosy he's the opposite of me in every way so I like to see what he does because I want to like you know I want to learn through learn from people with different play Styles and then Steve Bartlett same thing he's high style so everything Steve Bartlett does is cool I buy a hat he buys a hat mine looks shitty his looks awesome uh you know he well he's also like a 6-1 like pretty ripped looking black guy I mean of course he looks awesome everything he does the way he talks is in style the way his his party's British uh trailers are done in style his live podcast show he's got a gospel choir singing as he's talking or some [ __ ] like that I even know I don't even understand it but I just know that what this guy does he does his style I think there's very few people just like I think there's very few people in business who are funny I think there's very few people in business that have style and so I kind of I'm looking and watching what they're doing and picking little pieces from their game dude I always look at Steve McQueen you know who Steve McQueen is he's like this actor that he's dead now but he called him like the king of cool and I like look at clothes that of he wore and then everyone wants to dress like him and then you see like on Reddit someone's like oh I tried I bought the Steve McQueen outfit and you look at them and you're like oh you look like you look like store brand Steve McQueen like you know like that ain't good sometimes people just look like I'll look at Brad Pitt and I'll look at his clothes and then I like see people try to dress like him I'm like dude you just don't got it you know what I mean like no matter what I do I will never you're just better looking than me you just you got you got the bod that's sometimes that's how I still feel about some of these guys and I guess I'll put Steve in the category when you're when you got that bod and you got that face you're that tall you know you're gonna look good no matter what fair enough here's a really quick one someone said they asked a different question but I'm going to phrase it they asked one question but it phrase it differently which is who do you want to live with Gary vaynerchuk Elon Musk and Mr Beast and I wanted to say something I think they all would be horrible to live with those all three of those guys would be the worst roommates only Elon because he'll just never be there actually that's the best for me the guy who's just got the empty room and he actually gotta you're you're living in a double but it's all yours like that that's that's actually a pretty good good deal I've lived with a handful of Highly Successful People and I've like hung out with them I hate going to their house their Helms are usually a wreck I hate it camera around in this office right now like people would unsubscribe the gentleman agreement would be over people will be like I never want to hear from this guy again if somebody lives like this like think of your worst episode of Hoarders that's currently what my office looks like it's it's an absolute mess that's disgusting to me how do you live that way I just do bro I just do I don't know I I don't know how I live with myself like this this is crazy I don't want to be my own room your your room's like a mullet man it looks great like from this angle but you got all this party nonsense in the back well after I record this I just leave this room and so I never come back and clean it I can't stand that that's a filth to me I would not I could not be around that um is that it are we done Ben did we do it just one more I want to ask one more all right because why not Kevin Newman asked who are the three folks he does m33 but who are the people that are having the most fun I love this question I think about it all the time because you could ask like who's the most successful who's the smartest who's the most popular I'm interested in having a lot of fun with my life I only have so much time on this little planet I want to have fun with it I want to enjoy it and so I think this is a great question to ask I got a couple answers but I would be really curious to hear yours I think yours would be very different than than mine does anybody come to mine off top of your head Rob Dyrdek and say a few more words about that uh Rob Dyrdek when I think of what I want my life to be it's basically to have a Fantasy Factory so Rob Dyrdek um by the way he talked a lot about his wife not only is she does she seem awesome former Playmate model not only does she seem awesome she looks awesome yeah yeah no Rob Dyrdek he um I think he has a ton of fun and I think that he I think he views I like people who view business a little bit like an art instead of like a McKinsey like spreadsheet dork and I think that this is his art this is how he expresses himself and I think he has a shitload of fun and the way that he's broke all he had an episode on Fantasy Factory where he like broke nine World Records or something like that just because I love people who do just dumb stuff just because it seems fun so I think Rob Dyrdek is up there you have uh Joe Rogan he seems like he's living his life all right what are the five things you you most enjoy doing he's like I love comedy love UFC I love talking to smart people and learning new [ __ ] um I love hunting you know and then he's just like cool that's my life it built he integrated his his career his life and his friends to be the same thing like his friends are other Comedians and um and then it's like and and people in the UFC his career is like oh well I'll just be the top broadcaster in the UFC the top podcaster and then I'll be one of the top 20 comedians like that sounds great like they'll make a bunch of money and I'll get to do my art like that sounds fun and then any a Drew boundaries he's like um yeah I love the UFC but I'm not traveling to like Senegal for this pay-per-view like I only do the ones like within a two-hour flight of me or that's it like that's my rule and I'm just gonna do that and I'm okay with not doing the rest and I love that you said he's yeah he's not divorced it seems like he's got his head on straight like I really think he's having a lot of fun I admire that Bill Simmons is kind of the same way he's basically that for sports and then my uncle Vinnie I got an uncle Vinnie who's literally his nickname that was given to him was Smiley so he signs all his signatures Vinnie quote Smiley um and he's just or he'll just sign it smiley and like this one definitely just been in the banks like uh sir I don't think you could do that he's I don't know 70 something years old and if you hear him he's like I'm getting younger every day he's like I'm so excited he wakes up at four in the morning with no alarm because he's so excited about the day and like even even though the things he was he's doing like he's like I'm so excited I'm doing this webinar about multi-family real estate right now it's like it's not what I would enjoy doing and it's not even something that to the outside sounds super glamorous but the point is he is he is excited about it he is having the most fun in his life like he he wears what he wants he dresses the way he wants he talks the way he wants he does what he wants with his time he travels the way he wants it and I just feel like uh that guy his Joy meter is like you know permanently stuck on on like Max and so I kind of admire that because with Joe Rogan it's easy to say man yeah if I if I also had the best podcast and the UFC and all these hobbies and great friends like yeah I would be having a lot of fun too and my Uncle Vinnie's a great example because he doesn't have anything that like is the he doesn't have a lifestyle that's like you know some celebrity or something like that and he's having all the fun like now and I think that's great because he's not waiting to achieve all this [ __ ] to have fun he's having it now what type of Indian guy has the name of Vinnie is that are those real names and then he went Vinnie to like make it more like acceptable in America when he moved here and then they just were like bro this guy's never stopped smiling so his whole company just called him Smiley and then you know that was like that was the whole thing we we name one time in Austin we had this really bad office that had rats and we Nick and we had them and we nicknamed Vinnie and Vinnie was an Italian guy like and they would come in at night like oh hey the fat guy left us some cheese and that was the name of our office rat was viddy Eddie video from New York and uh that's what I think if you have it named an office ratter Mouse okay you haven't grinded have you lived you're not on that right um all right q a this is the easiest stuff ever to talk about so maybe we should just do this every time now I know why Gary vaynerchuk did that the whole show was asking garyvee right all you have to do is just like answer dumb questions yeah this was fun we should do more um all right that's the pod [Music] thank you [Music]

well how does it feel to be wealthy now after after grinding after this for so long it's better than before it is it is definitely not [Music] Doug I want to give you an intro because I've been a fan of yours forever and I in 2019 or 2020 when our podcast was much smaller I told Sean about you I go this guy Doug is very fascinating I think he should launch like some type of like car website I'm not sure then you did and then we talked about it and I'm like I'm pretty sure this is going to be huge and so I want to take a little bit I want to take like one percent you know I helped you succeed I get a little bit of credit because I I picked you you're my you're my horse and I bet you know there's something real I'm sure we'll discuss this but there's something real about that like I tell all my friends now in this space like you need to start businesses like this will not last forever you need to start businesses and I think smart people who learn the business World kind of realize that and you were my you are my guy and so for the audience who don't know um so Doug tomorrow has a uh it started as a you're just a YouTuber I guess I mean you're originally a journalist for a bunch of different websites where you would write these funny quirky blogs then you parlayed that into a YouTube channel that I think now has like four million subscribers but the reason why you're huge and lovable is for a few different reasons one you dress really funny so like you'll wear like khaki shorts like from the early 2000s with like a red Polo shirt and then your white undershirt will be longer than the sleeves of your polo shirt so it's like hanging out on the sleeves and like you just dressed like horribly even though your videos each get like two or three million views like you're on uh Jay Leno's um pod uh or you're on Jay Leno's YouTube like a few days ago and you're wearing Saucony like running shoes I'm like what are you doing dude well Jimmy Jane is not like Jay's dressing up you know so I I feel like I I there's not a high bar there anyway you're just like you're very likable because of the way you dress you're very funny you're very um quirky because that's one of your things you talk about the quirks of its cars you're very quirky you're very relatable and so you've grown this YouTube channel to like four million subscribers you launched this company called cars and bids which is like almost like eBay but for different types of cars cars enthusiasts so cars from the 80s 90s and early 2000s and then recently you sold the majority of the business the churning group for around 40 million dollars I believe when it was only like two or three years old um yeah I've bought cars from the website so anyway I'm a big fan well thank you I appreciate that thank you for having me I am I just listened to so I just bought a car a couple months ago three three four months ago and uh it was your YouTube video that put me over the edge so I bought a Cadillac I bought an Escalade and I was looking for a review your review has 1.7 million views I was like okay this got to be the best one uh like Sam said uh I was surprised because I I'm not a car guy at all uh and also I had never seen your stuff I had only heard Sam talk about you on the podcast so I actually didn't put two two together that oh that's the same guy that Sam's been talking about every time I watched the video and I was like I don't know why I trust this guy uh what's the uh what's the key to uh to being the sort of likable trustworthy guy is that just who you are did you did you play anything up in your YouTube videos is there is there any strategy here or is it all just uh that's just who you were no that's a good question and it the answer is there is remarkably little strategy um I just it in fact if you go and watch the videos from before I had a lot of subscribers they're pretty much the same so it's not like you know it's not like I knew what the hell I was doing when I had 200 000 subscribers it's not like I knew where this was gonna go um but I really think I think one of the reasons though that I kind of did it this way is that uh a lot of people come to me and they're like I'm gonna make the best car videos with 4K drones and high quality Sound and Music and all this stuff and I just wanted to like kind of show people like you actually can do this as long as the content is good you can just do this like you can just do it in your garage you're just using an iPhone right basically the shots where I'm like in them there's a it's a cam it's a Sony 4K camcorder which isn't cheap but it's also not like a crazy camera and then an iPhone is yeah half the video is done and like you're editing if I remember correctly up until recently like until the startup cars and bids you're editing them and like they're not like good editing but in a way that makes it awesome like you know what I mean like it's a very it's it's really funny it's it's it's quirky yeah it's simple my goal was just always to like overload people with info and like cool stuff about the cars and they could decide if they decided that hey this this quality is not good enough then they could go find somebody else but like I always thought that I had the most info like the most like it like that when you bought that Escalade like seeing how all that stuff works how it's how it's going to fit together sitting inside it so many other people focus so much on like Driving Experience there they do 45 40 like like 20 minute video and and 18 of the minutes are oh but here's how it goes through the corners and I was just like you know like let's show people the little ins and outs of the car they are actually gonna buy and I think that that's like proved to be quite useful and you also have this thing at the end I don't know if you saw this Sean but like I watch every every single one of his videos and he has this thing at the end called the Doug score and if and you kind of like by the way it seems like I'm like insulting you constantly but in reality I've been like love with you but yeah it's just I don't I get what you're saying like yeah the the quality was never the gold the gold was always like the quality of content you know well what I'm saying with you you have this thing called the Doug score which like I base my buying decisions off of like I've bought a bunch of cars probably three or four cars off your like you've driven you know hundreds of thousands of dollars of value like to whoever I bought my car from and you have this thing called the Doug score at the end of every video and I went and Googled and tried to find it and you could barely find it it's like on a Google sheet and you have to click file make a copy so I could sort it because I'm trying to sort it I'm like you know what I mean I'm like I want because you have two categories you have the weekend category which is uh you know like a dad who wants to have fun it's like McLarens and [ __ ] like that and then you have um a family or a daily category which is just like what's good for daily whatever and some days I'm like you know maybe I'm in the mood to buy like a a fast car like let's go let's sort by speed in the category uh right um weekend yeah and but I gotta like go to Excel and I've got to like do like a like a like a like a row freeze like it's so complicated why don't you make this more like robust it's a really this database could be a business in itself I know I agree I should do more with it to be fair the Doug score came out in like mid 17 and for the first two years it wasn't really all that valuable because I didn't really have that many cars in it and so like late 19 it starts to become pretty valuable and now there's got to be like a thousand data points in there but what happened was I launched cars and bids I just priorities had to kind of take shape and yeah I probably should do more with that because I think it's valuable also and I think the really valuable thing would be able to be to sort by like type of car like if you want a fast wagon put up all the fast wagons and then you can just have that but that's something that that you could do at home I've decided I've decided I'm going to just do the videos inspect I'm a big fan of specialization and so I decided I'm gonna do the videos and we're gonna let other people and sometimes people email me they're like I just did this great Dana project with all the dub scored data here it is and I look at it and it's really cool and it's like I should be doing that but I'm not at what point did you uh so the the show I mean your channel has it been growing very steadily and was it making enough income to live off of throughout uh his existence yeah so I launched the channel late 13 um but the really big kind of turning point for the channel was in late 16 I flipped to two videos a week um and I don't know that necessarily that is the Turning Point anymore for a YouTube channel but in 16 it had a big effect and um and almost right away after doing that yes it became enough money to listen that I I did that I made that switch in August of 16 and in December of 16 I made 20 grand and I was like oh my God like this is a thing I didn't know what I didn't know was Christmas the ad revenue is way higher at Christmas time and so in January I made like eight grand and I was like oh well I guess maybe this isn't a thing I kind of know what's going on but that was one of the things I learned throughout and so yeah like pretty quickly it it kind of grew at that point to become something I could live off and so when you were made that switch you're like all right I'm gonna start doing two videos a week is it because you had heard of the algorithm likes that or you just happened to do it and saw a bump what was the what was the reason because I always wonder with people who get started with content um like in retrospect in hindsight it always makes sense it's like oh of course people are gonna want to see a car before they kind of buy it or just like sit from the comfort of their home like get to see a review of a car if that makes sense uh YouTube's the biggest video platform so whoever does it on YouTube is gonna benefit there's gonna be lots of search volume so they'll probably get views just by assert by the search of the name of the car and um right yeah that video is probably gonna charge a premium or be worth a premium or maybe make money an affiliate or something I don't know exactly what it is but I can see how to make money it all makes sense at hindsight at the time in 2013 when you start doing this did you think there's a business here and how did you get those initial views how did you get the initial momentum was it because of your following as a writer or was it separate yeah that's exactly what happened and I actually got really lucky you know I I never ever tell people to like work for um like promotional value like a lot of times businesses will be like oh instead of paying you in money I'll pay you in you know like exposure and I think that's BS but it actually worked for me I I wrote for Jalopnik which at the time was a Gawker blog and was an incredibly popular one it was the most popular car blog on the Internet by far and um I started inserting my videos into those articles and that drove the Articles drove people to the videos which then started to put me in the algorithm which then started to get me subscribers and Joel I think was paying me I sort of got 25 an article which was not real money but like the value was in the number of people coming over to my YouTube I didn't know that at the time but in the years in the later years as as 2013 became 2015 it became clear to me like I think I'm actually a YouTuber and not a writer anymore like I think this is a reality now and so when I decided to move to two a week what happened was I left jalopic start a blog with AutoTrader with Cox Automotive at AutoTrader and in order to promote that blog I decided I would be shooting more videos and within eight weeks I was I was the video content was suddenly earning getting way more views and way more Revenue than the than the writing content and thankfully the video channel was your own right the video channel was your own even though these were guest blogs on other people's platforms yeah the agreement with AutoTrader was that I would uh you know promote on my YouTube channel these this blog that we had started and so I didn't realize that you've been doing this since 2013. I thought that I'd was like an OG by like watching since like 17 um like so I mean you've been grinding at this first yeah but you pretty much are because initially I I made videos with my my own cars and those just never got as much traction and what the big switch in 17 was I switched to doing reviews of cars and suddenly it was a lot less war because I didn't have to buy cars and then take on that personal Financial Risk I would just like show up at a dude's house film his car and then peace out and that was a video and there was like no that didn't cost me anything except like the gas to get there and so that was that was a big change it also allowed me to do more videos because you can just do more videos that way as opposed to your own cars you have to kind of think up a new topic every week which isn't always easy and so in 17 I think that's when things really started to like really take off when I started to do like car reviews and especially new car reviews that's what I realized like okay that's where the money is is and that's where the audience is but you make jokes sometimes where you're like um like for example I watched your def I I'm I'm thinking about buying a Defender a new one and I like watched your video on it and you might make little jokes you're like one day what I'm able to afford blank I'll get it and I'm like seeing your videos I'm like man I think you could I bet you're making like you know at least low digit Millions per year without cars and bids I have to imagine this was significantly more lucrative than you like the vibe that you would joke about sort of but on the videos but the thing that's I think important for people to understand there's there's two components number one is you never know when it's gonna end and so like I yeah I was making a lot of money but you never know when suddenly a competitor shows up and it can happen in a couple of months and suddenly you're now third fourth fifth in Search and things are slowing down and so you never really know like what that day is and so unlike maybe an attorney or a doctor where you have these jobs you make a lot of money less than I was but you have a lot more job security over long term for me it was like yeah I have a lot of money but I saved so much of it because I was always just terrified that you know I never knew exactly what was gonna what was gonna happen What amount of money did you feel like you kind of like you made it or you looked at the number and you were like I can't believe this is mine I have this uh where where was the milestone for you that it was kind of like your holy [ __ ] moment uh not until we closed the deal with uh would turn in believe it or not I I I I I just never earning on a on an annual or a monthly or a weekly basis like is just never to me like that's just there's always of some some fear in that you know like you're always just a little worried that the tap is gonna turn off and so there was never a moment where I felt comfortable like spending or splurging on something which Sam goes back to your point like yeah there were times when I said if I could afford this I would buy it but like I probably could have afforded it but could I have afforded it and then my business and then YouTube slows down and then I have to deal with the depreciation of it like a new Lambo would be cool right but if that loses 200 Grand in the first two years I couldn't mentally justify that same with the new AMG wagon I've always wanted one but there were 150 000 when they were new well was I comfortable losing 50 Grand in a year mentally no because I was always afraid the tap might turn off you know at the YouTube channel did you and when originally when you launched cars and bids I was a big fan of bring a trailer um bring a trailer is similar to you uh different different audience but I think I heard rumors that when they sold it was like 300 million dollars and when you go to bring your trailer.com it looks just like a blog like it's a very like it doesn't look like a sophisticated business when in reality it is and when you launched I was like yeah this is awesome but of course we'll do a lot of like critics were like well but this this thing already exists and so like what Insight did you have to go down this path and also who did you partner with early on because I don't think that you're a tech person right no no not at all as you can see from my video editing and you heavy usage of iMovie um no uh yeah bring a trailer is it does exist and they're huge and they were huge then and they're even Huger now um and that was the hurdle what Insight did we have none what were we thinking in retrospect I honestly Wonder like what what was going through our minds thinking we could compete with them the only Insight we had was that we had heard I love bring a trailer and I think they run a great business and they have some great cars and I have sold cars on there and whatever but I we had heard from that there was some dissatisfaction I think at the end of the day bring a trailer had gotten so massive that like stuff was taking a long time to get listed there were like you said the quality of the it's a WordPress blog ultimately it had caught it caused people some issues you know in sellers and buyers and the functionality of it everything and we kind of thought to ourselves hey we can do this in our minds better and we can make it modern and so one of the big things that was our Focus was doing cars just from the 1980s and up like more modern era cars we we thought hey if we come with a modern website and focus on a modern audience maybe we can kind of exist in a sort of a different space than bring a trailer where it's like more Millennial younger people focused on these types of cars and I think that that has largely teased out although now we're starting to kind of eat some of the bringing trailer Cars we just posted a Lamborghini Countach on the site today like we're going down that road a little bit more more and who did you partner with early on I mean when I was doing research for the original pod I remember I went to the person's LinkedIn I was like I gotta figure out who he's working with like so yeah what was that relationship and you know how did it come about you know it's an interesting thing um I get I had my email address is in all my videos it's like a Yahoo it's just it's done tomorrow yeah right and to be clear like my personal email address is not on Yahoo but that's the email address for all the people who are going to send me emails because as you can imagine I get when you post your email address that publicly you get some weird stuff going on you know yeah people think they know you what's it called uh people you know we get that Shawn and I get it all the time what's it called a parasocial relationship right that's exactly people email me and be like hey man I'm making 84 Grand a year I got two kids one of them's in private school thinking about leaving my wife what car you think I should get and I'm like that's true but so I got it I so I get random emails and so a viewer emailed me named Blake and he said hey I know I know we live close by in San Diego I have this car you ever you know if you ever want to get dinner and this was before I had a a kid and I I would I would meet up with random I did this many many times probably a hundred times I met up with just random people on the internet just it was how I made friends when we would move to New cities and so I met up with him and I learned that he did something in Tech which is how non-tech people View All Tech people you know and so and so um it hit me that I kind of wanted to do this only a couple of months after our meeting and I called him and I was like hey I know you do something in Tech can we do this and what do you think of this and he had actually just sold the car and bring a trailer and kind of recognize some of the deficiencies and he said yeah this is a great idea and so we used some seed money from his company to kind of just get get off the ground and get started and then we launched and and right away we were quickly earning revenue and quickly profitable was any of the what was the split so I I always wanted this about Creator kind of businesses where it's like are you just promotion or do you have to do anything with operations uh are you do you have to put in money what's the equity split how did you guys decide kind of roles and then the the ownership split it was tough to decide and there was a lot of back and forth and it kind of almost killed the thing but I ended up with with sort of a substantial majority because I was even though they had put down the money I was coming with the audience and one of the interesting things I think about these businesses you mentioned bring a trailer and how could you compete with it you would be shocked at how many other auction sites have shown up and failed since we launched um most of them never even make it on anybody's radar of course we watch them like a hawk because it's like our business but you'd be stunned at how many of these have shown up and we learned that like you can make a great product and that's important and we did that but like having an audience showing up with an audience is so crucial for the success of this and that's what caused all the other ones to fail and so um that as a result of that I think they understood that a large portion of the value at least initially was me and so even though there was sort of a tangling in it um I ended up with with the majority and yes I ended up doing an enormous amount of operations work like I was personally the first few weeks I was approving or denying all the cars that got submitted we didn't know it would blow up so much right away is what happens I think you got a thousand in one day right it was like the craziest day of my life we got a thousand and you get like a you gave like a three sentence description of each car yeah that was another thing what the hell was I thinking marrying myself to that idea but um what happened was when we first launched we had this we had this idea that in order to attract sellers we would offer a thousand dollars for the first 50 cars on the site and 500 for the next 50 cars on site it was a brilliant idea it was it was spending whatever that works out to be 75 grand or whatever but it was the greatest 75 grand we ever spent because we got so many submissions right away however um then we had to deal with them and boy was that so it's a day and it was all me doing it basically that's a nightmare and what's the what's the business model the business model is you uh probably if I I don't remember exactly but is it that buyers buyers of cars have to give you like three or four or five percent of the total purchase price that's right sellers pay nothing buyers pay four and a half percent um and now we've got a few other kind of drivers of Revenue as well there's a shipping component we just launched inspections which is really cool sellers can get their cars inspected um which we have already seen increases the number of bids and then the sale price and everything so that's I think it'll be a big um benefit going forward um but mainly it's that yes that the we get this buyer's fee and then of course we've now rolled up the businesses into one business that the YouTube channel and the auction site and so obviously my content revenue is a is a part of the business too and you did I I believe in 2021 you did like something like 75 million in gross sales yeah that feels right I should always the numbers but yeah it looks like the first month so you get this immediate surge of of listings but you know getting a Marketplace off the ground could be hard but I I suspect with your audience and it kind of just took off probably fairly quickly what what do you remember anything about that first month what were the numbers oh yeah the first car was your car right yeah it was my car that's right the first car was my car and I've since sold four or five um although I haven't bought yet I gotta do that um the first month was chaos I mean it's like you hear from any startup founder um who's successful right which is that that that it was absolute chaos we had we had the good problem of not having planned for what would come uh the success that came but the bad problem of then having to do it on the Fly and we were hiring people like talking to them on we didn't even have an office it was coveted we launched in June of 20. there were no offices we did this we launched the whole business from my back patio and so we're like talking to people in the pool I mean this was the whole situation was a complete disaster um and that month was definitely the most chaotic and most ridiculous of my entire well the first two months really and we started to build more of an infrastructure and more of a team and that kind of started to make things easier but I was still like in the ground on the trip in the on the ground in the tree is doing everything um until the churnan investment came and we got a little more cash and we could finally start like putting people in their roles and I could go back to my biggest asset to the business which is of course you know doing talk a little bit about the sale how'd that come about how that's a high stakes negotiation probably the biggest hand of Poker you've ever played uh tell us some fun stories about the uh the process and then the ultimate sale what went down you know I was really lucky that I had Blake who who has been in the kind of the business world the startup world before and sort of held my hand through the process because I was just a clueless I mean at the end of the day I make YouTube videos for a living like I shouldn't be involved in any sort of high eight-figure private Equity deal like that's not where I live you know so I hate people so they came to us and and by the way we hear your fidget spinner or whatever you got there on the mic there you go away this is a Toyota Mega Cruiser we um they came to us and you know we had gotten as you can imagine we had a lot of people reach out to us um because we had kind of grown and it became clear quickly and then the car market started to blow up and all these pevc type firms were like we gotta get in on this we gotta get on this today and here's this business that's actually succeeding doing it and bring a trailer had just sold to Hearst and so all these other companies were like are we missing something we got to go and then you know what's what's out there we could start it ourselves or this exists so we could a lot of reach outs but we viewed it as like kind of BS we were like we're too small to make this make sense to anybody um and so we kind of ignored them all but the Turning group was really persistent and finally they kind of got intro to us through a friend and I thought to myself well I can't say no to this call if it came to a friend I'll just take it it'll be 10 minutes and I'll hang out I took it in the car and um but they told me the most interesting thing I wasn't familiar with the children group but they told me that they specifically worked with creator-led businesses and that was a huge like light bulb moment for me because my big fear of working with any ervc companies they're going to come in and they're going to say we got to change this this and this on your YouTube channel and it's going to look like this now and this is how it's going to work and even if it was a big payday for me I feel like I didn't want to have to explain to someone how YouTube works you know like I just wanted I felt like I could do it better myself but these guys knew already how it worked and they were going to be like your audience it's already working this isn't how we don't want to screw with anything and that was a big moment hearing that they like specialize in this and so going forward that that just sort of began the conversation and one thing led to another that kind of went through here's how we might do it you know we kind of gave them some Basics they gave us a term shade and it it it came to fruition were you able to take money off the table or did it go to the uh go to the business yeah no I took I took money off I bought that career GT and and uh so it was a nice it was a nice situation for me to be able to do that especially after a lot a lot of hard work and actually in the end I feel like this is the best time because I got enough money that I can kind of chill a little bit and I swear there's something nice about that in terms of running and operating a business like this you make way more money when you have that like when you could chill a little bit you know like the less you want it the more you get it I feel like that's true like I feel like I'm I'm more relaxed I'm by focusing on like myself a little bit more and then I'm in a better mental state to like make better decisions and do more things and in the end it's actually been beneficial even though you would think it would be the opposite if you're chasing money you'd you'd work harder and maybe I did work harder but I think I'm working better now have you ever heard of the phrase uh trade a mean keeping Keen so like I remember when I was when I was like 16 I was like I was telling someone I was like I want to meet I was telling my a friend a girlfriend uh who is like this really pretty girl I was like man I want to meet more girls and she goes you got to treat them me to keep them Keen you know the less you want it the more you're gonna get it and I was like oh thank you like it's a I tried way less hard and I got way more girls the same is true with money I treat him I treat it mean and I keep it Keen you know the money comes to me the more that I don't want it that sounds like something an aunt would say no 14 year old is hitting me with that quote when you say I want to meet more girls uh yeah she was like a like someone like a neighbor you know she was in like college at the time and uh yeah and I was like man I'm trying to try to meet these girls I read the book the game I'm doing all the stuff I'm trying to I've tried hard and she was like you got to treat me to keep a Keem she's like you just gotta care less you don't do nothing we're still using that phrase all these years later it's still relevant how does this work though like if I'm this may be a question for for Mike and those guys at turning but like you buy a Creator lead business Critter wants to go chill on the beach now you gave him give him millions and millions of dollars but you need their face still it's tied to their face is there like a long transition plan where you you it's like blippi where they just changed out the guy a different guy came in and started wearing the stuff on YouTube and everyone in the comments is like hey uh that's not blippi um what's the plan you know I've been on I've done a few podcasts and interviews and all sorts of things with after this deal is closed and you're I think about your question constantly and you're the first person on one of these who's actually asked it to me because yeah I think they're nuts I truly think they're crazy like if you really think about it the best answer if you really think about it like like the whole it's a great idea when it works and for them it's worked wonderfully and I suspect that relates to the diligence they do on the Creator like they they know that I'm not gonna do that right because they know me they got to know me through this process it took like six eight months and we really got to know each other and they realized I wasn't about to just bail and go sit on the beach or do something insane like start saying crazy stuff on Twitter and get canceled whatever they knew that but like I could like I still if I were them I'd be terrified like they're making massive investments into businesses that have dudes like me who could just go off the rails one day and I think that is a crazy business model but they would torque by saying hey we do the diligence but also like this is how businesses are going to be like creators have these audiences this is where people want to get their stuff whatever it is Kitchen products cars doesn't matter they want to get it from people who they love and who they care about Mr Beast Burger you know all that stuff and so if you're gonna do it you gotta take that risk and but the benefit is you don't have to spend a lot in like paid marketing because the audience is there and they want to be there and so there's like a huge benefit to that but also a very scary potential drop we've had we've had Mr Beast on the Pod uh we recently did an episode with uh Danny Austin who created a hair hair care brand basically a scalp brand um also doing really really well what Creator brands are awesome to you that you think have done a good job is there any that stand out or you took inspiration from that's a good question you know when we when we launched this when we came up with the idea and launched this in the summer of 19 it wasn't as common like it's having a Creator kind of pivot into a brand was like less of a thing a lot of guys were doing a lot of guys I say guys because I was car people but just generally people were doing merge that was a big thing and some of them even had lines of products whatever but they the pivoting of doing this has become more of a thing since then and so I wouldn't say any of them were necessarily an inspiration it was more that I was just terrified that I had this giant audience and if I didn't do something with them they were going to start to go away eventually and I had to do something and so that was more based out of fear and anxiety than like than like being inspired by someone which is great um but obviously since then a lot of others have come and I give this advice to everybody I know everybody in this space all of my card creator friends I tell them like start a business start a business start a business you never know when your audience is going to go away please like take your audience right now and start a business do something and they they look at me like I'm nuts some of the time because they're like what do you mean I'm already traveling five days a week filming and doing all this stuff and editing late at night doing I you know writing scripts how can I start a business on top of that and my answer is like I don't know but you gotta you gotta figure it out because that's the that's the next way to take what you're doing [Music] spot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better have you seen I want to ask you about two ideas have you seen have you guys seen um what's it called uh exotic car hacks I think it's called no dude it's the the guy I I think that he's like playing a douche on TV I think he's like trying to be an [ __ ] like this is so his whole he's definitely this guy's like a total jerk but he uh he's got this course I think it's a course I don't know if it's a community or it's a course but you pay a little bit of money and he teaches you how to hack exotic cars which I have not taken it I think what it means is like you buy a car that's like four or five years old usually around the twenty thousand dollar uh or Twenty Thousand Mile range and then you drive it for one year and you could sell it and you have hopefully only you know you you've mostly broke even I think he also has a thing where you can like become a licensed dealer which I don't understand how that works but I heard a rumor that he sold the course to PE is that true or totally made up I don't know I I haven't heard that have you seen that Sean yeah are you looking at this guy now but his YouTube Banner is like uh Tim is a Grand Theft Auto character so that's that's solid to start and then I think you're right it's basically like how it says learn how to buy sell and trade exotic cars for Fun and Profit uh which is honestly it's a good good Niche um in fact my only criticism of this guy is uh he doesn't look douchey enough like once you go into the video he's just like a guy wearing like a v-neck he doesn't look like yeah he's just gotta be like no dude he's like uh I watched the video he was like like 10 times more jewelry than he's wearing like this guy he needs to piss me off but also make me want him right like that's the trick well he was driving a Land Rover Defender and he goes see the problem with the Land Rover Defender is my watch is worth five times this Defender the audio he's a verbal dude he goes even though it looks cool I can't decide if I'm poor because five of these still wouldn't equal the price of my watch well I think more people should do this I so so Doug our uh one of the companies I built we got bought by twitch when I was at twitch you know you spend a bunch of time on Twitch and you see what people are doing and it was like everybody's kind of doing a very similar thing it's like um you know there's like two classes of people there's like you know really good at the game three classes say really good at the game people watch them because they're so awesome at the game and they can actually have no personality people just like them because their aim is good and then you have people that are super cute right hot girls they do well too and then you have uh like the third Group which is like super likable like kind of the group you're in I would I would say where it's like they're not they're not like the most technically good at the game but they're likable they're fun they play they're called a variety streamer they stream a bunch of different games they keep it interesting good good fan interaction and there was one guy that just took it a whole different direction this guy doctor disrespect have you seen him yeah I've heard of him so he created a whole character he comes on and he he himself was like a college basketball player so he's like six eight so he's this huge guy but he wears this like mullet wig he wears like a bulletproof vest like a red bulletproof he looks like a character from the 80s and he created his name he created his thing Dr disrespect and then he has like he's catch phrases he was basically a wrestling character so he basically was like the rock where he would um he had this Persona and he had these catch phrases and then everybody in his life became a character his wife became a character like if she would come on the screen like you would never see her only her hand and she would feed him while he was playing like feeding him grapes basically and he would do everything ridiculous and then to add to that he would like go sit courtside at an NBA game but dressed fully as Dr disrespect and that investment of like that five thousand dollar Courtside seat was actually really valuable to building this Persona this brand of like and he always called himself in the 1994 or 1995 two-time Blockbuster NBA Jam whatever like Champion like he's got these like phrases that he would always go to just purposely trying to be hateable yeah just trying to be like exactly he created a whole character and he just stayed like when he stayed with him Floyd when Floyd Mayweather became Money Mayweather exactly like I'm going full heel exactly but even more like it was more like wrestling because he's got a costume also like on top of the whole thing and I actually think that for Content creators it's surprising you don't see more of this like yeah that's such a good point there are these archetypes like in wrestling you have the the faces the good guys you got the heels the guys that are intentionally bad guys that are gonna get a big following because you'll love to hate them Floyd Mayweather did this in boxing he was not making any money and he uh he became Floyd Money Mayweather this obnoxious arrogant you know money in your face guy then he started getting really really popular because people wanted to see him lose there's a guy in the UFC that did the same thing he uh he's basically about to get cut the UFC told him you're too boring we're going to cut you and so that night he went on and he just started saying all this offensive stuff on the microphone against Brazilians and this one fighter and whatever and they were like well now we got to keep him to fight that guy because he just created a feud and he's like this guy just took it to the like to you know to level 10 of being this heel I I'm surprised there's not more of this on YouTube you know the best car guy who's doing that right now is this guy whistling Diesel have you ever seen his I love whistling diesel I heard that he's a sweetheart by the way there is no car content creator who I like more than whistling diesel I've never met him tell Sean tell Sean what he does dude it's the it's like Mr Beast but like for cars and he and he just does things that make people hate him so he buys a Ferrari to destroy it and he put it you know you know you can buy those as an example you know you can buy those garage bubbles like like Boomers have you know they put their old corvetteum inside their garage it's like a it's like an inflatable bubble that makes sure nobody ever touches the car he bought one of those for his Ferrari and just started throwing stuff at it ladders and shovels and and sledgehammers song just see if it worked it would off-road the Ferrari he put giant 20 foot tall wagon wheels on his Tesla I mean all sorts of just dumb stuff and I just am obsessed with it I'm like this is the kind of content I wish I was making how does he how does this guy afford it I assume I assume he's doing the same thing that Mr Beast is doing where he's taking basically all of the money that he's pulling in from revenue and from you know placement ad placements and just putting it right back into doing more dumb crap like you dropped the G wagon into a house when he was in the G way I mean everything it's just incredible it's incredible content there's uh what are some of the titles uh using 35 000 Nike Air Mags as work boots so he bought extremely rare extremely expensive shoes it's just a great walk around in the mud with them doing work uh there's extreme School Bus off-roading he takes a bus and he's just like flying around but it's also number one so I guess that's a series I guess there's gonna be a lot more of those uh to come driving a Tesla upside down parentheses 10 foot tall Wheels okay I don't know what that is that's that's amazing but each of these has like five to ten million views so it's very incredible it's incredible content and he's just this kid from like Indiana or like rural Pennsylvania who just if he wasn't doing this he'd be like driving a truck you know but instead he like decided to become hateful on in on YouTube and he's killing it and I love it yeah he's great to see people hate him there is nothing more fun than these people that guy's so irresponsible and it's like yeah that's been fun it's YouTube yeah you're supposed to be responsible supposed to be a little he took like um like a 250 000 G wagon and which is like everyone says it's an off-road vehicle but like no one drives a G-Wagon off-road and he like you know destroys it like to the point where it's smoking and he just annihilates this G-Wagon how much revenue do you think that this guy's Channel makes so I want to know if he is if he is putting all of it back into the videos I want to know how much that budget is he's getting 20 million views a month so I suspect he's probably pulling in you know yeah one to two million a month and then he does AD placements and they must get tons of money because his views get so uh his videos get so many views wait at 20 million views a month you think he's making let me let me review a million it's in I don't know in in his in his world I don't know because his audience is good as I suspect you're very different from mine my audience doing car reviews is really high dollar content because you're in market car Shoppers and that is a very desirable demographic for advertisers whistling Diesel's probably there's probably a lot of kids there's probably more foreign audience than mine so probably doesn't make as much but he's he's probably doing all right and plus he lives in the middle of nowhere in like World Pennsylvania so his cost of living is like he's good he's damaging what would a good CPM be from AdSense for your YouTube video that's a good question I don't remember anymore I actually calculated CPM in this completely different way because I never understood why it was views like dollars per thousand views it never really made sense to me so I started calculating the number reviews I had to get to earn a dollar and so good for me was a video that broke a hundred with a hundred marks so less than 100 views to earn a dollar um and there were there were a lot of videos especially in December when ad rates were strong that were that were pulling in that that's so funny that's how you calculated that makes it actually makes a lot of sense because it makes more sense to me yeah like I feel like everything you've told me so far is like um just a guy like sort of using his intuition like like you're just like well like uh like I had a friend that was like I had a friend that would do this he'd be like um you know it like he would keep like his money like instead of like going to a bank selling a bank account then like oh you should invest it he's like no I have three shoe boxes and like shoebox one is spend money and shoebox two is save money and he cut his own bank account in my dorm room and he was just like yeah like you know but you if you're gonna move one to this box you got to put two in the other box it's just like I'm like dude I think you're actually just using the normal like personal finance rules but you just are but you but you backed into that yeah you did them like a guy like you know like a caveman like just sort of discovering fire here that's probably true for me but I I will say like in my in my view that's kind of how YouTube was it from like 13 to 19. the before like a lot of big businesses started showing up and really maximizing the hell out of everything I think it was a lot of people just kind of randomly using intuition to like make decisions and it was like okay that video did well so I'm gonna try this video instead of like really thinking through okay the thumbnail should say this at this pixel and all that which is how we a lot of creators do it now it was a lot of just like yeah let's give this a shot and for some people it worked out and those are the people that you end up talking to and for some people it didn't and those are the ones who sizzled out did you and do you now have a video team I read somewhere that you were editing up you're editing them up until cars and bids and then now you just have an editor but like is that true or do you have like a Booker because I know you're on the road or at least you said one annual wrap up you're like I traveled like uh you know most weeks yeah well when I lived in Philly I was traveling a ton because the weather but now I'm in California and it's gotten a lot easier um yeah so it was just me so I launched the channel in 13 we went to two videos a week in 16. it was just me up until we launched the Royal the Royal you say we yeah we when we I my fam I think of my wife as part of this because boy has that been a journey for her but um so so I launched the channel in 13 and there have always been kind of people around friends who helped shoot things that kind of thing so there's a Wii component to that too but mostly it was just me and then in March of 20 when we all launched cars and bids I realized like that week that I was never going to be able to edit another video again and so I called a guy who had emailed me like a year before like hey do you need an editor and I always kind of ignore those emails and I was like are you still available and can you start today and his answer was yeah and he's still my editor uh it's been now over three years you just had a baby and um but now we have more people also because we're going to start doing more content and so we hired like a a video kind of content manager who's going to oversee I think it's going to be multiple channels mine the Carson bids Channel and then like new creators come in and stuff and I just don't have the WHERE with all the bandwidth especially because I want to continue doing what I'm doing and I just don't really have the ability to like also manage a whole thing have you guys heard of uh more plates more dates have you know who that is uh all right so his name's Derek he's probably maybe as famous as you but in like the fitness genre he's like on Joe Rogan and stuff whatever yeah and he has a great video but his video a you don't know his last name you just know it's Derek at more plates more dates and B his videos it's just him like on a camera kind of like you are right now but it's just a plain white background like it looks like you're just at like like he's in like a college dorm or he's just like in his house just goofing around but his videos get millions and millions of views and I heard a rumor that now his businesses are making many many tens of millions a year in Revenue but the room that he originally started this YouTube video or this YouTube channel it was just like a like a shitty old apartment when he didn't have a lot of money and they took the wall out of the apartment and he has since moved to a significantly larger very nice home but they try to transpose it so it looks exactly like the old one and that's kind of like what you have to do so like they don't want people to think like Oh Derek is like killing me now he's unrelatable and that's sort of like I imagine you've kind of lucked into this situation where it's like oh my whole shtick is that like I'm quirky and the videos aren't well edited therefore I can keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger without like doing anything that sophisticated there's a component of that also that it's worked so like in a sense I don't really want to change it that much because as much as that is kind of like the the stick it's like also been successful um but yeah it's one I one drawback of this and I think about Jerry Seinfeld a lot when I think about this Seinfeld's humor is all based on a normal guy doing stuff he's no longer and hasn't been for decades the normal guy and I bet it's gotten harder for him to make jokes like hey you ever get to the FBO or the private plane you know and it's late and you're like damn like you can't so how do you do that and so for me I'm like it's it it hasn't gotten harder but I do feel sad that like I'm no longer like your neighbor who's like here's how you should think of this card because here's how I think of this car no I'm a guy who's got you know a career GT or will afford and it's like okay well maybe he's not quite as you know when he talks about supercars being slow it's like well screw this guy you know because it's a little bit less relatable but I still like to think that I'm you know Chris and Chris Rock's most recent comedy special he says I'm rich but I identify as poor and I kind of like feel that way to an extent because like this didn't I didn't start this way like I still remember I still wear these stupid clothes because like that's what I wear it's not like I've like she's gone I'm not like wearing like high-end stuff and then when the camera turns off like that's just who I am and so I think to an extent it's still it's still pretty genuine by the way Sean uh Carrera GT it's like a one point something million dollar car it's like uh the car enthusiasts love it it's like a lot of people's dream car Doug but you're the type of guy who like uh I imagine shows up in a million and a half dollar car wearing cargo shorts yeah oh yeah a white T-shirt that's dirty and old New Balance he's got like you've got to be the only guy over three and a half Pockets per uh per leg that's exactly where I'm driving everywhere I go I wear my stupid shorts and t-shirt and like you can think what you want I'm driving career yeah and yeah I don't know if you've seen this Sean but on his videos the true fans they'll put stuff at the top of video like Doug's the type of guy who licks his finger before he turns the page on his iPad like like he's got he's got to think I'm like this geeky like cautious person which is probably accurate to be honest I just love at the end of the day people are like the quirks and features thing what a great idea like this wasn't an idea I really just love like seeing how buttons work in cards like that is genuinely and you know what's funny like I shoot all these videos now for the site you know we're selling cars on the site and there are new cars that have gonna have big audiences and like I show up to film and I like still have this feeling in me every single time shooting an Acura NSX right after this and I still have this feeling like I'm really excited to see the quirks of this car like it's still in my mind after all these years and so I feel like I'm probably doing the right the right job does it uh well how does it feel to be wealthy now after after grinding after this for so long it's better than before it is it is definitely nice aside from that car I didn't like splurge on anything I kind of like live a certain life and that's sort of how it's going to be but um but it is nice to have a little I think I am a little bit more anxious about money than a lot of people and it's nice to not have any of that anxiety anymore and I'll tell you it came at the perfect time because I just had a boy and like it's amazing to be able to like detach and just like be with him without having to worry about like grinding for the next video every little dollar you know that I place this thing perfectly in this video um it's a it's like an amazing sequence of events do you think um how big is this business going to get I mean I think I I by the way Sean have you seen brigad trailer it's basically like yeah a Blog I think it is actually in fact WordPress yeah by the way the whole time we've been doing this interview I've also just been shopping cars and bids so I'm like currently like my finger is hovering over this 1994 Toyota hiace Super custom wagon this I can just buy this van for five thousand dollars and I'm very very tempted to do this this is pretty sweet looking van I don't know why I want this but I really really want it it's awesome the site's awesome I'm looking at uh you have this like three wheeler a vanderhall because I was looking at a Morgan three-wheeler or do I need to close this tab it's buy or close the tab those are my two options right right exactly that's kind of the fun of it well you you bring a trailer which was before you guys it was basically just a Blog I don't know if you know the show but the guy who started it his name was one guy's name is Randy but the other partner was Gentry Underwood who started mailbox that's that company that sold I think for a hundred million dollars pre-launch to Dropbox and I emailed him because he used to have throttle yard which was that for motorcycles it had all the stuff and I was like tell me about this business uh bring a trailer and he says it's the hardest slog like it was the hardest thing ever to get going it took years and years and years and then I heard a rumor that it sold for many hundreds of millions of dollars do you know what it sold for Doug I have an idea but I'm not gonna speculate on Randy's business was it to uh private Equity or who bought it Hearst First Media but like half of it is our understanding am I often saying that I that like it's probably I think the valuation was in the hundreds of millions but I don't I I don't know exactly how much anybody ended up with or whatever but um but they did well Randy killed it they're killing it now the the sale was was um by the car business standards the sale was relatively early um in the sense that they sold kind of right before things went crazy in 21 and they've ramped Bay and us I mean as a function of this Market that's been so crazy have ramped like crazy since then and so I think the business is worth quite a lot more now I suspect what do you think is going to happen with you guys I mean do you think like are you thinking you know this is a a multi-billion dollar opportunity I don't know I honestly I never thought I'd get here don't you have to make it that now if you if you I I think you sold I don't know what you sold you sold it just said majority majority for 40 million which I I you know that puts the valuation in the 60 to 80 million range I imagine I mean you need like a I imagine they're looking for like a 500 million plus outcome then I think I think we'd all be happy at 500 million yeah I don't I but and I think that there's a pathway to get there and frankly I think bring a trailer showing that and I think that also the um reality of this space is that this is how it's going like the internet made it easier to buy and sell cars obviously it used to be in the newspaper and that was kind of a disaster with low information on both sides and everything and now the internet shows up Craigslist shows up that's one thing and now people are starting to realize that there is significant value in these auction sites because sellers can amplify they can get you know to a much larger audience than they could on their own website or an AutoTrader and buyers can get a larger selection frankly than having to visit every single dealer's website and every single whatever or go to physical auctions like Mecum and those are you know what are you going to show up there you know like that's not realistic for a lot of people this is kind of becoming the new way so I honestly don't know I think if you would ask Randy eight years ago he never would have thought his business would have gotten this big and but this is the market is growing along with these businesses another interesting person in your space who I think that you have a feud with but I don't know why but when Sean bought his car I think he did he watched your video and then he dm'd this guy named uh car dealer guy is that what it's called a car dealership car dealership guy so basically the story behind this is Sean and I have been obsessed with so Sean and I are both popular on Twitter we've been obsessed with this idea of like look there's gonna be a billionaire YouTuber Mr Beast at least is getting there it might be around that um there we've seen that happen on Facebook we've seen billion dollar companies on Facebook we've seen that on Instagram no one's done it on Twitter but it will happen and in particular we're interested in these like there's like these guys called like the guys so there's like the strip mall guy he talks about investing in strip malls there's the watch guy who talks about old watches and we're like what's gonna happen with these quote guys like what are they what are they gonna do and then there's the anonymous car dealer guy and I think Sean like dm'd him asking like which car should I buy and he told him to get the Cadillac and then he watched your review and then he just wired some guy money and got the Cadillac what do you think first of all I don't know why I said I want to buy this car I'm looking for this car can he find it for me and buy it for me and get it to my house and I don't want to do any work and he did it he did exactly that um okay here's here's the they'll tell you the Genesis of the feud and then I'll tell you what I think of that um the here's the thing about success on Twitter for for one of those guys and I love all those guy tweet twitters I think they're all really interesting including car dealership guy but the problem is in order to be successful on Twitter and I have a suspicion that this is even more true in the new age of Twitter you've got to be really controversial and you got to be pretty like I wouldn't say Blasphemous but you got to be like out there with like your takes and your opinions because that amplifies more and I think Facebook found out years ago that like they can do that but that doesn't necessarily lead to a great community and a lot of times there was all this election misinformation or all this fear-mongering and so they like dialed back some of that and it sounds to me like Twitter right now is actually magnifying it like it seems every crazy take is at the top with all these engagements and that's what they're trying to maximize for and the problem that I have with car dealership guy is that like his if you read his posts some of them are just like the most insane through marketing stuff you'll ever read like The reason we got into the feud was I he posted like Ford has done this crazy thing they're gonna go out of business it's gonna be the worst thing in the world and I'm like this is this is so insane and I went into the data of what he was talking about and Ford had to do some big write down on some investment this year and so their profits were low and he didn't mention that he only mentioned that the profits were off 80 compared to last year and it was like maybe a little bit or he'll say like he'll say like uh uh lease lease uh I forget what it's called when you can't pay your lease but uh link lease delinquency is like at this time which is the highest it's ever been which means in four months something like everything is gonna blow up and yeah and I think the problem I have with all of those guy accounts is precisely and so I I called him out on this Ford thing and we got into a little a little tiff and unfortunately for him everyone who was replying agreed with me once they saw the data and so he blocked me and so and then but and then I realized though I'm not the only person he has blocked he a lot of my car journalist friends who I suspect have also tried to add contacts at various times he has blocked them also and so what I suspect happens is he's like kind of tried to create a little bit of an echo chamber around himself because that's what makes you popular on Twitter now if you go into somebody's tweets and you see that they have a lot of like well that's amazing types of replies they're going to continue to get magnified and get blown out and I think that people who have a lot of dissent it starts to become a little bit cloudier and but if you see somebody as like a real icon where everybody's agreeing with him then it continues to make and seem more and more like elevated and I so I suspect he's blocking other people who disagree and so I I in in an idea I like the idea of that Twitter account but I think in order to be popular I don't I don't even dislike him I dislike the concept of in order to be popular on Twitter you kind of have to just keep going controversial and these crazy takes and that's really the only way to like make it work and I think that that's less true on the other platforms yeah I think that's true we have a friend named Nick who owns uh or part owns an agency that outsources a lot of like uh assistant like executive assistant work to the Philippines and he'll do these tweets where he brags about paying his workers five dollars an hour and how that empowers them and and everything like that which like is or is not true I I imagine it is true but he says it in such a way where he knows people are going to get angry and share it and at the bottom of the Tweet he'll be like by the way uh if this actually interests you you could like sign up here and so he'll like tweet something that gets like it'll go it goes viral every time like he'll get like you know 50 000 likes and like you know three or four or 500 quotes of like people saying this guy is such a douche can you believe how tone deaf he is whatever and then he'll like text us he goes made 50 Grand a day exactly that's that's the problem I have with Twitter at least right now I think it's definitely gone to more of a controversy cells kind of thing you can't just be like a nice dude and do well on Twitter right now you have to have like takes that are controversial and kind of ridiculous in order to get anywhere and I'm just I don't know it's a shame I want to ask you one one last inside baseball question which was um Sean you probably don't this probably doesn't entirely interest you but maybe I think it would for you Doug have you noticed that a lot of car museums are non-profits so for example there's like the barber Museum in I think Alabama yeah where so it's a non-profit you can go on and like see their financials and everything and I have a feeling and this is like an interesting tax hack but I don't know if it's true I have a feeling what they do is they sell a business sort of like we've all done and what you've recently done Doug and they put their money I think in some type of like Donor advised fun which is like you can uh give away a certain amount of money to certified non-profits and then reduce your tax burden and I have a feeling what they're doing is they're setting up their car museum as a non-profit and like the barber guy I believe he set up the barber Museum after he sold I think like a dairy company for like a billion dollars he had like a milk and dairy business I have a feeling what they do is they make a big sale a big Equity sale in their business and they put a certain amount of proceeds into a donor advice fund of which they've been put into a non-profit that they own and that's where they go and buy all their cars and they let people come and see their cars and whatever I have a feeling that's what's happening I don't I don't know I've just been like looking around this I think that's what's happening there's another guy who I think you had on his his YouTube channels like here's my 20 million dollar car collection he's a young guy that has a tire store and he keeps saying in his YouTube videos I buy these cars so everyone can enjoy it and I have a feeling he's doing the same thing as well you're talking about huvi I think hoovie's garage I I can't remember he's in San Diego and he has a tire store it's an interesting idea it's an interesting idea I think I need a larger exit before I can make that happen but that is a great place to a great way to justify uh a vehicle collection I think it's not that you donate the money I think you have to donate the asset or your shares to the daf first but if you but if you control it and you work in the museum is yours what do you care I just asked um I asked Bard the new Google AI I said explain how rich people use non-profit museums to avoid paying taxes here's what it says that a way that rich people use nonprofit museums to avoid paying taxes to create a donor advice on death the death is a charitable giving account it allows donors to make a one-time or recurring distribution of cash or appreciated assets and receive an immediate tax deduction but um so basically the donor donates art to like for example donor donates are to a museum they receive an immediate tax deduction for the full appraised value of the art however the museum does not have to sell the art and they can instead display it as their own collection they can avoid paying capital gains on the appreciation of the art um and so I think I've seen this where people basically have like a quote-unquote public museum like in their backyard uh it's like and I wonder how who what who dictates what yeah what is the monitoring the price but also like how many hours does the museum have to be open to justify exactly 45 minutes yeah 45 minutes a year like like could you say that like because this is Doug's Porsche it is now worth an additional 20 increase you know what I mean like I wonder I wonder like what the appraised value is but I had a feeling that's what's happening which seems like a wonderful hack for Cardinals because you can now totally would that mean that your your purchase price is effective believe like 37 or however whatever your your taxes uh fifty percent I've been to that barber Museum and it is quite an operation and so if that's true there's probably such a massive spend at the beginning to get if you don't think it was it was the legal 50 million I believe uh I went and looked up his all his numbers I think he seed funded it with 40 or something million and it makes around 50 million a year um and man that's crazy non-profits you can go and uh look up all the information yeah so there's like I think there's the Peterson Museum in La there's a few other ones and you could actually go and look at all the uh you can look at their financials and you could figure out because I that was my dream was I was like if I get you know a 500 million dollar exit I like it would be awesome this is what I'm doing this playground um but yeah I've already done all the math and like looked into all this that's what we got to do that's an interesting thing never considered it but will in the future well Doug we appreciate you coming on now hopefully uh uh you realize I'm I'm legitimately a huge fan so yeah I appreciate that thank you and talk to you and um maybe uh Sean's not exactly a car guy but maybe he will because I hope you appreciate that I legitimately have only watched one of your videos but it did lead me to buy a car so you know enjoy that escalate it's gonna be great I will it's only got a 66 on the Doug score now I'm thinking no that's gonna be maybe I should be pretty good the best car ever got like a 73. there's six cars higher than it and so I'm like am I the kind of guy who just buys the seventh best luxury SUVs I bet it's at the very it is probably my favorite if you're gonna go down that route um it's a that's a that's a bit of a risky car to drive around the bay area where everybody else is in electric cars you're getting like 12 miles per gallon you know oh yeah I love it it's but it uh I asked him Doug I go so do you have like the self-driving stuff and you're like I don't know do I and I was like that's like the whole point of that point that's the whole point of that Escalade is like drive for you isn't that in the bay that's what you want the PO the point of it is that it fits multiple car seats and as huge amount of trunk space that's that's the point actually yeah you didn't even know I'm pretty I'm not trying to self-driving car myself the system you have in that car is the best system of all of all it's better than Tesla's self-driving how is that possible absolutely sure unquestionable because it came from Cruz the Cadillac system lets you be totally hands-off Tesla system is not even I would say in the top four anymore but Cadillac system is especially good it lets you be fully hands off as long as you want provided that you're looking ahead you can be hands off and and you have to be on a mapped road but that's like every Highway if you're if you're on a map road which like the five and you're looking ahead you can just sit there and yeah but like I won't give you ideas about stuff you can do but you don't have to be driving no I don't know you're the car guy I said let me just but I am the tech guy and I just don't understand how Cadillac could possibly have better self-driving because software they bought Crews they brought your buddy's company uh Cruise you know remember remember they they they bought Crews GM bike Crews GM owns Cadillac but cruise is not like Cruz was not the top of the top right like that that wasn't they they are some of I mean you'll see cruises in San Francisco now you can rent a cruise at the intersection they don't know what the hell to do at any Interstate have you seen have you driven around San Francisco I wouldn't trust it that's the thing about it the the Cadillac SuperCrew system works best on and mostly only on freeways I don't even use because I have a pretty good system I have a new Mercedes that has a great system too and I don't use it once I get off the freeway I'm driving myself and that's true of the Teslas also they say full self-driving but we've seen all those seen those videos where the cards yeah I wouldn't trust it off freeway we're still in a kind of a wild west situation we didn't look at the defender Sean you weren't you weren't a Defender guy is that a Marvel movie what do you know what you're talking about the Defenders what are we talking about here yeah that's the level we're at here with Sean I dm'd a guy and told him to buy me a car that's the level of research I did I picked you didn't look at anything rap videos dude like that was my research what about a minivan would you consider a minivan at all I wanted a minivan my preference was a minivan my wife vetoed it because she was like uh because I'm just like cars stressed me out nice car stressed me out so I just wanted something I wouldn't be stressed about that was super functional I was like what if we just go the other way what if we just zag here when everybody's zigging and we we go get like the most functional most spacious ugliest minivan that I'm not gonna worry about anywhere I could park it anywhere and I'm just not gonna care what happens to this car and it's just gonna be this like transport closet for me and my kids mess and that's what I was interested in but my wife was like cool we're not doing that I recommend minivans to everybody now everybody with multiple kids I get a buddy who has three kids and I was just like I need a van he's like what SUV can I get I was like you need a van he was like I could get three car seats in my car there's there's a good minivan for me the Sienna is the one you want that's the one everybody gets right now that's at the Toyota Sienna that's the one you want dude is slow and it is lame but it is if you have if especially three and up children three numbers three kids or more you you just have to getting car seats into an SUV like it's just I just want like the Crocs version of a car yeah that is exactly that but Crocs are cool yeah I'm betting that the minivan will make the make a Crocs like come back no you made the right choice with the Escalade if although that's like 130 000 SUV which kind of defeats the purpose of not worrying about it uh yeah I could I got overrode bye-bye I I got vetoed by my wife and I had to buy a good car that I do have to worry about a little bit and what what do you own right now Doug I didn't know you owned a another Mercedes you have the defender my main normal car I have a uh E-class station wagon um so AMG or not an AMG no just an E450 pleb dude we had this exit we had this giant exit and got all this money and I went out and bought a used non-amg E-class stage wagon that is who I am at heart um you know the real reason I did that is because I love the AMG wagon but ultimately I now have a 4GT a Carrera GT and then two crazy convertible SUVs and my view was I don't need to be getting seven miles per gallon and doing 0-60 in three seconds in my daily driver it's just not it's I I'm good I've got cars that can do all that and so I just bought a regular one also the regular ones are just as fast now as the AMG ones were only a few years ago so I'm it's it's fine it's comfortable and Bishop it's so nice do you still draw I mean I I watched one of your things and you're like I drove this car across country six times in the last like two years why are you driving cross-country versus flying oh in the summer we live in Massachusetts and so I drive all the way across the country every summer and all the way across at the beginning of the Fall every single year I've done this now three times this will be my fourth I'm leaving in 30 days from today and uh I we just it's a whole summer so you need a car you need your dog we have a lot of stuff and it's just the easiest way to get everything there until I unless I can afford to fly private which I cannot this is that when um so by the way I do the same thing I I spend my summers in New York and my wife flies and me and my dog Drive uh there you go I found another I found another person who touched this when will you be wealthy enough to fly private you think when are you gonna feel never do you know what it costs let me tell you a story this is probably 30 grand from LA to SF so this is the thing I I we go to Nantucket so I so that's like the I'm at like the polls of the country San Diego is the extreme Southwest Nantucket is basically the extreme Northeast so um I generally fly first class now that is one of the splurges that I do and so a first class ticket across country is a thousand bucks or whatever and I'm like thousand bucks this is great and I thought to myself I'm flying first class for a thousand bucks I bet I can fly private for like you know three four thousand I bet that's what it costs this was me of of of uh naive Doug thinking hey it's probably only a few grand more you know what how much more could it be and the answer is I looked it up 55 000 direct from San Diego to Nantucket and so the answer to your question when will I be able to fly private never my dog and I will always pile into the car and end up refueling at these sketchy gas stations in New Mexico and Oklahoma that will be our lives for years how often are are people uh recognizing you on these road trips at gas stations all the time I imagine no it's rare on the trips um and I'm and I'm like I'm like obsessive about getting there quickly like I just go I don't ever stop and like look at people or chat but in life like yeah all the time obviously and it's always nice it's always good interactions with people well dude this is awesome we appreciate it oh man you want to shout anything out where people should find you or where to reach you or whatever cars and beds no we've talked about every people can people will figure it out well dude thanks for doing this man uh yeah we'll we'll uh we'll pimp out your Twitter the YouTube channel cars and bids and uh you're the best man I've been a fan for years it's awesome to finally talk I appreciate it thank you for having me and congrats on the all the success um even though you've been at it for you know I've never seen Sam like this he is just funny he can't stop he's just like listen man if you want a carpool cross-country sometime I I love our dogs can sit in the back we can sit in the front it'll be amazing yeah you need a friend I got a friend I'll be your friend if you need one glad to have you on the pond glad they were friends now right would that be fair to say would that be a reach would that be okay I'm legitimately I'm thrilled to find someone else who does this drive and we should be in contact about that at the very least I have become like a student contact day yeah yeah we can start there I'm happy to start there we could do that the funniest thing by the way Doug we just did a live show in Austin and like Sam is Sam is like the opposite of this when someone's a big fan of Sam they know everything about him they've been a fan for years been following them they've kind of falling over them huge turn off to Sam but when it's somebody that he does the exact same thing to other people this is hilarious to me you know I had this I had this happen to me I met Jerry Seinfeld like a year ago and Jerry tells me that he watches all my videos and over at this point I've had people coming up to me on the street for years like I've had some of the interactions you know great some of them don't and I know exactly what to say what to what I'm expecting someone to say to have it go great you know and I meet Jared he's like I watch all your videos and I'm like uh uh uh do you like Porsches like I can't believe I've screwed this up after having so much okay well and by the way I know we keep like we tried wrapping this up and then we kept going so like I just really acknowledge that because I actually do kind of want to hear about this Jay Leno I don't know if you know about this Sean but Jaylen I was like car guy yeah doesn't he have like four or five airplane hangers is that what was that like oh it's I've been there now three or four times it is incredible um yeah he's got like four one of them might be an airplane hangar but it's mostly just like buildings it's like in an office Park it's next to an airport but they're if they're not um but anyway they're giant buildings yeah I would say maybe six of them one is just like a machine shop it's incredible I mean his collection is truly unbelievable oh yeah hundreds of millions you think so well he's got a McLaren F1 that in itself is probably worth 40. um maybe 50 at this point a McLaren F1 is worth 40 or 50 million now wow yeah that's pretty crazy yeah at his he's it's like his is like a one owner car is that a 25 years he told me he paid 800 for it or six seven hundred that's insane to me yeah yeah the car Elon had that he crashed have you seen uh Sean do you know what WeatherTech is it's like uh it's like you buy a car and you like get like the mats which is like one of those businesses like Yeti where you're like there's no way a cooler company is going to be big it turns out this thing's just massive and the reason you know it's massive is I think it's privately owned but they sponsor all the stuff which you have to have a big budget for but the owner bought a Ferrari 250 GTO yep for 80 million dollars which is like I think the most expensive car sale ever yep and that's how you know this company is killing it that the owner of the privately Health company has enough cash to spend on an 80 million dollar car that's just gonna sit you know it's it's ridiculous I mean it's like a crazy thing and so Jay has one that's worth 40 or 50. that's got to be in the top 10 of like most valuable cars oh yeah yeah for sure and by far the most valuable like modern car and um he told me the most unbelievable story about this car that he bought it he paid 600 and he told me he's driving through La there's only 64 of them he's driving through LA and um he sees another was he driving it this was when he had bought and he's driving through LA and he sees another one so this is 97.98 this is another one just Street parked in front of a house and he's like what and so he goes up and rings the doorbell and meets the guy and he says hi to the guy and they exchange rate oh yeah we both got McLaren f1s in L.A and he told me that the guy calls him a year later and says Jay you'll never believe it I sold mine and I made I got eight hundred thousand dollars I made 200 Grand and Jay's like I think I'm gonna hang on to mine a little longer and now it's worth 40. and that's a lesson who who's gonna buy a 40 million dollar car I mean how many people in the world do you think would do that are there any emails in people I reviewed Jay's and and I asked him and I had to cut this out of the video because it was quite an interesting segment but like I asked him I was like what do you think of the other owners of this car and he thought for a long time and gave a very measured response and I thought to myself like what reading between the lines what he was trying to say is there are a bunch of jerks who have money they're not car enthusiasts like if that car has become the type of thing you buy if you just want like a trophy rather than if you actually care about cars whereas when it was 600 800 Grand there were enough car people who could afford it that maybe they'd get into the mechanics and do the work themselves which Jay values very heavily but now it's just a bunch of Rich guys who want to brag and that's why he doesn't uh own Ferrari because in order to buy the fancy Ferrari you have to buy a entry-level Ferrari and you get on a wait list and they like release them like like a Rolex almost and he's like nah [ __ ] that even though I'm a rich guy I'm I'm a man of the people I'm not getting on a waitlist to buy a a million dollar car there's got to be 75 cars in that maybe 100 cars in that collection and not one for our that's insane how many people can afford a 40 million dollar F1 or a McLaren nobody and the ones who can servicing it is a nightmare it's done on some like MS-DOS based I mean the whole thing is like a total mess it's but it's the coolest thing in the world you know and if you're a rich guy and you have all the rich guy cars like the career GT and the F40 you're not a really rich guy unless you've got a McLaren F1 then you then you don't even need the other cards you're just like yeah I win don't keep your how much is your monthly insurance for a million dollar Porsche not as much as you think I think it's only a thousand a month to insure that car um but you can drive it do you drive on a date uh like on a Friday night or once a month I take it to Cars and Coffee once a week basically but other than that like my wife still hasn't even ridden in it like it's just it's not something I'm I I've driven at a thousand miles since I bought it four months ago which is actually pretty good but like it's a terrifying thing to drive a car that's worth a million dollars like anybody could hit you and then it's like okay well this is not gonna be good for anybody like that person bankrupt now because their insurance limit is way below this and my insurer is going to sue them and like the whole thing is just it's just a scary die I love driving I truly believe this is the greatest thing you own that car sounds like might be not so fun to own that car no no I I when when I take it out which is very rare but when I take it out on early mornings before people are up when it's still cool and I can take it into the mountains and like really enjoy it which I've done now three or four times then it is so rewarding and so incredible and I truly truly believe that it is and I've driven them all the greatest driving car that has ever been made and so like to that extent it's worth it for sure okay this is actually the end of the podcast now all right that's it Sam Sam you he's not he's not gonna be your bestie he's not gonna be your best friend yeah yeah give it time bro give it time it takes time we'll build a relationship I've already got this planned out there's gonna happen to be in your town next week oh hey you're just in town just I was hoping we could hang out here for this oh you're not in L.A you're in San Diego tomorrow too uh thanks Doug we appreciate it yeah thanks guys [Music] foreign

foreign [Music] think at this point Nick Gray yes we're ready for questions all right so what we're going to do is we're gonna do a little q a and we'll Riff on some of that stuff fantastic let's see uh please can I have house lights and I would like to see Hands Up For questions for the panelists I see one here in the center I see one over here thank you guys I'm gonna ask you to raise your hands again and we're gonna try to go through these fast please say who your question's for uh my question is for Sam uh what do you think podcasting will be in 10 years positive or negative what no like you want to have some light discussion uh where will podcasting be so when she was Sean's idea to start our podcast he came to me and he's like I've got this finished episode will the hustle publish it be our publisher and the original version of MFM was not what it is now it was him interviewing people and it was still good and then one day someone didn't show up to the studio time that we had already paid for and he's like oh just come in and do the thing that we do and that's kind of how it came to be and by the way you know that story is not true right no that's not actually how it came about it I did not know that because I've heard you tell this I'm like is he telling us because you're not a guest Bail no I told you that what happened was it was a good time to come clean right in front of us in our 500 closest friends what happened was the hustle wasn't promoting the podcast enough and I was like how do I get them to promote it maybe I could tell them what's in it for them maybe I could make better content or maybe I could just invite Sam on the podcast and he will for sure make them promote it and so you guys are launching Trends and I was like hey come on and let's just [ __ ] about upcoming Trends startups I was like they have to promote that episode because it's like that's their thing well they call this The Prestige yeah you honey potted me it worked my point being when we got into this I thought it was a I thought podcasts were stupid I was like ah it's played out there's too much and what I've learned I'm not gonna entirely answer your question because the answer is I don't know but I'm gonna try and get around to it what I've learned is I think it's the most powerful medium that we've ever come across so like because when you're in this is it sounds weird but when you're in someone's ear it's like literally the headphones matter when you're in someone's ear for like 40 or 50 minutes per session like three times a week it's insane how what people learn about you it's way better than like an eight minute uh YouTube video so where do I think you I don't know Andrew what do you think is gonna go right so Andrew owns a podcasting company yeah I own a company called supercast um and we help um like huberman and other people monetize their podcast and I was talking to the guy who runs it actually yesterday weirdly and he said that podcasting there's 62 penetration in the United States so like 62 percent of people are aware but there's only two billion dollars in the market so podcasting advertising dollars and stuff and you think about like FM radio and how big that market is I would just look at FM radio and be like okay how big is that and if every podcast was monetized like FM radio it's probably that big so it can probably like 20x 50x 100x I don't know would you agree that podcasting is the hardest medium to grow yeah for sure I think that it has the benefit of what you said that people become really loyal very quickly but it's the hardest to grow so you can go on Tick Tock and you'll get a bunch of followers but if you said hey we're doing a live show in Austin you're not going to get anybody to show up in fact there's funny tick tocks of these tick tockers doing meet and greets that no one shows up to because they thought if I have a hundred thousand followers for sure people are going to show up and so you know the the trust is what matters not how many fans well also I'd say it's I'd argue it's the best medium to have subscribers on because someone will see it in their app and there's no algorithm that's going to get in your way whereas on YouTube or something yeah you've got the same monetization opportunities of doing events and you know promotions and ads and all the other stuff but it's so easy for the algo just to go away from you and you forget about the person the problem with it is unlike blog articles and things like that you can't fake it I can fake a Blog article and get you to click on it um it's podcasting is very hard for that reason and I always like joke but I'm like the best way to circumvent someone's [ __ ] detectors to not [ __ ] and it's like the best way to like get successful in podcasting is to be talented or like be really good and that's super hard because you don't actually have to be good at a bunch of like blogging and even newsletter writing you should have to be pretty good but you can kind of be pretty bad and still succeed podcasting is a lot more challenging who else hey this question is for Sean and Sam I'm building a website called askthepod.com it's meant to be AI companion for podcasts so you can listen to the episode and go back ask questions what do the books mentioned what are the links mentioned so is it okay to add my first million the pitches are less there's a moment yes next question who's got a question I want to see one from over here hand out pass the mic down please hey guys thanks so much love the podcast my questions for Sam I'm I'm a copywriter and I'm just wondering what your number one tip is for getting better at writing persuasively and specifically copy just some boring questions guys so copying word for word other people's work so what I like to do is I print out like whether it's a movie script or a great like blog article or a really good piece of copy that I like and I copy it word for word and it's almost like learning music you like play other people's music and you like see the texture of what makes greatness and then you like steal from a bunch of different places and make your own and that's what I like to do spend six months doing that one hour every day you'll get pretty good awesome thanks should we get people to line up maybe just so that there's no delay sure yep I'm open to that if you have a question which we would love to hear questions coming it's a good question where have you been all my life man Marilyn [Laughter] you're one joke away from getting this next seat on the on the stage here so I mean uh he said a lot of the past guys I hate the podcast my fault but um you hate podcasts huh you hate the podcast no it's sarcasm oh can we [ __ ] hey excellent question come on up the next one is Austin all right this question's for Andrew uh what have you learned uh the commonalities of the bottom 20 of Investments that you've had versus the top 20 what differentiates the bottom 20 top 20 the biggest that I do the big the biggest mistake I would say over and over and over again is when I bet on the business not the jockey right so I get really excited about the business and the business model and I go oh my God this is a great idea if I ran this or someone like me ran this this would be amazing even if I don't believe in the entrepreneur and I've realized that betting on the entrepreneur is 100 of the game right because they'll figure it out but don't you want to have have a business that any idiot can run oh yeah for sure but I'm saying like the ones where I've lost I actually haven't lost that much money in businesses where I'm buying the whole thing almost all of those work it's the ones where I'm doing venture or I'm betting on something or I'm trying to start a business that's why I lose all my money excellent next question hi Massey um so I wanted to ask how do you feel about Community Building obviously it's become really big for creators how do you see it in the podcast genre sort of that async communication with your fandom and building those super fans yeah I think for a podcast you don't really want to build a community as such you want to build a cult so so basically you're like what is it that we believe that not everybody believes and let's put that on blast and then a bunch of other people who believe that too are gonna be like finally someone said it or like finally they they do things the way I do things like for most of you here I I would bet like hands up if you consider yourself like I'm a real fan like I truly love the Pod I feel like when you guys are doing the Pod I could be sitting there right with you guys kind of bullshitting I bet like leave your hands up for a second um put your uh leave your hand up if the following statement is true it's not that you learned that much from us but it's kind of like you feel like you're hanging out with us that we are like you and that if we just happen to have met we would have been friends so like most people leave their hand up right I kind of confuse them but it's that's kind of what you go for I think most people when they do content they're trying to be heavily informational and they think they're talking down to people they're thinking they're educating them and whatnot what we do is we just talk about stuff we're interested in that we think and then it just happens to attract a bunch of other people who think the way we do and that's kind of like more like a cult than it is a community of people where we all gather around and serve each other human is a great example of that where like we were just talking about this backstage actually he does these two-hour crazy podcasts on like weird nerdy science stuff but he makes these subtle little comments about his dog and he seems like a real sweetie and all these things and people connect with him and he's handsome what does he look like shirtless ridiculous okay so Mike huberman invited me over to his house and he goes let's do a sauna and a cold plunger I've never met him before and I was traveling with my girlfriend and I was like oh like Zoe do you want to come with me and we'll go to huberman's she didn't know who he is and she's like no I'm good and we get there he takes his shirt off and he's just shredded like you could like shred cheese on his chest eight pack bulging arms tattoos and I'm there and I'm just like folding myself into a little ball and I was like thank God I didn't bring her our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better [Music] we'll do uh two or three more yeah all right next question hey guys um my question is what can partners of Founders do to support them on their journey I see that some of your wives are here just wondering yeah let's hand the mic to them let's see what they have to say we uh don't do it yeah everyone we've gotten the requests where people have like bring your wives on and we're like no we're not doing that this is the one thing I have don't give it to her um my uh I've done a good job of partnering in business and in relationships with people who are very emotionally stable because I am not and that and that has been awesome and so basically like there's been many many many times where I'm laying on the floor and I say [ __ ] this I'm out this sucks I'm bailing I'm gonna quit and she'll just like sit there and be like okay okay and then just like not really reply other than like all right you done now and and that has been like pretty wonderful to have someone who's like emotionally stable to balance out someone who's pretty neurotic um for me I remember when we were gonna like I always say oh we sold bibo as if it was like this easy thing that was for sure gonna happen what actually happened was the business wasn't really going the way I wanted and I was like I gotta just do something else so I said I'm gonna try my best to sell this business but if it doesn't sell just gonna shut it down I don't know I don't know what I'm gonna do next we're gonna just I'll figure something else and I just gotta change it up and I went to my wife Sony who's right here and I I said hey I'm thinking about doing this we were pregnant pregnant with our first and it's like hey how do you feel about me either selling this or more likely it's just not gonna work out and we get zero we have no job no health insurance and like I don't know what I'm gonna do next but I just kind of failed for five years straight so that's the track record I got going here and she was like let's go for it like no hesitation was just like I believe in you let's do this um like no kind of like go the go for it go for the upside and not worrying about what happens if things go wrong that really helped me because I was like oh cool like even if we strike out I don't have to I already beat myself up I'm not gonna get beat up more if things don't go well and I don't have to keep hedging it's like seriously workout muttering like broke ass [ __ ] see so I would say I would say there's three things so number one empathy but empathy without understanding is useless so like in previous relationships it would be like oh my God you know this person at work has given me so much trouble and the reason is that they want stock options and that means this or whatever and the previous Partners would glaze over and they'd go oh babe that's so hard but it was like Hollow right there's no understanding and so what I found really works is actually not like going into business and like obsessing over it but just making a bit of an effort to understand the actual problem and like you know for example like my girlfriend will listen to my first million or my girlfriend will read I mean so she'll make a bit of effort um and then what was my third thing [ __ ] brain fart I'll remember it later I'll tell you great so for those that are in the line I'm gonna walk down you're very quickly going to say your question I'll try to do five or ten real quick they will not be answering them but they may give an answer later first up what was the reasoning behind going public taking tiny public and what was the biggest lesson learned excellent next question question for Andrew I was curious about your follow-up to your kind of personal episodes about your dip emotionally and what that's been the last like 12 months for instance awesome a few more Andrew how did you start and grow your agency business excellent next yeah for the panel uh built a few businesses that did Millions now I found myself complacent lacking purpose yeah I'd just like to know your answer to that uh okay all right next one without turning it into Billy of the week Andrew's Impressions on meeting my boss's bosses bosses boss Michael Dell this week the stuff that you didn't put on Twitter already yep we're gonna pause for those of you that are standing waiting for questions take a seat and we'll do another round of q a so I think I think the first one was going public and why and I would say that going public is if you're an investor it represents the greatest opportunity right you can raise Capital at a great valuation you can buy it back when it's cheap you can use your Equity to buy businesses those are just kind of boring business reasons to be honest the reason kind of relates to my dip so over the last like two or three years I went through a bit of a funk and it came from this feeling of like I don't know why I'm making more money I don't have a thing right so when I started uh it was because I was like okay I want to wake up whenever I want and I don't want to have a job and then it was like okay I want to have a sweet house and a car and then I was like okay I got a sweet house and a car um now I want to pay off my parents mortgage and then after that and then it was like okay I want enough money that I can be fine and stop working but after that point which I reached seven or eight years ago um I just didn't know what to do with it and I tried all these different things you know I would go and like you know buy wine and fancy cars and go on fancy vacations and all these things and nothing really made me happy and so over the last couple years I've been trying to figure that out and I tweeted about this earlier and I mentioned this but I've been really admiring people that do two things one is they use money um to live life in a very interesting and creative way so Nick is a great example of that Nixa multi-millionaire he accidented his business he's done very very well and he just has an Investment Portfolio on autopilot invested in Tesla really early on and now he just focuses on meeting interesting people so that's one piece and I've done a lot of that just meeting interesting people and then two is figuring out how to give it away and actually impact my community so like I did that local journalism thing I think you guys know about and going public in Canada it allows me to actually give my shares to my foundation so I can actually do that so it enables that Andrew did the biggest Flex on us when we saw him for dinner the other night we're like oh what have you been doing and he goes philanthropy they were like oh okay okay big guy and then he didn't pay for dinner he didn't dedicate to donate to the Sam and Sean Foundation yeah the 500 dinner um and the other question was about Michael Dell you met Michael Dell this weekend yeah Michael Dell um he was so okay so like Michael Dell is like what you hope capitalism is right like I met him and he was the nicest most down-to-earth engaged Pleasant guy and I spent a lot of rich people I've met billionaires multi-billionaires he's worth 50. so he's worth like 10x any of the other people and he was just really genuine and nice and I asked him like okay what are your vices like how are you not like you you have like a Super PAC like some weird libertarian Island where you like hunt and kill people are you building like penis Rockets to Mars like what are you doing and he just goes no I got a couple nice houses I've got a jet I just like to work and build my business and I give it all away to my foundation and I was like okay that's pretty cool he's like the human version of a Dell computer [Music] totally but like a nice a nice computer that works well for you [Music]

Franz Ferdinand and like the killers and all these cool things and I heard the sound guys first of all sound guys I want to apologize I heard them talking before this and they're like what the [ __ ] is this like there's like is this like a rich guy's birthday party what is this I think they thought it was a graduation happening so sound guys sorry but it is what it is you always wanted to be a star you wanted to walk out to a sold-out venue and uh I guess this was it's one way to do it that's one way to do it so sound guy it's gonna be the lamest thing you're gonna see this week but maybe you'll learn something I don't know uh but this is awesome what do you think working [ __ ] you sound guys this is working come on guys I can tell who the real podcasters are sure so so we did this huge event in Vancouver we had like 1200 people in this massive theater and Sam sneaks out on the stage and I'm like what are you doing and he's he's peering around the corner taking photos and he goes I'm posting this on Facebook and I was like who the [ __ ] uses Facebook that's so weird and he goes all the people I went to high school with uh and so we wanted to start off by saying we are laughing backstage I and we were like right before we came on we're like we got to talk about Nick Gray does anyone here has anyone here met Nick Ray that was the guy that was just talking I just met him for the first time last night he is I don't know if he's the most interesting man in the world but he's like the most interesting man in Texas for sure I'll give him that I feel like on this show we always talk about billionaires and there's a lot of money billionaires but Nick is a friend billionaire yeah a lot last night so we hosted a dinner last night with like I don't know 15 people and Sam had set it all up it was gonna be perfect he had this like high-end restaurant table for 14 the time was locked in we got reminders we show up it's supposed to be beautiful uh you know just a first class dinner everything was taken care of and we get there and immediately the plan was blown up it was raining outside raining like crazy and our seat was like half outside yeah so we weren't going to be able to do it immediately Nick Gray improvises he's like hold on you six to the bar and then he sprinted because I pulled up I saw him running and I was like Nick Gray where you going and he was like I'm scoping out a venue and he I don't know where he went he runs into this place and he's like hey is this a event space soaking wet yeah and the women look at each other and they're like what and he goes what's the name of this place and they go it's called Miss Kitty's and he's like are you guys in event space What do you do he goes we wax women oh I got 15 dudes outside or not but he did he found us this like like abandoned Shack almost this amazing place and he he got us it was really like a shed it was an abandoned shed but it was like I don't know it was perfect it was exactly what we did it was outside the rain we were all in there was quiet we could talk and um and he hosts this thing so what Nick does is he has this book called I think the two-hour cocktail party and he's basically perfected the art of a two-hour party and I got to see it firsthand he takes out his harmonica to like get everyone's attention and then he uh he has this way of getting everybody to open up to talk to sit in the right places do the right things and it was incredible the best part though was he saved your he saved you so so Nick is looking around and he walks up to me he goes hey are you all good everything good uh and I say okay I want to go to the shed I'm excited I'm a little bit cold though is it gonna be uh is it gonna be heated and he goes hold on I'll be right back and he runs outside and like Sam said it's like pouring rain I don't know if you guys witnessed this yesterday but it was insane he comes back he's soaking wet he looks like that scene in Glenn Gary Glenn Ross when the guy's like at the doorstep and he brings me this sweatshirt which he had paid like 70 dollars for that's who Nick Gray is and the reason we're bringing this up is not because we like him to be clear we like him to be clear we like him but that's not why we're bringing this up but on our pod my first million uh and by the way is everyone here is anyone who doesn't listen to MFM here who's here for the graduation yeah okay and who here actually listens to us regularly all right let's get up and so we bring up all these like weird businesses that a lot of people haven't um heard about and this one is probably the weirdest one he he told me he was going to write this book about a cocktail party I thought it was a horrible idea and so far he sold 11 000 copies of this book which is insane and he um and so we have this dinner and we meet all these interesting people at this like 14 person dinner I think we had a guy there who sold a company that sold dog supplements which is like the greatest business ever because who knows if it works right like you have no idea he sold his company for 650 million dollars it was insane and he was telling us a story about this we had another guy who sells also dog related dog ramps so like so you're old or small dog can like go up on the couch and he does 18 million a year in sales there was another guy there that has a website that is like a Marketplace so you can rent a tractor and it's killing it we had a a person who has a bunch of owns a bunch of car washes that does tens of millions in profit what else we have anything else that was weird it was great it was crazy it was different than San Francisco if you go to San Francisco or New York you get one type of entrepreneur you get the AI crypto you get that in SF in New York you get something else and in Austin you get mustache hat tail and like I sell tractors online or I'll sell your dog some vitamins you know what you get a different type of entrepreneur but in the I bet in the crowd right now we gotta have some interesting businesses yeah who who here has a business let's get it get a sense of here so keep your hand up if you own a business and if you do over 100 raise them high raise them up if you do over a hundred thousand dollars keep it up if you do five hundred thousand keep it up uh one million five million okay we got a few twenty twenty million anybody no okay back to five no no no we got them over here okay 20 million 20 million and a couple of we got one over here okay two here one in the back any of those any of them profitable okay all right okay Nick we want to talk to these guys I want to know what their businesses are put their hands up hand is up I'm coming over here all right stand up please let's hear from you what's your name and what's your business Kelsey Larrick 365 Holdings or an e-commerce roll up sorry can you say that one more time 306 Mission please 365 Holdings we roll up e-commerce businesses I want to be Andrew Wilkinson when I grow up [Music] that you don't trust me he's blushing up here it's very sad who's the guy next to you uh Justin Turner attraction Capital our we have a business that sells equipment to fire departments what do you mean I love the way you said all that but I'm gonna can I just try being you for a second Sean Puri Puri dad of dad of the house change diapers like you just said just stepping but with such like you're probably right about me we sell like 37 million dollars worth of equipment that fire departments use and firemen use every day like yeah houses nozzles uniforms uniforms and why is Okay so and what about competition is it just like you're the only one in town there's only one place to buy them or do you have a moat of some kind we have exclusive distribution uh relationships in nine of the western states in the US how much profit on 37 million in Revenue uh it's about 10 margin does it feel uncomfortable when I ask you these questions should I ask like what do you like naked what was it like when you lost your virginity there's only one way to find out this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better um all right what else and who else who's got a weirder story than that anybody got a weirder story yeah put your hand up if you've got a really weird business okay maybe it was like weird yes yeah yeah hold on one sec please okay so this is a paper Koozie but I own a 40 000 square foot print wear shop warehouse and we print real Koozies so like it's really Niche and it's really random not these small boy cruises how long you've been running your business for um I've been in business for eight years but we do a lot of different types of printing um did you become a millionaire selling beer koozies that was my first largest e-com store that I created yeah sewing Koozies because I'm from the Midwest and we drink a lot of beer and that's you look like you're from the Midwest yeah anyone else have a really really weird business like dog ramp level weird business tell them to let the freak flag fly guy with the Austin stash there it is the capital v-neck shirt you just grow those when you fly in as soon as you cross the the border the mustache just pops up we make custom dog treats for Hospitality businesses so like when the Ritz Carlton uh has guests come with dogs we provide the dog treats that they give to their guests and why wouldn't they just use number normal dog treats just because ours have their branding on them oh very smart how big is that um we started 10 months ago and we've grown it to half a million in 10 months at run right wow that's all right this is cool we're gonna we're gonna hear more businesses because a little bit later we're gonna do like a shark tanky type of thing with a bunch of uh a bunch of pitches yeah you're we could put we could put the lights down two times okay there we go um so the cool part about like doing this stuff is we get to meet all these interesting people who are succeeding and some are failing which is actually just or more interesting um but speaking of a big success Andrew over here took his company I thought you're pointing at me no uh Andrew over here just took his company public it's called tiny it's not that tiny yeah that should be the tagline it's not that tiny and you were telling he was telling us a story that we had not heard about almost selling the company like six this was a backstage story can we tell it I think we could yeah we can we can tell it so there's really two stories so one by the way if you don't know I I gotta do the intro uh Andrew started this thing called meta lab it was an agency that made a bunch of um Tech stuff for big companies using the profits from that company he then started buying and investing in other companies which that whole company that hold company was or holdco was called uh tiny he recently took it public last week it's now trading at 850 million Canadian dollars which is only like 600 million bucks in real money uh no but it was it's a huge success but it all started because he had this agency called meta lab where he was um you know like I said doing stuff for tech people but you were saying earlier that how that was like the foundation for the success of everything else but you it you almost did something crazy early on yeah so I almost wasn't sitting wouldn't be sitting here so uh we were sitting at dinner the other night and talking about this and uh there's two stories so one uh I got very excited when you know you when you have a business you always know how much it sucks how hard it is to run and you always admire other people's businesses and so I always wanted like a SAS business a sexy business and so I started one I started this productivity uh business called flow it was like Asana except we didn't raise any money and we uh we had a great product but it just didn't go anywhere like uh task management task management which is one of the hardest things one of the hardest businesses in the world and uh I got so excited about it at one point that I I was up at like 11 o'clock at night I was feeling all manic I'd probably had a couple beers and I sent this email the entire staff and I said guys we're shutting metal lab down we're going all in on Flow and Chris my business partner who's here somewhere where's Chris Chris over there uh Chris was the CFO at the time and he looked at the numbers he was like we will be out of business three months how big was Flo was doing like 300K of Revenue 2 million or something like that and so because when you when when you were two million maybe two million in Revenue versus 300 000 300K or something I was just like moment of insanity and Chris went around to all the employees quietly and was like please don't leave please don't leave we'll be bankrupt in like a week and save the day and then the second story was uh Chris and I we you know running an agency he's really stressful and we got this offer for the business to sell it for 15 million this is about eight or nine years ago almost 10 years ago and fifteen one five fifteen one five and uh we actually went through the whole process you know spent four months going back and forth with this private Equity Firm we signed the documents you know my lawyer calls me in quivering hand I signed signed the documents and the wire is supposed to come in the next day and so I wake up I go to my local bank branch I go to the ATM and I look at the balance my balance is the same and I think okay it's probably going to come in later so I check later nothing next day nothing next day nothing I call the guide the private Equity Firm and he goes hey man I'm really sorry but we weren't able to finish closing our fund so the deal is not done so I legally sold the business and if the wire had come in I would my business would be worth maybe nothing at this point because this was the entire foundation of the business and we would be we would be tiny so we almost lost it all what do you think it's worth now meta lab I don't know hundreds of Millions for sure but I don't know it all could have just one decision actually you made the decision and it's and it was anxiety right it's Panic every I'm sure every one of you that runs a business everyone knows how miserable it is inside right I've you talk to people you look at them on the outside you go they're an amazing operator they have a great business but on the inside there's a great quote by Brent be sure he goes every business is a slow motion Knife Fight right like you just wake up in the morning you're sweating and you're fighting you're trying to survive right and we felt that way and we pushed through and it was okay but we almost gave in did you before you sold the hustle it's a HubSpot did you ever almost said did you come close to selling before that so when I was running the company I was miserable most every time so if you go on like Facebook or Instagram look at my pictures from like 2017 and 18 I was lumpy I was like pretty fat uh and I was like because I was eating all the time to like make myself feel better so I was miserable most the time and then this one company emailed me to uh they showed interest in buying and so I fly all the way out to New York and I start talking to them and I get in their office and like it's empty and I'm like where is everyone and they're like oh they're doing stuff and they take me to a an office to have the meeting and I look in the windows of each office and they're in a every employee is in a sexual harassment seminar because the CMO had just like you know gone off the rails and did a bunch of bad [ __ ] um and so they get me in a room they like send me a term sheet and they're like well buy your company for 10 million dollars but it's going to be all in stock and I was like well show me the financials and like let me see what's going on with your business and I got a peek in it and the company was vice vice media which means that deal I was so close to taking it it would be worth zero I'd probably be in debt because advice like the valuation has just plummeted and so I almost took that because I was so like desperate to get out sexual harassment seminar almost saved you he did yeah yeah you're a survivor [Music]

there's like dudes in prison for like two decades for selling like a little bit of weed and and she's just walking out of here with two bits she she basically took maternity leave from prison like what's happening I don't understand [Music] all right what up we're here Sam incredible shirt um I mean enough said not just one man to another I'd like to issue a quick compliment and I'd like to move on someone in the comments said uh oh wow Sam's dressed like a grown-up all I was all I was wearing was it was a coat and so I I'm sitting on top of his shirt so I had to bring it back down I had to let people know you know I could play Both Sides here yeah so Austin 316 baby I still get that dog in you which I think is going to be the next shirt we make is the uh still got that dog in him um okay where do you want to start first of all did you do anything crazy this weekend because I feel like your weekends are a lot more interesting than mine this weekend I watched cops on Sunday because that's what I do it's a solid session of cops but then so I'm um I I did this combine thing so like I wanted to I set like a new fitness goal every uh quarter and this year this quarter I wanted to score average for a wide receiver in the NFL combine if you Google like NFL combine averages you can find them and this Sunday I had to do my bench press test which is 225 times or 225 pounds and I had to do it about 15 times uh and I just about hit 15 and so my results for my combine tests I almost scored average I just missed it a little bit but mostly I was there wow yeah so I had but but the big discrepancy is when they do the combine they use an electrical timer for the 40 and I did it by hand so my hand time was the same as the electric time typically electric is is is slower meaning you have to add a little bit on the hand types but I kind of did it I kind of did it this was one of my favorite business ideas that still I don't I'm not aware of anyone has done it's not my favorite in that I don't I don't think this is going to be the best business I just it's a product I wish existed which is a traveling combine for your town so basically the way I was thinking about it was for Youth Sports so you know the market of like 33 year old guys who really want to test themselves before they leave their athletic Prime that's that's you and that's a small Market but a big Market is parents who really think their kid is a special snowflake and so um I was like why don't they have a version of the combine where you get measured height weight you know aren't wingspan speed agility strength vertical leap all that um and just do it for all kids who are in like competitive Sports because like you've seen that for like travel soccer or travel baseball parents spend thousands of dollars and like uproot their whole life just to kind of like pursue the kids athletic dream which is maybe actually the parents athletic dream and just be able to say that yeah oh he's really good yeah he's yeah he's he's playing with kids two years older than him right now they love that they love saying that their kids playing with kids you know yeah they're only there's 14 year olds in that league and um and so you know I think that that product is great because it's basically the Tough Mudder for little kids so you would be able to charge I don't know 150 dollars per kid to get tested plus another 20 a year to keep it all on file uh you know another 20 bucks to get the photo or the video montage that you're gonna get to post to social media and then every year you'll come back and get retested to see how did you do are you getting better or you're getting worse what's your what are your gains so I think this could be a viable business and I would love if this existed because I would love to go I'd love to get my kids tested or my my niece tested and uh even myself would love to to love to enroll so I'm taking this a step further first of all I knew I was going to marry my wife because when I met her father he had the ideal calves so he had the ball he had the ball in the calf wait well I like yeah I think I got a bulk ass well usually people who are explosive they have like a ball like a little tennis ball in their cap I saw I saw his like skinny ankle with the ball in the calf and I was like all right skinny ankle has to go with it right that's a thing oh yeah pretty sure things skinny ankles you need a skinny ankle you need a skin I remember I used the data girl and she did not have a skinny ankle and I was like I don't know if I could do this I don't know if it's gonna work it's not you it's me judging you that's a great way to put it and then I um I remember Malcolm Gladwell had a book and he says like if you're born uh if you're the eldest in your class you're more like you got to be born in like September so that you missed the August cut off so you get a full year to go dominate those hoes and so I was like we're thinking about where you know as I'm thinking about Family Planning I'm like where are we going to live what's the school year cut off can we can we fit it in right before that and then this weekend I got out a piece of paper and I'm like basically my life planned is I don't wanna I wanna rent until I buy a home that I want to live in forever because moving sucks and like the house that I bought now it was just like oh this is good enough and then now I'm like I don't want good enough I want perfect and so I'm just like plotting until and so I'm thinking about what that right home is going to be and I realize it has to have a five to ten thousand square foot like Warehouse so whichever sport they're in we're gonna build that we're gonna build something yeah yeah if it's if it's hockey gymnastics doesn't matter what it is we're building that there and that's is gonna get awesome at that and so I'm planning all that out now there's not a lot of houses with a five to ten thousand square foot Warehouse attached here just gonna let you know you may not have I'm building it well I'm gonna build it I've already looked it up I've already looked it up I'm building this thing also I have a theory that because my wife and I were from different like very very different ethnicity uh background don't get canceled I think our kit I well I think what I'm saying is I think if we you mix all of these genes until one child hopefully they're gonna be a super baby you know they won't get sick they'll have strong calves we'll see I don't know what's funny but when you say it like that you know it's strange but but acceptable socially if you had just said the opposite you're like you know the wife we have the same background we're pure then all of a sudden you stepped out of bounds so uh no I want I want a diverse kid they're gonna be a super baby because my wife uh is is mixed race and I'm telling you she doesn't get sick there's like all these things about her that like I like that like whenever she takes Med lesson she never has the side effects you know what I'm saying right so I'm just saying she's a super baby uh so we'll see what's gonna happen with that I will keep everyone updated though um we're we're waiting eagerly I've got a few interesting topics you want to talk about this Elizabeth Holmes thing first really really quickly so funny explain what what you what you saw I don't have a New York Times subscription by the way so I only saw the headline and the photo dude I I assume you pay for the New York Times can you tell me what was in the story and explain this whole thing I will so basically on Sunday yesterday today's Monday she uh Elizabeth Holmes from theranos you know uh fraudster whatever she the story of this is she was convicted of defrauding investors upwards of hundreds of millions of dollars got sentenced to 12 years in prison she pulled some a wild move where she had a baby and then the baby baby one is two or three years old baby two is now like six months old and she's making her plea to the government saying actually I have a newborn you can't put me in prison and they bought it and they did it and so they they delayed her prison sentence I'm not sure how it's going to end up New York Times did a big expose on her expose or like positive feature it seemed like a positive feature does expose mean negative because this was not negative this was yeah incredibly positive exposed it's like just like a guy with an accent saying exposed face exposed her as being a wonderful human is what they did uh because they make her sound like Heavenly and I will read the headline Liz Holm wants you to forget about Elizabeth and the whole story is about how Elizabeth was this Persona and how her new persona is Liz and she's a normal mom she speaks like a normal woman you know Elizabeth Holm was known as she would talk like this and she would wear like a black turtleneck and whatever and then she admits she's like I did that because I was a woman I'm blonde I want to be taken seriously so I had a low voice but listen to this uh and and the pictures of her now she's got long hair she's wearing blue jeans and she looks like a mom she looks like me honestly if I'm a woman and you go look at this picture we look alike um but listen to this one she does he's I mean she looks just like me it's like Elizabeth it says Liz Holmes wants you to forget about Elizabeth the black turtlenecks are gone so is the deep voice and she wants you to meet her new persona a mom and and this is embarrassing honestly for the New York Times to do this is pretty this is pretty embarrassing people get mad at us for bringing some people on the podcast to do interviews with no no no New York Times posting this photo of sampar with a wig saying and then doing this Rebrand from Elizabeth Holmes to Liz Holmes Liz Holmes are you kidding me and saying so a new persona this is absurd listen to this story so here's an expert I can't uh I can't shake us up so Mr Evans is her husband I think Billy Abbott so in the waning days of Thrones Miss Holmes got a dog a Siberian Husky named Balto last year when a mountain lion carried Balto away from the front porch Miss Holmes spent 16 hours searching the woods digging through the brambles and poison oak hoping to find them alive everyone knew that he was dead but Miss Holmes kept searching she was relentless the certainty the fanaticism it's the same way Miss Holmes kept hanging on Toronto throughout therados Miss Holmes eventually found her beloved husky Balto in the woods but by then the dog had been torn apart by a mountain lion and it's this like whole story about how her seeking her dog is this her getting carried up in just the fanaticism and she's really well intentioned but she just got caught up in it it's like pretty pretty wild and I have to remind people I wrote an article I actually posted it on here I wrote an article in 2016. so I want to call myself I read this in 2015 and the headline of my article is the coverage of theranos is utter and the first sentence is Elizabeth Holmes has been thrusted into the spotlight as a skateboard scapegoat for all things wrong with Silicon Valley but I find the media coverage around theranos drama to be utter and I explained why I think she didn't she's not doing anything wrong and how she's being hated on I left the article up because I'm like you can't you can't take down a mistake you got to leave it up but I I fell for this and when I read this article about New York Times I just realized I think I'm just a little a little I fall for all this stuff I read this and I'm like oh you're right she's just like you and me like let's let's not send her to prison I fall for all this stuff I mean look at this this is like there's a picture of her and this guy and their two babies sitting on a bunch of rocks by the beach Barefoot do you see this I don't know if you see this photo yeah it's like yeah yeah yeah tweet it out first of all it looks you're using mid-journey what is this why does this look so fake secondly like this whole like you can't just get a new haircut and drop half your name like if I got a buzz cut and came on here and said I'm shop hurry you can't be like oh that's Shaw Shaw's a great shot's a great dude it doesn't care about money shot is a tweet controversial things he's a different kind now he's a dad and then I take my kid to a place with some rocks take a photo that doesn't work like you know it is working though it is working though this is the greatest do you know who James Todd Smith III is no who's that LL Cool J baby oh my God at least James Todd Smith had the decency to like fully change it up and try to get a whole new persona this is crazy that she is uh that they're just trying to make this happen I mean I don't understand what's going on it's working though she's not she's not in jail she was supposed to report to prison like three weeks three weeks ago there's like dudes in prison for like two decades for selling like a little bit of weed and uh and and she's just walking out of here with two but she she basically took maternity leave from prison like what's happening I don't understand that's exactly what happened that's exactly what happened you know what and you know what's another thing that's kind of crazy is do you ever follow Ross Albright on or ulbrich on Twitter so Ross Albrecht is the guy who killed or he ran Silk Road and Silk Road was like a drug Marketplace and at the time in like three years it did like two billion dollars in sales he uh also is accused of um did a murder for hire for three people or four people none of the people died but the police took pictures of the people pretending to be dead and sent it to Ross and then he hired the fake killer which was was the police he hired them again and again and so anyway he got life in prison and he tweets about it I've got one of those guys that thinks that he doesn't he he should go to prison but dude life is a long-ass time for for eign that's all the time and he's tweeting in prison and I feel so sorry for these guys I fall I fall for all this stuff I'm you know I'm just I'm soft I think yeah yeah it sounds like it okay so you think Ross is you think Ross deserves like I thought like 25 years is isn't it actually one of the life sentences isn't a life sentence actually only like 22 years or something no he got life without parole like he's he's in there forever and he probably has multiple life sentences right and it went all the way up to uh the Supreme Court so they so basically the only way I believe he's gonna get out of prison is if a president uh says uh what was it called were they um uh put you out of prison I forget the word but uh that's like the only way that he's ever gonna get out and I don't need to like get him confused but my nephew Ross yeah a telemarketer needs to call Biden pretend to be uh well we have your cousin yeah someone from Indio and he's act like they work at Apple or the IRS I have a few more topics what do you got what do you got that's interesting so I want to tell you about a a I have a I have a feature here I got a billy of the week for you [Music] [Applause] [Music] a million dollars isn't cool you know it's cool a billion dollars it's been a little while since I have a good had a good Billy of the week I kind of felt one bubbling up a little bit and sure enough I got one okay so here's I'm gonna tell you some things about this person's career and uh you can you might know who it is you may not okay so this is somebody who's um so they've had a very successful business career sold a company uh to Berkshire Hathaway actually so they sold a a company that had done five billion dollars in a 10-year span of sales okay wow impressive um just now yeah yeah they do yeah yeah I got one eyebrow up all right let me see if I get that other eyebrow um they've won an Emmy they were a manager of Run DMC and 50 Cent was their intern at the at the time huh so music dominated business dominated uh how about uh what's uh what's an Emmy and Emmy is um the Musical TV I think oh yeah I mean it's actually TV so this person uh they wrote Jingles for for for TV and stuff like that and that's that's one way they made their their bones but they also managed to Run DMC which is the hottest rap group in the world at the time in 50 Cent I think I know who you're talking about they also uh you're a you're you're a fit guy I see I see a cutter too in in the in those arms the uh this guy's run over 50 marathons has run a hundred miles in uh 24 hours and actually had David Goggins live with him for 30 days and ended up writing a book about it sounds pretty pretty interesting he's a part owner of an NBA team does he have a successful wife that's the best part about it in his marriage he's not even the most successful one married who I someone who I think is the youngest female billionaire um in the world so incredible incredible pull on his part um let's see do I have anything else good about him here well I think you missed something very interesting the company that did five billion five or ten billion or whatever you said billions in sales wasn't that a jack company it was a private jet company fractional ownership of private jets the person uh oh there's a few more they also were a key partner in uh in a cpg brand everybody wants to start uh start a cpg brand see it in store shelves one day did that ziko coconut water you ever heard of that one sold to Coca-Cola yeah got it everywhere this is something they also wrote I think they also wrote the Jingle the official jingle for the New York knit Knicks for something right it sure did sure did um in addition to that sells online courses and he's like one of us he's just like us these billionaires I'm talking about you would you like to to guess who I'm talking about here so uh Jesse itzler is the ability of the week this guy's got a fascinating career right I I am like everybody's got a different thing they admire the thing I admire the most in people is people who play the game their way on their on their terms and their rules and one of the ways you see that is people who have multiple chapters in their career where they're able to turn the page to do something completely different so for somebody who started out in the kind of like jingle writing business to then be like a manager of a of a famous you know uh rap Squad to then starting a private jet company to then living in a monastery with monks to them becoming an endurance athlete to then becoming an NBA owner to them doing coconut water like I love people who have done multiple chapters of their career and I want to kind of talk about some of these different things he did I kind of run you through his timeline here of what he's done yeah and I I read the book it's called living with seal it was basically the book I think that got David Goggins to be famous it was awesome it was a good book oh was that before David Goggins kind of was like super well known yeah in the book I don't even think he mentions David's name and then it came out oh it came out who this person was I think he Jesse was at a marathon and he saw this guy and David Goggins you know everyone knows he's like a six foot six black dude he's like ripped and that's not typically what an ultra marathon runner looks like and he became friends with them and hired him so here's what he did so he started uh back in 1995 started something called Alphabet City sports records and these guys were making basically like music um Sports Marketing music production and they do it for three years they sell it for four million dollars to uh to some like you know small a small acquisition so get there that's how he got his first million and uh stays there for a little bit then they they set him in the same guy I think uh start Marquis Jets so Marquee Jets was basically like how do you buy hours on a private jet without buying the private jet so how can you get more people access to private jets and so it'd be like you would buy 25 hours of flight time on a private jet and it was like a debit card you get to just go use it then you get to buy more hours whatever whatever you want if you get a whole bunch of people doing that you might be able to use these Jets a lot more efficiently than they're being used when just one person owns it that's sitting on a Runway 90 of the time was that a big business so they never really they never fully released any numbers the one thing he said is they did 5 billion in sales in a 10-year period which is a lot of yeah but I'm wondering I'm not sure if I'm not sure of the economics of that though because it's like if you sell they didn't sell Jets but if you sold Jets like that doesn't necessarily like a jet cost 20 million dollars you actually only make 500k from it I don't you know what I'm saying yeah I don't actually here's what he said if it's legit here's what he said in an interview I'll put it this way we were extremely profitable we did cumulative 5 billion in sales 5 billion over 10 years so he says we were extremely profitable so we'll take that I also think that when you sell to Berkshire Hathaway they're not in the habit of buying unprofitable businesses so um they sold well they sold to Berkshire Hathaways company netjets which is like you know one of their one of their companies so they sold to netjets so then uh zika coconut water so these guys have been around for four years he partners with them and uh goes to them and says look let me invest let me help you guys grow this thing it was kind of like small at the time and in the same year he invests he gets Coca-Cola to invest 15 million and then eventually they sell the whole thing to Coca-Cola I'm not sure how much they didn't disclose that um but basically in a five-year period four or five year period he helps ezeko coconut water go from kind of unknown to pretty well known and uh and sold in 2013 too to Coke um they've done this thing they've done a similar thing they invested in kind bars uh as well uh he's got like basically he's got this brand investor group called 100 mile group and that's what they do they've also they invested in something called sheets energy strips with LeBron and Serena Williams and a whole bunch of famous people that one failed it was like caffeine you just put a strip on your tongue and it melts and it gives you like energy uh but that one didn't didn't work out uh Pitbull also a angel investor in that one so uh he bought a he was part of the group that bought a piece of the the Atlanta Hawks which is I think where I think he lives in Atlanta I'm not sure yeah they have a house in Atlanta and there I follow them on Instagram he's always in I think he owns a fat townhouse in New York he's also RV I've seen them like RV like in this huge tour bus looking RV thing I also think he has like six kids too the guy does it all yeah I know quadruple threat dare I say so he uh so he also started this thing called 29029 Everlast everesting and so what it is is basically they rent a mountain and they bring together like food music thick and it's a it's an endurance event where you can walk run climb crawl whatever you want to do up this mountain and then you take the gondola back down until and you keep going up and down up and down until you've done 29 000 and 29 feet which is the height amount ever so it's like a way to hike Everest without going to Everest without doing the the extreme risk of uh of surviving Everest he's got like his all-day running club you probably know about this one it's a paid membership club for for runners basically 400 bucks for the for the year and uh he's wrote two books he was a rapper back in the day back in 1991 he was a rapper called Jesse James and uh wrote the Jingle the New York Knicks theme song Go Go NY go and uh I mean just done it all really really incredible like Variety in his career I think this is prolific prolific good word prolific the guy's prolific was he me and then his wife is Sarah Blakely who sold Spanx I think it was yeah and Spanx was just acquired for like two or three billion or something like that do you know what the final it was just bought by Blackstone BlackRock or Blackstone whichever one is the one that buys companies bought it yeah and if if I remember correctly that company was entirely bootstrapped 1.2 billion 1.2 billion I think she owned most of it yeah so like they're killing it imagine being Jesse and not the most successful one financially in the relationship that's a good catch yeah what's like the best thing I wanted to make a joke there about like you know in the house he does the dishes or something like that what's like the uh what would have been the joke there for for him being like uh the subordinate in the house I think he manages the people who do the dishes at this point but he's definitely managing people no that I I've been following them for a while Jesse's been he kind of like became the self-help Guru and I was turned off by him and then I actually started following him more and I was like Oh no you're actually pretty awesome and he's the one he's made uh so he's been on the Forefront of a lot of really popular Health Trends so he was really into saunting for a long time and now like hot and cold exposure is quite popular he's been doing that for years uh he's also been doing fasting I would follow him like years ago and he would go like five days without eating and he would try all these weird help things and now a lot of these things are popular he was he's been doing it for a while and in his book uh it's called living with seal he basically found David Goggins David Goggins lived with them for 30 days it's an awesome book it's a really good book I mean he tells all these crazy stories about this guy and so I'm a big fan of Jesse one of the ones I got to know him I was turned off when I like first heard about him and then I realized he's pretty badass what do you say that I had the same same reaction I saw him just in a bunch of like public speaking slash like ads being like you gotta take my course and do whatever and I was like you know usually typically people who are like pretty self-promotional with that sort of stuff it's like their their main business is actually the talking uh like their main business is the selling you on how to be successful not like having been successful themselves that's just like a general rule of thumb so I was really surprised when I looked into it I was like oh wait actually this guy's like pretty prolific he he's pretty legit I'm surprised I had that opinion of him though I kind of bucketed him mentally as like online business Guru guy um you know but maybe I don't know maybe maybe that was a total mischaracterization now that I see kind of all the stuff he's done I also think one really interesting thing is uh have you heard about his pickles thing no what's that so by the way I invited him on the podcast we follow each other on Twitter so I DM them last night and I was like hey you should come on I want to hear I want to hear about some of the stories that the experiments that didn't work out because this is all the the wins I I'm sure if you're a guy who's tried this many different things you had to have a bunch of uh a bunch of you know trial and error along the way so he posted this on Instagram last month he goes why I'm excited about pickles all caps and he goes last week I said I wanted to buy or partner with a pickle company and boxes of pickles have been shown in my house all week it's exciting I'm doing a live taste test this week uh they're all so different lots of people asking me why pickles here's why he goes first of all can you name five pickle companies I hate pickles I don't know can you name any pickle companies there's probably only two or three that I like to buy I buy a lot of pickles I'm a big pickle guy yeah big of the Pickled pickle scene so he says can you name five pickle companies exactly it's a crowded Market but not many dominant players second pickles are underrated Americans eat 20 billion pickles a year and there is no buzz in the category not much fun for creativity all the packaging is the same number three the average American eats nine pounds of pickles per year number four the average American household buys a new jar every 53 days number five purely pickles are a big deal entrepreneurs look to make things better often those new ideas come in the form of products they use daily they get excited when they see a new Lane and I see a new Lane here and so um he created this thing this pickle company called Hoya Yaya pickles and he's like this is the day of our new company we just need the perfect picture is that like a Yiddish thing I have no idea well pickles are like a popular amongst Jewish people he's Jewish just Hoya is that like a maybe it's like a Yiddish name I don't know it's a funny name and he said it says if you go to their bio they only have 2 000 followers right now but I'm gonna follow this I want to hear the story play out he goes we're crowdsourcing our brand while we create the best pickle company while we find the best pickle company to partner with DM if you have a clean ingredient pickle company and then he's basically like uh like it's got to feed and it's like here's a picture of Adam Sandler casually eating a jar of pickles it's like he's just trying to build a speaker company he's trying to do the coconut water thing again for pickles this time and uh I think we could probably pull it off dude pickles are awesome I'm I like Jesse we should get them on if Jesse if this makes it to you this will make it to you anytime yeah remember when you I went to hustlecon your conference and um there was the guy who created method soap and he created Ollie vitamins he created Welly Band-Aids he created three hit consumer you know cpg Goods uh that were sitting around something Eric Ryan I think is his name it's him yeah he's like a he's like a he's like a flamboyant looking guy he wears like these bright glasses and he his hair is combed uh exotically I like that guy yeah yeah exactly he looks like he uh you know was born inside of a Warby Parker or something so he uh he was on stage and he gave a great talk at your conference one of the things he said they were like how do you it was like how do you come up with ideas like which you did Band-Aids you did vitamins you did soap what how do you choose where do you see the open space and he said basically the same thing that Jesse just said he goes I walk down the aisles of a grocery store and I just wait till I see a sea of sameness so basically a sea of sameness is an area where there's a shelf where you see like a ton of products with no differentiation it's just a bunch he's like for soap go look at the sobile it was just green bottles of the same product in the same shape sitting there everywhere he's like so we came out with a different bottle it was blue and had clean ingredients that was going to be our thing and that was method so he's like go to the Band-Aid section same thing CEO of sameness whereas we took a different approach and he's like Band-Aids we're trying to all be this like nude color that was like same color as your skin he's like but nobody's skin is actually that color so it's just like this like kind of you know you're just trying to like hide something it goes we you know we believe you know your every cut is a badge of honor it's a great story to tell and so we want to put a badge on that on that uh on that wound as that stands out and that was his approach to that one or whatever and so same thing with the vitamins aisle he's like the vitamin dial was just a bunch of labels that all said like vitamin D3 b12s you know C blah blah blah he came in and with Ollie they have like a different looking jar and it'll say like better sleep or it'll say better hair and nails or whatever right like it'll say the benefit of the vitamin not the vitamin itself and so just taking a slightly different approach to these like kind of stale categories was the was the idea and I think if you go down the pickle aisle probably a pretty stale category it's probably as a sea of sadness and so I think this is gonna work well Jesse if you're listening come on man come on this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better we were I was one time I was doing one of these events and we were looking at speakers and we typically had never paid speakers and for some reason his name popped up and like his agent sent or some agent sent like how much his fee is and it was like a hundred thousand dollars to get him come to come and talk so the guy's killing it and a variety of places that's right um all right I have another interesting person um and I'm gonna explain why I found this person have you ever heard the phrase the way you do one thing is the way you do everything hate that phrase why do you hate that phrase because I do a bunch of things terribly that I'm like does that mean I'm gonna do everything terribly uh so I hate it because if it's true I'm in trouble so I believe that that phrase to be true and I believe it to be true because I've always I've got on myself because I'm not entirely like you but I'm a little bit like you where I like to like you know free ball it I free ball lines you know what I'm saying I just I try to figure out as I go but my lack of discipline and my lack of process sometimes really hurts me and so I'm trying to make up for that and so I've over the past couple years I've been obsessed with the phrase the way you do one thing is the way you do everything so for example you're late for this pod you are also late for your kids Home Depot class that's right so the way you do that one thing is when you do everything and it's like one of the that's one of the reasons why the military they make you make your bed in the morning is because they say if you start making your bed in the morning that means you're gonna eat breakfast the correct way that means you're gonna run the right way which inevitably you're gonna fight the right way and so like I believe in that and so I was looking for examples of that and so have you ever heard of this company called uh racketon this is a company called rackington it's basically like Amazon in Japan it started by this guy named uh his name is he goes by Mickey so Mickey uh Mickey Tani is his name and he's similar to like Jeff Bezos in Japan where he's like those kind of like pretty hardcore guy but he's lovable and he's he's a Titan of Industry so rakitin is like Amazon in Japan it has 32 000 employees 14 billion in Revenue this huge thing and I love reading about Japanese entrepreneurs because there's something about their culture that fascinates me and they have uh this thing where he has like uh a handbook that he gives every employee and I got a hold of that handbook a few years ago and I read it and one thing that stuck out to me was in chapter zero the very first thing that they have you do the whole what that chapter is about is it's called the uh the book is called the basic principles but in chapter zero it's called they outline how at their offices they don't have any janitors and the reason why they don't have any janitors is every Tuesday at four o'clock they have an hour of clean time which basically means that uh so no janitors coming by but every week at the same time in the morning everyone at rackington from the CEO to the lowest level staff cleans their workspace they take out rags and spray bottles they clean off their surfaces they pick up trash they get on their hands and knees and they polish the legs of the chairs and it's part of the company of the culture and uh it's been like that since the beginning since the company was around and it's the purpose of it is to foster a sense of ownership he says we do this activity to remind ourselves that everything the company does is relevant to each and every one of us to keep a sense of direct involvement top of mind it's also an opportunity to reaffirm that the entire company is a team by having everyone regardless of position work together on the same task and I read this when I was leading the hustle and I tried to make that a thing and it didn't work no one no one got into it no one got it I'm so glad you said that last part because I've done this so many times I've just Michael scotted it so many times where I will read something or hear something or have some kind of crazy idea but usually it's I hear I heard some cool person did some cool thing and then I'll try it in our office and I just got these looks like okay and then within four days the thing is gone and I'm like oh man I really needed a different like force of will or Charisma or some like a leather jacket I needed something I'm missing something to make this thing because the way you do one thing is the way you do everything man you didn't do a good enough job neither did I and once I failed at that I realized I need to do this stuff even more and so with Hampton with Hampton I'm trying to figure out what is that thing you know that we can all do and I realize right now it's our Zoom setups so I actually I linked it down here in our document but I have this I have this so if you go to scroll all the way down to where it says Zoom I have this document called how to look good on camera and the reason I do that is because when people apply to Hampton we interview everyone and then me or Joe or someone else goes and watches the interview to see if that person should be approved and I saw one of our guys his name's Alex pattis he works at Hampton and he's awesome but I saw that his camera setup was horrible I was like dude this looks like a ransom video you filmed on a Nokia cam camera like this looks really bad and so we're gonna have to like we're gonna have to like fix this you know first impressions matter and so I created this guide on how to make your zoom camera look good and then we gave everyone a budget to go and buy like the proper lighting and things like that and that's like my one thing that I'm trying to implement now whereas like I won't talk to you unless your zoom camera looks great it has to look good and it doesn't have to look like professional like you and me like a DSLR camera but it's Gotta look pretty good and you can make it look pretty good with like 500 and so we're making everyone have their zoom camera look great so first of all this dock is hilarious and the video of the picture of the guy who looks like the ransom guy is hilarious um I think you're close but I don't think you quite got it I hate to I hate to do that too tell me more as a friend to just pop the bubble like that but I think you got half of it right meaning I think you Your solution is great but you pick the wrong area meaning this is too logical it's too quantifiable why they why this is a good idea you said well first impressions matter everybody agrees with that and you say well you're doing sales essentially for the company so you need to like show up the right way it's almost like you could calculate the ROI the beauty of the Polish the chairs and your leg chairs or whatever is that it's unnecessary same thing with the make your bed in the morning first thing or wake up at 4 30 in the morning just to harden yourself as a person or take a cold shower is It's gotta have some it's got to be something you kind of don't want to do or seems unnecessary to do and it's like but that's the point so what's an example this is almost like you kind of gotta do it this is almost like uh yeah it makes sense I agree I'm not taking a leap of faith here I'm just doing what you know maybe I was held back my money here in the tech setup and I just get around to it um so I think it's good but I think you need something that's a little bit more story worthy which is like yeah at Hampton we made everybody blank and I think if you say with everybody fix their camera setup it's not going to have that same Showmanship it's not gonna have the same uh punchiness as if it's something that was completely unnecessary to do so I've got to figure out what that thing is though but I but I definitely want it I want I want a stick oh yeah I love a good stick yeah I love a good stick I'm a big fan of sticks I think they add a lot right now my current stick is your your zoom camera has to look good it's Gotta look great you get it everybody has a small tattoo on their ankle of a date five years of the future which is when Hampton will be worth a billion dollars right you have to go you had to go pledge baby you gotta go get Brandon if you're gonna get on this but I love that stuff and that's another thing we're thinking about Hampton is we're like What rituals do like our members need to have in order to get them bought in and so I'm like trying to like research like fraternities and sororities but I love this in the same way that Tony Robbins his shtick is that uh what's it called a firewalk yeah walking a coal which like isn't even that big of a deal is it have you watched on coal yeah I did it I've done it twice at his events um yeah it was like a pretty sanitary thing isn't it yeah it's right there's no there's no no risk in doing this basically he's like yeah you gotta get your mindset right you got to get in the state and when you're in state you could do anything it's like I'm pretty sure that like they basically just make you stand on this thing that's wet before so you get like moisture on the bottom of your foot and then you can just walk across these coals and it's not gonna like unless you stood there and stayed there it won't uh make it past that layer of water or whatever this I'm like it's just actually science that if you're if you walk across this much thing for this much time with this much water on your foot you're not gonna get in you're not gonna have any problems and so a great actor dude a great actor needs a good set and good props and I'm like reading this book about JP Morgan JP Morgan was this guy in the his Gilded Age whatever rich guy and he one time was trying to settle an agreement with like five different like Union heads of like different steel companies and he goes come out to my boat and we're gonna go for a boat ride and we're gonna discuss he gets on the boat and he goes all right everyone any like the the pilot of the boat uh like goes off in a rowboat he goes we don't have a um Captain uh we're stranded out here until we settle a deal we are not leaving until the deal is done and it's that Pizzazz that show midship every great every great actor needs a good set he he set up that set wonderfully and I'm constantly looking for what's our ritual what's our SEC going to be how can I like add the showman before and I studied a bunch of different like kind of rituals basically anybody that has a really strong Community what what is it everything from actual Cults uh European soccer clubs where the fans are just insane um like I went to Duke and we used to live in a tent for three months which is basically living in a line to try to get into the big game really and everybody behave everybody behaves a certain way people don't even like basketball or live in an intent for three months just to do this just because they get swept up in the rituals the movement um I remember I never been before man but I talked to people I was like dude there's something about burning man that gets people to act totally differently than their normal behavior what is it and they told me that when you enter burning man I might butcher this because again I've never been but when you get to Burning Man so you first you wait in line in your car basically for hours hours and hours trying to just get to the entrance and when you get to the entrance apparently you kind of like you get out and they give you a name they give you like your new name your burner name and then you like roll around in the sand or some like that have you heard this yeah like Firefox lion boy yeah and then you roll in the sand and like that's like your like entrance thing or whatever yeah um I did something at my last company that was kind of like that which was uh just roll around the streets of Soma no no I'm just joking we had uh we had a meeting once I was ever everybody had been at the company for like the the was it like the the hepatitis huddle everyone's gonna go out in the streets of Soma and roll around hahaha it's syringe Sunday baby get on the ground yeah with our body the uh but I did this thing where after six months of working I um I called a team meeting and I basically gave a presentation to the team about each one of them and I basically said this is this this is Sam this is the same story if this is Sam's superpower and I gave everybody a superpower and I was like this is um this is Derek Derek was our designer I said designers are notoriously they're just artists they're fickle they need inspiration they you give them a deadline artists are terrible with deadlines and uh but Derek's superpower is that Derek is the mailman he delivers every day of the week except on Sundays and I was like Derek if you give him something at 9am he will have it to you by 5 PM every single day without fail except Sundays you message Derek he's not going to get back to you and I was like which is like it's totally not true but you've just implanted that into him it was like mostly true everybody's thing was like believable believably true but it's amazing that everybody started living up to it everybody started referring to him as the mailman and then he would like sure enough he would always deliver them he never didn't deliver because he had to live up give people a reputation to live up to um with fur Khan I was like fur Khan his superpower is that he'll always lend you five dollars whenever you ask for it just you asked for him he's got you he's always got some change on him always always good for 20. he um I was like he belts and I was like he is just a melter you can't bring around him it's like radioactive it'll just start to melt right away and so he otherwise the Freak Out was pretty like uh direct and I think some people you know were intimidated by him and they felt like he was like you know criticizing them when he would say something but then it reframed it as he's just using the super he's just he just he's great at identifying and melting it's not you it's it's the that he's melting and so um so I tried to do that for everybody and I I really that was one of the few like management random like random experiment sticks that actually worked that people really like they liked that they had a superpower and then they kind of I named it and then I reinforced it and people uh people started using that one actually in the office whereas most things was just me trying to make fetch happen and they're like it's not gonna happen well I remember early in my career like I worked the only job I ever had this guy had a shtick and he would try to he would get everyone to clap like slow clap before yeah yeah it was like that and I remember thinking like this is so stupid and then after a couple weeks I was like all right yeah now I'm a little bit older and I'm like uh stick is good a good stick is great like it's really good A lot of that like performative stuff I just think I'm I'm too cool for this I don't need this and then you realize like no man humans are not logical we need emotion like this emotional stuff matters like the difference between a highly motivated person and who's using their emotions effectively is significantly better than someone I mean that's like if you look at like different Wars like you could like look at like who is like fired up the right way versus who's not and it really has a massive difference I think that uh leadership basically if you want to be a leader like three things are true the first is that you have a higher standard for yourself than anybody else has for you so it doesn't really matter what your job title is but if you hold yourself to a higher standard then your manager holds you to you are a leader and so that's the first to me first definition of leader second is somebody who understands what the emotional state is and what it needs to be it could transfer it so basically anybody who can understand that morale is low it needs to be high they can shift the mood they can shift the energy or everybody's a little too comfortable we need to get a sense of urgency they they understand the state of the emotional state and they know how to shift it that's two and then the third is they see things how they actually are not worse than they are not better than they are how they actually are and then they paint a picture of how it's going to be better than it currently is to me those are the things are you reading this are you reading this off something no that's just wow straight off the door that's a good little I think that's a good little uh a good little thing the next tweet there you go that's a great one actually if I if I wasn't a retired Twitter artist I would have tweeted that one um I got one other quick one for you I want to read you Justin yeah yeah I've been eager to see what you're gonna say I want to read you something so this was uh you're on that Justin Mayer's tip so we talked about just the mayor's at the last pod Justin's a very fantastic entrepreneur you clearly been reading his blog you've been obsessing I actually somebody sent this to me um afterwards I haven't I've only read this screenshot that they sent um somebody sent this to Ben they go I feel like every time you've done this last time you read you said you're reading a book and I was asking about the book and you're like I've actually uh you you go I just read this awesome book and turns out you're five pages in yeah it's awesome you love at first sight you know we need to know all right so here's what it says here's here's a quote from his blog it says I give the same advice to friends who want to start a company startups are momentum plays that's the key thing startups are momentum plays you choose you choose the idea you are most excited about you put a date on the calendar for three to six months at that date you're allowed to reflect on your commitment level until then you do not spend any time questioning it should I be chasing xid over there should I be doing this over here no you put blinders on for a period of time you allow yourself to dig into the problem space and spend your early time actually working on the thing versus intellectualizing is this the exact perfect right and obviously huge thing I should be working on at least that's what I've struggled with when working on something new uh startups are momentum plays and how you have to put blinders on for a period of time to just actually do the thing versus intellectually like constantly questioning or considering the Thing versus 10 other things and paralysis by analysis um what do you think of that yeah I've told you about this I think I have this thing called worry time where I say like all right today of the week I can worry about these things once that hour is up no more worry time it's only due time I can I can go back and reflect and figure out my worries and figure out what's like legit and what's not at a later date sometimes I'll do it six months out so like when I was searching for kind of like where you are now when I was searching for which company to start I go all right for the next six months it's plan mode all I'm gonna do is read consume I'm not going to decide a thing I'm just going to consume and read and then at the end of six months then I'll make a decision and uh so I I love setting like clear dates where you can't do anything I also love momentum so when someone talks to me about starting a business I go try and see if you can get sale sales in the next 24 hours like what's the least amount what's the smallest thing you could do to get a sale in 24 hours because the second you make one dollar if everything it feels like changes it's like as if you had poor eyesight now you have glasses on it like that that little that little bit of eyesight gives you a boosted energy and you feel significantly better to get the second dollar which makes getting to 100 and then a thousand easier which at a thousand you go to a million so and you have this really cool line you say a b z where you go you worry about step a and how to get to B and then don't worry about anything else but you can think about Z occasionally which is like your big motivating factor but don't think about you know all the whatever the other letters are yeah if this reminds me of something I've seen a bunch and I have a sensitivity towards it because I did this which is uh a lot of people want to do like startup Studio idea lab I want to do multiple things at once basically so they want to do parallel entrepreneurship I ran an idea lab for five six years or so and I loved it because it's the most fun thing you could possibly do it's like you get I had a blank check and an awesome team and I could pursue not just any idea many ideas at the same time and I could go from meeting to meeting to meeting and have all this amazing variety of Adventures and challenges and ups and downs and it was like I felt like I got 20 years of experience at four but notice that I said experience instead of success because it was a lot of lessons learned and a lot of skill sharpening it wasn't a lot of winning and if you would have had to have sticked to one idea do you think that would have been better or if you would have had a smaller budget sticking to one idea would have been far better or just I'll give you kind of the three options so there's what I was doing which is parallel entrepreneurship so you basically take multiple ideas and you pursue them in parallel um this is the easy trap to follow to once you already have a win under your belt this is why you've seen um you know Mark pickis with Zynga create an idea lab Kevin Rose created an idea lab the guy from Uber created an idea lab the guy from uh you know who whatever there's there's like 10 of these examples out there that's usually successful founder wants to do startup still but has too many interests too many ideas more ideas than time so they create a lab a studio that's going to create multiple hits is the idea and almost none of them have any hits whatsoever um zero zero is the is the average and the median for these for these uh Studios that don't it doesn't work it doesn't work for a bunch of reasons I could get into but it's this form of parallel entrepreneurship very sexy but uh not great for actually winning so there's parallel then there's serial entrepreneurship serial entrepreneurship is like the Jesse itzler thing which is like I'm gonna do this for this period of time and then I'm gonna do a different thing for the next period of time or I'm going to take this one thing and if it doesn't work I'll pivot it into something else and then I'll try that for a few years but I'm gonna give each one a several year you know chapter basically of of effort and focus and like full intensity on one one thing but then I'm willing to switch what the one thing is I'm not trying to run the same company for a decade uh or stay in the same industry for for 25 years of my life I'm gonna switch around I'm gonna hop around so that's cereal and then there's the last one which is repeat entrepreneurs the person who actually does the same company or stays in the same space it's like uh I created one d2c brand I'm gonna create another d2c brand or I run one company and I'm just gonna run it for 15 20 years or um you know I did a newsletter business I'm gonna do another newsletter business and that's repeat entrepreneurship and so I personally have tried parallel I've tried serial I haven't really tried repeat I've stayed away from that one I think if you wanted order of in order of most likely to succeed repeat is number one serial number two parallel number three and in terms of fun parallel is number one serial is number two repeat is number three and so I actually think that the correct decision for me is cereal it's the has enough fun and enough winning uh that that's the that's the choice versus going for maximum success probability or maximum fund with lowest success profit which idea do you think would have been the one that you should have stuck with at Monkey Inferno I think for the most part it was ideas that we weren't we well we should have done so what we did do versus what we should have done what we did do was we tried to create Hit social apps why because before that the the main the guy who was running it who hired me and the guy who uh became the main investor or was the main investor they had built a social network called bibo they had competed with Facebook and Myspace back in the Heyday of social networks they sold it for 850 million dollars Facebook went on to become worth 850 billion dollars and there was always this sort of like Shoulda Woulda Coulda and at the time people were pretty down on Facebook it felt like there was gonna be something new but nobody knew what it was and sure enough turned out to be you know Instagram then Snapchat then uh Tick Tock eventually and so new things did come out that part was right but the wrong part was trying to recreate re-chase that dream because it was just so low chances of success so we build messaging apps and social networking apps and all this stuff and it just was really really hard to get it to work uh what we should have done was we should have built either tools for startups or tools for developers because we knew what the pain points of an early stage startup were and we had a bunch of developers we had like 18 developers and so it was like we could have built products that what was the total budget what was your budget for the do you know like three million four million I think we burned about three to four million a year um in funding and which isn't that much money for for 20 people well we also had uh it wasn't fully 20 uh 20 was like where it got to at the peak but also I would say the core team was like let's say 15 people so 15 people I think you could do math maybe I have it longer there was I don't know if that was pre-taking into account the profits from one of our businesses so we also revamped one of his early businesses that was his cash cow birthday alarm and birthday alarm was making millions of dollars uh profits before it had been declining year over year for five years straight we kind of like revamped it try to turn it around and got it back to you know slightly growing basically at that by the time I left and so um that covered a portion of the bird so I don't know if the three or four million was pre-that or post that I remember at this point it's been six or seven years since I was doing that which was there uh was there a developer tool idea that you thought you should do but you didn't and someone else came and took the opportunity so I'll tell you three ideas that I think would have worked that we had that we literally discussed and had the idea for uh the first was uh user testing so I used a very early pro version of user testing and I was like hey this is a pain point for a startup like like the the company the company user testing which is basically like I could pay a hundred dollars and I could get four people to go try our app talk talk through it because they would find bugs they would tell us if they liked it or if they didn't like it they would tell us what's confusing about it and I was like these videos are amazing like this is saving me so much time versus having to go in the wild and find literally fine people stand over their shoulder and watch them do this or just guess and I was like this is a super useful service and I told uh Michael that one day I was like hey I think we should build this for startups and I think we could outpace them in terms of marketing because we're here in Silicon Valley we understand the startup game like we're we would be good at getting early stage companies to use this and usertesting.com is like a multi hundred million dollar a year business now yeah yeah exactly it went public at a period of time hey we're public I think it went back private now um but yeah it was a it turned out to be a big success you know eight years later uh like they they took it all the way and took it to IPO and he was like yeah could do seems kind of boring right and I was like too young and weak and I I was 24 years old and he was my hero and he was you know my boss at the time kind of thing and I was like yeah yeah you're right you're right you're right you're right dumb sorry sorry sorry I even said that right like I backed off it right away same thing happened with cryptos 2013. our sis admin the the guy who's running like our whole server setup was like guys I'm mining Bitcoin on this server and we're like mining what and he tells us why Bitcoin is going to be the next big thing all of our all of our Engineers were like yeah this makes sense we love this um and our team loved it and what our CTO was like hey no normally this guy never had product ideas he was like tell me what to build I could build anything he's like I got an idea and I was like oh Paul's got an idea fantastic let's hear it he's like um Bitcoin I think is going to be a thing and there's like no there's only one exchange there's a startup called coinbase but like they're just getting started and he's like I think we could build either an exchange or one of the other like financial services for this like cryptocurrency industry and he's like they don't he's like you it's hard to take a payment you know you can't take credit card you can't do any of these things that you're going to want to do to enter like for a human being to use crypto and he's like we should just start building Financial Services let's start with an exchange and then let's see maybe we could do you know debit cards on-ramp off ramp like what can we do and he was so motivated he built like a prototype overnight he got he he started coordinating with his designer he like shoved the product manager into a corner it was like you know shut up I got this and it was like a great sign for a startup when the engineers are like I know what needs to be built here I I intuitively understand and then our lawyer our in-house counsel called up uh our investor was like Hey the guys are talking about Bitcoin I Googled it I think it's for drugs and like you know I don't know if this is the right idea so he came in he was like you know I don't mind losing the you know three or four million dollars we spend on on whatever like that's okay that's an acceptable bird but I'm not going to jail but I'm not trying to go to jail and I'm not trying to do like money I'm not trying to handle like money in serious like ways like this um I think like Bitcoin isn't this like snake oil I don't know and I like kind of can I convinced him enough that day to buy Bitcoin I think like he was basically like I don't know sounds a little sketchy he like bought some as a hedge but he was like I don't think we should do I don't think we should be in the Bitcoin business because you need to you need licenses to do this you're basically talking about building a bank it's a super gray area uh I I'm not trying to lose my billion dollars like I can lose the 3 million I can't lose my billion and I was like dude the message I got block Michael Bert she just blocked you guys hard I I don't mean to blame him the the mistakes were all on me I'm just I recalled two examples where I think we had good ideas that we did that was the third one see through the third was we had built blab into a business that was like a really good video chat product and uh it was it got to four million users so it was like kind of a thing so it was basically like if you see Clubhouse today or like uh Zoom today it was like basically like a zoom caller Google Hangout four people could be on the screen talking but there was like a live audience and anybody could kind of request to join and jump in from the audience and start talking so you could do like calling shows and like that uh and it got pretty popular like Tony Robbins was using it like famous bands were using it the UFC was using it Martin's Corelli Martin shkreli was using it yeah exactly um and so we had we got to four million users but it was like so we thought maybe this is that thing that big social product that we've been waiting for but it was pretty clear to me that it was too leaky everyone was high yeah sure was gonna be too high people weren't going to use this every day or the people who did use it every day they were there just to make friends so therefore it wouldn't grow because they didn't bring friends they were there to make friends and so you have this problem where um if you're if you're sticky users are people who are there to meet people they're not going to bring people and so you're either not going to grow and you're gonna have stickiness or you're going to grow and you're not gonna have stickiness was the problem we ran into which is why by the way when I wrote that thread that went viral calling explaining why Clubhouse was not going to work back when Clubhouse was at its peak the reason I knew that was because we had built a very similar product and run into all those same issues and sure enough it's all playing hey so you didn't get rich but at least you got kind of popular on Twitter so there's that what's the it's like I just dropped 400 at Chuck E cheese and I got this like you know a little a little slinky laser pointer yeah yeah so that's cute you guys you have your little Twitter thing that's nice exactly so so that was the thing there the move there would have been to shift towards like Citrix was the big Citrix had a thing called WebEx which is like they're like uh video chat like for meetings and that was horrible webinars and the obvious thing was we had built a way better tool for webinars or or like kind of large company chats like uh All Hands meetings and things like that if we had pivoted to B2B basically um we genuinely had a like sort of like you know 5x better product than them at the time and I think we could have made it successful we even had the idea we were like should we do this we're like uh kind of got to do sales and I don't know like do we want to do that are we are we a B2B company now and I was like nah we'll just try again to build the next big social app which was you know a giant mistake hey you're not flying private and you don't have a vacation at home in Tahoe but at least you learned at least you learned you know if you're not winning you're learning books it's a memoir called at least I learned dude I hate when people say winning or learning I'd rather win I don't want to learn I'd rather be a dumb winner than a smart loser all day of the week that's easy I'd rather be winning on my plane but barely know how to read um this is why I love this pod you get stories like that those are good stories yeah I think we should uh should wrap it up there but tell me one thing what's that say on your shirt awesome baby all right we gotta start getting back into that stuff uh I've been out of the game but anyway good pod that's the episode [Music] foreign

yeah I mean like our first like full year I think you already shared it well you said 20 is 40. but uh yeah we did about 40 million dollars and then um you know this year we're on track to do 30 35 growth yeah um it's it's crazy so we are here in the uh yeah the shed yeah like this studio like I'm looking at the video it looks legit yeah people don't know what's looks like from the outside this is definitely like a sketchy um like I've seen a Netflix documentary about a shed like this well you got here five minutes later than we did it was it was like 100 degrees in here I was like this is gonna be a sweaty podcast and this is uh you guys are different than I'll say our normal guests which are almost always like I don't know a business like tech software type of entrepreneur uh y'all are entrepreneurs in a different way and you're Instagram famous so that's cool that's amazing um you tagged me in a story yesterday and I gotta say my wife has never looked at me that way before she was like oh so she's never listened to one episode of this podcast we've done many 400 episodes she's not a podcast person in general like she's listening to anyone's podcast yeah but you would think maybe she'll listen yeah there's just not a lot of like time to like do things like that yeah I get it but I think she'll listen to this one so I'm excited because uh she's a fan of yours and uh and so we hung out at dinner last night got to know each other a little bit so I'm excited maybe we'll do like you guys give like a 60 second intro yeah who you guys are what why introduce yourselves to the audience sure um I'll go first so my name is Danny Austin and I started uh creating content online about 10 years ago I was actually living in Austin I was at the University of Texas sophomore like just making videos on YouTube in my in my dorm room um you know kind of just grew from there really fast thank God on Instagram all the other platforms we now run Divi which is a scalp care uh hair care product brand um and we do that together we have a lot of fun doing that honestly online we just share anything about our lives from like be having two kids under two to um you know fast or affordable fashion um yeah we've kind of been doing that together for you know five years so she's been online for 10 years you know we met we didn't work together until we got married I was in like Austin Tech scene before we got married and then uh you know I was telling you last night this just became a lifestyle and it was all consuming and so she would be in like Turks and Caicos and I would be in a boardroom and I'd be like oh my gosh like what am I doing in my life and so around 2018 we took the leap to work together jumped into kind of like the influencer space which we it didn't have a name before that it was just like we created content and then I think the media started covering it a lot more and then they labeled me an Instagram husband and then they uh labeled our industry you know how do you feel like our label you know it's fine like I'm glad that I did it wait that's so not true at first yeah it's true like what are you doing he's like um you never knew well when you're coming out of college like you know so much of your identity is wrapped up in your title especially being here in Austin Texas like you know in the tech scene it was like oh what startup are you part of do you have funding you know what's your title what employee number were you and so I was still kind of caught up in that mindset and then you know we jumped in together it was like I remember the first article that came out was by a writer named Taylor Lorenz and she wrote an article about what is the Instagram history with Taylor the Reds too yeah really yeah yeah dude it's crazy a lot of people have a history with her now but uh you know she so she she wrote that article and she quoted me in it and then I was like labeled the Instagram husband but uh yeah and so we we did the influencer industry for five years together and just honestly created content together and then covet hit and Brands started really investing in that space we should also say how this came about yeah you listen to the Pod yes and he's a huge fan I'm a huge fan and so we I didn't know that I didn't know who you were at that time but uh I did an episode where I was talking about Creator businesses yes so content creators who have now spun off businesses that are doing really well that are not called Mr Beast it's like okay everybody knows Mr B's yeah so who are the who a lot of the other cool cool examples and we did like maybe five six seven examples and then Danny with with Divi was one of them and so I guess you heard that yeah well so like a couple nights before I think I saw a tweet that you were doing and you were like we're doing episode on creator-led businesses and I think I like told you told me that'd be so cool oh you guys on Twitter and you know like I was like oh man like that would be cool if they recognized Divi but we're in a a niche right that is totally not your Niche like you know you had no idea who Danny was I last night Danny was like watching the first couple episodes I was like no this is Sean he's cool um and uh yeah I I was on a plane a couple days later listening to that episode and then it was like oh have you ever heard of Danny Austin you asked that to Sam and Sam was like no that was funny and then it was like uh yeah you talked about Divi and I really appreciate that so I sent a DM and I was like hey man would love to come and share a story it's very different than most of the businesses y'all cover but and let's play a little game uh we went to dinner last night Chinese restaurant we ordered food let's see how well you know your husband I don't know if he told you they're sorry alligator yeah oh he brought out it's hard to check in the busy order thing wait so you ordered alligator I did order it and and it was just kind of like a spur of the moment thing there was a couple things that were funny about it I think he was trying to impress us no I I was not trying to impress you this is funny though like so Matthew booked the dinner and it was uh so Sam Ellinger used to play football at UT Austin that's one of Matthew's really good friends Matthew works for for Danny and I and I go hey find a cool restaurant in in Austin that you know we can talk these people he books this like upstairs room there's like a chandelier it's a table for 16. and then and they walk in I go Matthew this is such a power move and then on top of that you know the I'm like you know we're all talking so I don't know what to order and then he's like you should try the alligator I was like okay I'll take the alligator and they were like and then he brought it home and woke me up and he was like you gotta try this alligator I'm sorry it really tastes like chicken you should just try it okay so you didn't try it out here yeah that was a crazy proof uh I gotta give me credit I will never enjoy it I'll never forget it so yeah I guess that's maybe a lesson to be learned yeah they go to a dinner with somebody first time order the weirdest thing on the menu get it that's awesome so you guys uh you started doing this back in 2012. uh right around 2012 you're in college at the time what was because you know Instagram had been out um YouTube had been out for maybe five years by that point but it sounds like when you're talking about it it was very early days back then what was what was working back then how did like what would you have a tiny following back then like how did it what was this early years like so the back story is my brother Landon Austin he's actually a musician and he started on YouTube he just started posting covers of different songs um he had one video blow up because people thought that he was John Mayer it was actually covering taizon Days Like Chocolate Rain Song anyway so that popped off so my brother started to like kind of acquire this audience and he told me about the space but I thought it was so weird like I'd walk by his bedroom and he'd be like talking to all of his imaginary friends and I just I was like come on Landon like you got to make some real friends and so um but he ended up putting me in like a sibling tag because tags were really popular on YouTube back then you know like the Chubby Bunny Challenge or whatever tag so he put me in a video and you know in all the comments it's like your sister should start a Channel or she should share how she did her makeup or where'd she get her top and so my brother actually made my channel for me and I didn't touch it we went home over winter break and we were so bored because you know all of our friends are in Austin now everyone's in college and um you know I was just like you know what let's give this thing a shot so my brother filmed and edited my first video it was all like just affordable New Year's Eve outfits and it popped off and within like three months I had a hundred thousand followers and I just started kind of posting consistently I knew of like a handful of girls out in Los Angeles that were doing this like full time and they actually had managers and there were agencies that were just dedicated like specifically to YouTube which was like a totally different world So within three months I signed with a manager um and then every summer from then on out I would just fly out to LA and do collabs because collabs were like yeah oh yeah collabs were everything they actually had just opened YouTube space and Playa Vista in Los Angeles as well and they had this thing called The Creator program where they only a lot of think like 10 or 11 of us in and creators of all sizes and we were for you had to collab with two other creators in the program in order to be able to use YouTube space so like when you got to YouTube space I mean they had everything from like their you know a red camera they had Studios they had you know editing Bays editing Suites they had all these classes you could take so I would go and work for my manager from like you know nine to five and then from five to like nine I would go to YouTube space and just collab make YouTube videos learn about how to edit and everything and you're like 21 at the time yeah I'm 21. I was 20 actually it was 19 20. I couldn't drink what are you doing when you're working for your manager well just by day you're like so that's high yeah no I mean I was like um in on like all of the negotiations like a lot of the creators were moving out to LA and the brands would come to the office and you know meet all the creators and I honestly learned everything about like the back end of the yes and then like also being around all these creators I would meet some of like the girls that I loved and then get their number and then we would collab and everyone was very it was just very collaborative everybody's helping each other out um so it was awesome and but then I was able to kind of take all of that back to Austin and there really weren't a lot of you know YouTubers in Austin which also kind of helped me because I felt like I was one of the only ones and so um when I was I did start kind of like pitching myself to Brands because like I also signed with my manager but she was you know managing girls that had over a million followers I had maybe 150 000 at the time um and so I started pitching myself to all these like startups in Austin and what I found was what was happening was I was getting these brand deals or these Partnerships I would you know get to know them pull them in and then forward them to my manager and then I would look on YouTube and like all the other girls that were signed with her would be working with these Brands and I wasn't so I was basically just like funneling these Brands to my manager so I realized at that time was like I'm not big enough for them to care right so I need to get out of this contract and just kind of manage manage myself and build my own team and like have people that actually care about what I'm doing um so as soon as I could I got out of that contract and ever since then we've always kind of had like an in-house team um which we've learned a lot oh my gosh from that but um yeah it's just kind of crazy how it's evolved and so how even when you were so how big is the audience snap so now on Instagram like total total on all of our platforms we have probably over 2 million yeah 2.5 million one is Instagram now main one is Instagram which is like the perfect platform for us um most of our content is on Instagram stories and the reason we like that is because it's kind of like reality TV where I wake up with my audience like like literally when I wake up in the morning I get on stories and I carry them throughout the entire day and so it's just like the closest I feel like people really feel like they're in our homes you know it's it's very stripped down yeah yeah it's a lot more authentic it's kind of like follow all of my day and so you uh you've done that now you also launched Divi yes because that's kind of how we when we initially found you guys I read this thread I read the Twitter thread somebody else somebody else I've written about this and they named five or six creators I'd never heard of that had businesses that were really big it was like Divi uh it's a you know this sort of like hair care product whatever and it was doing 40 million or something in Revenue I don't remember what the exact numbers were but I remember being like wow that's like really significant and so cool like I never really like I never heard of that you hear the same three or four examples all the time when it comes to like like Logan Paul and Prime and Mr Beast and whatever like especially in the tech world we kind of hear the same we're not like as deep in so you only hear this hear the same you know three or four examples every single time so how did that come about how did you yeah when did you decide to instead of posting for other people like let's create our own brand and how did you pick the product how did you like how did you have the confidence to go for it yeah so um there was definitely an era on Instagram where everything was perfect you know it's like back in the day of like posting the perfect selfie or the perfect like latte art whatever it was um and so I definitely played that game and it gets very exhausting after a while I started actually losing my hair when I was in college whenever I was at UT first it started with like just me being so stressed out because I'm at UT I'm flying to La every weekend I'm posting on these videos I have like neutrogena's like where is the brand deal and I have like four exams the next day so I'm stressed style all the time started pulling my hair then I get hair extensions to try to like cover that up that makes it worse then I bleach my hair that makes it worse when we get married I think like a year in I look in the mirror and I'm like I literally have no more hair I was like I didn't even want to leave the house anymore so Jordan I mean a couple strands of hair what are we talking about I know I mean like bald spots like patches like patches of hair and it was stress driven stress driven and then hair extensions so that's probably like more attraction alopecia so what happens when you put hair extensors in like your hair can't withstand that weight and instead of just losing hair where the hair extension is with traction alopecia you actually lose hair like around that whole surrounding area so it was like multiple bald spots like all over so Jordan of course my husband he's like wait I don't get it like why don't you just get a wig all the Kardashians wear wigs what's what's wrong with that so he takes me to a wig shop in Dallas like the first place he Googles we walk in it's like a Halloween store like the most expensive wig is like a plate called swords bright neon yellow I'm like I don't know if it's gonna work plastic wigs they're like the most expensive one is like 15 bucks so I leave there like so defeated I'm like I'm always gonna be bald you know so we actually um learn about this like wig shop in Los Angeles called the wig shop actually yeah uh from Jeffree Star Jeffree Star who's another YouTuber anyway long story short we fly out there find my first wig I'm in wigs for a year and actually when I first got my first big I didn't tell anybody because I was so embarrassed I was like we actually took a trip to Chicago with my parents and my sister-in-law and my brother and we didn't tell them the entire time they go oh nice haircut yeah like they I mean these things can look so real now it's insane so about a month into wearing it I just felt like a fraud oh it's like I gotta tell people I feel like I'm probably not the only female going through something like this I think that like people will appreciate it and hopefully they'll be cool with it so I shared that I was wearing wigs and it it kind of just opened up this door of like all these females that are kind of going through the same thing like this like hidden epidemic of hair loss um so life all the time after uh after we had our first baby I think it's like a known kind of like postpartum oh yeah like issue with with hair losses so she was talking about it all the time and I was like I was like what do you mean like don't worry about it she's like no look at this are these like baby hair whatever and it really bothered her like I didn't even think really even to try like what what would a solution look like so yeah I mean I felt that it can be very emotional like especially for females um because there just weren't a lot of people talking about it so um long story short I took the year and wore wigs and I was like you know what I'm just gonna focus on my scalp health I'm going to focus on my Wellness um and really like give this thing like 100 so meanwhile there was actually this trend um or I guess a hack online where a lot of women were using Monistat to grow their hair back which is so strange but the reason that was working is because it has a lot of like anti-fungal properties Danny you got to tell them no you shouldn't know about it but is it a good thing so all the guys on the five guys would be like what by the way we should explain there's we always joke that we have four female listeners hopefully that'll change after this episode we're all like dying inside their face right now so Monica is what people what females use for yeast infections okay gotcha and so a lot of women were using this on their scalp though and it's helping their hair grow and people are taking before and after pictures and it's like insane so the reason that's working is because it has these anti-fungal properties in it which nowadays you know they always tell you don't wash your hair it's not good for you so a lot of females are using um dry shampoo and so they're putting all this dry shampoo all this product that's just like sitting on your scalp blocking your follicle and so your hair doesn't really have like a fair chance of growing so when they're using Monistat you you know it's kind of like detoxifying it's getting rid of all that product buildup and your hair is growing so the only thing with that is you shouldn't be using it long term it's just like has a lot of harmful things in it so my goal was to find a more natural way to essentially accomplish the same thing so I would like get into my bathroom and I studied bio at the University of Texas I was going to so did I they don't teach you anything I learned photosynthesis for like seven years yeah exactly I don't teach anything about the human body she can hang with the chemistry she can hang she's like okay I remember that I kind of I kind of get it but basically how much you learn when you really need to learn versus like by Major now I wish I really would have paid attention because I think it really would have benefited me but could have known anyway so um so you know I'm like a little chemist in my in my bathroom I'm getting all these ingredients from online Whole Foods all over the place and just making my own scalp serums and I would you know share on YouTube like this is how I make it this is where you order this and then mix it this way and and then people started asking they're like hey can you just like ship it to me right and so I go to Jordan I'm like I really think this could be a thing a lot of people when was this like a couple years ago this was a 29th uh another probably yeah 29 2019 2019. um and so that's kind of like where the idea originated from and it was totally clean so it's something that people could use every day and not feel like it's going to be harmful so we had a lot of like eucalyptus uh natural ingredients jojoba oil um but there were a lot of things I wanted to put in it that I just didn't have access to so long story short found Partners found a great chemist and then came out with our first product which was escape room and to be honest I did not think that it would pop off at all I really was just like I want to serve my Audi I've been very like service driven with all of my content I'm like I just really want to serve people because I feel like if I serve them they'll come back so that was really just like the heart behind it but what happened was a lot of people were buying it for like their day were down the street or their mom or their husband and people started taking like before and after pictures we never asked for before and after pictures but I feel like that's kind of what made it blow up right the best marketing there is right before and after yes people started sending in their before and afters and like so then I would start sharing them you know left and right and I mean every day I'm probably tagged in like 15 before and afters even to this day yeah so were there not scalp serums before that or they were but they just weren't you know I think it was just such a new like a niche like you know putting something on your scalp like a skincare routine like creating that scalp routine was very new people weren't really thinking about it so I'm sure that there were scalp serums out there um but I don't think people were educated about like how to use them or why they were important um so our biggest thing is just like if you're taking care of your skin like you should be taking care of your scalp it's kind of like an extension of you know and so um so I think once people kind of understood how to use it then they went to divvy first because we were also one of the only like clean scalp serums out there gotcha so business launches win 2020 2020 uh 2021 2021 October 2021. so we're not even two full years in you know and it's exploded so I don't know how much you guys typically share do you guys share Revenue stuff or not really yeah I mean like our first like full year I think you already shared it well you said 20 is 40. but uh yeah we did about 40 million dollars and then um you know this year we're on track to do 30 35 growth yeah um it's it's crazy and that's mostly from kind of the power of your community or that's that plus a bunch of other marketing that you have to do or how does the business grow I mean that probably exceeded your expectations I mean that would exceed anyone's expectations yeah I always say like when we launched the product we thought that we were launching it for like 10 of Danny's audience like we were like hey these people need to be serves Danny you know acquired this audience they want a resource and it just grew so far beyond that and a lot of people think that you know Divi um is all Danny's audience that's been buying it and you know she's only made up about 15 of the overall revenue and so it was just a product that I think took off and worked it was just right place right time it was like during the era of the skinification of the scalp is like what the beauty gurus call it and so I missed that whole era yeah you missed the area well it's here either so I had to catch up I do Starwood skin move myself I gave you two boxes yeah I know you're you're in it now um and so yeah it's it's just been wild I mean we we never expected absolutely did you guys look at like other creator-led businesses like who was an inspiration that you're like oh you know if we do this well this could be like you know whatever yeah skims or this could be like the Chinese Kylie's lip thing or whatever I mean we've always admired the Kardashians in a business sense of like how they've how they've like used their reality TV to grow all these businesses and like we one thing we love about them is like how they all support each other it's like an ecosystem like you're using you know Kylie's makeup and then you're wearing him skims and so we always loved that aspect of what they do but I mean in terms of like our inspiration to be honest everyone in our space was just launching clothing lines um so it was totally different yeah it was very very different were you tempted to do that too a hundred percent Jordan was like please don't please don't the returns are insane my parents my dad actually has a showroom at the uh Dallas world uh Trade Center in Dallas so he um you know sells wholesale tall you know Nordstrom all these boutiques my dad always told me he's like the one thing I ask you is please don't get in the fashion industry it's just yeah it's it's a lot and so um but one thing I knew that I wanted if I ever did launch a business is I wanted to have something that could be on subscription and so a lot of my ideas were mainly Tech at first um I never really thought it was like what like what would it uh you know some service that you could get I had I honestly didn't have like a what like you we had this like one yeah there was one time where she like wanted to launch her own app because she felt like you know she could build a better Community like through a different platform than Instagram and and we we tried it we called it what did you call it the sassy Club The Sassy Club at the time and it was like we used this uh this third-party app system and we drove a large part of our community to it and we tried to do like more the whole concept was like let's meet in real life with our audience and so it was like we do meetups and stuff like that and that was just really hard it was kind of like a bumble right yeah it was kind of like a bumble and so we tried that you know it was pretty difficult and then it was it was difficult to manage like the in face interactions yeah let me ask you a question I just hired a guy I paid a guy five thousand dollars to do a couple of like one-on-one like workshops with me and it was all about this idea of personal branding which honestly a pretty lame phrase in general like I cringed that I even did all this but I'm putting it out there in the spirit of authenticity so I paid this guy why did I pay this guy well this podcast itself has gotten pretty popular but uh I've always had this problem which was just like um you see some people and their brand is so clear it's like uh there's this guy who this guy named Pomp and pomp is all about Bitcoin he's the Bitcoin guy yeah like you know I'm about to you know because of Bitcoin he talked about Bitcoin everything he loves you know every fourth word needs to be Bitcoin yep and then you have like um Tim Ferriss who's you know the four hour working guy or the four hour body four-hour Chef he's the four-hour guy he's all about kind of Life hacking your way there and so you you got on the list and a lot of people who have built good online followings they have a clear kind of like they're the blank guy or they're the blank gal whatever like that that's what they're known for and for me I've always been like well I don't know the business business guy yeah that doesn't sound very like specific or focused and I was like oh I've gotten pretty far without that but maybe maybe somebody could help me kind of sharpen this so this guy who I hired he works with like you know like Jay Shetty and like um a bunch of people who are like that like uh the guy who did Quest Bar I think yeah Tom whatever bill you um and he's like yeah you know like Jay Shetty his story is he was like kind of like in and out of trouble then decided to go be a monk and he was a monk and then he like got kicked out of the monastery because the monk came to him was like you know you like some there's something bigger in store for you so he decided to make his life mission to bring ancient monk wisdom in a modern way to the world or whatever I butchered that but something like that yeah every day I just knew him I was like the blue-eyed Indian guy or like you know that's what stood out to be like the guys they were green eyes yeah yeah but I was like okay I see I see the value and if you really like sharpened this like whatever your brand is all about but then I've met people who are maybe like you who um You probably never hired a consultant or like did a brand Workshop or like sat down with a piece of paper and like tried to architect it seems like it kind of happened organically and naturally for you so I have two questions for you one do you think you have like a focus like that like the blank you you are the you know just like the Bitcoin guy like do you have like a thing that's like our brand is is about this word or these three words or whatever do you have something like that um so when I started going through my hair loss I think was the first time that I kind of felt like I had that thing like I was kind of like the wig influencer for a while and then kind of like the hair loss influencer I mean as cliche as it sounds I feel like like I think our biggest thing is we've always just been very authentic and like goofy um and we've kind of I feel like what we've done is figured out how to collide those worlds of like being professional but also getting you know taking your heels off getting back home just like and being real about what it's like having two kids like you're in heels changing diapers kids peeing all over you um but like I would say it it took like 10 years for people to kind of I've never had you know this Persona or this video pop off and go viral and then everyone knows who I am like I've never had that moment it's just been like very gradual of but I but I totally feel what you're saying like I I still go through those times where I'm like okay who am I like identity what's my identity like what do and I I do feel like there are some bloggers out there that are so good at like okay when you think of Chick-fil-A you think of this one person or when you think of like this one brand you think of it dude that should have been mine Chick-fil-A you're a genius yes and it's like and so I do try to find those things that like okay when in Dallas when people go here like are they gonna what brands are they thinking picking up when they think of Danny you know but it's it's challenging because also like I'm very you know one day I want to be doing this one day I like to like kind of shift and be on my toes what do you think people get wrong when they try to build a following not like the people who are just obviously bad but let's say people who have the potential work could be working out what do you think are the mistakes that those people make that like they're trying to be perfect all the time and it's so unrelatable I think like one of the biggest reasons that like people can relate is because we have made so many mistakes and we share them and like there's times when we get online we're like man that was bad we should have done that like there was an example a small example but I was uh cutting up like fruit for my daughter Stella's lunch and I'm cutting the grapes wrong you know like where they can choke on grapes and like had no idea like my mom never cut my grip so like I didn't know I was there anything wrong but you know like the DMS start flooding in the Facebook groups are popping often he's like cutting the grapes like you're influencing all these moms to cut grapes wrong and I'm like oh my gosh I didn't know like so you know you get on you're like guys I'm so sorry like I made a mistake let me like teach you the right way to to cut grapes instead of like deleting the content and being embarrassed about it and so it's like I think you cut them wrong the second time dude I did I did I did um but yeah so I just feel like I have a lot of girlfriends like in Dallas that are you know trying to do something similar and they're trying so hard to just be perfect all the time and it's not just about you said the word relatable I think that's a key uh key thing like we had the comedian Hassan Minaj I don't know if you have music uh yeah it was on Netflix and stuff like that he came on and um and I was asking him something about because we do this like we're doing these live podcasts now sometimes so we're doing one this Saturday here in Austin and so I had asked him I was like Hey I'm going on stage kind of like stand-up comedy it's gonna be whatever like a thousand people in the audience how do I you know any what would you say like first five minutes how can I set a good tone here he goes um he gave me two pieces of an eye see those first make it clear that you are there so he's like talk about the room talk about the person the front row talk about you know the city that you're in and like what it's been like for you to be there like just make it like yeah give them the fact that you're there and everybody will be present together when you do that and he goes the second thing is uh low status you know low status he goes yeah like people make this mistake a lot that they try to be high status they're like yeah uh I want your approval so I'm gonna present a version of myself that is high status when in actuality the way people relate to you and like you is doing something low status so making fun of yourself showing a weakness being vulnerable saying something that's what makes you look bad not great or like embarrassing to you and so he's like you know comedy is actually a low status art form not like not high status which is what you like if you go to a conference you go on stage uh it's typically going to be all high status stuff people trying to say things that show how important they are and how smart they are in their resume and all that basically that's not how people relate to you and so what you're saying kind of reminds me of that is like a uh doing things that are showing the showing some of the flaws almost not just because they're there but like it actually helps it actually builds that relatability I know I I agree I mean I feel like the times that we connect with our audience the most is like in those goofy times when I'm running around with no pants on and like you're like oh I relate same thing you know I think there's like a there's like a pushback on like A-list celebrities even towards influencers because it's like I don't understand like this is not relevant to my life at all what the Kardashians are doing in the private jets and all this stuff and like I think that that's where people feel at home you know is is in these kind of like relatable moments which is what I told Ben you need to do I feel like y'all can do so well on the podcast is like you're not trying to be this business Guru expert you're just kind of talking about everyday people's business and your thoughts on it and you're kind of riffing and I think that you know I told Sean I was like I think he just needs to do more he needs to get on Instagram stories need to get on YouTube that was my advice non-private like you know yeah when we dm'd him this private I was like what's this guy doing yeah yeah I didn't bother with Instagram but but what did your your fancy branding coach tell you so what he was saying was so they did this they did a great exercise actually um I kind of want to like package this thing up so more people can do this I think it's it's a pretty useful thing but what he says is he was like you know you want to figure out your signature stories uh first so he's like don't try to get to the end point of oh I'm known for X he's like go look at yours the signature stories that made you you so like what were the moments of your life that kind of defined who you were times you either made a key decision in Life or you which could have just been like no more like I'm not doing this ever again or uh you know so some people have that they give up alcohol or something it's like that becomes their brand but it's like the signature story is The Rock Bottom story that they when literally they were so embarrassed at something that they did or felt and then they decided never again or it could be a single story where you know they went from kind of being you know shy to actually getting out there being more confident and what what changed so you find your signature stories that kind of reveals what you're going to be in what you're going to end up being known for the mental shortcut people will need to make when they're trying to think about who's that guy oh he's the guy who blah blah blah that's there that's their story um the second thing he said was he was like you gotta figure out what you said something about like serving he's like basically people will come to your contact because they're trying to change the way they feel so you got to know that you're not giving information you're giving a transformation of like you know emotion how somebody feels so he's like what transformation do they get when they come to your content that you give them better and more consistently than anybody else if you do that you win and so you got to figure out what is that chain so like with the Pod for example we talk about business ideas or like we'll show you an under the radar business you never heard of that's really interesting crushing it but like let me ask you I bet I bet you I bet your answer will match what I think it is which is why do you listen to the Pod what do you what do you feel when you when you listen to it I think it's like education meets inspiration like I think I walk away being like oh cool new idea like I want to you know I want to learn more about that or I feel like I can you know go do this in our business right and I think that that's what you guys do really well whether it's like just sharing ideas or you know uh uncovering these things we've never heard of but it's done in a relatable manner whereas like I think that that's why it's inspiring is because you're not doing this in like this I'm up here you're down here type of way it's kind of like Hey we're all here and we can all do it right tangible it's more tangible it's very relatable like I think that there's very strong parallels between what I've seen in like Danny's content and the way that she relates to her audience and what you guys are doing with your audience well we call it the girl next door we don't want to be a supermodel we want to be the girl next door yeah you're still trying to be hot relatable hot like yeah like I can get there but yeah you are the girl I love that how have people like do you what are your experiences like in real life when you meet people who listen to the pun uh it's probably like how what you feel which is that they know you they're like like yeah you know what I mean but I really know you we're friends yeah like like an Instagram like daily vlogging kind of like through an Instagram story it's kind of the same way it's like the same yeah your kids I know what your house looks like I know like on my way here I was asking my wife I was like I was like I don't follow them on Instagram like I don't know their stories little I know they're like oh their mom is like involved in it and yes they got two kids like there's like all these little things that are known about your life the inside of your life and so I think like that's what you guys do on the podcast is different podcast is like such a long form conversation right unedited unscripted so you get to know someone's personality and we I usually do the Pod with uh my buddy Sam and Sam like it's kind of like two friends hanging out kicking it and so you you hit the like the big what we found was that the two Transformations people get the two feelings that they get consistently is we're like they're entrepreneurial friends it's almost like yeah they got to hang out with their two guy friends who are like super into business nerding out about business stuff it's like they kind of got to have the hangout without like going and having the friends and doing the hangout like themselves because it's like I was driving somewhere and I just listened right but I kind of got my hangout fixed and the second is like motivation or like the inspiration like the juice to be like I'm probably not gonna go do any of the things you mentioned on this podcast specifically but just hearing about stories of people doing interesting things made me want to go do more interesting things or maybe if they're doing well it made me want to go crush it in my field too so once we realize that it's like oh okay that's very different than people come to me for this specific information uh or the specific help um because it's like yeah there's some of that but it's not the main thing that gets people attached I told I told Ben this um you know but I I said the biggest Pitfall from here is you got to stay humble and you got to stay consistent because I think that what happens in this era and and you saw it a lot with the early tick talkers that blew up during covid is they moved in these big houses right you know and then they would sign with these managers and then they're all in all these commercials and the very thing that made them relatable and tangible during this was dancing alone in their bedroom she was dancing alone in their bedrooms now they're in mansions and it just loses the same sentiment right and I think that that's the pitfall of anyone really in like the entertainment industry but like anyone who's built their brand off of authenticity is like losing that right so it'd be like you guys you know becoming jerks you know or douchey and then like no one wants to hang out and they're like oh well now they're just pompous or even like you have to protect yourself you know in our world we have to protect ourselves from the sponsored thing things of like oh they're just bought now you know like I don't trust them anymore you know I I don't believe that they're saying this for just genuine reasons it's not salmon right you know kicking it and so you probably get this question a lot it's the same question we get a lot which is like if you were just starting out today what would you what would you do right if you were 21 now what would you where would you start uh we get that on the business side what would you say your your answer to that is on the content side would you yeah would you start on Tick Tock would you go to Instagram yeah like what type of content would you do because like you had said one thing that's actually very very interesting to me your first video you said was like affordable New Year's Year New Year's Eve outfits that's kind of amazing because that's a great like almost like title um like it seems like from the beginning you had a good sense of like what content will work right yeah not everybody has that like I think most people would have tried something that's like no yeah I would say like any platform that I started on I mean I would probably start on Tick Tock now just because I feel like it's the easiest to go viral Instagram is so tough um but I do feel like YouTube's like kind of coming back a little bit yeah I heard vlogging is coming vlogging um long form but I honestly wish I wouldn't have started out with the trends like chasing the trends I really wish I would have liked just like found something really unique and honed in on that because I feel like I was like Trend chasing for so long and then I would have some video pop off but that was just because it was trendy and no one actually wanted to get to know me more um so I wish I would have just like kind of been more unique which I think kind of just goes back to like what does Danny actually want to share like what is she really passionate about I would mix in a little bit of that like I since I was studying biology and Kinesiology I would you know mix in a little bit of like what I was learning in my classes but then the next video was a trend you know and so that's the same thing that I feel like a lot of tick talkers get caught up in you know they're just doing all these trendy videos and then they have a meet up and like no one comes because nobody really knows them and nobody actually like connects with them um and then two like I think branding as characters within your content is so important like you said my mom's in a lot of content so I had this idea to call my mom what's her character so yeah her character is we call her tornado and that's the re the reason we call her tornado is because she is a tornado when she walks in the room like right now if she was in this room she'd be dusting off your leaves over there she'd be fixing all the light bulbs my mom has so much energy and I didn't really know how to like communicate that to the audience so my first step was like we call her a tornado and the second step is every time she comes over we're showing her up on a chair dusting things off and like doing tornado things doing tornado things pulling me out out of my comfort zone just like being a tornado and so um and then you know Jordan's Jordan's character is like every single day he gets up at the same exact time he wears you know he gets dressed up every single time I'm running around the house just like chaos so we all have our certain characters and I didn't really learn how important that was up until like probably like three or four years ago that you just sort of like because people started forgetting who we were and so I I had to like create a way where people like when they when they you know were missing like what did they associate our family with and like how how could they remember us throughout the day and so um so like tornado was was a like was kind of huge for us I feel like that was not like that but it was like very relatable because you know just even before we had kids like the content we were creating I'm like who relates to this we're traveling all over the world taking outfit pictures right you know like this is not it doesn't make sense and honestly it was exhausting for us because it wasn't even like relatable for for us you know and so as soon as we kind of like settled down and we had kids and I was like okay we have to figure out a way to make our everyday life interesting like so we bought her a nice house and then we had a vegetable house relatable houses go sleep in the nice house no I honestly I know people that do that like I know influencers that have second houses that literally just film there yeah our middle class house no or I know influencers that literally will like they'll take a Chanel bag to dinner but they'll like switch it with like an Amazon one before when they take the photo and it's like um but no I feel like what's so like unique about us too is like that we kind of live our lives just the way we were raised like with the same family values that we were raised with were not shared to we're not scared to share that with our with our audience yeah I mean I would say like everything you said a lot about like characters this is like who they are you know and it was just like how do we kind of like tell it from all these different angles and it just fit you know like every family is a story right I think that that's where a lot of the creativity seeped into what we did right and why it was hard to do what we did is we had to find what made our our family unique and almost produce it like a reality TV show and I think that that I mean I don't want to say that we were the first but I think that that's what we saw the medium of Instagram stories as like a lot of I think influencers in like the 2019 era when it came out we were like oh my gosh like how am I gonna do this because they're not super personable and we you know with your YouTube background we're like oh man this is like our platform to shine and it was it was so fun it's what I'm pushing you to do is like show your wife show your kids like show the behind the scenes of like what is happening in Sean's life beyond just this podcast like that's what I think and it doesn't even have to be family it could be like your producer or your assistant or whoever it is like my my brother now has an assistant her name's Katie and she shows up like three days a week and she is everyone like loves her on the content and now because they love her and because she's a character they go out and do these crazy things that they probably would have never done that's just so much more entertaining now because there's another character involved and so who's are you just like selfie with the camera do you have somebody who else you're right this guy hello my name is Jordan okay but this guy I mean yeah it's we do have a content creator now that we actually just hired yeah it works with like reels because those are that's a different thing that's a whole other Beast so you know he's been helping out a little bit but like we kind of just enjoy doing it ourselves there's a lot I talked to another woman who listens the Pod so Rebecca zamorolo she's like a YouTuber she's got like 10 million Subs on YouTube and when I called her she was basically like yeah downstairs right now is like the camera crew they basically live in our house and she's like my dog has a channel that's got like 300 000 Subs like we have our gaming channel we have our she does like kind of kids like role play content or something like that yeah story kind of like yeah let's like treasure chest in the backyard let's go do whatever yeah and so they not only each one not only there's a character each one got their own sub channels has their own following and then they have camera crew that was like just there all the time I was like man that's you know like stressful or like just it's like a lot like it's like reality TV it's like you know famous people they have trouble when they go out because they're like oh I keep getting stopped but almost like influencers have it in the house it's like I never get to just not yeah have you said the same thing yes oh my gosh it's it's hard and I love our team to death but you know it's it's hard when your job is to live your life you know your job is to to experience life to capture it in a very raw strip down way but you know when there's Crews and there's teams it's it's sometimes counterproductive to what you're trying to do it and so you know the reason I think that the husband and wife Dynamic works so well in our Niche is because it it's just us hanging out you know and it's like it's the best content there and he had a bin in her life that was like falling around that wasn't her husband it's like it's all about the Dynamics right and so like I you know it's funny I always advocate for like the best producer for a content creator is going to be the husband in fact I think that the most successful uh couples in our Niche have that husband wife Dynamic where they're creating content together it is funny we have our so we do have a team and they come over like four days a week but they they meet in our upstairs playroom and so they're not the ones actually filming the content but they're there yeah we have more kids it was like okay we're just gonna put this ball pit in here okay here's Stella's table and so Stella will walk in and just be playing over there but the amount of times that we've tried to you know get a workspace or get an office it just like doesn't work because they do have to be there because like if we're going into an office every day that's not relatable anymore right and there's also like nothing I don't know it's truly one of the most like like technical nuances that's difficult about our industry um is like how do we position our team where do we put them and then like Danny can't you know you can't just say hey Danny come to the office and do a try on haul all the clothes are in the the closet right but so it's always the trade-off of okay do we have people in our house what do we do yeah we're still figuring it out still figuring out and for the like Instagram kind of like sponsored content or like brand new deals um tell me a little bit about those so how uh how those kind of like changed over time what what it what is like working the best or what works yeah what doesn't work anymore or it doesn't work at all when people try it yeah so I mean brandell started out as you know here's a product go make a YouTube video include it for 20 seconds put the link in there and like At first I was such a sellout because you know like you're I'm 20 years old I'm like I'm just trying to pay my rent like I'll do anything that I can do to just like get by and so and then I think you get to a point where you're like wait like people really trust me like this is like some responsibility so I kind of like took this approach where I pictured myself like you know shopping with them and then purchasing something then trying it and then them being like what the heck Danny why'd you recommend this so I really started to take like more responsibility and like wait I am a resource like I Gotta Serve these people not only that I have to find the best deals not only that like I need to go after these Brands and beg them for better promo codes that like they can't get anywhere else so it kind of became like competitive with myself yeah we kind of became like like a like a QVC always gonna have the best deal and so we tried to adopt that mentality in-house you know we I always describe it as like a like a like a triangle like at the top is the audience and like as long as we're prioritizing them first everyone's happy at the bottom left is like our business which we have to take care of we run a team and then on the right is like the brand we're serving and we found that every time we try and flip the triangle a different way so if we put the brand at the top then the audience is like you don't actually like this product and everything kind of just crumbles and the the I would say like this year in particular kovid especially it was like there was just this like craze for promo codes like because what the shopping was happening so much through Instagram that we found our Edge to be like hey let's get the best deal that you're not gonna find anywhere else you know in the country and it kind of I mean yeah but I think what works a lot for us is to not just go 100 on brand deals but to also couple that with affiliates so when I post you know ltk so when I share something that I would like to know like to know it yes so like to know is basically a platform where you know anything I swipe up to you can make commission off of it but the best thing about ltk is I can share things that I genuinely bought like this top right now I got from Target I purchased it I get to go tell people okay it kind of fits a little tight in the shoulder so maybe go a size up you know here's the link make sure you order it in white because that's about to sell out whatever it is and so that's like super authentic super real people know that you're making commission off of it they don't care because you're just providing them like a lot of value so that's like 50 of how we monetize and then the other half is you know through brand deals where I feel like if you have a really strong affiliate base like you can get really picky with the brands that you're you're choosing so we got super picky like the past couple years and um and then it got to a point where like okay we're getting brand deals we got Affiliates now let's go after those brands that have never given promo codes or never given deals let's fly out there and like meet with them in person and like beg them for promo codes so one of those examples was free people you know girls love free people I've been wearing free people for years they never do promo codes they rarely do they'll go on sale but never do like a discount code so we begged them forever to get a code finally got a code you know within the first hour we pushed seven figures because people are like and not only that but because we I had worn it for years and people had seen these you know these specific uh crop tops that I've been wearing for so long it was like the most like gen like authentic push and it like benefited the brand benefited us benefited the audience everyone's happy and so what's the juiciest brand deal you've ever had where you were like wow they're gonna pay us that like that's a stupid amount of money or like you know we can make this work you don't say the name of the brand or you could just describe I know what you're gonna say I think you say it Stanley yeah Stanley Stanley water yeah so fun fact we were like why are those like so popular we were the first to share them yeah first blockers and I was like this is humongous this is a giant giant cup it's it's a great product you know they are owned by pe um and so we flew up to Seattle and we were like guys listen because they really hit that like Utah Mormon Market really well yeah it's a great Market um and then they saw that that was working the the president is a guy named Terence he's actually a phenomenal like marketer he was the one who put post Malone and Crocs in like kind of like reverse Crocs trajectory to being like a cultural icon and so he uh I think had noticed Danny and was like Hey you know like I there's something about this mom Market that's working with Stanley um you know flew us up there and uh it was it was hard they still haven't given us a code per se on the quencher or have they not on the quencher we have a code on every other product but yeah that's it's hard but yeah they um they've been good we have some special things coming out with them we're excited yeah we're excited amazing I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better so pain points right so like you talked about how Divi was born out of a pain point that you had yeah um I'm curious as you guys are trying to run this kind of influencer business plus Divi like have you felt any pain points that you're like God I wish I wish somebody just made this easier or made this hiring people you see here yeah wait this is kind of random but like content creation at weddings can't take creation at weddings yes so I feel like now Brides really want like tick tocks or reels or just like iPhone photos they don't want to like hire this photographer and wait you know two months before they get their photos back so at my wedding I just hired someone to like take an iPhone and like take an iPhone video walk around it's a good idea that's a great idea that's a great idea take photos and I just paid them like hourly but I feel like you could get like a pretty good team that like you know they take all this the nice thing is too you get your content the day after the wedding because like the biggest bummer is you go to your honeymoon you don't have any pictures yeah let me post and like people are gonna pay for that because it's their for one day a normal videographer I think is like 10 grand sometimes I don't even I like the iPhone like you said like my sister-in-law just got married like a few months ago she just now got like the first cut of the wedding video and then that doesn't look like what content looks like nowadays exactly it looks like this thing it's like nice yeah but it's like if you posted this it's like okay Grandma like you know what this is not like uh I would rather had like five tick tocks and like six Instagrams yeah that like felt like the fun of the party you know I think the reason we've noticed that is because Jordan films a lot of our content and we've we've been to a lot of weddings where the next day the bride is like reached out to me like hey can you send me that reel that you posted or uh your stories for the day and we're like oh they already expired like they're they're done they're gone you know there's so many like content creators now that I feel like don't want to be influencers they're just like content creators like they'll just create content for other people I think someone's gonna that's always been a great idea you had thank you I had more time that's cool because that could just be like local franchises you could uh just train someone in theory you could just start that business and then be like I'm looking for an operator in Nashville we need an operator in Florida yeah who's gonna be able to do these like dispatch content creators so easy and they go in and then they like cut it all up and then they have it to you by midnight yeah who did you you said there's a bunch of content creators that don't want to be influencer so who are they what are they what are they doing yeah I would say like we've seen this a lot with like Divi it's it's called ugc now so it's like uh user generated content so there's like a brand yeah there's like a whole economy now uh they're not getting paid like as a brand deal to promote it on their own stories it's like you know hey we'll pay you two thousand dollars for four videos with our brand a month and so these Brands will have uh 10 ugc creators on standby on retainer you know and they use that content for ads and so what is happening is like our like our ugc content at Divi is performing the best over any type of like a branded asset and so it makes it sort of feel like a lot of people are using the brand in an organic ways and they they are but it's a whole other new class and I was like oh my gosh people are doing that like that's insane yeah we pay for our brand we pay like between one and two thousand dollars to a handful of creators for this exact thing and it's like they don't have a following yeah they're just like good at creating this content and uh they're like wow you know I get free product and I get paid to do this like this is amazing and I don't even need to be famous like I felt the hit even with my brand deals like we don't get a lot of those opportunities more because they used to come to me and they used to say we'll pay you x amount but now I guess we're too expensive or something because we never here for them anymore well it's kind of shifted to like that's interesting part about like how the influencer industry shift is it's it always kind of goes in waves right but it's like moving from like back to mass marketing where it's like as many people as possible are using and talking about your product at the same time and so that goes viral on Tick Tock see how it goes so where does Divi go from here so you guys are at this level now are you guys you have like a retail distribution too right yeah so last year we did about eight percent of our revenue from retail but we are scaling in Ulta so we're hoping to be in all doors of Ulta by the end of this year um I don't know Danny's always been big on like not taking investors so we didn't do that at the front end and so we're kind of like we own our own destiny at this point um I think that we're very passionate about the mission but Divi like it's hard to create an influencer brand that people don't think you just slapped your name on it right so we really wanted to create a product that is more and bigger than Danny and so the products have to be really good um and so we're really focused right now on Innovation we're trying to patent some of our Technologies um why is it called Divi what's the name yeah you answered this I always forget it's just like divvying up attention to like each area of your life like overall better lifestyle and overall Wellness but is it one of those things where it just sounds cool then later you're like what's the meaning or you're like I always really want to know it was just so hard to trademark yeah she gets mad when I say this but I was like yeah it's the third name all the other songs it was like the 30th name like um it's a good name yeah it's good yeah now I like I love it now but and uh so you're going to reach tell you hired a bunch of people you said yeah what else is like what's the next unanswered question for you guys what are you trying to figure out next I would say like you know last year was very difficult uh just because like it was kind of Danny and I running everything we've now like you said hired like this Suite of VPS um let's say the next biggest challenge for us is like we're kind of setting the stage for in 2024 to go International um which some companies have done really well and other companies have really botched yeah um and it's been just like a money pit and so that's probably the next Frontier for us and you know we would like to do it without having to raise additional Capital we've done everything thus far ourselves um which is very unique I mean the best part is like our audience is kind of built in so when we launch something people tell me that day if they like it or not or that day what they want more of and so you know our sequence or what we've launched we only have four skus right now has just been like listening to our audience and that's the biggest one of the biggest things is can you sell International and so so we're definitely working on that and then just like a lot of other skus in the pipeline since we only have four skus we have a lot of product development's been the hardest thing to learn for us for sure and so there's like that uh company like seed beauty that was doing stuff for forgot who Kylie or something like that yeah there's like these companies that are behind a lot of influencer Brands like uh I know like the prime drink or whatever there's like these guys behind it that totally they have their own company they do like multiple Brands out of that did you guys work with somebody like that or did you do your own sourcing and Manufacturing we found a manufacturer and that's pretty much it um formulation how did you do that you went to like a formulation house or whatever kind of the same yeah like manufacturers usually have chemists in-house and so we've found one and it it they developed our serum and luckily we just picked one right that's a very hard world to navigate to I've learned um I think we totally got lucky with our manufacturer on the first one because there's a lot of bad manufacturers out there and you don't know until six months later right and so picking the good ones has been hard but yeah other than that I mean we have two in-house chemists now yeah we have two in-house chemists we we again with the influencer business like Danny learned so much from having a manager we've always just tried to be entrepreneurs in-house and bringing a house which is usually longer you make more mistakes it's harder but I mean I think that we like where we're at where we didn't have a Cody or someone come in and say just slap your name on this because we're able to listen to our audience develop the products that we know that they want and uh but yeah it's more challenging for sure I didn't see him at all last year yeah I'm like I have a life now I play paintball now so like I'm good now but people around you I play paintball now so no and it's also the first time now we have like our four VPS when we walk into a room and we're like hey we have an idea can we do this yeah that's the political process of how we get things done and now there's process everywhere whereas like you know if we have an idea today and the content side we're like okay let's make it happen you know and it's just it's becoming a real company which is it's cool but it comes yeah I have to be careful Jordan tells me when we walk into the office he's like you can't just walk into the office and tell them what you want like we've been working on this product for eight months she's like yeah I don't really like it you know it's like wait wait just don't say it there's crushing hopes of dreams I'm sorry do you think you'll be doing content in like five years ten years 100 I'm obsessed I'm obsessed with my job like I love creating content yeah yeah I don't even think of it as a job but it's it's honestly like so I I think it like our relationship I feel like is always really healthy whenever we're like creative together and creating things together and I think we love doing that um Instagram therapy basically yes pretty much I miss you guys connected well if you work with your wife like you I feel like you have to work through so much more conflict than if you have nine to five like I mean we yeah it's it's it makes our relationship stronger I mean with something like a larger goal and then you know um but we'll see like how it evolves with involving our family like our kids that's something I still haven't really figured out um and that's what's so great about working with Jordan is like if we ever didn't want to share our kids or go down that path like him and I can just take over again um and then also having Divi we don't have to rely on on sharing the entire family um but no I think it's something that we'll probably always be doing yeah we're sure well on Instagram yeah so people can find us on Instagram under Danny Austin um and then Divi diviofficial.com um and then Instagram divvy official yep yeah what about you where's your Instagram oh I don't you don't even have one I don't have one as soon as you got a spin-off characters it's so much effort that I I couldn't I couldn't it would cause conflict in our marriage to try and do both like yeah I'm a great supporting actor that's right amazing if people want to come work for you how would they mind you yeah yeah if you want yeah if uh if you guys want to come work for Divi email hello diviofficial.com and it'll get to me yeah awesome well thanks for doing this I know this is definitely you're probably like what the heck is this podcast who are these guys but uh you know I appreciate you coming on this is fun this is fun thanks for having us [Music] foreign

this is such a good idea by the way this is a phenomenal idea this is a 10 out of 10 opportunity and uh dude he pitched me why haven't I not invested in this [Music] all right what's up we got a banger we got a doozy we got a we got a two-man Trio here and uh it's just me and Sam No guest today uh Sam what's up nothing I've liked having guests actually normally I hate it lately I've enjoyed it what's the difference so we should do more I like the people we've chatted with it's been better yeah not like those other crusty guests in the past [Laughter] um I have got a meaty topic it looks like I don't know if you have meaty ones but you have four good ones but they're smaller is that right all right I'm gonna tell you about a business that I think is kind of interesting Ben Ben put this on my radar um yesterday he goes he goes dude uh your sister should open a play Street a play street I was like what the hell's a play street so I look it up have you ever heard of this thing play Street Museum probably not you're not you don't have little kids but basically imagine like a good for you version of Chuck E cheese I'll start with that as a as the analogy so like Chuck E cheese is you know um it's like having the street is like um come eat rat pizza at my child Casino [Laughter] dude my parents used to say the they're I always thought the Chuck E Cheese near my house had burnt down but they just got to say no it burnt down we can't go anymore if I drove by there when I got a license and it wasn't burnt down I just thought it had burnt out that was their excuse they said it burned down 16 years older just slamming the steering wheel just like God damn it this video like it's like it's like one of those facts your parents tell you when you're five and you just believe it to be true like totally you know I think I thought my I told you my my father one time said real men don't drink with straws but he was referring to like a Jack and Coke so like for years I was like oh we don't we're not allowed to drink from straws it's like the Chuck E cheese the Chuck E cheese on Chippewa burnt down you know it's not there anymore Chuck E cheese on what for what that was the Street Chippewa uh too good all right so let's have this thing play street is basically you go there it's a nice Clean Plate it's like like a dream playroom for your kids so it's like they got a giant train set they have some learning games they got like you know the floors all it's like child safe and you basically beautifully 15 bucks beautifully done and you get to play for an hour and a half or something like that and so Ben goes yeah I've been going to this place and I see that basically the one near me at least he goes I think they're doing 50 Grand a month like a 50 Grand a month that's kind of a lot and he goes yeah he goes they basically they have and I forgot the exact numbers but it's like seven sessions a day it's 15 each and you have 25 kids I think in the in the thing at once um and he goes they're basically 75 full in these sessions you kind of do the math you're like all right that gets you kind of like the 40K plus you can host your kids birthday parties there in the nights and weekends and so some people do that he's like I think they're probably you know an extra eight to ten K of of sort of event Revenue uh per month and then if you look at the cost you know you got your rent it's probably like you know 5K and you have to yeah you have your staff your teach you're sort of like your your supervisors or whatever that are like overseeing the the play space and like resetting it re-cleaning it in between sessions um I think I'm pretty sure this thing is like netting uh something like 30k a month um in profit maybe 25k a month in profit and and they have tons of these locations yeah so so it turns out they're franchising or something like that I don't know if these numbers are true by the way this is like complete guesswork on my side but I wouldn't be surprised my sister owns uh some preschools in San Francisco and the numbers are somewhat similar now that's different that's you know they pay you know a lot more but for for you know regular schooling uh but it's interesting to me that these play spaces can uh can do so well and it's like it's weatherproof it's like you know you do it like I know with me like we go to Target three times a week you might ask yourself John what do you what do you need from Target so much don't you know you can order online and what I tell you is this is uh this is daycare for me like I like Sean goes to Target so much that in his home you have this like Target like a Target checkout playset and a Target like grocery cart that you you said you had to like find because it was like a collector's edition or like it was all sold out everywhere right moms go crazy for this thing you had to like buy it on eBay and do a big markup yeah exactly these Target mini grocery carts uh kids love them because they're they're used to seeing the kids like to do anything they've seen their parents doing so the whole mini grocery checkout plus plus Target cart is uh is I can hide the band so I go there often and I do it because you got to kill time it's like how do I kill 90 minutes and ideally and I would do something that's like enriching to them in a worst case scenario we just go to Starbucks or Target or whatever and um this would be better I would gladly pay 15 bucks for my kids to be able to go play in a place that's not a Park which is like weather weather dependent so I think these are really cool ideas um I think I think this play Street thing is a cool idea and I could see this uh you know this franchise doing like you know decently well probably not the best franchise in the world but I think it could do decently well where are the locations they're like Texas uh there's like none in California none of New York it's like a bunch of like but what are they it's like a it's like a blank commercial space um so like you don't need any food stuff uh so you just you know it's like just a blank like retail space huh yeah I mean their branding is pretty pretty good it's like kind of like how Escape rooms work Escape rooms work because right they require no specific real estate they can operate in a very small footprint and they take like two staff to run at any all day and so Escape rooms actually are like you know fairly fairly good you know franchise businesses or they were for a period of time now unlike an escape room which is kind of like you don't know if Escape rooms are a fad or if they're going to be like popular three years from now um these you kind of know are going to be popular because it's like yeah every parent's got this problem all right let me tell you about another another thing like this another problem you haven't really thought about there's a business called 260 sample sale you ever heard of this no uh let's Google it it's like kind of a cool New York thing so what what they do is any e-commerce or fashion brand has a ton of you know photo samples or product samples that they get from their manufacturer they use them in their photo shoots um to create the the pictures on the website or for advertisements or marketing or whatever and then those don't live in the warehouse like they live like where the photographer is or where their office is and you just end up piling up boxes and boxes and boxes of photo samples um you know over time because let's say you you know most fashion brands or apparel brands have yeah thousands of skus for each SKU you had a sample made before you had the production one made but you didn't just have one sample made you have each of the sizes made and because you needed it for the photo shoot um to be able to show the range or be able to cast different types of models and so what ends up happening is you get a ton of these samples over over the years that you can't really it's like not worth your time to get rid of um and so this business popped up again like you know the markets are like you know water and water's gonna just float everywhere there's an empty crevice there's an empty crevice in this market here for getting rid of these samples so what they do is 260 samples so it says send us your [ __ ] brand and we will host a pop-up where we're going to sell you along with a bunch of other brands um all at a great markdown so we have high quality Brands add a markdown because these are samples so you're not like training your customer that like you know hey this is like TJ Maxx discount or something like that it's it's a good story this is these are samples that you're going to get uh for for less and they'll like they'll just give the brand a commission back they'll say oh you know every time we sell something of yours you get a small commission it's better than nothing it takes it out of your space how'd you how'd you find this this is totally out of your out of your dude they're only based in La Miami New York and the pictures are like smoking hot women and then like uh uh it looks like a a picture of like a huge line out of a warehouse in SoHo so a lot women and women of those things I don't do it you know your boy doesn't do it yeah so um yeah none of this checks your box yeah your boy's so married and so in the house that is I did not go to this you're right but I'm in the e-commerce world I got my own e-commerce Brand Plus I know and talk to a lot of other Commerce people and I know about this problem and so I heard about this solution and I think it's very clever um I think it is a smart thing to do I also think these guys are not that well known and they're only doing it in certain um certain areas certain locations and whatever I think this could be done many times over I think I think like a aspiring Hustler could do this by vertical so you could go get a bunch of health and wellness and fitness brands or Beauty Brands and be like hey beauty brands and that's your products and we're gonna we'll have a stations where you could demo them and Sample them and then buy them um so I think you could do this for other verticals I think you could just do this in other places like hey if these guys are doing New York and La I think that their locations like Beverly Hills of Brooklyn or something do this in Texas do this in um do this in different different parts of the country I think you could have uh you know it's like your own little farmer's market it's your own flea market that you you get to to stock and run um but you don't have to do it as a full-time job so you could do it with every quarter or twice a year or something like that and still have it be successful so I thought this was a cool have you heard do you know Kingsford Charcoal you you've seen it it's like the most popular car called like the blue do you know how that was created I think it's a byproduct of something else right what was it a exact productive wood four oh four so Ford uh when when when Ford was making cars they had to like you know have all these furnaces making metal and they took like the leftover Char and they're like what should we do this and so they pushed it together and compact it really tight and that's how charcoal came to be and that's like a byproduct business and I love byproduct stuff you know it's kind of like it's tangentially it's kissing cousins with like the sharing economy I love that stuff I love byproduct stuff and this is one of those that's awesome this is actually quite cool their website is really challenging to use which is uh I think actually a good sign uh because I can't tell like apparently they do sell stuff online right but it's mostly but one thing I do hate whenever I go to New York dude seeing people wait in line to buy like Supreme clothing like just press yourself put the gun in my mouth man like I'm never doing that I'm not doing that I'm not gonna wait in line and spend my valuable time to purchase a thousand dollar like thing that should cost only thing worse than that is bottle service at a club it's like the guys who are paying you know seven thousand dollars for a table to and paying a thousand dollars per bottle that they could literally walk across the street buy for forty dollars it's uh it's like oh you're a chump come to this line please please please come right ahead come right ahead you you walk through the chump line I'm not a man of God but when Jesus made like the list of seven deadly sins the example of debauchery and gluttony was people waiting in line for five hours to go to a supreme store I mean like whatever like I see that stuff I have like this is the worst form of consumerism I cannot stand this I so I they have these pictures here and it turns me off bye man I I would maybe buy this online but I stand in the line I'm not standing in line with a bunch of these people to buy this stuff I can't stand that whenever I see that it makes me want to like throw away everything and go live here's an idea you're gonna like more um host chair so got a DM from a guy named Michael Fisk and he shows me this thing called hostshare.com um and he goes here's the here's here's here's the situation you have a short-term rental right yeah a property um yeah shout it out so people can go stand at marathonranch.com Marathon Ranch Marathon Ranch is it.com yeah or dot Co I don't know yeah.com Marathon Sam comes by has dinner with you gives you a massage it's fantastic so um you don't have 100 occupancy right you have some nights that are unused is that correct a 60 occupancy rate is is a profitable amount so you got let's say 40 That's unused nights what you doing with those nights this is the sharing economy bro what you doing with those nights Michael Fisk has an answer for you his answer is trade your unused nights with other hosts who have unused nights you stay for free there they stay for free at your place and um I think this is a really smart idea I don't know how many hosts let's Google this how many posts on Airbnb I don't know how many properties they have or how many hosts to four million okay so you have a market of four million hosts that you could make a inter host um like Network basically where you say hey if you're a host you get to travel for free um so you get to I know I don't know how they make things equal so like if your property is way more dope than somebody else's I don't know how you make that uh that trade uh thing okay how do you normalize the values across properties we calculate how many shared nights you would be staying in in exchange for 21 in exchange for the 21 days of travel per year the formulas established a higher higher value properties share last night's lower value property share more nights so for instance if your average night is 500 you'll share approximately 15 nights of the Year whereas if you're 100 you got to share 45 nights in a year take to the same minimum that's great so like what's your property per night right now uh 700 700 so you're gonna basically what they'll say is hey make your thing open for 12 days out of the year and then in exchange you get 21 days free booking in this network would you take that deal that's yeah in fact I do so go to live live kindred.com so it's Kindred k-i-n-d-r-e-d and then live um so I use this service so my dream situation is I want to find like another couple that has like similar style or like once as I do that lives in New York and they want to be in Austin and we can just Swap and I've not found a good solution for that but there's this thing called lit live Kindred Kindred that I do that I have used where someone will stay at my home when I'm not there and then I get credits for the marketplace and then like I'm gonna go to Taos New Mexico like I have like eight credits because someone stayed at my house for eight nights and I know that so I'm gonna go and stay somewhere else for free and it's actually pretty cool I wish that it was just like a direct swap so I could do six months here and we could just swap six months for six months but but I've been using services like these I actually think that I don't think I'm not bold enough to say like this is the future but I think that like you know there are a lot of people like me who do split time dude finding a place for those split like when you split time it's really challenging I'm always looking for a good solution yeah that's uh that's good I didn't know that something like this exists so with this do you it's hard and I think they raised money by the way from Andrea yeah you give up your space is that right so you give up you put your space in the network but you still have to pay or you it's free uh I there's some type of service fee frankly I don't think it's a good business uh I don't understand how they make money and because what I said what I signed up for I was like I'm getting a lot of value I'm not spending a lot of value I don't know how you guys are doing this so like that's a BC subsidy right now you're getting that Andreessen Horowitz yeah value Exchange yeah so like we're trying to use our credits quickly because I think I don't know if they're gonna stay in business or not because I don't I don't understand how it works but it is awesome if it's awesome if it does work uh that's hilarious um so yeah I like these types of businesses where where uh or that solve this problem uh is host share popular I think I just created it yeah if you could pull it off it's pretty amazing it's a smart model I think it's hard to pull off because like I don't understand how host share makes money I think they have to charge a flat membership so I think they have to basically say it's 500 or a thousand dollars a year to be in the network and um you know you only pay if you use more than five nights or something like that make it a make it a fair trade and um you know I think I think basically then they're trying to get a subscription right so they're trying to say can I get 50 000 people to pay us a thousand dollars a year um on this subscription there's a few things like that I forget what the big one is called but there's they there's things like for Luxury Rentals where I'm almost certain that they just partnered with hotels where you pay like five grand a year do you know what I'm talking about it's called avanta yeah I don't know the name of it but I know what you're talking about it's like you get access to the second time for boutique hotels yeah and I've looked into them when I originally saw it I didn't have enough money like I I wasn't in the spot that I could do it and so I've been looking for things like this I actually I really like these businesses there's one there's this company called uh the nerd wallet of England I forget what it was called it's called Uh money markets oh yeah yeah there's a guy named Simon who started it and so basically he started like the nerd wall he started a Blog that compared like mortgage rates and things like that and then if you bought one or got a mortgage through him you got affiliate fee it's uh I think it's called super money market is what it's called it's publicly traded in England anyway the guy sold all his shares after he took it public 20 years later and he now owns this thing called like Simon's Resorts and so it's this rich guy who went and bought like 50 Resort or 50 like really nice homes around the world and I actually don't know they they frame it up like this is his personal stuff and you can just use it when he's not there uh but it's actually pretty cool and so I love these types of things because I think they're just neat to like buy all this [ __ ] and share it with everyone I think it's really cool yeah I like that because I think about a little random experiment I'm gonna do so I want to make for this Christmas season a deep fake Santa so basically you're going to be able to come on the site and pay 35 and you um and you type in your message you could say hey wish my daughter Jessica uh Merry Christmas tell her great job with the soccer thing and um be nice to her brother big sports fan huh great legs and soccer and so you'll be able to type in that message and then it'll basically create a video that Santa's saying this to you so what I'm going to do is I'm going to try this thing that replit has so replied has this new thing where you could basically Buy developer Cycles have you seen this no but so you can go so let's say you need something built you can basically just go and buy you can put up a bounty so you're like all right I want somebody to build me this deep fake Santa it's got to do a b and c and you put up a bounty you put up put up the dollars and then people will just build it for you and um and you can you basically have an award so it's kind of like a uh uh like 99. yeah exactly and and you do it in their currency which is called cycles and so they kind of help you estimate like roughly how many how many cycles should this be for this to to work out um but I haven't used it yet I really want to try this bounty thing I think it's great because so you're gonna uh you're gonna pull an Emerson you're gonna uh you're gonna be this smart guy who just does a money grab uh no I'm gonna bring I'm gonna pull uh Justin Mayers I'm gonna bring the joy of the Christmas of belief really of the belief in Magic uh to millions of kids around the world this Christmas what are you doing for the children this year Sam is that your is you're gonna do the Justin Bears pitch like so we had a problem we wanted to bring joy to children like and we thought what better way to do that than a 50 card a world full of war and divisiveness Joy is all we have left it is what they call the last refuge and people say that magic is Magic but the magic is getting people to believe the magic and how do you get people to believe using deep fake technology and that's what we how do you get people to to Believe In You Lie we're gonna we're gonna create a fake cartoon about a fake person we're gonna charge real money and it's gonna be a fantastic result are you really gonna do this yeah because I really want to try this uh Bounty thing I want to play with this uh I think this could be what's the URL going to be um I think it's going to be called Santa's real uh you know.org give it a DOT org let's make all of our businesses.org just so we can like just so we can be prepared to other people yeah for a long time I wanted to make my businesses.net so people would think that I've been around for a long time yeah but dot org is way better I'm going to do a DOT org that's way better than that stupid ass XYZ crypto [ __ ] I want to dot org is that what they are or like dot AI dot Io if you have a data IO like I'm not into it I want a DOT org we are a for-profit DOT org it's fantastic is that what dot org means I think you have to be a non-profit for taking a DOT org but who makes that decision is there like a governing that you have to like present your EIN for your 501 3C or something like that I have no idea I've never done this to be clear I've always been firmly in the.com Camp but I'm ready to uh I made my nut and I'm ready to go and get get my DOT org on for the rest of my life that's like uh on stage Andrew or backstage we were like so what are you doing and he used the p word I know philanthropy slandered us with the philanthropy yeah it's like dude if you don't say that word around me don't say philanthropy don't flex with me bro and uh so now instead of philanthropy it's dot orgs a wilkinson.org go ahead and email me there I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better today I want to talk about Vice vice.com the reason I'm talking about them is because they are about to declare bankruptcy right cue the Michael Scott clip where he just walks out and declares bankruptcy let's think about that I love that clip now yeah I I agree most every joke I've said on this podcast I've stolen from that show um so the reason I want to talk about them is not because of Vice but because of the story of the founder Shane Smith and if you're under the age of 26 Vice probably means nothing to you they've actually like very quickly lost relevancy but to give you some background on what Vice is so Vice originally was up like a punk rock magazines based out of Montreal so it was three Canadian guys one of those guys being Gavin McKinnis you know who Gavin McKinnis is no who's that have you have you heard of proud boys proud boys like the political thing yeah he started proud okay which a lot of people don't realize and so it was like these three like kind of like punk rocker guys and Gavin McKenna's being one of them Shane Smith who I'm going to talk about today was the other one and basically the way it started was they got like a grant from the government where they were able to launch this magazine and that's how it started it started as a skateboarding punk rock magazine and they would write like these amazing articles where it was like vice's guide to drugs and they would like write all these stories about drugs they would use the n-word all the time they would like they were like wow it's kind of like you know how like some you probably don't know about this but like in the punk rock Community they like sometimes will like talk about Nazis they talk about like use racist language but they do as like a shock Factor because it's like I want to be in your face that type of thing that that's what Vice was all about I don't remember I don't know if you remember like the old school covers of these magazines but it would be like a tab of LSD on like a hot chicks uh tongue do you remember like I don't remember seeing device magazine I remember reading something actually they called it just zines is there a difference between magazine in a magazine because that's what that's what I just just the just the culture if it's someone's a Zine it's typically more it's like a punk rock thing whereas if it's a magazine it could be like GQ okay gotcha so you've never seen these but it started out as like hardcore punk rock where they would write articles about um doing drugs having sex like just rock and roll [ __ ] and Matt started getting picked up and so they started this company in 94 but in 99 they moved to New York and that was like where things changed and that's right where like the internet Just Got Started what looks like you're looking at something I'm looking at the magazine covers and I'm and you're saying rock and roll and I was just thinking about like this is what cool like basically like this is what influential people uh it's like kind of like musicians are influential people and they did the stuff it's like the the tongue with the LSD on it it's like someone just biting a tuft of hair I don't know why there's a bunch of hair in someone's mouth and I was just thinking about pod and roll and how it would be just like someone entering a cold plunge someone meditating so it's like yeah we're part of that pot and roll uh yeah we were the famous podcasters you know I mean they're all just on a cold hot cold man it's crazy the temperature variance is insane yeah the definition of cool has changed which is actually part of the thing I want to discuss but so the internet starts coming around in the late 90s they raise a little bit of money like two million dollars they move down to um they moved down to New York and that's where they like really get going and so they create the website advice.com originally was a magazine there was a free magazine that they would just hand out and they would make money off ads and it would be the three of them writing articles and they would do something that I used to do all the time where they would have like fake authors so it would be like someone who wasn't real just [ __ ] making up stories is really what it was which is you know it was an entertainment magazine so that's fine but they start growing and it takes off after a handful of years and so they've kind of created this thing at the time now we just know it as like branded content where it was now sometimes people call them advertorials things like that but basically their whole shtick was we're gonna make awesome content and we're gonna get the eyeballs of Millennials which back then Millennials were like the Gen Z today you know it was like The elusive hard to reach audience and they said we're gonna reach these millennials and we're gonna make the best content and we're just gonna plaster your logo on there and that's gonna be good enough for you and this is like pre-facebook so like performance advertising wasn't really much of a thing so it was like the way to advertise and eventually they blow up and the important part of this story isn't exactly that they blew up because they did but the story is like the Antics that they went along and and built this thing with and so they raised money from Rupert Murdoch who's you know the founder of fox they raised money from all these amazing people Viacom eventually they raised money at a six billion dollar valuation today they're nothing but they still make 600 million dollars a year in revenue and so I want to talk about some of the crazy stuff that the founder did as well as how their business model works and so have you ever heard of the the guy Shane Smith who is the CEO and kind of the main man never all right so he had a whole bunch of interesting things that he did so if you Google Shane Smith you'll probably see like pictures of him like it's a it's a a guy who almost looks like a punk rock Santa Claus where he's kind of like a bigger guy and he like you'll see like he's got sleeve tattoos and you'll see him shirtless all the time and smoking a cigar do you like see any pictures like yeah he looks like um he looks a little bit like the guy who's the number two guy in billions I forgot what the guy's name is uh like not not ax but his his right hand man yeah looks a lot like that guy if that guy had just like chest tattoos if he just had like a tattoo around his nipple that'd be this guy dude so he's just like crazy and so Vice originally the way that they became respected is they would do all this crazy stuff but it was him doing it Shane the CEO and so he would go to Liberia during uh when they're having a Civil War and he would just bring a camera and just get dropped in Liberia and figure it out in 2013 he traveled to North Korea because he organized a basketball game between the Harlem Globetrotters and the national team of North Korea and that was like the big stick and then eventually do you remember hearing about Dennis Rodman going to uh North Korea that was for a vice documentary and they would make these like free documentaries and they would post them on it was originally their site and then they moved to YouTube and they would get lots of views and they would like put like an Intel logo on there and that's how they made money and so they and so he was known for walking around his office of like Vice and I've been to the office it's like as magnificent as you would think it's like the coolest of the cool and he would walk around shirtless and he would just like say crazy stuff he was known for just being like this Wild guy and so one time when he hired a CEO her name was Nancy this was recently he said we're the monitor where the modern day body and Clyde and we're here to take all your money and he would just say stuff like that all the time there was another time when they were just getting started and uh I believe it was into it they came um was it into it or IBM one of those they came to the office in order to uh pitch or vice was going to pitch into it and so what they did was there was a really shitty office at the time 24 hours before the meeting he built like a glass uh conference room so it looked legit and so you could see your employees and then he went and hired a bunch of like actors and got tons of friends to come and work in the office to make it look like they're important because he always like said something like um we don't want them to think that we're or what do you say we want them to think that we're rich like they like he was like we're gonna act as it right and he did and they eventually got a 25 million dollar deal from this company and it worked out and there was another time where there was this uh a 2003 Vice made it their documentary on themselves and he tells a story about when they started the company how he got arrested in Bangkok uh Bangkok and he said something like a few years later they were like yeah remember that story you talked about being imprisoned in Bangkok and he was like yeah yeah I remember that and he goes tell me more about that he goes well I made it all up we needed a story on how that we needed a story on how the company started and I heard the story from someone else so I just took it over and we needed and I just had to take make it mine he's like I want something over three and uh decided that was my life dude he would do crazy stuff like that all the time there was another time where I was reading this interview with him he uh there was this headline about how he spent three hundred thousand dollars at dinner in Vegas and a Reporter Goes did you really spend three hundred thousand dollars for dinner he goes no it was 380 000 plus tip and it was barely dinner it was mostly wine uh and so he's just he the guy's like wild he even tells uh crazier stories where he goes this was a quote from uh the uh Financial Times here we go I would be at the party and would just go get wasted take Coke have sex with girls in the bathroom and then get uh and then afterwards mail my advertisers drugs because I knew if I sent them a bunch of drugs in the mail they would keep buying ads with us and he admits all this stuff it's crazy mancraft I just don't get it well so check this where did we go wrong was it when we mailed our customers drugs or when I did drugs during the day when I was working with my shirt off having sex in the bathrooms dude he tells a story about him and his co-founders having threesomes with like people who are going to buy ads with them and he says that they were like Mobsters who accidentally clanked shovels together while they are bearing a body if that analogy makes sense when someone was like what's it feel like having a having sex with your co-founder and you know do you guys ever like touch he goes yeah but it's just like two Mafia guys and our shovels accidentally complaint while we're preparing the body [Laughter] wow this guy is a showman he's a total Showman of course it didn't work out well in all seriousness did uh totally blew it it didn't it didn't work out well for the company but it worked out for him so Google Shane Smith house yeah I see a 50 million dollar house I'm up two steps ahead he already Googled it so this there's this amazing article that came out in 2008 where it's all about Shane Smith and it says Shane Smith's living large and it documents his new house that he purchased for 30 million dollars I think and it's this beautiful mansion up in uh La somewhere while he recently sold it for 50 million dollars so like this guy has totally come out on top of this of this whole thing and I it just really fascinating that he basically came in he spent about 15 20 years doing his thing right before like Ty the tide change and like these guys were the opposite of woke now Vice is like the woke us of the woke but right before that change happened he got his money he got out and he bounced and he hired a CEO and uh his story is super super fascinating and so you've never heard of him I've never heard of him I briefly knew that Vice started as a as a Zine or a magazine what's your main takeaways because this is entertaining because this guy's like Felix Dennis just like reincarnated um so what's your takeaway you're a media guy you're you're a bit of a wild man what's your take on this not that one I mean this guy makes you look like a like a you know choir boy or something but uh what's your takeaways from this story I have a bunch of takeaways and so but first let me tell you how their business model works because that's part of my takeaways so a lot of people don't realize how they make money they're going bankrupt now but they still make 600 million a year in Revenue but it's just like wildly unprofitable so they their company it's basically like I consider it like a mortgage-backed security for media and so do you remember like the mortgage-backed Securities of 2008 where it was basically like Banks would buy like tens of thousands of mortgages in one tranche turns out like 4 000 of the 10 000 were [ __ ] that's exactly what Vice does and so they they got famous because they only had like 20 or 30 million monthly visits to their website vice.com which isn't a ton that's not a ton for hundreds of millions in Revenue what they did was they did uh they partnered with omgfacts.com distractified.com and all these other click bait websites and they would roll that up and so they would sit call them part of the vice Network and so they would tell people uh you know like Intel or whoever the big advertisers are look we reach all of uh Millennials and we have a hundred million 200 million monthly uniques to our Network in reality it was on like [ __ ] sites like you know all those other things and that was like once that came out it was kind of frowned upon and then the other way they made money was they had an agency called virtue like Vice and virtue which was pretty clever but their whole company is basically a creative agency so they would make content for Snapchat Facebook and then eventually HBO and they would get paid like a service fee basically for it and it was basically one big agency and that's how they made money which brings me to the takeaways take away one if you're going to be a company that makes money from multiple different streams of Revenue you gotta nail one first they didn't even nail one like stream of Revenue they had like five other things that added up to a lot but not one of them worked wonderfully at least not enough to be profitable so that's one major takeaway the second major takeaway is they would always say they're going to be the next Disney they go we're going to be a mini Disney Shane once said we're worth 10 billion right now but conservatively I think we're gonna be worth 40 or 50 billion in a couple of years that couple of years would have been like in 2020 or something never worked out he goes we're going to be just like Disney except with Like Cocaine didn't work out why because no one likes them if you're gonna build the next Disney you got to be like people gotta love you you know people love Mickey Mouse they don't really love like Shane Smith you know and all that stuff you know they like them they don't they don't really love them so if you're going to be a media company like that you have to have something that people love the next thing is news if you're going to be in the news business that's really really hard because you have to stay relevant and I actually think that you should be something that typically people don't grow out of but they grow into meaning a Wall Street Journal a New York Times if you're going to be like one of these Publications economists Financial Times things like that you want to grow into it meaning like as you get older you want to like aspire to be able to read it and like it and understand it and brag about it whereas advice it was like I'm no longer 28 years old reading about this stuff is not exactly cool and plus the people working there you kind of look silly I've always thought about this about barcel sports I'm like dude Dave Portnoy is getting older like some of these Antics are kind of not going to be cool anymore they're more so like pathetic you know what I mean and that's kind of happened with advice yeah you basically uh you either stay with the stick and you just start to look like a clown as you get older and older or you gotta sell get out and change your life you know change your lifestyle and uh it's pretty interesting because it's very hard to let go because hey if you weren't such a nut you wouldn't have got that got this level of success in the first place so it's kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy and then on the second second uh part of it you know it's very easy to get addicted to the character the the fame the money that comes with with acting a certain way you're being rewarded rewarded rewarded and then now you're 57. and you're you know oh you know you're Vince McMahon now or your Hugh Hefner now or you're whoever right like it's hard to believe the character uh even though you might actually maybe you actually should uh you know grow out of it um anyways but I'm glad that these guys don't grow out of it it's for our entertainment thank you thank you for your service Shane Smith it is and the last two things if you're gonna build a media company avoid New York City like when you're a creative Services business you need it's a it's a talent Arbitrage and it's really hard to do that when you're in a really high cost of living City like New York and also you saw that they like became this whoa company which I don't entirely believe like go woke go broke like that type of thing I do think that um I think that like there's a niche you can make money in any Niche it doesn't matter if you're woke or not but they like changed that way when that wasn't originally what they did and I think they changed that way because they moved to like Williamsburg and everything like that and it totally changed their uh their their stick but the last thing is actually a compliment so you texted me the other day right before you're about to go on to you're gonna speak at this conference and you said uh what did you say about to drop some Showmanship on these [ __ ] is that what you said about to show these [ __ ] some Showmanship yeah and that is totally true and that is what he did and frankly even though he it seems as though he conned a lot of people he kind of got the last laugh and he had Showmanship throughout the entire thing and had it worked out it would have been a lot cooler but having Showmanship it totally worked by the way there's like story like oh do you get nervous before public speaking it's like I don't know man if I was nervous probably wouldn't be thinking I'm about to drop some Showmanship on these [ __ ] it's a different attitude exactly versus I hope I don't mess up dude he like throughout his career if you can like there's so many crazy stories about this guy it's all about Showmanship he does the wildest stuff where he like tells Stories the way he tells stories it captures your attention and some of his employees were like when I'm with Shane I feel like I'm going to war and I'll go to any war with him right or there's like uh Johnny Knoxville did a interview and he was talking about Shane and he goes he's the greatest uh leader you could ever have also the greatest drinking buddy yeah he like has all of these like amazing one-liners even if they are full of [ __ ] but whenever I hear him talk I'm like oh my God I believe everything you said so for example have you ever heard me say the best way to circumvent someone's [ __ ] detector is to not [ __ ] I've used that line a couple times I stole it from him so he would like he has all these like amazing one-liners and that Showmanship it's absolutely captivating there's like a story about him with Rupert Murdoch and Rupert Murdoch and Shane are walking and Rupert Murdoch is like a you know if you see the movie TV show succession he's like that guy he's like a mean old man and Shane sits down with them and goes you don't have Millennials but I do I have everything you don't have and like he's talking to this billionaire testosterone youth all right but he just like totally like swings above his weight and I think it's really fascinating to learn from this guy so if you're listening to this Google Shane Smith it's there's like crazy stories about this guy good segment by you good good job by you good job I like that one uh I actually have a spin-off of that you mentioned a company in there that I was like hmm that sounds familiar I kind of remember this name so you said OMG facts do you know who started OMG facts I do I forget his name but he's an oddball right this guy Emerson Sparks and I met ever since Sparks maybe 10 years ago and when he was building OMG facts and building uh a network called dose media he's like a genius right he is I met him and I was like wow this guy is super smart um I actually think that he is kind of like if he had just applied himself to some other areas he would have like totally uh done done some like you know absolutely amazing things everybody would know his name versus just kind of me and half of you knowing his name so I'm going to tell you a couple things about Emerson Sports so the guy when he was 12 years old built a website called muggle net and I don't know if you're a Harry Potter guy but I'm I'm a Harry Potter guy and I was on muggle net all the time and I used to love this because it was the number one Harry Potter fan site in the world tons and tons of traffic I mean at the time Harry Potter was like you know Justin Bieber Harry Potter was was super super famous and in between the books people wanted a place to discuss to post theories to post fan fiction to uh debate you know what should have happened blah blah and so muggling that when he's 12 he builds the super popular site getting millions and millions of visitors when he's 18 He publishes a best-selling book his best-selling book is called uh I think it's called Harry Potter should have died controversial views from the number one fan site and basically it's like Harry survived but should he have uh you know I run the world's biggest fan site for Harry Potter and here's some of the controversial viewpoints that people have about Harry Potter you could already see this guy's got the he's got the certain that owes you that comes with the sandwich he's got the sauce and uh he's got the Showmanship and so he I I met him maybe he was I don't know how old he was maybe 22 or something like this at this point and um where'd you meet him I don't even remember man I remember being on a call with a video call and it was him and I think his girlfriend at the time and they were creating something called dose media and I go so what is it he goes well we're gonna make like really viral content so uh they had OMG facts that was one of their companies they had like four or five websites like that one that was like science facts ones that was funny things one that was whatever controversial or pop culture stuff like references to TV shows and things that were hot right now and they had these websites and I go okay so how do you like at the time in my mind I was like going viral is getting you know lightning strikes you you know you it's just not something you try to do it's just something that happens or it doesn't happen and it usually doesn't happen he's like no no and he had built a four-part system and this is the first guy he's like yeah we're a different type of technology company we have uh 18 engineers and we have four writers and we reach millions and millions of people a month and I was like no no it was actually good I was like so what it what do the engineers do he's like well basically all the viral content on the in the world starts either in one of three places Reddit imager or 4chant and he's like basically I built a detector that would find stuff that's going that's getting hot on those on those three platforms first before it hits Instagram before it hits Facebook before it hits Twitter uh it's gonna get popular there first and he goes so we built a detector then we built a um like a then the writer basically would would uh build like like write a summary and then we built a a b tester that would basically create headlines um headlines and uh and and like different like uh frames of that same story and it would test them really quickly that we had a tester that would spray that out we would pay to get that in front of like you know five thousand ten thousand people we'd find what what's the winning angle and then we would have the post and then distribution right and then we would actually distribute that to our audience and so we could engineer a higher degree of virality in every piece of content why because we're finding the best stuff we're packaging it quickly with our writer then we're remixing it with our automated a b tester that's going to juice up the headlines and then the images then we're spraying it out getting data feedback telling us which of these 15 variations is the winner and then we post the winner and um I was like dude this is amazing and over the few years I saw him build this up and he his traffic kept going up and up now the problem was traffic wasn't that valuable it was kind of flyby traffic uh it was kind of like the lowest common denominator of the internet and from Facebook I think it was very dependent on social networks and then Facebook changed and for a while Facebook was like rewarding the hell out of anybody that could post viral content and then it got two clickbaity on Facebook and then Facebook just manually went and unplugged the like viral engines for for these companies and so like 10 companies died like you know uh in that transition I don't think his totally died but I think it definitely slowed down and I think he also grew up and was sort of like what else do I want to do in my life so now I just went to by the way really quick before that before you go on to him did I have I told you about my partner at Hampton Joe he had a company called little things which was the same thing as that it was a Content like clickbait website he started it in New York and then like he had all these he had multiple floors in an office building and it was killing it they were at 100 million in Revenue he had a deal sell they went through due diligence the deal was going to close in two weeks that change that you just referred to it happened to little things at the time little things was the most trafficked website from Facebook in the world so it was like little things and then it was like huffpo and then like BuzzFeed BuzzFeed yeah the deal was about to close I think for a hundred and something million he was gonna walk away with 50 million after taxes two weeks before the money was supposed to go through that changed happened the deal he lost the deal and weeks or months like only a couple months later they had to shut down the company and it was all because they built everything on top of Facebook that's a Mike Tyson gut punch right like uh and a bird's fly fish swim and Deals fall through that is the the the the the sad part about deals that that is too common yes and that's very common that's what happened to this guy Emmett smart Emmett smart so what happened to him Emerson Sports Emerson sorry yes but uh here's his bio now um he's his thing says like AI history complex systems of Bitcoin then he goes goal I'm gonna die number one on the leaderboard of people who changed the world and so his what he's doing now is something called non-linear and non-linear it looks like is basically a is basically a a company that is funding people working on AI to make it make sure that it's safe and so um so they they fund basically non-linear entrepreneurs people who are trying to work on these like exponential Technologies and so yeah they we incubate x x risk non-profits I don't even know what extras nonprofits means uh by connecting founders with ideas funding and mentorship and so that's what he's working on now but this guy's always going to do interesting things this guy can't this guy can't be uninteresting dude when I read about him I I was like why are you doing this dude like you're doing this dose media thing like you seem like a genius you're just absolutely wasting it this is a what do you say it's a uh High uh High effort low or what do you say like the hormuzy had a good one for this it's a 10 out of 10 um 10 out of 10 entrepreneur we're going at a 4 out of 10 opportunity and uh that's how I felt when I met him I remember literally like this is now 10 plus years later I have not spoke to this guy you mentioned OMG facts and in my mind I'm like that guy's smart follow up with that guy right because he left such an impression on me where I was like this guy is really really clever really smart really also like wholesome like even at the time he was like uh even though he was working on something that's like typically I would say almost everybody I know that's in this kind of like viral media actually just like lame there's kind of [ __ ] and um and I made that like in an endearing way like you know some people are [ __ ] and it's all right you're just like yeah I'm trying to I found this Arbitrage I'm making it happen um and so he was not that he was really soft smoking really really nice guy Ben says extra risk is the risk that something could end the world it's an existential risk okay yeah good so he's he's Gonna Save the Planet which is dude and his website is a is a DOT org yeah Noble mission.org type of guy when I was in Austin um a friend of mine was hanging out with Justin Mayers who's been on the Pod before I think I can quote this because I think it's a good quote but he said uh he goes Justin said the best thing he goes it doesn't matter how you make your first nut just gotta make your first nut but after you do that then you want to work on a noble Mission and he's like dude he's like I like that he's like you know do whatever you got to do to make to make your first nut which is you know get your that first few million dollars where you're financially free and you're and you're uh you don't have to have a job you can work on whatever the hell you want but then after that don't go chase the second nut go go after something that's a noble mission go after something that's awesome and um you know very few people actually do that in fact I don't even think Justin is doing that at the moment but but I I love the quote isn't he doing like an FSA spending store that's like the most like opportunistic thing I could think of the way that he pitched it it was pretty awesome he said something like uh obesity in America is like an epidemic and 60 of people are overweight we want to make you eat healthier by making it easier to acquire like you know this types of food and this type of healthcare and we're doing it via and then he like that's where the pitch comes in all right that's always a good look so his site I think it's called true medicine true Med so true Med he says food is medicine exercise medicine sleep is medicine we don't mean this in a theoretical sense food exercise and sleep are all scientifically proven to prevent or alleviate uh physical and mental illness in short these are all medicine it's a true Med is a payment integration that enables qualified customers to use pre-tax HSA and FSA funds to purchase health promoting products and services from their favorite Merchants soon it'll be available the checkout flow for all Merchants who are for merchants who sell healthy food supplements extra equipment and other health and wellness products this is such a good idea by the way this is a phenomenal idea this is a 10 out of 10 opportunity and uh dude he pitched me why have I not invested in this I mean I didn't invest because I was just like saying no to everything and I deeply regret it I deeply regret it because by the way this is the best way to pitch a business which is like you like paint this like dreary picture like the world is obese you know did you know that like if you add up all the terrorist attacks all the guns all the car accidents it would only be one-tenth of the people who die uh you know from being obese like you know that type of fact and you say like if we continue this this is what the outcome is going to be this and that and and so we need to solve this the way that we are happy to happen to be trying to solve this is by doing X Y and Z and I'm like all right that's a great pick yeah this is uh wow I am so jealous that I'm not invested in this I'm I'm messaging him right now all right um yeah that's it that's the Pod we're out of here [Music] foreign

at the beginning of the show we do this thing where we're like put your like raise your hand if you're an entrepreneur most of the hands will go up okay keep your hand up if you've launched your business all right like 15 of the hands go down okay keep your hands up if you have more than a hundred thousand dollars in Revenue okay hands go down a million dollars in Revenue 10 million in Revenue 30 million in Revenue we just keep going up to see kind of like who is who who wins the no small boy stuff competition of that of the crowd because we're like there's the people who are there they already kind of know our story and they know our bits we don't know them and so that might be actually more interesting there was a guy who was one of the people who's got like he was at the kind of like 30 40 50 million level he's like um yeah I uh I sell gear to fire departments around the country and he's like you know like we're like like hoses he's like like hoses and uniforms and you know nozzles and and like you know just stuff for the fire department and did he say that he did 57 million in revenue of that is that what he said I don't remember the exact number it was something like that [Music] all right we're live what's going on I'm back home the live pod is over the show the show is over let's talk about your time in Austin the light pod we should talk about a little bit we might be airing that that episode we got to go back and listen to it to make sure that there's nothing that we have to bleep out but what did you think about Austin it seemed like you had a great time had a great time dude I know more people in Austin than in San Francisco somehow so I think uh I don't know if that's about Austin or that's about me I think it's more about me not leaving the house here in San Francisco but when I left my house I went to Austin I saw tons of old friends you and a bunch of the crew um had a great time stayed uh started off in a haunted hotel and then moved to a better hotel and then uh yeah it was a good time you uh came in on something like a Wednesday you left on a Sunday or Thursday and Sunday or something like that Tuesday five days Tuesday Tuesday it's a Sunday you had you you spoke at two conferences you were on the Chris Williamson show which was uh that guy's interesting yeah but what what was cool having you here was I felt I felt um I missed our times in San Francisco the 2012-2018 era where it was like it felt like all of us were doing the same stuff then when you came in town we had everyone we we had like three or four dinners of like eight friends and it felt like oh wow this is it feels like it's happening again and actually it feels like it's not happening to the extent of what we experienced then but there are a lot of really special people here and it felt really cool like to to appreciate that yeah you're right uh I think people should do whatever we did in our kind of like 20s which was moved to the city where there's a bunch of other people that are um chasing the same dream as you I think that's like a that's an amazing like you could pick a city based on weather based on location you could pick it based on cost those are some factors but if you're in your 20s and you're the type of person who listens to this podcast you're sort of entrepreneurial you're ambitious I think the move is moved to a city where boom to a place I don't even know it was a city move to a place this could just be a house in the town you're in where you will be around other people who are chasing the same dream as you it is massively underrated like you will not only get smarter faster but also uh you bond with people and it's like those bonds don't go away uh you will always kind of remember when you were all at the very upstart phase of what you were doing and we did this live pod and this live podcast and the con so is me Sean and Andrew the content was fine enough whatever but we'll talk about that later or we'll just air the episode but what was cool was I met people I think we had 550 or 600 people it sold out and I met and so we stayed out Sean and I and Andrew stayed afterwards and like did like a meet and greet with everyone and you always talk to these people and I'm amazed that these people would fly in from all over the place I met a guy from Malaysia uh I met people from all over Mexico America North America uh who came and they were like I came here because in my town I'm a weirdo and it feels nice to be around non-windows and I was like what do you mean and I looked at Twitter afterwards and I saw pictures of like so like basically we didn't let people into the venue until right before it started and in the line I don't know if you saw this there was people interviewing each other like for their own content channels there's like people are like oh I met this person who's doing this I met this person who did this I met this lady did you meet this Mexican lady who moved to from like Mexico City to Ann Arbor and she flew down from Michigan it was her and her 12 year old daughter did you meet those people I did I love that they were she was like hey love the Pod this is my daughter she listens as well we listened together and I was like oh amazing you know what do you I asked the daughter I was like what do you what do you like about the show uh because she was she was quite shy in the moment and she was like ah just yeah I like that it's fun uh it just gets me laughing and then uh you know I just learned different things and it makes me want to go do like it makes me want to go do stuff and I was like you know that's the that is the actual sales pitch right you'll laugh uh you'll learn something and it'll it'll get you excited to go do stuff um and the mom was like you know thank you uh for the Pod because it's the only like it's the only podcast we can listen to together that we can vote that we both enjoy so it's like become a thing we do and um you know that's probably not that common but uh that was one of my like Golden Nugget kind of moment takeaways from the whole thing yeah she was my favorite person I met but anyway my point is is that it was cool that like um and what you're saying is what we saw a very micro version of that with 500 people was like go to the place where there's other weirdos like you and like cool stuff happens and and that's always really fun I met a lady who was like uh yeah you talked about me in the Pod and I recently sold that thing for 30 million dollars and she was like waiting in line for like 30 minutes to talk to me and I was like yeah let's do some of the interesting people that we met so there was a guy um at the beginning of the show we do this thing where we're like put your like raise your hand if you're an entrepreneur most of the hands go go up okay keep your hand up if you've launched your business all right like 15 of the hands go down okay keep your hands up if you have more than a hundred thousand dollars in Revenue okay so hands go down a million dollars in Revenue 10 million in Revenue 30 million in Revenue we just keep going up to see kind of like who is who who wins the no small boy stuff competition of that of the crowd because we're like there's the people who are there they already kind of know our story and they know our bits we don't know them and so that might be actually more interesting there was a guy who was one of the people who's got like he was at the kind of like 30 40 50 million level he's like um yeah I I sell gear to fire departments around the country and he's like you know like we're like like hoses he's like like hoses and uniforms and you know nozzles and like you know just stuff for the fire department and did he say that he did 57 million in revenue of that is that what he said I don't remember the exact number it was something like that was it was either 30 or 50 million something somewhere there he said he had an exclusive right to sell in nine states so like you know beautiful business right because he's got a basically a monopoly on selling in these in these certain States he's like won the contract or whatever and really profitable business that uh you know who even thinks that like who even thinks about who's the who's the B2B e-commerce for fire departments and it just gets you thinking wow how many Niche businesses are there because you just kept meeting one after another uh do you have any others that stood out I got a couple more uh we went to dinner so we had a dinner the night before one business that I really like that uh I'm eager to see if it's gonna work out and not is called boom and bucket and what boom and bucket does is I I don't know if it's rental or if it's for selling it's selling but I think is it selling so basically if you are if you own a uh or if you need to buy a um tractor or like a one like anything caterpillar so like dump trucks I guess uh boom and bucket whatever you know whatever has a bucket and Carries there's a market plate yeah it's a really good name it's a boom and bucket and it's a really cool website and so they I think uh the founder his name is Adam Lawrence he previously was the CEO of Bolt bolt was like this like high flying startup one-click checkout startup to be determined if it's gonna work out but they raised something like hundreds of millions of dollars at multiple billions valuation he left there after being there for a while then he went and started boom and bucket and he's telling me all about it I think it's only a year old or two years old still new so they're still figuring out if it's gonna like take off or not I think but really cool business that I actually think will work once they can kind of get uh uh uh to to you know marketplaces you need supply and demand it's really cool I'm on their site right now so boom and bucket which also sounds like an amazing name for a bar in Austin like you know a bar with like you know dollar jello shots and like uh you know the ax throwing in the back I feel like that's actually in Austin people just have that in their backyard the ax throwing thing that's like that's what it seemed like so no bro we all have coal plunges and saunas so the first thing on here is a two a 2012 caterpillar 420f for somebody out there they're like oh my favorite model uh I've been dreaming about that one yeah 77 000 ships Nationwide you click it and it's basically like here's the thing it was priorly used in construction for concrete uh you know here's the specs uh we inspected it here's what we found that was great about it here's what needs work it's got a residual oil buildup on the engine valve cover no active leak scene so they're adding value by doing inspections and doing close up detailed photos of the equipment and then they say great you can buy through us we will finance it to you and we will take care of the shipping to get this to you um this seems like a great idea I don't know anything about this Niche so you know take that with a grain of salt but um love the name love the idea and I love that this guy went from like the most Silicon Valley VC thing you can do like a network effects VC funded multi-billion you know unicorn that's either gonna become 100 billion dollars or go to zero and he's like I'm gonna move to Austin grow a mustache and start selling tractors online dude he had a he had a thick beautiful mustache and he was wearing cowboy boots and he looked exactly he looks like you want him to look he looked like he was in Disguise yeah I feel like you're just trying to blend in in Austin so this guy's awesome his name's Adam Lawrence I love Adam I've I've gotten a gnome over the past year so he was cool who else was was interested um another one that I thought was cool these guys were in the meet and greet line they come up and they're like hey love the Pod blah blah blah no questions just want to picture um or actually they have one question they were like you know we do franchise marketing and I was like franchise marketer what uh say more and they're like basically five percent of McDonald's stores use us as their digital marketing agency and social media marketing agency and I was like ah five percent of McDonald's franchises that's like that seems really significant they're like yeah it's going great and this is actually the second time I heard about it and this is kind of my rule of two which is if I hear about the same thing from two completely separate people it's like well roll up the sleeves time to go down a rabbit hole plug the nose you heard someone talk about the same business or the same like literally or the same style same style of business so our buddy cieva had told me about this these businesses so there's a two businesses called one's called scorpion marketing and the other is called ferocious marketing uh okay I see it normally seems like a little bit of an overcompensation but they actually sound like badass businesses yeah I need like a I need like a like a like a rabies LLC you know what I mean it's like yeah fever marketing or something I need something like that I love that hey we're from Dengue um yeah we're happy to help we make it hot if you know what I mean Genghis Khan Incorporated I love it kill the competition he had told me that one of those two I don't remember if it was Scorpion or ferocious does over 100 million dollars as just a kind of like Google pay-per-click Plus um you know basically Google Ad Agency plus maybe uh maybe Facebook ads as well for franchises like they go to Every you know Goodyear tires in America and they're like yo you need to have a good presence online this is what we do we help could your tires franchisees make more money in your location you pay us whatever 10 grand a month and we take care of your website your marketing will make sure you're visible on Yelp and on Google when people are searching for tires blah blah blah and that's what they do and they go do the same thing they did in tires and then they'll do it in Jamba Juice and then they'll do it in you know one franchise after another and so I kind of love this model I think that this like this idea of general like generic agency but agency that is tailored towards franchisees I think is great why franchisees all are going to have the same problem set you're going to have a cookie cutter customer I love that you typically if something is a franchise it's got scale already so you know that Niche is sort of validated third it's the easiest marketing pitch in the world once you get started which is that yeah we do uh over you know if five percent of McDonald's franchisees use us or we're the largest Agency for McDonald's franchisees we are the number one we serve over 150 store uh franchisees guess what the 151st is way easier to sell to once you got to the 150 right it's like it becomes a snowball in terms of your marketing um your operations can get streamlined because they all again cookie cutter customer they all need the same thing and then lastly that type of customer a franchisee they've basically put like their net worth on the line to own these franchises they typically are not like these brick and mortar franchisees they're doing that because they're not super tech savvy or online Savvy and so I think it's the perfect kind of customer and you can just provide clear Roi from month one and I think you could do this in a lot of niches like I think you could do this in like senior living like my father-in-law has a senior living facility and um he is like he basically like the entire business is just how's our occupancy and uh you know if occupancy's at 55 versus 65 versus 75 versus 85 that's like this that's a swing of like 10 million dollars just in that that question right there oh wow um and so I'm like great hey Dad what are we doing for well how are we feeling that occupancy right like you know what are we doing and he's like well I don't really know how to do online marketing because most people who own senior living facilities are not the most tech savvy he's like so we need like uh like a come die with us Mark he's like we host a coffee and donuts like brunch for the local Hospital nurses because that's like their number one source of deal flow right now and then there's these search engines like like place for mom.com or something like that and you know you you try you tell them hey I'll pay you for leads but they just don't bring you that many leads and so somebody who can basically solve the search query for like you know Senior Living Austin or Memory Care Austin or whatever the person who can rank you at the top for that search is gonna be the difference between 55 occupancy and 75 occupancy I think and so I think if you found a niche or a franchise like that doing the the sort of digital marketing for it I think becomes very appealing yeah you just have to run it which can be challenging running those companies are is very hard but getting customers I think is is actually easier than but what's the one thing to running a company easier if you had good a good way to get new customers it is like for sure the number one like you know Advil for all aches and pains when it comes to running a business is well at least we're getting a bunch of customers like you know easily we have a reliable way to do that uh every other complaint from there is like you know just a little little bump and Bruise another interesting person who you met for the first time was Nick Gray so Nick Gray was like the we asked me to like MC our event and then he ended up just attending every other like dinner that we had and he like emptied it hardcore and what's interesting about Nick Gray is you guys should look him up is he's in like real time you can watch him like become an authority on this very strange topic of like hosting small Gatherings right and he might be able to turn this into something substantial and just to give you an example of what happened we had this like fancy restaurant booked for this one dinner it got rained out because it was like the table was partially Outdoors so we went to this kind of crappy bar and then we moved to another bar next door that was also somewhat Outdoors but had a roof and Andrew one of our guests was like oh man is it going to be cold and Nick was like yeah it might be cold hold on and he ran to a shopping mall across the street and bought like a hundred dollar long sleeve t-shirt and goes I got you and how impressive is that he was The Ultimate Party host which is no surprise because that's what he does so his I don't know him you know him very well I I just met him and I'm and just I'm just got my first dose of Nick Ray and I can't wait for my second dose so basically it sounds like he ran a company called Museum hack which was basically a kind of like a night adventure company so you would go to a museum the tour would be hosted by a local stand-up comedian or magician or somebody who's got some Showmanship and uh and basically he paired Showmanship with something that needed Showmanship Museum tours and it was a good company I think it was making a couple million maybe one two million dollars a year of profit he sells the business takes the proceeds invests it into I think did you say all of it into Tesla or like just a lot of it so previously he had made money because he him and his family started an aviation Parts business so they made like the screens that go in like private jets like uh like the uh navigation screens with the earnings that he had from that business he invested it all in Tesla and there's these funny pictures of him during the New York Marathon years ago and he would hold up signs that says buy Tesla because he was like trying to show up everywhere and just Tesla bomb yeah yeah and then he uh killed it on that and then he started this uh Museum company with this proceeds he put it into cloudflare which has not done well but you'll see him all the time it's really funny you'll see him like someone will be like what's the best service for this and he'll just reply on Twitter I hear a cloud cloudflare is really good you should check out cloudflare like he's like promoting it and with his book he says the same thing he's got this book called two hour cocktail party if you go on Google photos and look at the reviews of any bar in Austin he's been there and he's reviewed it and when he reviews it he takes a picture of his book in front of the sign or the food of that restaurant as like Gorilla Marketing that's all he does he does little things you told me about this guy as this kind of like super social guy that's in Austin that's like now doing this thing called a two-hour cocktail party and um and he sold like out of 10 000 plus units of of that book and he was like um and I couldn't tell at first I was like well is he an idiot or a genius and I think this is a common game I play where I meet somebody and I I'm playing the Indiana genius game and the case for idiot was like wait so he like sold his company and that was all in on this chest perfecting this like owning this little sub brand this Con this content brand around hosting a two-hour cocktail party I I can't tell you the last cocktail party I hosted so so I was like he spent three years and he was all in and then all the things you told me about the way he was promoting the book and books in general are not a great business model so I was like what is this guy getting at and that was my like is he an idiot but very quickly I've shifted into no this guy's a tedious and here's why so first of all it's a real problem hosting a hosting a party a hosting hosting any kind of party forget like a specifically like two hour cocktail party but hosting a dinner party is something that is valuable if you do it kind of stressful when you do it and there's a difference between bad good and great that comes into a bunch of details and the details are things like when you invite people how do you prep them for it what is the email you sent beforehand that reminds people even that this is happening what it's going to be about and how they should show up uh and that when they show up like how do people have to introduce themselves oh he's a bigger yeah Gotta Have name tags name tags help because whether you name tag name tag name yeah you gotta have name tags okay what else do you have to have he's like well you kind of want the event to Flow versus just having it be like well whatever happens if we break out into to random clicks of people that already know each other or a giant group where it's kind of awkward uh you know what's gonna happen and so he's like has his little sister he's like I'm gonna have some other structured time and some structured conversations and then back to unstructured after the structured because the structure gave us all something to talk about in the unstructured time he's got to say it goes into little things like hey you know if you host something at your house like people nobody knows what the trash is and so they're opening all your cupboards of your house trying to find [ __ ] now they're just going through all your [ __ ] and then they just leave it on the counter and now your house again now the party's looking like a college rap party just put a label where the trash is let's just do that and he's got all the little reminders and tips and tricks for a hosts Okay so solves a real problem that's kind of stressful and kind of valuable if you do it right like we've both been to parties where the magic happens the conversation just gets really interesting you meet three or four people that you're like become really good friends with you did this actually like this is how we met was it you host our dinner party at my office and so like you know the right dinner party can lead to some really great things and the wrong one is just forgettable okay so now why do I think it's actually a genius I think he's got a win-win scenario and what I mean by a win-win scenario is that whether this becomes a big deal or not he wins the first part is by doing this He is building like the ultimate friend group network like I think uh Andrew called him Andrew Wilkinson called him a friend billionaire he goes Nick's a friend billionaire and he'll and Nick won't brag about it but I'd be like what'd you do this weekend he's like oh I was at a friend's house I was like who he was like oh uh Matt mollenwag the guy who started uh WordPress yeah we were just I was just at his house all weekend and I was like what how do you know Matt he's like oh I met him at a dinner or this and he like has so many stories like that and when you are a front billionaire what does that mean that means you you know a lot of cool people so you're constantly inspired by the people you're around you got a lot of people who you know got your back into love you and you have a bunch of of like real connections and like real a real social life which I think is like I think it's kind of like one of these like silent like you know epidemics that's going on right now is that most people I know have like a really weak and feeble friend group maybe I'm just in that world I don't know but like a lot of people have this feeling of like great I work from home I live at home I eat at home I order food on doordash and like I don't see another human being for like you know I can go seven days without seeing another another like person with a pulse or even if you are seeing people it's all transitional transactionals great I live in SF or LA and I go to Barry's boot camp and everybody rushes in and does the thing and then rushes out and like this like what happened like where am I supposed to make new friends uh you know that's not really like that easy for most people so anyways I think that what Nick has is actually quite rare so whether all this is is he makes a bunch of friends has a bunch of fun experiences um and you know he was showing me this video on his phone he's like check this out he's like last night after we hung out I was on my way back and my friend texted me and said you gotta check this out it's flooding in my area but it's created like this almost like fake surfing thing like it was like flooding on some Street and the water was running really fast but there was like a lip in the in the road and so he could you could go on a boogie board and basically feel like you're surfing and they just did that for like hours and he had these fun videos and I was like cool I was just like on my phone scrolling whether you were doing that right like this guy's not only I was watching billionaire he's gonna have he's like an experienced billionaire so I think that's the that's the bottom of the win of if nothing else he gets that but at the top I'm like dude I kind of think this should be a local franchise like I think that he should basically turn this into like the modern day Toastmasters like I think if he wanted to this could be an enormous business and it could help a lot of people because he could basically say look open up a local chapter like Toastmasters and um it's just dedicated to hosting awesome get-togethers of awesome people I'll train you how to host them right you fly out to me you attend one of these that's part of your training and um and then go wherever you live and start hosting these things and uh you know pay your membership dues to to be a part of this and let's let's create an international wave of people who want to get better at hosting things and having an awesome social life I think he could create the next Toastmasters what do you think so Toastmasters uh so for those who don't know Toastmasters I don't know entirely how they describe themselves but I I knew it as like a public speaking Club so you spend 50 or 100 a year something like that and you get to go to a local chapter where you like everyone practices public speaking but I think they weave in some type of leadership component where you can like learn how to lead but it's all related to public speaking there are non-profits so you can look them up so Toastmasters has 63 million dollars in assets of which looks like about 35 million of that is just cash and then they did last year something like 18 million 19 million in membership dues oh sorry 25 million in membership dues and about 30 million in Aggregate and total revenue so like not a nice that's very nice uh so it definitely worked yeah exactly and I think that like you know there's a lot more people who want to be able to host the party and build an awesome kind of like social life for themselves then there are people who want to get are at public speaking and uh so I think this actually has a lot more legs and it reminds me of the game so I haven't read his book but uh but the way Neil Strauss wrote the game and was like hey do you want to get better you know like meeting women if so you know this is a book that's going to tell you a bunch of awesome you know sort of War Stories plus techniques that that can help you do that and I think that this reminds me a little bit of the game it's got the benefits of the game without the sleaze factor of of the game and so for that reason I'm in and I just gave up I just gave him I just gave him the thought leader triangle with my hands for those who are listening you start with the Pyramid of hands going upwards and then on the on the inflection point of the sentence you gotta flip it down this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated whoa I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better did you meet anyone else that was interesting or have any other uh thoughts about uh people you met or experiences I got a couple high level thoughts a couple high level thoughts the most so we do the meet and greet for like I don't know it was almost like two hours or something after the show uh just like people are you tired after that um I have this thing where relief gives me a lot of energy so I was so relieved that the show was over that I felt like people had a good time um and that I didn't like my trip was over I was gonna go home and get to just like be in my bed and not have to be I was traveling with my two little kids which is you know it has its own challenges I had no less than 10 people reference the size of the cotton candy that your children had they were like my wife wanted to see the show so she brought my kids were two and three years old to the show that's like you know that's like you know opening up a a lighter inside of a natural gas Factory like you you kind of knowing this thing could combust at any second and she just had a backpack of bribes which I think actually should be its own product from traveling moms it's just a pre-made backpack full of like little dollar store toys that you can give out every 15 minutes to be like all right be occupied don't scream and cry and think about anything and just unbelievable amounts of crazy candy that they never get to eat like a bathtub size container of cotton you've got a seven layer lollipop it looked like you know those like dude someone told me they're like we saw Sean's eating Sean's kids eating a kebab or like a hot dog or something except Sour Patch Kids it was like uh you know when the shake builds like a 95 story like apartment for himself in uh in Dubai it was the the Shake Dubai tower of lollipops it was incredible yeah I had a bunch of people uh tell me about that but anyway what were you saying so I would say in the meet and greet line the most common I would say the most common questions and I don't know what you experienced because you had your own line and I had my own mind so maybe yours was different I got a lot of people being like hey whatever love the show can take a selfie and then got one question for you and the question I was like oh this is gonna be a it's probably gonna be a doozy right that they're they won't you know they're getting they're using their one shot on this question and it would the most common questions the most obvious answers it would be like you know I'm trying to decide between this or this you know what do you think I should do but what do you want to do I really want to do this all right well then you should probably do that one or like I don't know it's like a few like I mean do you want do you like do like one more than the other like do you you know do you want one if you if you did know what you wanted what would you say yeah I know you don't know what you want but if you did know what would you say and they're like B I'm like cool do be then right or it'd be like yeah and I and I hate giving that answer because it's like uh you know not that we're someone's hero but don't meet your Heroes because like yeah we just give you the most obvious right obvious answer or the second one is like I'm doing this this and this and I go oh cool what are the results they'll tell me I'm like what were the results last year okay well just yeah keep going sounds like it exactly either it's working don't don't mess it up or sounds like it's not working do you wanna like you're asking me for investment and uh actually you should be asking for advice right because it's not working uh you know the same thing was like I'm doing these I got these two ideas I got one company I do this and another company I do this and I'm really it's really hard because blah blah cool sounds like it into two companies uh like do you think do you think the optimal strategy is going to be to do two startups at once or one like they're like uh yeah one probably cool so which is the better business like which one do you want to do which one is working better and then they're like well no but see this one kind of feeds into this one and I'm like no it actually eats away at all of your time in mind share it doesn't feed into anything and they're like hmm I'm like you know like Elon Musk can run two companies at once he might even be able to run three but um until you have you know like until your palm is like you know a physics textbook like you know until you can unless you're built the way he's built like it's probably not the optimal strategy for you like if you're in this meet and greet line I'm just gonna tell you right now probably you don't want to be a CEO of three startups at once and so the obvious answer for most of them is like but what if you just focused on the one that's that you like more or is working better like I think that would probably work better than trying to make both of these these fledgling things work and so I felt almost silly that that was the case and what we're saying here about everyone was searching because we met like a bunch of successful people for example probably one of the more successful people we met was this guy named AJ Patel who is like 32 or 35 or something like that and he started a dog supplement company which whenever I hear about that I'm like that's the greatest thing ever because who knows if like the product works but he originally sold a portion of the company at like 200 million dollar valuation and then a few years later sold it for 650 million dollars in valuation and he seemed pretty like zen-like like he kind of had his act together but still there was some things where he was like trying to figure out what to do next and like he had normal questions that everyone else had and on here you had everyone searching yeah actually I want to say one last thing about that previous thing about most common most of the common questions at the simplest answer that's not a knock on those people what I meant is dude this game is not as complicated as we make it I have the same I do make those same mistakes and all it takes is just a third party with like a fresh set of eyes just like well sounds like he's just picked the one you want to do right or like instead of doing three things try focusing on the one and it'll probably work better or like you know whatever and so I think that it's useful to almost have that be your own coach in that way and save yourself a lot of Heartache because that it wasn't a knock on those individuals it's that is the common problem um is that we we don't have complex problems we have SIMPLE problems and a simple problem doesn't need a complex answer it needs a simple answer so that was my point there all right this to the second thing yeah everyone is searching it didn't matter who we were hanging out with net worth zero net worth 100K net worth 1 million 10 million 100 million and the billionaire we had dinner with everybody was searching searching for meaning searching for what's next searching for what they should be doing with them their time searching for a better challenge searching for a way to to solve their problem it just felt like everyone's searching specifically a lot of people were searching for like Direction and it really made me like it really highlights me the value of when you know you when you have a clear Direction the value of that to like be grateful for that and find people who are good at figuring that out because I think if you stay in that searching state for too long that shit's dangerous it's like an Inception it's like we can only be in the dream for an hour before we forget that it's a dream uh you know we got to do that thing where we [ __ ] cold plunge ourselves to get back out of it wake back up it's like there is it's okay to be in a Wandering mode or a searching mode or kind of a thinking mode like what do I want to do but after six months after 12 months after 18 months like that [ __ ] becomes you get lost in the sauce and uh I felt like there were kind of a lot of people that were lost lost in the sauce uh that their their search was sort of like almost indefinite and I think that's that's dangerous that's interesting and that's actually really scary that's that kind of a because it's one of those things where if it goes on for too long it gets even worse and then you know you're like you know ass deep in it and you're like oh no yeah you forget how to even start the engine it's like this car hasn't been on for a long time does the engine start and I think you're good at this I think the way I think you're really good at this the way you are very structured helps you because I think you're very like regimented you're like for the next three months I'm gonna only talk to people and figure out what I want and after three months I'm gonna have a conversation with myself and shift into the next gear and because you're that is my read of it at least I I don't know what goes on in your head but my read of it is no that's exactly how time box things and you know there's an argument to be had for like just wandering around and letting you know don't you can't control everything but I think having these creative constraints these like time box constraints helps keep you honest like am I really am I even learning from my wandering at this point or am I just have I forgotten like my head for my feet do I even remember what the hell I'm supposed to be doing right now and so I think you know you had a period post hustle and pre-ampton that was like your searching period but it was like I think you knew you were gonna search you knew you were going to wander and explore which meant don't jump into something really fast but also don't let that last forever is that right yeah well I'm obsessed with time so like even when I was 20 years old I had this document I think if you Google like my name and then CEO doc you'll be able to find this spreadsheet and I would map out I think I had thousands of them of all these biographies of people I read and I would type in uh like when they started their apprenticeship when they got successful and the time it took to do that I was obsessed with time and the reason time's important is I think that the constraint is incredibly necessary I read this book by Robert Greene and he talked about urgency and that was the first time that I learned about the importance of urgency and so that's why I'm obsessed with time and so usually what I do is I have this thing called worry time which is very similar to like searching time but worry time is like here's the period that I can worry about this these following things so like it could be like you know I'm not sure that here I'll make a list of all the things uh going on in my life that are that are happening right now that I'm not sure about like it could be like this podcast it could be um my relationship it could be anything and it's like all right on Sunday from three to eight I'm gonna worry about right and I'm not and then I'll like set time aside to worry about it and then I'll send it and like lead into every moment of every day and be this underlying worry or anxiety that just sort of like plagues you yeah so it's just like uh you know like have you ever used headspace the meditation app there's this like cool thing go ahead yeah I like com2 but Andy the guy who would narrate it be like all right today we're gonna uh we're gonna do the meditation whatever now the cloud is above you let's put all of our thoughts and feelings and worries in that cloud above us now let's just walk a few feet away now we're away from the cloud we can acknowledge that like our worries are up in that cloud but we're no longer under it and we can go back under it when we're ready and worry about it and so that's kind of where I came up with like worry time and so I have worry time and I also do the same with like searching time so it's like all right I'm gonna search for this and then in three months I'm gonna say did I find it or not no okay fine we'll give another three months and then once I find it it goes searching is done we are no longer searching so I actually uh turned off like this is just a very small example I turned off the Twitter DMS of my Twitter handle because I would get all these interesting opportunities but I said nope we are done with opportunities I have the opportunity we are going to pursue that and then at a later date we'll open back up to pursue New Opportunities maybe but right now there's no nothing new right and uh I like we my wife and I were joking but it's not really joking it's like my rule right now is No New Friends I don't need new friends I have the friends that I want that is perfect I'm not gonna go out and hang out with new people No New Friends because uh you know like the searching time is done for now and we'll open it up at a later date auditions will come at a later date for new ideas and new friends dude that's great uh I love the way you said that I do a similar thing but without uh I I hate the word time I'm the opposite of you I I want to get off the concept of time altogether um but my but in reality the result is actually very very similar what I do which is I focus on the word constraint so how can I use a constraint to my advantage I love this because naturally I'm always constrained right like I don't always have every resource at my disposal to do what I want to do right let's say I'm traveling and I don't maybe have the time or the equipment to get to the gym to do the same workout that I was doing before then how do I get excited about the constraint okay I got this wall I have the floor I've got my suitcase ah interesting I can air squat the suitcase and then I can you know do these like I could do a push-up challenge where I'm going to do 100 push-ups in the next five minutes and I'm gonna see you know if I how far under that time I can get and you know you do that and you've used a constraint to your advantage to have a better experience so I always have this thing which is I'm not going hour to hour I think that's a really I think time creates a lot of stress in people's lives so I want to use constraints without the stress of time so what I say is like all right I'm trying to have an experience right now what kind of experience do I want I want a sweaty workout experience okay how can I now use an exp use a constraint to ratchet that up and make it even better um right like and that's how I want to do things so I'll do the same thing where I'll constrain myself all right I'm gonna turn off DMS or I'm going to do no do a No New Friends season and I'll use these words like season just to sort of time box them but without the sort of urgency or stress of like the thing you did where you're like how successful were these guys by 30 dude that would have just made me feel miserable so I had to like tweak that a little bit for myself where I didn't want to always feel perpetually behind in life um and so my way of doing that was focus on all right I'm about to walk into this room what kind of experience do I want to have and get good at choosing that and then be like how can I use a constraint to like level that up to enhance that rather than feeling constrained by lacking some resources that I otherwise would want to make this happen I think the time thing is important because you do compare yourself to others and comparing yourself to others everyone says is bad I actually think in some ways it's really great because you see what's possible just like if you're like an athlete or you're like I want to be like this athlete I want to be strong but I want to be stronger than them or faster or whatever but whenever we do these events and I meet all these amazing people like an AJ like a Thule like an Andrew Wilkinson and I hang out with them and I think I'm behind I'm waiting that's the and that's dangerous that's dangerous that's the thing I referenced the other day when I said there's the there's the um the science of success and there's the art of fulfillment what the comparing yourself will help you in the science of success it will motivate you it will put a chip on your shoulder it'll get light a fire under your ass but it's not going to help on the art of fulfillment side and so what some people try to do in life is be like let me solve the success thing first and then I'll do the happy thing after that and I think what you'll do if you look at remember my back to my everyone is searching thing what ends up happening is people solve the success thing to try to throw a bunch of money at the happy thing it works to an extent but not all the way there the kind of disillusioned and they just sort of fall back on well let me just go do more success [ __ ] at least back then when I was only focused on success I felt better and I know how to do that but more than I know how to be happy and uh and so or or it's like I thought this number would give me the answer it turns out I was just one question five times yeah yeah it's actually it's not it's not 50. it's actually 150. somebody said I was just wrong they said it's always three times more than what you got uh like people always think three times more then then I'll I'll chill out after that I'll really move on to that next phase and I think while I don't think that's a bad path I don't think you end up in a bad spot I do think there's probably a better version of it which is like can I do happy and successful at the same time is that possible we were talking and I'm gonna add them here but it's nothing crazy but we were had dinner with Andrew Andrew you know his company as of Friday I don't know what to say it was worth 850 million in Canadian and I was like we were talking about like what's next and or like we were talking about like just personal like motivating factors and he was like like oh I was motivated because I wanted to feel secure financially because for some reason I always felt insecure as a kid and you know everything comes from like issues you had as a child and I was like do you feel secure now and he was like you know what not really and I'm like wow you don't we we're still not going to feel secure at that number uh like you you always need more and I always and I couldn't decide if I felt negative about that feeling or positive but I have realized that that might be the learning is that like you don't feel secure a lot of people don't feel secure regardless of what they have or what they don't have like it's the it's the same feeling of it's not enough like it can get taken away I I view it a little differently it's more like the security doesn't come from the money that feeling you want isn't going to be is it gonna change when the money changes in that in that way right like uh I feel secure now and I have one one billionth of whatever he's got right like it's like you know he why because I just view I just view it differently I have different insecurities that he's got right like uh but on the on the financial one I'm like as long as I still got my wits about being my two hands I'm always gonna be fine if I got my brains I got my hands I'll always be fine so what do I care I could lose all my money in crypto I can lose all my money in this this business could tank podcast I could say the wrong joke could get canceled on the podcast tomorrow still got my hands in my my brain all right I'll be I'll be I'll be all right and so if it's like Fitness right like if I put you in any fitness test I think you would feel pretty secure right like yeah I don't think I could be like Sam we're gonna do a work like I think if you invited me over you're like let's do a hard workout you know I'm not eating that morning I'm about my I don't know I gotta be light on my feet I gotta I gotta do like hey was creatine working one day let me take some of that like you know I'd be stressing out because I don't have the fitness security whereas I think if I invited you over for a hard workout you'd be like we'll see right or even if somebody even if David Goggins invited you for a hard workout maybe at that stage you would feel feel a little bit of the the lack of security but I think for most people in most situations you would feel pretty secure and so I I think it's everybody's chasing a feeling they think the feeling comes from a thing the feeling doesn't come from the thing the feeling comes from you and comes from practicing having that feeling and I think until people rock that they're just not going to have the type of feelings they want of happiness and all this other [ __ ] speaking of which we have a very sturdy audience I was putting my hand around on people's backs take a picture but yeah we had a whole bunch of broad bunch of deadlifters what's going on there was a there was a bunch of sturdy ass people maybe it's a a Texas thing but there's a bunch of big old boys that we're talking and women like every like there were so many strong people I I probably said it at least 20 times uh like you know it's like you're awkward the meet and greets are weird I don't know what to say to people uh so it's usually like oh I like your shirt or you look huge you're yoked but I said that so many times yeah yeah we got we have a interesting interesting demographic there's like the people that look like you the people that look like me and then there's the people that look like neither of us but it's kind of amazing how well distributed it's like a bunch of Indian dudes a bunch of really strong white guys and then like and then and then the other group which is a blend of normal people we had so many Indians and so many Indians with the really thick accents so I guess they just moved here do you think that we are are we popular in India because of the topic or because of you well I mean there's a lot of a lot of business topics out there they don't all have that I think you know like anything where's chamath from what's he he's uh is he Indonesia he's from Sri Lanka Sri Lanka I mean I don't know do they they probably love him too but it was like the six million people underwater or something like that it's like a very like I don't know how many of them even have access to like you know know about know about him but but yeah if he goes down here it's like the uh cult phenomenon him Naval biology like they really really look up to to those people no like it's like if you go to in China the most popular person was Kobe Bryant it's like Kobe Bryant was the star of stars because of some combination of like he's got the thing that they want like crazy like athleticism plus they piped those Laker games into China and like only Laker games for like a period of time and so he was just in everyone in China wishes they're a black man yeah exactly and he was just like look like a god compared to them right and it's like I think you you like people who are they're like you and so you feel like you could be them and then there's people who are so unlike you that you're like you are so different I just I I am in awe of what you are it's like the uh Bjork effect so Bjork you know is from Iceland which only has like five million people and like bjork's music sucks but every once in a while she would be like number one on the charts is because like everyone in Iceland right cheer for her because she was like doing something interesting in America or like Bruno Mars if you go to YouTube and look up Bruno Mars's videos on YouTube they have like three and four and five billion views on YouTube because everyone in the Philippines because he's like Filipino is like that's our guy you know what I mean so I guess that's why we have a really nice indian contingencies because you're their guy whereas with me it's just a bunch of like uh you know like guys from Ohio but whatever dude can I tell you speaking of Ohio can I um do a little bit here on Jerry Springer what about him R.I.P died two days ago I think um yeah his story is kind of crazy do you know much about Jerry's backstory wasn't he the mayor of of someone in somewhere in Ohio Dayton Ohio or something but he was really the mayor of was he was the mayor first and then yes so basically his career is like he at 25 he's the advisor to Robert Kennedy during his presidential campaign who I think died or gotten assassinated or something um yeah then he's like okay goes on to do like kind of like local city politics ends up becoming the mayor of Cincinnati for a brief period of time gets fired because he solicited a prostitute I think and got busted for it and so he's like oh sorry like yeah it shouldn't have paid for an escort or something um so now he's like out of the political game and he's you know in his 30s I guess and he's like what do I want to do next and so he he gets casted on to local TV to do a political show it's like oh you could be like our political kind of like talk show type of guy so he does that for for a little bit and then he gets his own show so he's I I don't remember what year this is like I don't know 91 or something like that and he gets his own political he's doing his own political talk show three years go by kind of uh unspectacular and then the moment happens a new producer comes in is like Hey look this political show it's going nowhere let's switch it up and the Jerry Springer Show is born so the producer comes in he's like look we're going to shift it towards controversy um dirty laundry and basically like we'll Captivate we'll make captivating TV by putting Scandal on air and we'll have like was it fake though so uh there's there's different opinions on this I read a bunch of like Reddit posts to people who are producers on the show or went on the show here's here's where I think it met it out which is they would cast for Scandal people would say yeah that happened to me the producers would intentionally not fact check anything and um so you could it could have either been real for you or you could have just been like if I do this I get to get on TV I get a flight to New York I get to go basically me and my my whatever person get to go on vacation to New York all sorts of pain we get to be on TV and you know that'll be that and so for some I think it was like truly real for a lot they were like kind of like make it up or they would embellish so it'd be like yeah I cheated but like actually they weren't best friends and I didn't like we knew each other first and blah blah and he actually knew about it already he's not finding out on air but like whatever we'll kind of recreate that and was it daily or weekly so I think it was a daily show it at its peak wow it's higher rated than Oprah so he becomes the number one Daily Show and for the first time in people's so so here's some of the kind of amazing things it goes 18 years on TV Jerry knows it's stupid but he's like this is what people want and I'm gonna give them what they want and I had a few takeaways from this whole thing right so first of all Jerry Jerry just that's iconic it's just so iconic and I love it yeah that was it was it was the pre-World star yeah dude we're World Star World Star lives in the shadows of Jerry so here's a couple things that stood out to me number one he gave people what they wanted not what they what he thought they should want and in fact he started with what he thought they should want oh here's the latest on the local political issues and where we stand and blah blah and he pivoted and he pivoted the right way and I think as entrepreneurs um there's a great like Gary Halper quote but he says no more never has more money been lost than trying to Market to somebody what they should do versus what they want to do and as a marketer you got to internalize that now there are some people that are not in my cult that that hate that phrase they think that's terrible that the world is terrible because of that they say no shouldn't we strive to be better shouldn't we strive to help the world be a better place and and not that like these sugar-filled cereals and these like you know dopamine social networks and all this stuff and so some people hate that that's true and they're fighting against it as an entrepreneur I'm in the camp of you are here to serve customers you're here to give them what they want if you want to win you give them what they want you get if you want to win really big you give them what they want in a way that no one's out no one else is giving it to them or maybe even that they didn't even realize that they wanted people didn't know they wanted this and you're the first to provide it but that's the game of business and uh to me so so anyways I think he's a great example of giving people what they want uh two he pioneered a new format so his whole format of like putting this dirty laundry on air and the fights the bouncers the like the the the pregnancy test for the DNA test reveals like this guy's a goddamn innovator uh number three he became number one he'd be bigger than Oprah in his prime and lastly what I love was he uh dude he did 5 000 episodes he got his friends to win too so his security guy Steve who became like a character a character on the show like their best friend Steve says you know the most wonderful things about Jerry and Steve gets his own spin-off show later after the after the Jerry Springer Show so I love that he kind of brought friends along the way and then they when he eats they all eat and there there was a few few good examples of that and the other funny thing about this and people people liked working for Jerry people I could tell you yeah like it was like the opposite of Ellen uh like Ellen is seen as this like you know America's sweetheart and then behind the scenes was like you know a menace and apparently Jerry was the opposite it's like he was seen as a menace to society and actually he was kind of a sweetheart um from what people said now maybe it was just the guy dies and no one wants to trash him but like that's what I found the last thing though that I thought was interesting was that in a weird way because this show is really popular like in the early 90s his show was actually the first show to expose people to like to people being gay or trans or like all kinds of stuff that's like totally lgbtq like and he was like this is a for a lot of people in America they had never met or heard of anybody who was in any of those categories and so he kind of was like the Band-Aid rip-off moment for for a lot of America on these things which I think is also kind of amazing the real world was kind of like that too I went to uh I went to an all boys high school and and like I remember being like 14 or 15 and for some reason the high school it was like a good the culture of the school like young men felt fine coming out and saying they were gay and I remember like meeting these kids and it was like the first time I've ever done that and like someone who admitted to being gay and at first I was like uh you know back then you you would make fun of people and then I you realize oh that that's that's horrible you obviously we shouldn't do that and it's they're my buddies um and then it goes back to and therefore because I love you I'm gonna make fun of you just like I make fun of all my other friends yeah yeah and because I love you I'm not going to treat you differently we're all boys and we're just gonna tease each other over someone has braces someone uh you know likes men whatever it doesn't matter we're gonna make fun of ourselves and that's just a way that's the way that young boys show that we accept each other that's how we show love it was just a mini it was a mini Jerry you know Jerry was first you know like like well we're not not gonna make fun of this person because of this and that we're actually going to do it because it shows that we're gonna it's normal we're gonna normalize it so who knew Jerry was so Progressive you know what I mean the guy was uh Robbie we got Rosa Parks Martin Luther King we got Jerry Springer he's just one of many in a lineage of pioneers breaking down social yeah I saw he died dude he seemed he always seemed really likable I remember watching him like did you watch it like did when your grandma like babysat you or something like that's like what I remember doing I was just home after school by myself yeah like at like it was like four o'clock when you get home from school you watch Jerry and Oprah I remember watching all or when you stay home from school being sorry you watch Maury yeah staying home for a sec watch price is right and [ __ ] yeah I loved Mari Mari was the best too he's gonna die soon too I just looked him up while we were talking he's 85 I think uh so the Legends the Legends it's a it's a passing generation saltlier type of type of people who's doing this now is there like a thing now like where does this happen does this happen on Tick Tock or like twitch or YouTube or something I I don't see that's a good question of content even though it's a good one you know another great one like this my sister still listens to this every day when she drives her kids to school cheaters on radio this the show where they really bust cheaters like like that's still a thing it's a big it's a it's a big thing in the uh FM morning radio space which is a very small thing in the world now I think that is actually it was Joey Greco you remember Joey Greco the host is it just one I feel like every city just borrowed this format Joey Greco was like the more famous host and at one point he got stabbed you don't remember that episode where he gets stabbed dude he like gets stabbed and like the thing about the thing about that era of like the 2000s and 90s the reason it was cool was we don't know if it's fake because there is no one right tweeting you know what I mean you like think it's fake but like no one has a platform to like expose like that they went on the show and so that's kind of why it's hard to like recreate some of these things it's like we didn't know like I I wasn't sure wrestling was fake or not until like you know five years ago I I who knew you know what I mean held out huh yeah tooth fairy and uh Vince McMahon maybe maybe there's a way yeah no one no one knew but no that's a good question I'm looking it up now cheaters the TV show Joey Greco did the TV show version and then the later host was Peter guns right the radio version is basically they call the wife calls in it's like I think my husband might be cheating so then they call the husband as a woman I don't know how I don't know actually how they pull this off I gotta ask my sister what the actual format is because I don't know how dude easily because like I mean you'd have to get a cold call from somebody and be like yeah I'm down uh so I'm not sure exactly what they do or maybe they called oh I think what it is is they're like he might be cheating with my friend Rebecca and they fake call as Rebecca to try to like to catch him in the act and then they just do they hit the button and three-way call merging the wife and she just goes off on him on air it's it's incredible content I mean like anybody who's that who's a content creator out there like if you're not studying cheaters you're not even trying if there's a subreddit called public freak out you ever go to public freak out I see that I've seen a public recap on uh that's my favorite subreddit that's my favorite that's my version that's my version of Jerry Springer public freak out and popping where they just pop like zits and [ __ ] I love that big fan of that one and public freak out I was on the front page of uh popping one time I had a picture get 60 000 views so it's just whatever can I endorse you for that on LinkedIn how do I dude I swear I had to get like a cyst removed from my like head and I right before I went under surgery I was like hey Dr Brian can you do me a favor here's my cell phone number can you take some pics uh while we're in surgery and send them to me I want to post them on this subreddit and he did and I got 60 000 views I have a I have a folder right here on my Safari or my Chrome still it's called brain and it's like I took like before before during and after photos I was at number one I'm popping so no big deal I think it's literally no big deal actually that's the cool part about it I guess that's the episode we did a recap and we talked about Jerry Springer all right that's the episode [Music] foreign [Music]

from the Michigan episode uh we built our entrepreneurship Community from Michigan to Stanford since we saw you last it's called entrepreneur Power Hour we're chaining out College founders meet we're changing now Angel Investors meet these College founders we're changing the game entirely we got a non-steer who's our community to lead over at Stanford um things are moving we launched The Syndicate we're hype um but today uh we're moving away from Michigan and we're meeting the Stanford Killers uh and so I'm hyped to Passover or not he's going to get us rolling and introduce this and Bobby love you Bobby I got a question for you is it true what they say about the post my first million bump like uh yeah we'll have kids like you know are you getting kisses on the cheek around campus are you uh do you get free lunch in the cafeteria what was the library I mean my girlfriend was starting to get jealous she's like who who who's this the female Founders are coming out of nowhere yeah okay [Laughter] we need the we need the Conor McGregor clip where he goes it's red panty night when you sign to fight me you call home you call your wife you say Conor McGregor right made us we've done it baby break out the red panties that's what happens when uh when my first building comes to your college campus baby we've done it salmon Sean coming to our campus bring out the red Solo got it I'm the angel ambassadors of the female Founders I don't know who to worry about more all right so let's get started go ahead uh go ahead let's kick it off yeah well cheers thanks so much seems like we're put in this business podcast or Ninja's podcast um nice yeah I mean we got a great group of Stanford Founders over here and Bobby's an absolute killer love that man dearly and I hope that you're gonna love the founders we have got a great Community we're building it out so you're interested in learning more you know feel free to reach out to me I don't want to spend too much time re-entering so I'll introduce our first guy Tom Tommy Peas I like to call him he's a hardware dude he's actually the old head of the group he's actually a master's student doing a lot of cool stuff but I don't want to steal Tommy's thunder so I'll kind of let him take things from here how old is old I'll let Tom answer that because I actually have no idea how old but 20 plus well um thanks and yeah thanks for the intro uh Anon uh super pumped to be here um should we dive right into the pitch or yeah is it five minutes or two yeah I think we have wait wait what's the timing on these so I think we did too many last time somewhere like three or five three Bobby's saying let's do three all right here here's the deal you you got three minutes you got one where we're not gonna interrupt you but after that we could just jump in at any time and interrupt you after that okay so let's let's do it okay keep that in mind cool so uh okay uh so hi Tom here uh transcribe glass and we're building wearable subtitles for the deaf part of here essentially taking your Netflix or YouTube captions and putting them heads up um hearing loss is a massive issue uh I used to be pre-med so uh I guess a few Med stats at you all day and that's what I'm gonna do uh it affects close to half a billion people it's twice as common as in cancer or diabetes and it's growing by 2050 one in 10 people will have a disabling hearing loss it also is comorbid with a lot of things including dementia through three to five times more likely to get dementia if you have hearing loss despite everything I just said Hearing Solutions today are horrible they're really expensive two to eight thousand dollars often out of pocket for hearing aids because Insurance like Medicare doesn't cover them the biggest killer thing for me though is that 75 of people who could actually use hearing aids use absolutely nothing if you talk to anyone who has a hearing loss or try to hearing it what they'll probably tell you is hey I bought it put in my ear hated it put it on the Shelf never use it again now there's a really cool medical reason why you know people hate hearing aids more than glasses but we don't actually have time for that so what we do know about the deaf hard of hearing people like myself is that we love cash and what's not to love they're really you know cost effective uh incredibly uh sorry keep going I like it keep going incredibly accurate uh and um you know intuitive people know what captions are they know how to use them uh in fact I've heard of hearing people love captions so much that we actually Sue Netflix uh and now Netflix has to caption all of their content so if you're watching your foreign film with captions you know thank your local deaf hard of hearing person you know make sure to enunciate so they you're you uh but yeah um Pro tip um we knew that captions were incredibly valuable but we needed a way to get them on your devices and into the real world where you needed that for conversations uh and we looked at all the AR players we you know tried a whole bunch of AR headsets uh to bring those captions into your plw we made this really fancy chart and we realized one thing people don't actually use AR glasses today no one uses them no one's wearing them in this room I don't see them around the campus except me um there's a lot of reasons why AR adoptions have been so shitty um but um the fundamental trade-off in rpna our thesis is this trade-off a fully immersive content versus true wearability at transcribed glass we're focused on just critical information like text and captions as a result we built the lightest AR product with all-day battery life and a form factor you actually want to put on your head now into me and describe this describe the product what it looks like for the listener because a lot of people aren't watching oh yeah for sure so it's a wearable device I actually have a demo video I'd love to play it after it just shows what it looks like through the inside it's really quick but it's a lightweight AR product it's designed in a retrofit manner meaning it attaches to your glasses a lot of your users are older with here you already use glasses so it can fit onto any glasses and work Straight Out of the Box you have numerous features like uh Focus adjustment that are catered to the depth part of hearing and it has an all-day battery life and it's incredibly light people tell us they don't notice when they're wearing it you look through it and you see subtitles uh text floating in your field of view and you can position it anywhere you want is that is to clarify I don't know if I'm too sci-fi here or if this is your product but I'm talking to you and it would be transcribing what I'm saying right there for your eyes right so it's just live transcription of anything you're hearing it basically just looks for The Listener it looks basically like Google Glass but it turns any set of eyeglasses into a Google Glass looking device so so sorry go ahead and you're at the end of your time here so let's wrap the pitch yeah yeah exactly so yeah that's that's the product that's what we're building um users love it uh we have over 700 pre-orders uh completely inbound from Awards we won we won you know for social good Indian presidential gold medal you won the health category of Stanford's largest startup competition uh we also have a tremendous inbound interest uh from cinema halls and B2B they're all required to provide these accommodations uh and we recently signed an NDA was one of the largest media companies as a way to put captions into your field of view uh now is also a great time to do this hearing aids have been deregulated this year which is crazy you you no longer have to go to a doctor to get them or an audiologist you can buy them over the counter so our product can be right there around next hearing aids at Best Buy first time ever that this is possible and finally last thing I want to hit is you know we built a really cool product but the immediate thing is like hey why can't someone else build this you know you have Fitbit and you have 30 other versions of big bit Hardware especially consumer Hardware is inherently commoditizable the thing is what we've done is our revenues do not come from our Hardware sale they come from the recurring subscription revenues that we get on this product um and you know that scales really heavily um so I can talk more about that but just want to wrap it up we're running a pilot trout at Stanford this quarter officially if you want I can connect you to them and you can try out this product uh that's also a picture of my co-care in the corner of meeting the president of India um for this work [Laughter] picture of me with Drake um all right so that's a great way to end a pitch so you um two questions how does it actually do the live transcription is this software you guys are writing are you using some open source tools yeah AI what are you doing yeah so we're right now using um third-party as automated speech recognition Services we're Source agnostic meaning right now we support three Google Microsoft IBM their automated system that you know restream the captions and display them here um we are also uh able to do subtitle files if you walk into a movie theater you can load the subtitle file and display it uh or another thing called uh card interpreting um where you can you know a person types and then you can stream the captions to your device we're moving towards a non-device model that's Wi-Fi agnostic uh and can work anywhere as these models improve get better and decrease in latency things like whisper two questions question or Point number one you're in luck I am a soon-to-be hearing aid wearer and Sean has someone in his life who wears one too I have a hearing loss so I'm I'm actually in the process of getting one now okay um the biggest thing with my hearing aid or why I have a hearing of my hearing loss is not watching TV it's when I'm out in public I can't hear the difference between you talking to me and the background noise of the restaurant it all sounds like one thing to me so I constantly have to lean in so I want to know about that and number two um the whole dementia thing I learned about that and I don't I remember uh reading a little bit about it but but from my understanding dementia the reason why it's you why hearing people who have hearing loss gets dementia is because that part of their brain isn't working and so they like part partially get a little funky I think that's what it is how does this actually solve that if I'm still not using if I'm not hearing I'm just reading yeah okay super good question let me hit the first one first um so yeah uh hearing loss the biggest complaint was people who actually use their hearing aids is high noise settings I hate bars and I hate clubs as a result of the well actually everyone has a hard time hearing but I have a much worse time hearing uh what we're building here is adding directional microphones so you can isolate the speaker of interest uh so we're targeting both through the model right the ASR model voice reduction through software and also Hardware uh orienting directional microphones at the speaker of interest that may be able to improve uh the situation uh a bit but it is a it is an inherent challenge um right the other uh the other dresser other point was dementia um yes the the part of the brain isn't being uh stimulated but the there another thing is just the social withdrawal that you get uh you just as a deaf hard of hearing person if you have hearing loss you hate going out it's really hard and sounds sound weird um so you you lose the quality of of your social interactions and that was draw the lack of stimulation that really triggers dementia and a host of other depression as well is actually very comorbid as well as hearing loss um and wouldn't this thing be more embarrassing to wear than a thing in my ear that no one could see exactly like you like like I don't know man you take those glasses off I might want to hook up with you more than without them that's uh that's an honor but uh um um yeah uh you know on our website we say you can use this on dates so you can use it on dates but uh our it won't work but you can use it you could try it yeah topic of it but um so yeah welcome to the Pod my friend our goal our goal is to integrate it fully into the like glasses you know we this is an early version of the form factors was built on you know exclusively Grant based funding uh that we've gotten uh by other US state department government of India um but we're moving to an integrated form factor in your glasses um we also built it in a retrofo way meaning mounting because most of our deaf people part of hearing users actually you already have glasses we wanted to work with their existing solution I agree oh sorry I'm gonna give you my I'll give you my reaction to this right so I think you did a great job on your pitch especially at the beginning uh the problem section you did a fantastic job you outlined it's a problem it's a bigger problem than you think and it has all these knock-on effects so you nailed the problem part on the solution part you're clearly a smart guy and you are building something that's cool and useful but I don't think it's realistic for two reasons number one like Sam said I think that the thing looks a little dorky and people are gonna have an aversion to wearing it right now right so you're like well this is V1 this is the this is the equivalent of the big giant cell phones that we used to have before we got the cool like Sleek ones and I believe you but you're in an arms race against Google Facebook Apple all these companies that basically everybody wants to build AR glasses yeah it's like the hottest thing outside of AI is AR glasses okay whoever gets AR glasses that's the new phone you can put the screen on your eyes and so they're all gonna put billions of dollars in making the most lightweight um glasses that have a computer in them basically and so you're going to be trying to slim down your form factor using grant funding and all the stuff and Apple and Google and Facebook are going to be doing this with everything that they've got and they're gonna get there first most likely as to having the the lightweight form factor and at that point captions might just be a feature or an app on top of their thing and and so you're going to waste a ton of money I think doing trying to get the hardware to work when you're not going to be the one who makes hardware for the masses to wear on their their uh as like smart glasses the big companies are gonna do it so I think that's the problem now the one thing you said that I'm just gonna call out which is that you said uh hearing aids hearing aids have been deregulated this year so for the first time ever you can sell them without you know going through a doctor that was the big light bulb moment for me of oh there's a business opportunity here it may not be the thing you want to build because you're like sounds like you're trying to do good in the world by like changing the world and you know helping people blah blah blah you know that good stuff but there's somebody out there like oh cool DDC hearing aids gonna do that now like you know that that's now more possible than it was before because I don't need the telemedicine component in between um and so I think that's actually the real business opportunity out of all the things you said and I think you're on the right path but I don't think you're going to be the one to do it I think the big companies are going to make the glasses and then the captions are going to be a feature on top of those 100 uh could I hit that point real quick um yeah so I completely agree with you Facebook is spending 10 to 15 billion a year right now on their AR product you know all of the Apple wants to come out with ar glasses hopefully in 2024. um we want them to validate the AR Market um we're no and the thing is was you know let's say Facebook for example they're building an AR headset they're not going to validate it they're going to own it they're going to own it they're gonna validate it for you to go own they're gonna own it 100 but they need an immersive AR headset to run what is the metaverse they want to build a headset that can support their existing platform Marx I mean Zach herberg's vision is you know the meta burst this immersive reality that cannot run on transcribed glass and as a result that cannot run on this lightweight porn Factor all-day battery-like wearability setup so we can much more quickly build a wearable product because we're focused on captions and critical information for the deaf hard of hearing uh that that is you know the the core focus of our product it's building for wearability uh and form factor right now for a core use case of people who create need it not that broader vision of Multiverse Multiverse content yeah because there's other companies so Snapchat wants to Snapchat's doing it they just want to put a camera on there to snap a photo yeah right that's the only use case they care about right now yeah Google wants to put your notifications and your text messages and your email on it right um you know so everybody's got a different vision and so it's not just Facebook who's trying to do this you're trying to build a whole Multiverse or metaverse whatever the hell yeah it's like you know everybody's trying to make the thing that consumers will buy that turns their glasses into a basically yeah and um into some version of a phone maybe a lightweight version first and so I I don't buy that and uh yeah so for that reason for that reason even though I I think you're you're good intention and you're a smart guy I don't think this is an investable product what do you think Sam I agree but I do want to give you Kudos because uh I think you creating something Hardware related is ballsy and I think it's awesome that you're you're going this route as it is now no I I don't think it's it's the way it is but I have a feeling that if you keep going down this route you're gonna find a better solution soon and I actually think you should continue to pursue it but you're gonna find a you you've come up with some interesting technology I also like the fact that there's like an inflection here which is that uh hearing aids are now uh yeah deregulated are deregulated and I think that those are always good inflections when you can pounce on those things but I don't know if this is the right solution but it is interesting technology that I think is actually going to be used for something else cool um yeah and this is coming from a half deaf guy so like I would not want to use this as it is now but I I think it's a cool problem you're trying to solve and I think it's cool technology I just don't think they're aligned cool right on all right thanks Tom thanks so much yeah thank you guys best of luck our next one is going to start with the big D democratizing all right whenever I see whenever I see the big d uh uh I I'm curious so what do we got yeah from Gandalf the Gray we go to Frodo the young snow home is the Freshman of the group um he's an absolute killer one of my close friends um he's got a pretty sick startup so I'll I'll leave the rest to him so home sell yours bro so come come democratize us what's up sharks my name is soham I'm the founder of admin Yogi we're on a mission to democratize college admissions using the power of big data and artificial intelligence but before I can tell you a little bit more about the business I first kind of want to start with a personal story about myself I went to high school in one of the largest public high schools Across America down in good old Round Rock Texas my class had over a thousand students including myself and although our counselors were incredibly hard-working and supportive they were also massively under resourced so when it came time to apply to college we were always at a disadvantage compared to these far wealthier privileged students who could shell out literally thousands of dollars for these private college Consultants and this is a nationwide problem you see today if you want to get into one of these Elite schools you'll need Insider strategies but for the longest time they've been maintained and gate capped by this Mafia of six thousand dollar six thousand dollar College Consultants now when I was applying to college one of the strategies that I found the most useful was getting to read through some of my older Frank applications reading terms are their essays extracurriculars and awards was really meaningful to me because I got to see how they told their stories so in turn I could learn how I wanted to tell my own now with Ahmed Yogi I want to ensure that everyone from rural Texas to the bustling Big Apple can experience that same feeling of magic with all this platform this database of over 5 000 real applications that were accepted to Elite universities like Harvard Stanford and MIT and these applications are the real deal we're talking essays Awards extracurriculars SAT scores GPA you name it the whole damn Edge a lot sharks were a feasted and we are a startup in 2023 so we'd be remiss without mentioning AI so we use an AI powered algorithm to match high schoolers with students at their dream schools who are successful let's say there is an Indian student in Texas he wants to study computer science at Stanford University he can read through my applications which I spent hundreds of hours working on for literally the price of a cup of cotton and what's really cool is as we start the kind of stockpile this massive data mode we can start to use artificial intelligence to extract really high level amazing insights that demyst it by the admissions process turning it from this confusing lock box into a precise science and then we can always become this digital private consultant giving high schoolers personalized instantaneous and affordable recommendations so I got a question yeah um can you skip to the two parts about the business so I want to know uh how this makes money and I want to know are you uh if you're raising money how much are you raising and what's your valuation absolutely you know those two things so we started this business in September of 2022 with zero dollars of outside bunding we're on track to finish our first year with 130 000 of Revenue currently 85 in the bank oh we're going to wow congratulations thank you so you started this in November uh so you the 2023 your full fiscal year was 180 Grand oh around yeah 180 by the end of 2023. oh okay all right all right I got you yeah so uh from September 2022 to August 2023 we'll have made 130 000 in gravity and what's really exciting is we've actually helped over 11 000 high schoolers with their college applications and we think that that impact is enormously meaningful coming from a team of students who all went to public high schools so what do you charge how do you make money on this yeah so college students upload their applications on our database and high schoolers pay to unlock them so if I'm a high schooler then I'm paying for every person's application that I'm reading and we call it Lowe's profiles which include multiple applications essays Awards activities United gotcha and uh so you charge uh how much to unlock one one application so it ranges between five and ten dollars per application and why are the college kids uploading their thing that's a great question so we pay college students to upload their applications onto our service we've actually built out this direct integration with the common application platform which is the largest national platform for applying to college and it takes literally 30 seconds for a college student to upload everything from their extracurriculars their essays to their activities lists and we have over 5 000 applications on our service and a lot of these are coming from schools across the country wow and how did you get the the customers how did you get the people to hear about this we think that distribution is really important in 2023 so we have a tick tock of over 61 000 followers all organic and 30 million organic social Impressions we think that really marketing the Gen Z is super important today because there's not a single College consultancy out there they can really say that they can access 61 000 minds of 17 18 year olds at any given instant so I'm shocked like we haven't made a joke about like is the upsell if you're playing to Harvard like to tell you not to be an Asian person like has that happened why haven't we made like this joke yet why is this we're off our game so are you raising money right now at the moment we're not raising we uh we've never had any durations we've always been profitable since day one but in the future we are open to exploring I really want to invest more now yeah yes great perfect answer yes that was the perfect answer awesome job awesome progress so far this is very very cool but by the way I was gonna shout this product out next podcast anyways I saw you on Twitter and I saw I saw admit Yogi on Twitter and I was like oh it's a great idea they're getting college students once you don't need your essay anymore they're paying you a little bit for it you already did all the hard work so yeah whatever exactly in the database and now they have this database of college like admissions essays and like the the stats and the resumes and all that good stuff so I thought that was really smart I was going to bring this up anyhow um that's it's funny that you're that you're here I gotta give you props on two things number one you do two things really good in your pitch I want to call out the first is you said at the beginning you go you know before I tell you you know I'm the founder of Advent Yogi here's what we do then you go before I tell you about the business I gotta tell you a personal story as to like you know why I came up with this idea in the first place and that's a great way to do a pitch once you have somebody's attention like if you're in the meeting um and they can't really leave that's a great way to to to start a pitch um because it it shows your you know founder fit with the problem but also people just want to hear a story so uh you you get them from going into kind of this transactional like analysis mode to storytelling mode and so I think that was really really well done and uh and then the fact that you actually have traction is the the second good part of your pitch like this is not a theory this is something that you actually have in motion now Sam give me your take of uh would you invest in this why or why not would I invest uh if I were to learn like if you're taking this as a serious company I mean you're only what are you 19 or 20 years old like you're a freshman you've only been working on it for a year or less than a year you've got great traction I think uh the fact that you're only charging five dollars that's like uh I don't love that I think it's really hard to build a big business on five dollars um so I would I would want to know about what your average revenue per user is but I think that you are a very investable person so I definitely am interested um yeah do you have a question on that a little bit yeah yeah so our average customer spend right now is 130 so people pay to unlock these profiles in bulk anywhere from 1 to 50 profiles at once and people on average want to unlock 26 profiles of someone at the dream school and all three of us are really committed to this so we're actually considering taking a leave of absence to drop out work on this full-time Etc how many students uh are a plot like how big is the customer base for this how many students are applying to college um or let's say you know yeah and like kind of the serious callers where they'd be willing to pay you know for something like this how many students is that per year yeah so in America there's 2.2 million students who are applying to college every single year but if you just narrow that to maybe the most elite colleges then you have around 400 000 to 500 000 students every single year that are coming into this month and so how does this get huge given given that what you just said right so let's say it's 500 000 and let's say even 20 of that market was to use something like this so a hundred thousand dollars or sorry 100 000 customers uh that would be like you know the absolute like you guys are dominating the market at that point right like so what's that five million absolutely that's a great question and that's something we've actually thought about a lot at admin Yogi so sorry just to do the math if a hundred thousand people did it you said about they spent about 100 bucks each that'd be 10 million dollars in Revenue if if that was the case right so correct yeah and we're gonna we're gonna Define big as like 50 million in Revenue we'll say that's like the threshold of like things get really interesting sure yeah so currently the college admissions Market is around 10 billion dollars but that's just spending coming out of the top one percent of Americans we think that by providing more Affordable Services we can reach the other 99 and not only capture that massive initial Market but also create a new one entirely and be the biggest player in that space I think that sounds good that that's sounds good because it's democratizing but in reality what's going to happen is you're actually just gonna try to take that same one percent because the one percent care the most have the most money are the most obsessed and maybe you expand that to like you know the one to nine percent uh of the most competitive you know willing to pay type of customers uh and it's actually never the the other 99 that uh that you get to be your customer because the other 99 just don't have the problem in the same way or don't have the budget in the same way and so you know it's very hard to capture that customer versus the person that's taking test prep that's hiring a college consultant that's you know um you know really really stressing about what colleges they're going to go to they're the ones who are willing to pay for a new solution too that's that's really interesting and that's actually the Israel hypothesis that we had as well that we're going to Target these one percenters who are traditionally paying for college consulting services in this in the first place but actually with this most recent round of early decision or regular decision applications that came out just two weeks ago received floods like hundreds of emails in our inbox from these students who were traditionally underserved like we're talking and Annie from rural Mississippi first generation College applicant never knew about traditional Consultants I mean they were too expensive for her but admin Yogi wasn't so right we initially thought that hypothesis too but as we started serving our customers really collecting the data on this we realized that that actually wasn't the case what happened it's when Harvard's like you're like oh man we're getting all these robots uh you're or uh you know and then the the universal college application I forget what it's called like can they ban you uh like can they pull API access it can that can it work that way uh so we integrate with the common application which is agnostic to University so let's say the Harvard University admissions Department doesn't like us for whatever reason we're not sourcing any kind of data from them we're sourcing it from this national uh National Standard right I think what Sam's saying is if could the Common App shut off your access yes that's what I'm asking okay uh if the common application wanted to they could theoretically turn off API access but again college students can still upload their applications manually so it might take five extra minutes to onboard a new application on our service but fundamentally high school or college students own this data so they're in the they have permission to upload it to whatever platforms they want including Avid yoga and William a date so here's why here's why you kind of make me all hot and bothered number one well typically people are usually really good at getting traffic to their website so marketing or getting like hype and things like that and a lot of times the people who are great at that aren't amazing at creating products and a lot of times the people who are amazing at creating products suck at marketing and like getting eyeballs I'm I'm I've been toying around your website right now it looks cool it looks appealing it looks well done and you're saying that you've got all these customers early on I think that that is like very very very attractive like from a Founder's uh perspective so I think you're really fascinating the there is like I'm not convinced that it could be a huge thing but I am convinced that you could find upsells that could potentially make it big I think if I'm in your position I wouldn't raise money and I think that by the time you're 30 years old you can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars because you own a business that makes uh 30 or 40 million bucks that potentially you could sell for a hundred million dollars or something by the age of 28 or something like that but like just the fact that you've pulled off the the because it's a Marketplace a bit because you've already kind of cracked that code I find that to be incredibly impressive thank you so much yeah I uh I really like this the one thing I would do is I kind of feel like you're using the last business model instead of the next business model so I think what like if somebody came to me today with this trying to solve this problem of how can I help people apply to colleges in a way that helps them be more successful I would say oh fantastic this should feel like chat GPT so basically I should basically be able to go to go to some uh bot that's going to basically say help me with my application with my essay write my essay or edit my essay with my my application the you know the information I put on my application how to structure it better or present it better um and it should learn off of these successful applications so it should take a data set of successful and unsuccessful applications and then it should just do it for me versus a marketplace where I need to go pick and choose okay Jasmine got into Stanford should I pay ten dollars to unlock her essay okay then I unlock it now I need to look at her essay and I need to compare in my mind how to make her essay how make my my essay more like her essay no no no I'll pay you 99 bucks just help me get into college right like give me a you know give me a 2X shot at getting into my dream school because you have a chat GPT that's trained on successful college applications and it will write your essay and structure your your application and even do the application and just let you click submit and go to all these schools that's what I think the like if I think about how how's somebody going to do this in the next three years that's what the solution looks like Sean it's really funny that you mentioned that because actually that's the exact Vision that we had for Advent Yogi we actually tweeted an MVP of this chat gvt like chatbot they can answer any question about college admissions and it's like fine-tuned on this proprietary data set we built this massive data set of college applications and we actually tweeted an MVP about it a couple months ago but we really think that with big data and artificial intelligence especially with generative AI we can provide students with these hybrid personalized specific recommendations for literally like you said 100 bucks yeah because you know the college application process first you got to figure out what school should I even apply to where do I want to go and the chat back and forth about like well where do you want to go it's like well what do you care about do you care about weather do you care about being near home what do you care about oh cool then we recommend these schools and okay can you help me get in and then you're comparing to like how much does the college consultant cost polish intelligence charges six thousand dollars on average cool so you say instead of six thousand dollars pay 99 bucks once and get into your dream school and like that's the pitch that now that that I think is really really compelling so if you were doing that I would invest because I think that is a very very big idea we should we should go to the next one but dude this is wildly impressive I saw uh Sean but what you're saying it reminds me I saw this tweet this lady was like uh it just formed my heart today that people were doing things in the old school way I was on a train and I saw two kids copying each other's homework in their notebooks and it just brought me back to better times before kids were using chat gpd3 to to plagiarize one another uh and so like I don't know if that would I don't yeah I think that that's like weird to hear how kids are gonna be doing that in the future but brother you're impressive congratulations don't raise money by the way just own the whole thing before you go can you remind everyone just how how old are you there are some speculates I'm 19 years old wow you're ahead of the game you are out of the game you should take your leave of absence but you should just stay right next to the campus and just recruit smart kids to come work for you for free basically while you're uh while you're building a company while they go to class every day you should 100 bail by the way you should 100 bail yeah yeah yeah if you need help talking to your mom uh I'll I'll call her and help you out appreciate that Sean thank you cool all right see ya all right who's next so next up we got Zayn and Matthew I like to call them the two Twin Towers they're absolute menaces the bone out candid um you love them so let him take it away there's a bunch of beauties American Gladiator or Shark Tank a little bit of a Blazer and Blazer what a bunch of beauts let's get them up here he wasn't lying uh okay cool and we gotta go a little bit faster because I think we're taking a little too long on each one of these so let's try to hit the points just here's what you got to do say what you're doing say why you're doing it tell us if you have any traction on it and then tell us if you want money or where you're at with the business sounds good sounds good let's do it I'm Zayn and I'm Matthew so we're building candid at candid we apply generative AI to blog-based social videos with the goal of helping users get in touch with their mental health all right but pause there I didn't understand any of that so what it's generative AI to help you get in touch with my mental health through Vlogs what would that what does that mean give me what does that look like so essentially we ask users to record daily highs daily lows and then respond to a thoughtful question which we Source from psychologists and therapists then they can choose which of any of these videos they want to share with friends and from these these videos we do topic detection and sentiment analysis um to present patterns to users to help them get in touch with their mental health so more specifically see you Vlog and we give you insights into what's going on in your life and help you make sense okay so like almost like an AI therapist exactly it's like soft soft therapy yeah I like to call soft therapy okay love it none of that hard therapy Sam's been doing for the last few years yeah all right carry on yeah and before we jump in we'd like to tell you a little bit about the problem and and what we were facing so both of us grew up seriously struggling with mental health I grew up in Thailand in Uzbekistan and didn't have access to traditional therapy and traditional resources and Matthew grew up in San Diego and did practically seek out those resources now I found a couple of things and the thing that worked best for me was generally but the problem with drilling was that it took three or four times to start it's a hell of a hard habit to get to stick so we started auditing around Canada it was with the idea of making drilling more accessible and more engaging to users the problem's a lot bigger than us though last year 40 of students were in college experienced depression and most of them didn't go actively seeking out help our vision for the future of consumer rental health is that they're products that don't seem and come off as Mental Health Products but I was back in component that's strong mental health focused yeah so like I was mentioning at the beginning what does that actually look like a candid users record videos like they would maybe on another type of social media specifically highs lows and reflective questions they can share these videos with friends and then we use a simple AI techniques to present patterns to users so we do three things for them right we transcribe the videos we extract emotions we extract topics and we do three things the first is we identify patterns in people's lives so let's say you're stressed about the college internship surge right um and we we play that back for you and help you observe and help you come to your own conclusions about that the second thing we do is we allow you to Smart search through your memories so you can search for emotions and topics associated with the event you're trying to look at right and then the last thing we do is we build this Aura for you every week which is a generative AI visual um for what you're for what your week looked like emotionally and it's a specific color scheme built and tailored to you yeah so is this an idea do you have custody of users where are you guys at right so right now we're in test flight we have about 50 users we just closed our precede we're in Dev and in development mode right now we'll be launching on the App Store in two to three weeks and we'll be focusing specifically on Stanford to really get that product market and we have a lot of customers say again how are you going to get customers right so we're going to launch at Stanford in the next in the next month and that's going to be a hard launch and we're gonna use all sorts of distribution strategies and how much did you raise that you said you raised the seed round or something like that yeah of a half a million dollars wow from who a variety of these Seas uh in in the Silicon Valley area uh reach Yahoo OVO Z fellows uh StarTex uh yeah okay I am GSR and so you uh you're going to launch that at Stanford cool and you can kind of brute force that because you're there you got friends you're on campus that sort of thing what happens after that how do you get this to like 10 000 users or 100 000 users yeah absolutely so we really do at first want to take a very controlled approach so we're gonna go campus to campus we're starting at Stanford Lake Zane said we're gonna really lock in the method that works the best and then we're going to take a few uh similar universities like Harvard Caltech uh maybe some some universities in in Los Angeles and take that same approach and then grow from there so we're looking at high stress environments and we really don't want like massive rapid growth we don't want half a million users tomorrow because we really want to test especially the ethics behind us um and ensure that this is something that's scalable and like we're not doing any active harm to users all right all right so Sam let's let's pause the pitch here and I want to get your reaction to ideas let's say an idea like this uh how do you think about this either as an entrepreneur or an investor what do you think as an investor I I don't understand how it's the same thing as before like when you just do the math getting to venture size scale companies which I don't know what that is 50 or 100 million in Revenue something like that or a nine figure exit it's very very very very very very hard when you're only making a hundred dollars or something like that a year per customer that's just you just it's a very it's a it's just a math problem uh it's very challenging to do that particularly when it's like a social ish app so as an investor I don't think it's awesome as someone working on it I think you guys are in the best case scenario because you have five hundred thousand dollars and if this dies next next year then it's like no big deal you're young you did something amazing and you're gonna have another swing so from your perspective I think this is the greatest thing ever from an Investor's perspective I'm not it doesn't it doesn't Tickle My Fancy maybe because I don't see the math on how it becomes huge do you agree we have a friend who um has an app she called rooted and it's basically around panic attacks just similar space here and what she found was she didn't raise any money because she's not saying this is going to be a billion dollar company but it was a problem she had and she wanted a solution for it and she knew that other people have this problem around panic attacks and it was too Niche for like a a huge outcome but because she built the company in a way that suited how big that market is she's going to be really really successful with it right she's got seven pieces of Revenue the only employees herself she's the only employee it's profitable and it serves that Nation she acquires most of it she has two million users by the way and it could it could be a 10 million dollar a year business with four or five people right and so and she got she's getting the growth through basically being the top ranked search for if you search for panic attacks like in the App Store so she had a strategy around ASL right like SEO like ASO App Store optimization uh to be to be the top ranked term here and so um what I hear this idea I think these guys you know first good for you for for even doing entrepreneurship at this age that's the first thing uh second good for you for chasing uh like a problem that that matters with you know cool new tech so you're going to learn a bunch about this problem you're going to learn a bunch about this Tech um good for you like Sam said for raising some money so you know you're going to have the ability to take a shot at this if it doesn't work no harm done you just got your first lessons under your belt and you'll you'll do you'll go on to have your second company third company fourth company and one of those will succeed the thing I don't like about this is that it's a lot of work and what you know I think a lot of these Solutions look really good in PowerPoint but when they go when they go into the real world people will simply not do the work to help themselves it's like the guy who's you know the very first pitch he's like people get hearing aids and then they get annoyed with them or the battery dies and they don't plug it back in right and then it sits on the Shelf like adherence is a really big problem they'd rather get dementia than charge their their yeah put the battery out um and and that's and so you know customers go for for typically like the low friction Solutions and so I think what the challenge here is that you have built something that doesn't really tap into human behavior the right way meaning you're saying do the right thing it'll help you and unfortunately people just don't do the right thing and help themselves and so I would love to see you guys slim the product down into something that is simple easier a little more addictive to do and has some variable reward that's like you know worth the work that you put in if you've ever read this book go go read hooked by near IL uh have you guys ever heard of that book yeah I've read it actually it's a great book it's about habit formation it's a great book and I would basically say how can we make this a more habit-forming product because right now I would suspect that the work that you're asking them to do which is basically proactively go on video and share what's on their mind is going to be way too much friction for the average person um like you know so so I think you got to find something that's simpler if you want people to actually use it I think Simplicity is at The Chronic support we're trying to do I definitely think you know we need to distill it even more but really what we're trying to get at here is tapping into people's existing habit cycles of vlogging I think the inflection point here is that our generation is the first generation that's like super comfortable just getting in front of the songs and just like you know spewing their [ __ ] talking their truth right um and that's what we're really trying to do you should make this detect you should make it detect off of what they're posting on social media then so there's no extra work if if they're already vlogging or if they're already posting stories about stuff I wonder if you could read that and give them some insights and then that would hook them to to pour out more maybe after that because then you'd have a zero work solution uh potentially like I don't know the exact solution I just know that I have made this mistake the reason I'm saying this is I've made this mistake I put in a PowerPoint deck what would be an awesome product and I didn't let reality into the room and the real and when I let reality in the room it was yeah users aren't going to do all that work at the beginning so then so they're never going to get the benefits and um and so that's that's a challenge I've had in the past and I suspect this reminds me of mistakes I've made in the past are you guys dropping out what are you gonna do once you have your 500k yeah so we're actually taking the leave of absence right now we're working full-time on product smart this is amazing man like look my my true my my belief is that this is not gonna work as you guys have it set up I think that that's still a massive win for you um and my like big takeaway is like you we we say this a bunch how there's like levels to this game of like building stuff that makes money and products that people like you guys are like just this conversation you're very clearly at the top of the top like you know Luck's still gonna play a role and you can still [ __ ] all this up but just the fact that you are where you are now even though Sean said he's not a fan and I said it the same thing we're fans of you and you're gonna win it's just a matter of is it going to be this one or the next one or the next one but this is really amazing this is a classic thing of like I can't wait to see your second company or your third company um because you know I had my sushi restaurant as my first thing Sam had his thing as his first thing guys you guys are doing like you guys are way way better you're just generative generative hot dogs Sam would generate them I put them in the bun on my hand and I handed them they were very generous you had to be artificially intelligent to eat them the other thing I would say is um you should stop calling it a leave of absence and just start calling it a leave of Excellence people like that [ __ ] too if anybody else ever wants to take a leave of excellence and come work with me for for a year come do that you can email me shawnee.com how old are you guys we're both 21. wow well congratulations on your success and uh thanks for doing this thank you guys good to meet you awesome guys I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out-of-sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better next up what do we got simplify how many more do we have by the way last one last one last one we got Michael Mikey Mike Michael the Meister so many different names for this guy he's a great dude and uh yeah you'll close this out strong see that's what I miss about college I used to have so many nicknames like what they used to call me the blender because uh somebody thought my last they thought my last name was puree so one guy was like yeah his last name Fury right and they're like like the blender setting so they call me blender for like a year it's pretty good I'll I'll start calling you that uh Michael what do you got hey Sam hey Sean I'm Michael I'm one of the co-founders of simplify we're building a career platform for Gen Z what's the URL oh a simplified.jobs because I know you aren't sitting on that.com's got his b right now we're gonna we're gonna get it here soon I promise yeah I bet you will if you would apply to a job today you'd quickly realize how frustrating and broken the process is that's super disorganized jobs are scattered across dozens of different job sites so when you're applying you're you're going on 15 different sites it's super repetitive today career counselors recommend that candidates submit around 100 job applications to just get one offer it's also super noisy so existing platforms like LinkedIn and indeed make it super hard to actually find relevant positions among the millions of different openings out there and you know as a student at Sandra we've experienced this paid firsthand so during my time in college I applied to actually more than 200 jobs across 15 different job sites when I came to school um I grew up in small town in West Virginia parents didn't work in Tech I actually had no idea how to find my first job um and you know after trying all these platforms we realized that the existing Solutions out there really didn't work so actually I actually met my first my co-founders when we were applying a job together so that it's actually kind of nerdy even for standard Stanford standards but um I think that's why we decided to build simplify so when we designed this platform we really wanted to put the Canada experience first um so you can kind of think of us like by the way by the way I gotta stop you I'm looking at your thing you're you have a hundred thousand plus users that have are using your Chrome extension in three million applications and you haven't said any of that yet well it's not it's not section on the slide right here so but yes I gotta give you credit but I gotta say also your bear you buried the lead dude I don't pray that lead bro you're killing it and uh for killing it pull up pull up their site and put it in similar web while he's talking yeah I'm there we've definitely got some super exciting traction so I think you can think of us like the common application for jobs so I think admit Yogi talked about applying to college same process you come to our website fill out this five minute application that you can apply to basically any job on the internet in one click uh we've got a browser extension that helps us do that so in the last roughly year and a half when we launched um we've gotten more than five million applications submitted to our extension which is saved like users over 70 000 hours of time uh We've also got a centralized dashboard instead of like 20 different platforms so no matter what site you're applying on uh we'll keep track of your applications on simplify in a kind of CRM type of thing so you can stay organized throughout the process and finally with all this information we've built this machine learning model that is able to recommend you jobs based on where you're applying and also based on the profile that you filled out with us so instead of scrolling endlessly on sites like LinkedIn we'll actually deliver you jobs in like a tinder-like interface we can swipe yes or no and apply to those jobs in one click do you and you apply to them when you swipe right uh so no you you we redirect you to the career page in our browser extension we'll auto fill the information so it's effectively two clicks okay that's awesome but yeah so we so in the last since launching in October of 2021 we've grown to over 150 000 users and I think the most exciting part of all of this is we actually spent zero dollars in paid marketing um so more than four million applications submitted in 2022 we've hit a million already in the first four months of 2023. uh most front growth has actually been organic I think we've built a pretty exciting product that really puts candidates first so we see a lot of mentions on Reddit Discord GitHub um we've also been able to build a community around supporting people who maybe first-time job Seekers um so we write a newsletter that goes out to 90 000 subscribers giving general advice what on how to find your first job um I've also been able to find quite an audience on LinkedIn by posting just free career resources resume templates list of opportunities I've garnered around 60 000 followers in the last are you a student or are you like 28 years old and just snuck yeah I actually turned 23 a couple weeks ago um so I think I might be the oldest in the room but um second oldest I'm a senior right now um but yeah and uh what's what's the uh how do you make money right so we monetize in a traditional like B2B sense where we charge companies the ability to Source through candidates and post jobs I think what's super exciting about us is through this common application we've actually generated this super in-depth profile on candidates so basically more information that you get on a traditional job application or on a site like LinkedIn so that way as a company if I want to say hey I want specifically people at Stanford that were in their society of you know women Engineers Club that applied uh you know that studied CS for two years and have two years of python experience this is all information that we have in a structured format and we target your job listings too um and you know alongside that you can Source through these candidates on our platform so wait a second so companies pay you to post the job you will show to the audience where do they post that where does that happen because you're saying it's a Chrome extension and right when you're just using Chrome you're browsing the internet or you want to apply to you go to a career page you can click submit so where are they seeing the job where's that that other side yeah that's a fantastic question so it's twofold so actually within our extension when you click submit we'll actually pop up relevant jobs so basically we're able to kind of have a medium to four jobs candidates no matter what site they're on so even if you're on LinkedIn you apply to a job um this that post submission little modal pops up and it'll recommend you similar jobs um and companies have a chance to advertise there well in addition to that our matching algorithm is kind of like the core part of the business as well where through the matches like candidates are specifying exactly what companies that they're looking for startups series a companies you know companies that are founded by women companies that are in specific spaces so that gives us a very targeted audience to show jobs too I think in the last month or so I think we've had over 800 000 jobs showed um just within the matches uh on so check this out if you go to their site you go to simplified.job scroll all the way to the bottom they have this thing that says check out some of our popular job lists and they have things that say top summer internships internships at unicorns best remote internships software roles at top YC companies they have this really cool thing that says Moon shots and you go to moonshots and it says leading web 3 crypto and blockchain startups the moonshot list of 2022 and so you can apply to some of these moonshots uh dude this is fascinating congratulations like so far yeah so we're actually still pre-revenue um right now really focused on building out the consumer side of things I think when we set out to this we just really wanted to focus and make sure that the consumer side was fleshed out before we turned on the Jets on the monetization side I will say the kind of the way the product works now is we've built these scrapers that pick up jobs and like Sam mentioned um of all these different opportunities on the internet we put them into kind of like playlists almost so you can browse them almost like Spotify so if you know you want to work with a unicorn here's an example of jobs at these at these specific companies and basically through that we've actually been able to funnel a lot of candidates into their existing jobs so in the last couple of months more than 50 companies have reached out to us via emails we recently put up a form that is now allowing us to collect inbound from companies um where they say they've actually hired somebody that discovered that uh their company on simplified uh so very soon I think we're flushing out the recruiter side of things allowing you to have a self-serve model where you can post jobs for months and and draw you said 150 000 people use it how many people have gotten a job from it right so that's something that we're in the process of figuring out so through our CRM we can see how many people are like in the interview process because people generally use that to track where they are just to keep organized for themselves but once so how many interviews I think we I don't have the number on the top of my head but that's something I can definitely pull up for you um but what I want to say about just give me an ish I think around like 30 um have reported like movement in their job search process so whether that's an interview whether that's they've gotten rejected oh I think that's something like 50 000 people have gotten a job interview Because of You ish I would say around that yeah because I think we don't really contribute to helping you get an interview we just help you apply faster I think that's the thing um a lot of people ask like am I going to get a job if I do simplify I think the goal is just to make it easy to apply whether or not you get an interview is still up to you um that's kind of why we're investing in the newsletter to help people kind of actually learn the career uh aspect so I kind of want to see ourselves as like Credit Karma for jobs so we can give you like hey you should learn these skills if you're applying to like 20 jobs you still haven't got an interview I think that's kind of what we're looking for explain how uh give me the kind of like two line explanation how does this get huge so how does this become a massive company um what would be your best pitch for that yeah great question I think the vision that we have is just to like be in every single person's browsers then uh be in every single person's browser so we have a 90 retention rate on our extension which is basically generally the case for most browser extensions people install them kind of forget about them and they're only really pop up when they're relevant so I think the goal is to be able to make this Universal everybody that's applying to jobs wants the same time let's live in everybody's browser extension um so we have oversight on where people are applying and through that I think this gives us like a huge wedge in the recruiting space the future of recruiting I think is going to be all data driven as an employer you want to know like hey I want to Target people that are applying to my competitors I want to Target people that you know are interested in software and current platforms have very minimal visibility on where people are actually applying what jobs they're actually interested in I think on LinkedIn I've been recommended many jobs as like an electrician or a plumber so I don't really think that they know what I'm interested in I think through kind of art browser extension we're able to collect the data and make the process applying the job much more like personalized and I think through that companies are going to be signing up to recruit on their platform and to post jobs when they find out that their Dollar on simplified goes a lot farther um in making did you uh have you raised money yeah so we actually just closed a seed runs the first time we're announcing it uh a couple weeks ago it was a two million dollar round LED by Craft oh wow okay well yeah I don't know what the hell you're doing here but that sounds awesome dude it says yourself so listen to that where where is my email yeah how did I not see this this is uh now I'm upset you left me up Michael let me read the uh let me read the team bio so there's Michael here he's a designer LinkedIn creator with 30 million views and 60 000 followers uh rasheel is the CTO he's an engineer and product architect who scaled products to over a million users and then there's Ethan the CPO who you I guess he runs a career newsletter with 90 000 subscribers are those all accurate because that's a very impressive uh Trio are they all students too uh yeah we're well so actually we interestingly we've all dropped out but recently Ethan and I came back to live on campus Because we both are on uh near full scholarships at Stanford so we basically get free housing here um uh take a couple classes get free housing it's a great it's a great gig uh but we've been full-time on this for the last year and a half um and Rachelle lives in by the way in San Francisco I like that you said dropped out versus leave of absence leave of absence is is uh you know one foot in one foot out drop down is committed right it's the uh the old pig versus chicken uh breakfast breakfast analogy the the chicken is involved but the pig is committed you you're the pig you guys are committed I like that and uh uh you raised this two million dollar round can you say the valuation yeah so we raised out of 20 posts oh [ __ ] really yeah good job they're YC they're YC it's definitely tough Market but I think um it's also an inflection point for us where um when the markets are rougher wait wait wait you said tough marketers and you think that's too low no in terms of in general I think raising today is pretty difficult I think we had a little bit of a harder time but I think we definitely benefited in the sense that we've gotten a lot of growth uh really tough to find a job these days so I think uh job Seekers are more willing to give like new startups a chance and I think we've been able to capitalize that when people install simplify they generally don't uninstall and people people seem to love the product so I think we're super excited Michael this is great I love the product I want to invest uh I really like your approach here I do think you know when I asked the question of how can this be big and you're you've had the kind of like the what I'll call like the the vision answer which is like what if everybody what if everybody used this then it would be big there's another way to kind of think about that which is a Bottoms Up way which says you know we think on every customer we're going to generate this much revenue so with a hundred thousand people or 200 000 people or a million people using this extension we think we would be generating 100 million dollars a year right that would be you know so so there's usually a formula that says X users times y value per user equals z you know revenue and so you know you want to have that for you guys I know you're quote unquote you know pre-revenue so maybe you don't know exactly how much your user is going to be worth but it'd be good to have a guess so that's kind of my only my only like constructive feedback everything else was was music to my ear so well done definitely and I love these I love these businesses uh I think the guy's name is Ian Siegel I think that's the guy started zip recruiter if I remember correctly ZipRecruiter was like it had the largest series a at the time like five years ago ever it was like a 60 million series a because they bootstrapped the business to many many tens of millions in revenue and then what's the guy's name Wilson what's his first name is it uh the guy who has uh Wilson or Union ventures in New York I forget his Fred Wilson he has this awesome blog post and he's like uh we were seed investors of indeed and it's the greatest business model of all time because it's basically Google AdWords uh you know like people only it's like a paid performance type of thing and it's one of the greatest business I've had businesses I've ever seen I love these types of businesses because they're perfectly aligned like the the what you pay for you the pay for performance is perfectly aligned all everyone's incentives are pretty aligned it would be even better if it was like paid per job placement but that's a little bit more challenging but so it's pretty nicely aligned I think this is awesome yeah I know super really appreciate that I think we're still working out the business model right now we're trying a subscription-based thing but definitely open to to try new things so yeah would love to hear feedback here's what Fred Wilson said he goes um people you know one of the first grade investment we made at USV was in the summer of 2005 in in it for indeed and they talked about the founders were great the team was great blah blah he says they have a product that's used by 80 million people worldwide every month and they have a business model like Google is the best on the internet revenues profits customer satisfaction shareholder value they've built a fortress and I'm happy to have a seat in the front row um so that's uh that's that's pretty cool uh well listen this is this has been it's been awesome thank you for coming up I think we have to announce the winner so the winner is going to get 3 500 uh of the for the for today's pitch competition I'm gonna message you Sean who uh who what my winner is and then you could yeah go ahead ask Bobby what you want well I was gonna say how did we settle on 3 500. it's a very uh specific number here uh I mean bar shop you might have a I have an opinion on this that's like one souped up Mac you know MacBook Pro or something do you have Bobby like so you have a Syndicate now like it would be very wise if you just gave twenty thousand dollars to every single person and Sean you said something interesting which is like why did I not hear about this startup and there's what we've learned is that angel investors are having a damn hard time finding the top college startups it takes a ton of time to build these communities like we have at Stanford and Michigan and so right now we're trying to prove the model with a Syndicate um and helping support startups like you saw today and like the ones you saw on the Michigan show but the long run is hope to do something just like you mentioned there how old are you Bobby are you in college still yeah I'm 22. I'm a junior at University of Michigan and so what happens in two years when you're when you're out we're gonna we're gonna change the world of college entrepreneurship forever we started by building communities for Founders and now we're bringing in Angel Investors into the mix we think that the way that college entrepreneurship is fostered by Institute centers clubs at schools is bad and we think that the VC funds that are targeting College entrepreneurs are just looking for poached dealflow we have a better way of doing it by building the best communities and then intelligently bringing in dope Angels like you guys to make them make a lot more interesting all right well congratulations you're on to something Sean and I have selected the winner and um I don't Angel invest a ton not nearly as much as Sean and out but so the winner on this one I would love if you guys would accept me I would put a very small like five or ten thousand dollars if you'd allow it but um I don't know about you Sean I don't know if you're you're in that same boat but we both we both are aligned on who we think won this one yeah I think you know what is the best pitch uh who wins the pitch competition it's the person who can have a clear pitch that's compelling that gets you excited and um and they're committed I think that's the hardest thing with investing in college entrepreneurs is you don't know if next semester they're back re-enrolled in school it's like Okay cool so now you're super part-time on this like oh this is now an extracurricular activity damn uh that's not what I want like uh like those fishing guys you know remember the the guys who had the not the fishing the the Boating company we loved it and they were like yeah but you know we're in college it's like well I don't want to give you money then by the way I invested in those guys and they are going for it uh so they they are they're pretty committed to it but I think it is hard uh to know because you know it's just one extra risk factor that you don't have with somebody who's out of school is like that they'll just get sucked back in by Society to like the safe path and so and by the way a lot of times they should like go out there and get laid and do whatever you want but if you're gonna get after it I want you to get after it like if I'm giving someone money it's like I don't care this isn't supposed to be cute like I want you to give me more money back [Laughter] we have SIMPLE investment philosophies yeah like when you say like well you know but I learned a lot it's like yeah I don't care I don't care what you learn I care about me and my money so the learning is great but it is second to earning earning is always better than learning it's the fallback right uh anyways the business that we've both selected is simply uh I think you could probably tell from our excitement during the pitch you know it solves a real problem simplify bro oh sorry simplify that jobs um yes yes there he is Michael from simplify uh you are the winner of the pitch competition you had the best pitch you have the most traction you seem the most committed that this is like happening and there's no there's no way out um so congratulations you got you you have done it yeah thank you guys so much huge fan of the podcast and yeah simplify I think it's a we really got to get that URL for sure you're never gonna get it you're never gonna get it what are you gonna do with this 3 500 Michael it's a great question I think model service hey if you guys want we can make that happen but um I think what's most important for us is investing in our social channels I think you know a huge fan of the podcast um one of the hardest things for us is getting in the hands of more college students um our users have been super helpful and kind of organically spreading it we don't even have referral rewards so they're doing it out of the kindness of their hearts I think we want to invest this and you know whether it's our social media whether it's in on the grounds kind of uh referral programs I think these are all things that would help us really take us to the next level in terms of user growth you can either get a little bit of LinkedIn promotion or an eight-sleep mattress the the answer is it's very obvious to me frankly uh yeah this is 291 days of Chipotle so that's a lot of fuel that we're giving you first that is free for you to go forward I get the mattress think of us every day at lunch because like this lunch was brought to you by my first million every single day as you build this company for 291 days and at the end of that you're on your own Sean let's do a wrap up here about like what about these whole things I always I mean we've only done it two or three times I leave these things energized I also leave these things intimidated um so all every single person we've had on this even if we've like given them a hard time is incredibly impressive would you say would you say so yeah I mean I just remember where I was at that time and it's you know we're not even in the same room like I was I don't know where I was but so so just putting yourself in this position to be doing things like this can make a pretty big impact I I did this is actually how I became an entrepreneur I did a pitch competition my senior year second semester senior year I had never even thought about business before that I did a pitch competition I ended up winning 25 Grand and uh it changed the direction of my life like I would I literally wouldn't have been an entrepreneur had that not happen and so and the idea was bad my pitch was bad if I go back and look what was it what was the 25-4 the Chipotle for sushi idea and those those investors were horrible how did they well there's we had two things going for us one you know we had the the most swag of anyone at the pitch competition so we we gave the best you know pitch I brought the Duke basketball players in as a cameo during the pitch they threw out t-shirts to the crowd so we won extra money from the fans and stuff like that but also one of the judges he was worth like I don't know 20 50 million dollars something like that and he did it because he owned 50 Applebee's so he was like oh restaurant industry great industry to be in whereas 99 of the population would have said that's a terrible idea but this guy had made his living off of Applebee's uh and so you know we had we had one judge in the bag from that oh man that's a that was the that competition was really bad if they if you weren't because these are so much better this guy just raised money at a 20 million dollar valuation from like you know a top 20 venture capital I mean it's like pretty it's so much better than when you and I were doing this type of stuff yeah totally by the way the funny thing is we run the competition and then we also they also paid for one MBA student to work for us as an intern so they paid his salary and we were like we were younger than this guy this guy had worked like 70 years of like real world experience before then and so he was taking direction of these 21 year old idiots and we were like do you know how to roll a sushi roll we were just like yeah can you build us an Excel model and he just and then he would build it and we'd be like yeah you know this doesn't look very good can you just make it better and we just had this guy work on an Excel model for like five months he must have been like this is the worst experience of my life well congratulations guys you're you're amazing Bobby good job organizing these guys and uh I forget your the other guys name who's the BMC over there but uh good job uh uh yeah you what was your name I know Anon good job uh you know that energy that you have it's it's really actually great for setting these guys up you know because trading stuff is really hard and like dude I don't know if you guys have ever like done High School sports but like when you're lifting weights and like trying to bench press a ton of weight and you have your team around you who's like get it get it like on that on that like when you guys are trying to Max your bench or squad or whatever that [ __ ] actually helps and you're kind of doing the same thing so kudos to you it does actually help psychon these guys up so congratulations to everyone thank you guys so much and Sean I'll just close like you mentioned that gun on a uh the second semester or senior year like pretty much changed your future you guys are changing these kids Futures like after the nursing episode the amount of people that reached out to us and like up close this thing hit these people up hit me up be housed with you mitch.edu hit these kids up we're gonna put them up put the descriptor like their websites their emails in the description but like you guys are changing these kids lives too so we're damn we're damn great not necessarily for the better but we're changing them for sure our lives are changing we don't know which way it's going though I think that's the part foreign [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I am probably the most optimistic person in terms of like how good this of a business podcasting can be and I started talking crazy and then I have some friends uh that have built giant businesses on the back of podcasts I was at dinner with them last week and they literally pulled me to the side and they're like shut the [ __ ] stop telling people all this [ __ ] [Music] all right everyone today's podcast is special the guy's name is David senra he's got a podcast called Founders I've listened to dozens and dozens and dozens of episodes he basically breaks down different biographies that he read about business people artists whatever anyone who's you know the one percent of the one percent of their field and on the Pod today we talked about the difference between people who are like somewhat successful and the people who are absolute killers and what traits they have and what the commonalities so it's super fascinating to hear from someone who's read literally three or four hundred biographies and studies this for a living He talks about the commonalities of these killers whether that's UFC fighters or billionaires it's really fascinating I think you're gonna dig it my favorite part is when we talk about um he has this really cool quote from Joe Rogan describing uh Jon Jones who's this like amazing UFC fighter and the difference between like John and the rest of the people and then somehow David weaves that in with business people and he lists out all the business people who he says are the the one percent the one percent The Killers of the killers and he talks about what traits they have and what you can learn I think he'll dig it check it out talk soon yeah you know it's uh I um I understand why you'd live in Miami if your family's there that I that's I don't love like New York but I'm eventually going to move there for family so I the family pers you know supersedes all the other stuff that that's the only reason we stay here my wife is Colombian so 70 of Miami-Dade County is Hispanic all her family's here like I've been traveling a lot more for work and like the day I leave my kids wake up her mom is here her grandmother's here so like for my kids perspective like Colombians are they with South Americans general what they do is like they're very I like their multi-generational like housing my wife grew up in a house connected to her grandparents house yeah I dig that too oh that's incredible like I had nothing like that when I was a kid uh and so I was like man I really want to live in California but I'm just gonna stay here for family and then you know spend my summers in California what'd you do before Founders pod uh I've done a [ __ ] ton of businesses like since I was like 18 years old like I think me and you are around the same age I might be a few years older than you um the business I was working on right before actually started Founders while I was doing it was a thing called Robo DB which is a way to track uh the original the true origination points of robocalls through the payment Network um and it was just like a business that was like kind of like a clever hack but I wasn't interested in it the way I was podcasting so like I was obsessed with podcasting for for years I remember my friend Eric he invited me over to his house one time it's like 2010 he's like dude you gotta come over and watch this new podcast do you remember the guy from uh from Fear Factor I'm like yeah I watched Fear Factor when I was in like high school uh and we went to his house and it's like when Joe Rogan was on like the white couch and he was on like Ustream and then he'd have like there'd be like things falling down he'd have like you know the cheesy kind of uh like there'd be stars or Sparkles and stuff like that I'm like what is this he's like oh you can also listen to it on your phone anytime you want and that just blew my [ __ ] mind I could not believe that yeah were you successful or were you kind of like a struggling entrepreneur and then this is like is this your first like Breakout this is the first thing that's gonna make like I'll make a lot more money I was like making like dentist or doctor money for like a long time you know like not struggling but not nearly like you know what a podcast could could do like a successful podcast could do how big is the Pod now in terms of listenership it [ __ ] crazy right now uh we a few weeks ago I just cracked uh over a hundred thousand individual listeners uh uh per episode no no overall like so when I signed into like my podcastos it says like unique listeners last seven days that's the only I don't I'm not big on metrics like I don't pay attention at all I just try to make what I want and then put it out into the world um but the one number I want to see grow is that number because Founders is also weird good like you could Discover it now and because the back catalog's ever going Evergreen like I'll talk to people they'll Listen to Like the First the latest few episodes and then they'll go back and listen to [ __ ] that I did like six years ago five years ago and it it's just you right like because you're part of uh What uh colossal is that it the Colossus Colossus sorry uh and so they like sell your ads and they take a cut and so is it just you and a producer or what nothing just me so um patch I love we were talking a little bit about this yesterday like um the one thing I love about podcasting industry is how uh positive sum everybody is so I listen to podcast uh Patrick's podcast for years like uh I was taking no sense podcast I went back and looked since like 2019. and last year in May uh my podcast is a subscription podcast right you could listen the first 30 minutes if you want to listen to all of it for the first six years of in its existence you had to pay to upgrade right I had no worse yeah wait oh I don't know you so you've been doing this for six years yeah starting 2016. oh wow that's crazy I to me like you just got on my radar like a year ago maybe everybody was like that so Patrick played a big role in that uh the David and Ben from acquired they played a big role that was just on your uh your podcast um but what happened was um Patrick just randomly tweeted it out you know he's got you know this massive very valuable audience like in size in terms of size and then average net worth like he's got one of the most I would argue he's got the most valuable business podcast audience of the world right if you found if you keep if you uh like the fact the the average net worth of his audience's stream and uh he just randomly tweeted out like last May hey um I never find new podcasts to listen to I think David Center's Founders podcast is excellent you should listen and I was like what the [ __ ] I know you dude like I watch listen to your podcast like this is crazy and so I had become friends with this guy named Sam Hankey Sam hinky's the former general manager of this uh Philadelphia 76ers now he's an investor in Silicon Valley and I knew he knew Patrick and so I screenshotted that I was like oh [ __ ] look what your friend Patrick said and then Sam immediately put me in a group chat with Patrick he's like you two should know each other and so Patrick the first time we talked we talked for like an hour and a half we had like the same interest for addiction podcast addicted history addicted entrepreneurship all sorts of stuff and so we were just friends for a long time and then uh I had several people Rob Moore being one of them we should probably talk about uh yeah uh Rob's been hooking me up constantly like I'll talk to him and we'll email back and forth he's always helping me okay so this is the positive sum nature of podcasting I'm sorry for those who don't know Rob Moore Rob Moore and Andrew huberman are part our partners on the Pod Rob is the co-founder of the human lab package so okay there is this is the interesting thing one of my favorite quotes I've read every single thing I could find on Steve Jobs right and one of my favorite quotes that really describe uh Steve's one of his superpowers was that Steve was gifted at finding Marcus full of second-rate products and what you what you guys realized I think as well is like people people have essentially like when you're inside podcasting the perception inside of it is completely different than what it's outside of it it's like everybody's like there's too many of them uh it's too late to get in and like you need to start a long time ago and what happens is like everybody starts podcast quits right and when you get in there podcasts in general are full of secondary products Rob Moore and Andrew huberman uh and I put David and Ben up here which as well it's like their first their first class products and a first class approach to building their business so Rob I've never talked to Rob less than two hours every single time we talk he he dude look what happened my desk like what's that oh uh tweet yeah it's Rob and Andrew have been so relentless with supporting me for nope like they have no benefit right they just they keep like every time Andrew tweets about me the fact that he was one of his favorite podcasts is Founders he sends me of the church just from his tweets that's crazy right Rob's like hey um we have this new studio next time you're in California uh next time you're in California come out and like I'd love to give you a tour and our mutual friend Andrew Wilkinson had invited me to Victoria so I was like oh I'm actually flying to Victoria like next week that's a pain in the ass to get to for Miami I'll just stop in California for a few days and see you Malibu I met up with Rob we talked podcasting for seven straight hours that's crazy literally we meet up to have lunch we stay at the same spot they're like uh it's dinner now we're like let's have dinner and then we stayed there the whole time and then he's like let's go to the studio they are like to me I think uh not only is huberman's the size of his audience crazy but if you break down on how they think about the quality of the product how they think what's quality of the business model like there's ideas I got from Rob that I told Andrew or I told um Ben and David that they're now using that's going to wind up making them millions of dollars like the way they set up their business their ads everything they're just [ __ ] first class to do this are you uh I see that you're always tweeting out it looks like a screenshot from Kindle uh how many books a month are you reading to to pull this off okay so I think this is um me and you were talking about the advantage I think you have at Hampton which is really [ __ ] special um and it's an echo of what Bloomberg used to build his very unique business like your business is going to produce a lot of proprietary information it's extremely valuable to other Founders and then you can repurpose them do you know any [ __ ] people have had dinner with that tell me about the Hampton blog and you guys just just launched oh really I think we just we just we just like I I threw it together like I think two weeks ago I heard about some guy doing concrete or some [ __ ] or yeah yeah or something he was like searching they told me he was like searching through like uh like War Dogs uh yeah yeah like looking for the look into a database of government contracts and seeing what he can fulfill yeah so what I realized is when I text you that or uh yesterday was I'm doing similar things so um I realized what and it this is the the magic of you said something that was really smart where you're like rich people read a lot and it's very true our mutual friend Andrew Wilkins had just tweeted out he's like I wish I could short entrepreneurs that don't read and that's what I found as well it's like not only if the people I study is like they had they were so good at what they did that somebody wrote a book about them like that's [ __ ] crazy right and then you read their books and they're constantly reading biographies studying great work that came before them and so the Bloomberg idea was like his business is fundamentally he's like I want to sell you like a 27 000 year subscription or whatever it is uh my business his business collects a bunch of unique information and he made like a bunch of atomic pieces of content sort of media company as a way to get his brand and so 90 of the people I read his media will never buy subscription but his media is spread around everywhere just like there's a ton of people are going to read your Hampton blog you know obviously I think you should do a podcast if you do [ __ ] short form whatever it's like that's going to be spread out like that and then you know one percent five percent of those are going to convert to members and like the more members you have the more data you have the more data you have the more members you have and just keeps going so to answer your question I just hit episode 300 I've read over 300 biographies of entrepreneurs so far uh I have that's over a hundred thousand pages what I realized is like over time I'd input all my highlights into this app called read wise and so everything you see externally are just uh they're essentially uh highlights that I like the one I I posted yesterday we were talking about Bloomberg and I was like oh [ __ ] let me go and uh read back through my highlights on Bloomberg and I found one where he said that like you know if you you should try to love what you do because you love what you do you do a lot and then you know that compounds everything and I put that out and like immediately these hit and then people discover the podcast and they start listening and so me and you and Bloomberg are kind of running the same idea but in you know different uh different Industries or different like dude I use up until like I so two years ago up until two years ago I was reading a ton and then I uh so I like to listen to books I like to listen I'll listen I have one that I'm listening to and one that I read at night and I like to listen while I'm on walks and there's this one narrator who I love have you ever listened to Titan or uh Vanderbilt's book uh Tycoon he uh the narrator is awesome and so I was like I love this narrator he's so good so I went and found books just by that narrator and I started scrolling through and I'm like Oh my God this guy's done 1500 books or something like that that is narrated and it's like how to win friends and influence and like all these like businessy self-helpy books and then I go and looked at his LinkedIn and I'm like huh he's reading all these books why is any more successful and I'm like I'm like huh I done worse so I got angry so now I I now I I read mostly for fun and if I don't like something I I I brush it off I put it away uh and so I quit reading non-fiction books now I strictly read biographies or history so your friend Ryan holiday has a great post where he shared like his top 25 um biography recommendations and his the the intro to that post is excellent because he's like listen you go to the most successful people in the world look at their bookshelves they read a lot of [ __ ] they all read biographies at all of them without exception he's like some of the most high value um reading you can do you notice that as you read through the biographies like they're all doing this now here's the thing um this uh this actually clicked for me the other day uh you know Eric jergensen right yeah yeah yeah he helped Naval write the thing yep so he gave me this fantastic book recommendation I had missed despite this game Peter bevelin and he kind of it's a book on Buffett and Monger it's called uh it's just all I want to know is where I'll die so I don't go there and there was something that buff and Monger were saying in that book that really clicked for me they kept saying it's like listen we're going to share everything we know with you guys we know that most of you are just gonna listen or read it and never do anything and I thought about that for a long time I was like oh so learning is not memorizing information like the guy you were just describing learning is changing your behavior if you don't change your behavior that you didn't actually learn and so therefore I'm not applying the lessons I'm learning in this book from my own business then that means I'm just wasting my whole [ __ ] life because I'm I'm working on the seven days a week like I'm giving a lot of my life better sheet to this and I think that's the important part is it's like not just these people didn't just [ __ ] read they took this idea like okay how can I apply it to my business and then they actually change their [ __ ] Behavior which is like the key no and I've done that a ton I mean I'll what I my the reason I read biographies is I look for patterns and I say uh what mistake did this person make and how do I avoid it and where do they win and how do I like lean in on that and then like the way that I kind of this sounds really lame but we make a joke that I'm I call myself a manifest Cowboy because I love the redneck but the reason being is I'm pretty good at like setting five year and 10-year goals and staying focused and working backwards to achieve it and like I can like there's this one book by how to get rich by Felix Dennis love them and like I I like listen I was like all right and he and he was uh he had cancer I believe or uh I don't know if he had a cancer when he wrote it but he died soon after and he was like if I could do it all over again I would try to be financially secure by age 35 and then just puts around and I was like okay let's do that and so I like just worked backwards so like how do you just like have like the bills handled and then everything else is just you know icing on the cake and so I'm pretty good at that but I uh when's the last time you read it I read it all the time I refer I use it like a textbook so like when I think about like um equity and how much to pay people I go and read the sections that he talks about so I have it if you just Google how to get rich free pdf there's like a website that has it so I've bought many copies and I have a bunch of his biographies but I'll just like refer to that all the constantly I'm like all right what did he say about this and he gives like pretty practical advice like on company credit cards like how do you is your company credit cards and like uh office space and so I refer back to it constantly Andrew Wilkinson gave me advice he's like uh what he did he's like I read the book before I got rich and then you read it after you get really rich I thought that was really great advice we uh so you and I are both UFC fans yeah and I was asking you I was like what should we talk about and I was like I want to talk about the difference between the people who are pretty good and absolute Killers yeah and you are like oh that's just like a new FC that's kind of the same way but I because I'm fascinated with like I listened to your uh I think his name is Sam bronfman the guy who started sea girls which eventually turned into like all these other things and then I was [ __ ] Savage he's a Savage you know like he almost reminded me of myself not in the Savage sense but he did a few funny things he uh he was like a Hermit and he like didn't go anywhere unless his wife went with him and I'm the same way I'm like I don't go out unless my wife Cuts up me because I have like some social anxiety a little bit and like but when it came to business he was like pretty uh Brash and um uh like told people exactly what he thought uh except like when it came to social situations he was like super not confrontational if I go to the grocery store and I don't see what I'm looking for I leave I don't ask you know what I mean I'm like I'm like dude I just don't even want to ask for help because it bothers me um but anyway I listened to him and then I listened to Napoleon that one was really good oh dude look at this book sorry uh Sam Altman said the best book he's read in the last few years is this one it's really hard to find it's first published in 1955. is that the concise history one I can't see no no no I'm about I'm gonna do this in like two um two probably two episodes called the mind and Napoleon it's it's Napoleon's old [ __ ] words and that's cool yeah so because you say everybody's obsessed with Sam Holton right now because the chat GPD I didn't mean to interrupt you but Napoleon's well Napoleon has this amazing saying I forget if I heard it from you or or Ben Wilson but it was something like um uh you he he was talking to someone who goes you and I are not the same I am born of a people of conquerors or something like that like he had this like uh like this he felt like he was just like I'm here to conquer get out of my way and he had that at a young age and I thought that was really insightful um there is something that you picked up on where people it's fascinating how like uh you'll listen to Founders you read a bunch of biographies and you realize like the most successful people in the world you're like oh I don't I don't want their life and that's the way I feel like for sure out of like exactly first of all you said something that's really smart too it's like people dis like manifestation or visualization and they think it's like like Willie nonsense okay that's fine I can just tell you pops up in the books over and over and over again I told you yesterday I'm reading this [ __ ] insane biography of Tiger Woods this dude is like eight years old listening to motivational tapes writing it out and on his wall it's like I am powerful I will achieve my goals like over and over and over again and you see this from edwinland Steve Jobs Estee Lauder uh Bob noyce founder of Intel Arnold Schwarzenegger have you read the education I want to send you I was going to ask you for your address to send you this book but it's like he might have already read it did you ever read the education of a bodybuilder I've heard about it I've never read it it the first 113 pages is it functions as a as a autobiography of Arnold when he's 30. and like the visual utilization thing seeing things and like he said he's like he would lay in bed at night and just picture himself on the stage holding the trophy of the Mr Universe or whatever in his hand everybody's like essentially like bowing down to him he's a conqueror to use like that example what I find is that a lot of the people that um like Felix Dennis man uh I think his the advice he gave was wise like that guy had a hole in his heart that could never fail he spent a hundred million dollars in a decade 10 million a year on cocaine alcohol and prostitutes yeah you know like that's a [ __ ] crazy story in that book and he what I love about autobiographies entrepreneurs usually they write them towards end their life they don't hide [ __ ] they're like I was [ __ ] up I was a bad father I cheated on my wife I whatever you know um so the the tie this into like the UFC thing and and the like the Conquering is that quote um I think it's uh I am of the race that founds Empires is what it is so I want to read this quote that you and I are uh discussing where I think Joe Rogan is obviously like the world the world leading expert on you know MMA like the stuff I wish I could talk to that guy just I hope I get down I hope I get the chance just to ask him I wouldn't I just want to talk about MMA and all this [ __ ] that's in his brain and I was very curious what was going to happen with this Jon Jones surreal gain fight right so for those who don't know Jon Jones is this very controversial character at age like 22 23 he was like the first UFC fighter sponsored by Nike he was the Golden Boy he was the champion when he was 20 or something and he's just a killer never lost but he you know has hit his girlfriend before he's gotten arrested for drinking and driving he's a mess he's a killer on and off uh the field did you ever see the video of him where remember like during the the pandemic people were like lighting [ __ ] on fire there's all these riots and they did it in uh Albuquerque where he's at and he stopped him yeah you saw that could you imagine if those two guys there's two small guys like young kids like spray painting and vandalizing [ __ ] and John is just walking around like give me the can give me the can give me the can like dude if you know who that is you'll give him the cans Jon Jones is like six two probably well now he weighs 260 pounds I mean he's like one of the scarier people you could ever see and he's athletic the guy's a freak he's a freak but he comes off this is why this is interesting he he he tries to come off like a nice guy a lot of times in interviews and he and when you listen to him talk you think all right at least I think this is learned behavior and you are actually a more sociopathy than you are not and you will kill someone easily and sleep like a baby at night 100 so this is the fascinating thing about setting history so this is what Joe Brogan said about John Jones which I think is gonna it reminds me like a young Bill Gates which we can talk about he says Joe Joe's like listen there's human beings that have a ruthless competitive drive that is terrifying to the ordinary person Jon Jones is a bad guy who is trying to be a good guy if he were living a thousand years ago he'd be on a horse with a battle ax chopping the heads off of everyone and everyone would be running these dominators have always existed he's a [ __ ] conqueror that is the thing that's inside of him that lead needs them to be the goat greatest of all time without that you don't get there there's a thing inside of some people there's a driving force that allows them to overcome the greatest people around them when I heard that I wasn't thinking about Jon Jones I was thinking like that's Michael Jordan that's Jeff Bezos that's a young Bill Gates that's Edward land that's aren't uh John Rockefeller that's Carnegie that's all of them they had they have this ruthless competitive drive to me they're a different species than an average person um and so the example of that is like I did this uh this excellent biography of the young girl Gates right in my opinion the perfect biography it's like I don't need to know what their great grandfather did for a living right it's like tell me the struggle the reason we're alert like give me a little background to what family they were born into then tell me the struggle and then once they're rich and the book and so there's a book called hard drive Bill Gates in the making of Microsoft Empire that covers the first 35 years of though beats life right so it ends right after the Microsoft IPO and I'm obsessed the reason I have a solo podcast uh is because my podcast Idol is Dan Carlin Hardcore History right and is he by himself 100 he's got a giant audience um we should actually talk about podcasting if you're interested in that he he a lot of people share numbers he had said uh don't let me forget the thread on Bill Gates By the way um he had said the latest episode this is like two years ago uh that got published he got 19 million downloads on and then he said oh wait then he said oh wait uh it turns out some of them were double counted so in any case cut it in half it's nine he's got an audience of probably 10 million people that listen to him that would be one of the biggest episodes of the year for most every podcast yes you know the big dogs get a million or 1.5 per episode but rarely you know Joe Rogan if he interviewed like burnt when he interviewed Bernie Sanders or someone like that that maybe got five or or eight or something like that so Joe Joe's audience and Joe has more data than anybody else and all the Spotify exclusives has more data anywhere else he said uh remember when they tried to cancel him this is also the magical podcasting man uh which I know we don't like we we have to be careful here because we talk about it forever um the problem is is like you have people that don't if you listen to Joe or you listen like I listen to you and [ __ ] Sean forever I know even before we met I like I know who you guys are no manifest Cowboy I know the [ __ ] terminology we have an idea of who you are like the person before you meet them right that's the magic of podcasting it's like we're not creating content we're creating relationships at scale which is very [ __ ] powerful and still on people most people don't they they understand how powerful this is um and so what happens like you have you know people saying Joe Rogan's racist you know they they cut the clip and then you know he's anti-backs everything else and so they try to cancel them and then somebody's been listening to him for [ __ ] 10 years and listens to him 10 hours a week he's like you're not gonna tell me anything about Joe that I don't know and so what happens is he said his audience added too many people I think he went from 12 million subscribers to 14 million subscribers on Spotify those are the numbers I've heard yeah um and it speaks to like this he's still the biggest by far because even like the top you know human to everybody else like years 1.5 without YouTube and everything else so there's still just crazy how big and successful Joe show is um but what about Bill the like the bill uh so Bill Gates is I was doing an episode on him and I had just been listening to Dan Carlin's uh Wrath of the cons series on gang of Khan for like the 15th time and it I realized it's like oh like you you see Bill Gates is like this is Genghis Khan in a Mr Rogers costume he's in a disguise and he is unbelievably Relentless so there's this guy named Michael Moritz who was uh now he's a billionaire uh he's one of the guys that helped scale Sequoia but at the time he's just a journalist this is a perfect example he's giving uh he just drove us I think he's writing for Time Magazine and he's meeting bill you know Bill's probably made let's see 28 something like that they do an interview Bill's like hey I'll give you right to the airport they get in Bill's Car and Michael's like oh [ __ ] somebody broke into your car what happened here he's like what are you talking about he goes your radio it's like somebody stole your radio he's like no I I ripped it out he said why would you do that he's like from my house to Microsoft Office is seven minutes that's 14 minutes a day from Microsoft's office to the airport I go there three times a week that's 15 minutes around trip you know 30 30 min or 15 minutes she's ready 30 minutes round trip and he has this episode so that's like two hours in the car and if I have a radio then I'd listen to it and then I'm spending two hours not thinking about Microsoft and there's all these [ __ ] crazy stories because somebody asked the other day like what's the largest bootstrap business of all time and Paul Graham answered Microsoft and people are like oh they took VC no no they were creating money and they sold a million shares of Microsoft for a million dollars to a VC they did not need the money right before they went public to get expertise that was a bootstrap business the year before this is in 1980 money the year before Microsoft IPOs they did 140 million in revenue and 38 million profit that's insane right he's the same and then so this extreme Jon Jones the zero game thing when you hear about how he thinks about his [ __ ] competitors it's not just enough that he needs to win he's like I have to [ __ ] destroy you so there's this spooky [ __ ] um the spooky story that's in one of Bill Gates biographies I've read two of them and uh bill would be able to tell you like in the software industry he's like I know the CEO of every single software company I know what the revenue was I know what their where their product is right now I know everything about them and so they all they have a bunch of like frenemies he's like I want to destroy you but he would talk to you and a lot of them were getting customers at these in the early days of like these uh these software uh conventions which is very like very new and so this guy Philippe Khan that he was trying to [ __ ] destroy he literally wants to put you out of business because he told his employees like if I if we lose a 50 000 contract that's not fifty thousand that's a hundred thousand because we lost 50 and our [ __ ] enemy got 100 got 50. so you just cost 300 000 she was like that's psychotic about it and so Philippe goes over sees Bill sitting by himself in like a foldable chair just looking at something Philippe walks up to him and he goes say hi to Bill and he realizes what Bill's looking at he's looking at a picture of Philippe Khan he's in public in a [ __ ] corner of a Convention Center staring at a [ __ ] picture of his enemy like the what Joe said about John a thousand years ago we lived a zero sum if you want to build wealth what'd you do like you took their land or took their results somebody else yes yeah so a thousand years ago that personality type Bill Gates would have been leaky would have been in Napoleon he would have been leading an army it just so happens that this same personality type that is that exists today has existed forever will exist forever in the future can run companies and build wealth and when you when you study the personalities of these people it's like they're all like that thank God we are living a free market economy or else there'd be they'd be pillaging and raping and doing everything else well that's why my favorite era of American history is like um 1890 so that's uh uh 30 or 20 years after the Civil War so America is kind of getting back to it up until like 1920 because in 1920 um like the Sherman Act which was the anti-monopoly ACT uh started coming about and then the SEC was invented and so between like 1890 and 1920 America was really the wild west where we had some technology you know we had cars we had I think phones were coming about Telegraph so we could railroads railroads and the stock market what existed so we could like make wealth but there's a few things that you could do so for example Andrew Carnegie and um uh who's his partner Frick like Henry Clay Frick yeah like when people would uh when the union workers would boycott and protest they killed them like they they hired a private police team and they went on a private Army and they literally beat like 10 of them to death and I don't think anything happened I don't know if anything happened no because they also owned the politicians yeah and it was wild and then like there was a time where JP Morgan loaned the U.S government money and and then there was a time a lot of people don't know this but JFK John John F Kennedy the uh president his father Joe Kennedy was like the seventh richest man in America at one point he got rich from insider trading then after he was already rich he created or he was the first head of the SEC that made insider trading illegal like it was like hardcore crony capitalism that's one of the reasons why I like reading about John Rockefeller is because of all the things he did he was dishonest once or twice but for the most part he was a ruthless competitor and he didn't lie and he was honest other than uh one big time he lied but besides that he was pretty straight and how crazy was it that his employees net he did like he never we never heard him raise his voice and he never said an unkind word to us now his competitors different story he's completely ruthless with them but inside of his you're not going to find anybody that worked inside of Standard Oil and then obviously they hid all the things they owned there's actually an idea I stole from uh by the way his competitors he wasn't really I mean he was ruthless but he would go to them he goes hey I would like to buy you this is a very fair price come and join me and I'll make you rich of which many did and they got rich and he said if you don't join me I'm gonna destroy you so let me know if you and so to me that's like he's like look we can work together or I'm gonna end you you can pick but he wasn't like necessarily like rude about it yeah so the one thing he said was so badass he was trying to buy somebody out they resisted he's like I have ways to make money that you know nothing about he was yeah I always say like there's a there's a very common theme that common themes are Reaper in the history entrepreneurship and so I have maxims for a bunch of these like my favorite one is Excellence this is capacity to take pain it's just like you're not gonna achieve large success without being able to tolerate paint for extended periods of time right another one is bad boys moving silence like they find an advantage and they shut up about it this is what um Steve Jobs realized when he was built trying to build Pixar he's just like we can't get any [ __ ] data on how profitable because you have to transitioning for selling Hardware to just pure anime like trying to build the first computer animated movie and Steve Jobs like I don't get why like we can't get any information on this and then he realized he's like oh the reason that you can't go to the library and check out a book that says like the business model of Animation is because there's only one company ever did well and it's Disney and they don't want anybody else to know how lucrative it is and so he realized that because they had they had made like Snow White like 60 years before and right when he's doing his negotiations with Pixar and Disney they re-released it and we're selling like VHS tapes and I think that they might have had DVDs at this point and they're like wait a minute you sold 28 million copies of a movie you made 60 years ago that's all profit and they made two he said they made a quarter billion profit on that one movie releasing it for like the new technology and so I actually took an idea from Johnny Rockefeller Rob Moore plays a role in this is like uh what what um Rockefeller would do is like he had the secret allies right and so he entered into an industry that he thought was very disorganized and so he wound up building relationships and allies with all the people in the oil remember the oil business when he jumps in it's not what we think is oil he was like he was over fire he was selling kerosene for [ __ ] like lighting and stuff he made up he actually made more money in retirement because after he retired he still owned a [ __ ] ton of um Equity goes back to Felix Dennis uh and then the ambition of the core and so now like oh this this my my Stock's even worth more uh but what he would do is he'd go around and he'd organize all the other people in the industry so like I did this with a bunch of podcasters like me and you just started doing this like texting about this it's just like you just share information like you build secret allies and you just say hey this guy figured out this for your podcast you should use it and like everybody in the podcast industry is extremely positive some I listen to your um your interview with Brandon Shaw he said the same thing about he's like Joe told us we have an obligation to help each other out and so for business podcast it's like they're all kind of like satellites and like Loosely defined and so me and Patrick have been going around building relationships to people and just sharing information like I was at the acquire guy's house in San Francisco a few weeks ago they're like we give Patrick they have one of the most profitable Ben and David who are fantastic I'm actually wearing their merch right now um they have one of the most profitable podcasts and compared to audience size so how much they make and they're like well Patrick told us that we weren't charging enough so we tripled our prices then we and then we still sold ads and then we tripled them again and then it's like holy [ __ ] he was right and so that idea is like we're no gatekeeping just share information and try to help people as much as possible um that's an idea from Rockefeller when you read about some of these killers do you think they are different than me or do you start becoming that like do you think that uh just surrounding yourself with them is going to change your behavior or is it just like aliens exist and I am not them no here's the thing we I don't know if we're recording I like how you guys just Jump Right In by the way um so I don't I think most of our discussion was caught on recording but um I am very glad that I have a wife and two kids um up and down like here's here's my thing it's like the thing that I don't like and it's very present all these books is like if you're an adult it's your job to figure it out and like not let people take advantage of you right so if like John D Rockefeller gives you a bad price and for your business you accept it that's on you what I'm and you hear this on the podcast like I'm induced since the state of rages when people [ __ ] with kids I can't stand them and so up and down my family tree like I was the first person to graduate high school in my family much less College I'm the first uh male and my three generations not to go to jail right and so like up and down both sides of my family tree I just see a lot of like terrible parenting and this is not necessarily my parents they did the best they can consider both sets of their parents were shitty people but like I saw drug abuse I saw sexual abuse I saw people going to jail cocaine all this crazy [ __ ] right and so I was like if I'm gonna have kids I'm not going to be a [ __ ] father and I think the fact that I have a kid and a wife is that like we get along really well it saves me from not I think if I didn't have that I would literally work from the time I eyes open in the morning till the time they close and I would just [ __ ] like I think the scary part is like I and I try to prepare myself to you know you can't compare myself to Rockefeller so but like I have a little bit of that in me too and I think I hear from a ton of people listen they're like I think like that too the whole thing is like learning from their experience like hey but they get to their life they're not necessarily happy you know like so I don't want that um I don't want to destroy everything around me because I I chased professional success but I think men in general you know type A aggressive men like that's what successful people super successful people are crazy like they're not normal humans and it's probably one to five percent of the population that are borderline sociopathic you know nothing motor people that's that's a little bit extreme but like they're willing to do whatever they can if you get in their way and so I I'm I've been lucky that as we've it's it's funny that as we've I've gotten more popular for like content and business [ __ ] A lot of people in different fields who I previously looked up to like for example a Lance Armstrong or someone like that uh they'll like message me and I'll get an opportunity to hang out with them and this isn't about Lance but this is I've been lucky that it's been a bunch of different people and I'll go and hang out with them a couple of times and then I think I don't want to be around you ever again like and so like I don't enjoy being around them and so I've had a bunch of people who if you told me when I was 12 that these people want to talk to me I'd be like that is sick now I just I'm just like I don't like being around you it's actually not enjoyable being around some of these people um because it feels like well I don't know exactly how it feels like like it feels like we I'm we're in a pissing match when we're when we're with each other um yeah I simply don't enjoy it and so now I've I have a rule in my household which is No New Friends um so I default whenever I talk to someone I default to I'm not going to be friends until it's like all right maybe after a while we can we can we can cross the threshold but by default it's I don't trust you and I'm not going to let you in um whereas before it was like oh anyone who wants to holler at me yeah I'm in and then I go and hang out with some of these Ballers and these killers and I think oh this is this is a very unenjoyable hang you know there's a bunch of people who maybe Ben might know who we're talking about um but there's like a couple people that are like some of the most famous and successful people in the world and we've been lucky to hang out with them and then we'll go hang out with them after the Pod and I'm like oh this is just miserable I don't want to be around you at all and so my point being is for the the to what what you said about the most successful people being crazy not only are they crazy I don't want to be around them it's not fun they're not fun to be around and so you really see that there's a price to pay which is you are in the one percentile or 99 percentile of this of these other traits which usually not always means you're going to be lacking in a handful of other traits and sometimes that's like whatever the traits are of you wanting to be near someone I guess like physically and hanging out with someone that that's my thing everybody's like okay uh like are you doing all this are you gonna do you want to run like the next apple like what are you doing this for and I'm like no like out of the 300 people that I've studied the the person that I want to be the most like is the the closest person that I've studied and read about that has come to mastering life is a guy named ed Thorpe right and so it's a [ __ ] this is a [ __ ] crazy story so it's episode 222 and the crazy thing is like usually the episode title is just the book I read right this says my personal blueprint right and because what he did is like first of all he's a Ed Thorpe is one he was the guy that made the first quantitative hedge fund right uh the reason I liked him is because what I think you were talking about earlier like you have varied interests right where you need a balance because I've also heard you speak enough where I'm like okay he's clearly type A and driven and like if you didn't have your wife or you didn't have these other things I could also see you going I'm not sociopathic but like you know no limit to the kind of Empire you want to build you have a chip on your shoulders just like all of them I do too so I see that um Ed Thorpe essentially like what he did is like he made a ton of money as a quantitative investor right but once he had more money like he didn't need to worry about money anymore he refused to trade time to make more money because he understood he's like more money's not gonna make me happy but my time his limit he was a good father he was a good husband he was he followed his own intellectual interests like he had fun he uh Tim Ferriss just interviewed him and I would highly recommend going to YouTube and just type in Tim Paris at Thorpe and look at that guy's picture and tell me how old you think he is I've done this a bunch I did with my wife I go how old do you think he is she said I don't know 65. he's [ __ ] 90. because he learned when he was really young that physical fitness was really important and so he gave me the best heuristic uh Health he goes I view every hour in the gym as one less day I'll spend in the hospital at the end of my life and the guy's still doing like pull ups he looks [ __ ] fantastic right he's like no I think he might be like 92. um and so this whole balance of like your friend Ryan holiday actually I learned this from his content was like what it means to be a completed human we've known that forever we just get distracted it's like you want work that has meaning you want good relationships you want to have fun and you want to make sure that your body is healthy and you feel good that's it there isn't anything else I love what you just said because the same thing when you have a successful podcast you get hit up on all kinds of [ __ ] crazy experiences which is actually you know a huge benefit but it's like man I'm not going to build a thousand relationships that are like an inch deep I just talked to the same people over and over and over and over again it's like you have a limited amount of people you can actually be friends with and yet we're all connected so like we're hugely distracted so I was like okay I'm not smart as a Thor he's way smarter than me so I'll just [ __ ] copy his blueprint I'll write that down I'll be a good father I'll be a good husband I'll take care of my health I'll have work that I'm really [ __ ] obsessed with but I put guardrails on right and like I'm not going to keep trading money or time which I'm going to run out of for more money when I'm not even spending the money I have our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobbled together spot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better I want to um I want to ask you some more questions about history but a story really quick I I have a friend who's 40 low 40s worth a billion dollars has a publicly traded company and he was telling me the story about how he had this phrase called It's never enough and he was telling me a story about how he went to one guy's home who was worth 50 million and the guy was complaining about how he lives in this fancy neighborhood and he can't his home is his six million dollar home is less good than is worse than the other people in the neighborhood then he's like I went to another guy who's worth like half a billion and he was saying like yeah but you know what I don't have a super yacht and then there was another guy who had like one or two billion and this guy was complaining he's like can't get a sports team though it's not enough and so yeah I don't want to be around people I think you hit it don't be like I don't want to be around people like that It's never enough and that's what I've also learned because like I've thought that when I've hit certain points I'm like well I won't want anymore it's you always want more it's a very challenging thing it doesn't have to be that way though I had the advantage because like this is the crazy thing about podcasts you just said like you never know who's listening so I got uh invited to have uh to our lunch with samzo right and that's [ __ ] crazy um it came inbound Sam had listened to the podcast I made on his autobiography and he's like I want to meet that guy Sam's a real estate guy he's got a great book called uh am I being loud enough or am I being subtle all right am I being set off yeah am I being subtle enough he's uh he's probably close to 90 now he's kind of anyone he's kind of got this blue collar-ish Vibe about him but he's worth probably five or ten billion dollars something like that he owned uh uh all these real estate things he created the Reit I think then he like owned Schwinn bicycles he owned the LA Times I think or the Tribune something like that he's so he's like a tycoon he's so you're and you'd [ __ ] love them so he's 81 years old he sold his his real estate company for 38 billion to Black roach or Blackstone I don't [ __ ] know you know they're all being the same and so you know who the [ __ ] how often do you get to meet somebody that sells or company for 40 billion dollars and I couldn't believe this was gonna happen I thought it was like oh like this doesn't really happen now it's like oh maybe it's gonna be like a lunch I'm invited to and it's like 20 people there it's like no he sat eye to eye for two [ __ ] hours and he's not like that you would the reason I I got back after that lunch and I told my wife I go I want that I want that I want to be 81 years old completely still unbelievably curious about the world around him still doing deals doesn't give a [ __ ] he's not one of these like media trade guys right he only wears blue jeans I think he invented he he takes he takes credits like I invented business casual I'm like Sam what the [ __ ] I don't know if it's invented his schedule this [ __ ] hilarious that you would say that you invented business casual will not wear a suit still rides a motorcycle ah still I think smoked weed let's it's [ __ ] crazy but the thing the advice that he gave me he's like David he's like the Richer you get what you realize is one he goes you'd be shocked at how many Rich guys I know that aren't having fun which is describing exactly what you're saying you go to their house and they're talking about other people or what other people have I'd run the other [ __ ] way Sam didn't talk about that he goes listen he goes money he's like there's very few true luxuries in like the Richer he got he's like then I just kept just buying nicer of the same [ __ ] so I'd buy a house then if I get richer and then buy another house like this was [ __ ] stupid so he's like I basically own nothing he has a place in Chicago and he has a compound in Malibu that's his words by the way because he's like I have a compound of Malibu um he's like just he's like the advice he gave me over and everything he said five or six times every two hours he's like optimized for Freedom if you get Freedom you get to choose what you do and then you have fun and if you have fun you'll be really good at it and the money will come but do not give up your freedom for money which so many Rich dudes do it's [ __ ] crazy and then he goes the one thing he's like none of that [ __ ] matters I could buy everything I want he goes I rent a bunch of [ __ ] which reminded me of you because I know you [ __ ] hate owning a house and so it's like renting yeah he's like don't own a bunch of [ __ ] just rent it when you eat it like because if you own it you gotta take care of it this is advice from [ __ ] the guy that you know obviously on assets he was by he's still buying a ton of businesses the day before I saw him he he's like he's dude he's 81 he just his eyes lit up he's like I just 300 million dollars buying 75 of this company makes 50 million a year or some [ __ ] like he just loves the deal he's like I'm gonna be doing deals so I die just because he likes the game he's like he treats it like a game but he's like there's only one true luxury in life he goes try to get the private jet money really what what are what was it like meeting Charlie Munger so that was [ __ ] crazy too um and again because like Andrew and his partner Chris um it was fascinating because uh I heard your podcast where you guys had met Chris and spent time with them um and I got to have the the the the few hours before we had dinner with Charlie Munger I had like a super long lunch one-on-one with Chris and that dude is fascinating I wonder if he'd ever come on your podcast if you want to hang out with him tonight I want to be with him tonight okay yeah like you should I know he's more private he's another guy where I think he knows like one of the things I loved about Chris now he's wicked smart but one of the things I thought was so cool is like he showed me his calendar when we had lunch he's like look at my calendar it's like every day at three o'clock I'm picking my I think it's his son his son up from school like he's not going to be you know he's like obviously rich and successful will continue to be more rich and more successful as he carries on um but he's not doing it at the detriment of being a shitty dad which like I admire a lot [ __ ] hate shitty dads so what was Munger like he was he was present so Monger was uh he has this line where he's like oh I didn't succeed in life because of intelligence I succeeded because of a long attention span definitely has a long attention span but that dude is way smarter than me like if anybody's even even at 98 or what how old is he 95 so he's 99 anybody is going to have uh some level of cognitive decline at 99. and so all I could think about is like if that is who he is a 99 imagine trying to compete with that dude 30 years ago what was his house like I I have to be careful because I got into a little bit of like they want me to keep some of this up private so like I can't answer that question was it fancy was it uh was it as you'd expect which is very very very nice no he lit he's very authentic he if you read monger and talk about Monger he's like hey don't have a lot of silly needs in your life uh his whole thing is like I truly believe that he just wanted to show what he could do with his brain so he could make a ton of money with his mind because he's really smart he like wears like you know he loves flannel in your in your picture I think like a channel from Amazon so the Costco like his one of shared entrees Jim Senegal well I love a lot too and one of his favorite companies Jim Senegal or it's Costco because of that Costco could have made more money but past the the benefit of their group buying onto the customer and so Charlie's who he says he is he's like he's not doesn't have a fancy watch doesn't have fancy clothes he just buys books as far as I can tell and talks to interesting people and makes a ton of money but he's not in it for the money he just wanted he's in he says he's like I didn't want the Ferraris I wanted the independence who all that you've so besides Ed Thorpe who all have you Who Have you listened to or uh spoken about that you think is like in your top five people of like they will conquer the world if given the chance like they're they are the the the top they are the one percent of the one percent I mean I think the selection here is that every single person is in the top you know point zero zeros or what percent because you're only the only to get on Founders you have to live a life from work well somebody wrote a book about it what I would say is like I just got done reading James Dyson's autobiography for the fourth time and it is my number one book recommendation by far for entrepreneurs and he's written two autobiographies the second one's fine there's nothing wrong with that I'm done with the first one because the first one he writes after 14 years of struggle like what I admire so much about this guy is like he's not necessarily like a conqueror in a sense like he's gonna go around I don't think he'd be like a Napoleon in other times but what I loved is like my favorite entrepreneurs or very adamant about what they want to do in life and how they want to run their business it's not formulaic they're not going around asking people advice like what do you think I should do what does my product look like what is how should I run the business like no I have a very set uh mindset of like how I want to build the product how I want to build my business how I want to to uh to like spend my time you know I call that they Bend reality to their to their will you know they kick their debt in the universe that's what I always call that I'm like they know what they want and they bent reality to fit what they wanted read that dude who read his autobiography in a weekend it'll [ __ ] blow your mind because it's like why is this guy not quitting well what is what is happening here he's barring he's got two mortgages on every single house he's got he's crying at the end of the night and everything he's gonna be successful and he just won't quit and what happens is like you fast forward now James Dyson is 75 years old he owns 100 of Dyson company he's like you know one that company's probably worth 20 billion dollars it makes supposedly you know a couple billion a year for profit for his family that like they take out of the company what I love is um he the company he owned before Dyson vacuums it was this thing called a ball Barrow which looks like a wheelbarrow with a ball at the front and he goes and rents uh does a photo shoot for the ball Barrow at this like massive estate that has been in England for like 300 years 25 years later he buys it he's like this is my [ __ ] now like dude I I've talked to a lot of people who love that book one thing that one thing so I remember like when I've just got started in my career I was like firmly in the in the field of like I'm gonna pull myself up for my bootstraps and I'm gonna I'm gonna make this into existence and then I remember when we were selling our company and everything got done and that was the first time in my life where I thought luck is so important and even though I I think I'm a badass and that I would and I think that I could will myself to a very I think I can will myself to a really nice amount of success but in order to have the Uber success which we'll describe as like liquid hundreds of millions of dollars there's lots of people who are these types of killers who do have these attribute attributes but one or two things both in their control and out of their control went wrong or right and that can absolutely change things like it could be like like you know John Rockefeller didn't know that a car was going to be invented uh or like with with Zuckerberg like he would have kicked ass no matter what but it just so happened that like the phone came out and that like has helped a ton or uh you know someone like what you know I'm sure we've seen a lot of Fortunes get created during a pandemic like luck is real like when we sold our company and that was my first big win the CEO Brian got into a nearly fatal accident afterwards and I'm like dude if that happened like four weeks prior I don't know if this would have gone through and I still think I will be very successful but imagine if I was selling my company for a billion or two billion dollars and the CEO of the buyer got killed or quit do you think that with these guys luck is real of course you you said something great on the acquired podcast you're like I've met a lot of these guys it's like they're 20 times richer but they're not 20 times smarter yeah and a lot of Rockefeller is a great example right like so uh the best way to describe is like moderate level success like you know you could probably get to tens of millions of dollars in net worth that's like playing poker right it's like that's a skill set you can get but like two like Jeff Bezos like the funniest thing I had dinner last night with two Founders was like you guys know that Jeff Bezos was private jet has a private jet like he takes off and there's another one like that level of [ __ ] like there's so many things I gotta break the idea is like he knew he was gonna why does he have a second private jet I'd love to ask him I don't know like so you know how this is like people track private jets now some YouTuber made a video and they noticed that every time Jeff's playing maybe it's like the people who doesn't want on his plane I don't [ __ ] know but like there's a jet that follows his other jet around and like it's somebody put all this together from public information so uh that level of success like he knew okay the internet's growing we the everything store was a code name in the hedge fund he for Amazon they they were going to incubate it in the hedge fund he was working for David Shaw a billionaire uh hedge fund guy in New York and so he knew he was like we could sell books and then he also knew he could sell all those things but likely but he didn't know like he could invent AWS like there was no like all that stuff that happens Rockefeller is a great example Bezos when he pitched the First Investors he goes I think this can make 100 million dollars a year if we're lucky yeah he uh he he it took him 50 meetings for adventure capitalist to get his first million dollars and he said the most common question he was asked is what is the internet yeah he's a [ __ ] Savvy he is the closest to me Bezos reminds me so much of Rockefeller like if you read bezos's shareholder letters are excellent uh because he's telling you what he's just like the the Arnold book that I recommended earlier Arnold says this is my blueprint this is when I'm gonna do he calls a shot and then he goes and does it Facebook says the same thing but the Rockefeller 20 times richer but not 20 times smarter thing I think it's obviously you're talking about Randomness you're talking about luck uh Rockefeller was going to be successful no matter what like the business he was in as you know it's like he was they were wholesaling like produce and other stuff right they were just Traders and one thing that he did I think is really smart is like he's worked he's like 19 years old working for two Founders he's just an employee he goes back and reads all of their books goes back and studies their entire company history memorizes all the finances everything and then knew more about the business and the founder stud like that kind of personality is going to win wherever he's going to go now he could have stayed in that business and made millions of dollars is he going to build the arguably the most successful company of all time if it wasn't for the random discovery of oil no like he didn't control the fact that he was in the what I would say in the podcast is like you find these people that are the right right person right set of skills at the right place the right time if you're missing any of those you're not gonna build you know a trillion dollar company or uh you know 200 million or 200 billion dollar net worth you need things to break through for you that are outside of your what do you think you're going to do next like where you know where what's your blueprint for 10 years okay so this is where I start talking Reckless because um I am probably the most optimistic person in terms of like how good this of a business podcasting can be and I started talking crazy and then I have some friends uh uh that have built giant businesses on the back of podcasts I was at dinner with them last week and they literally pulled me to the side they like shut the [ __ ] up stop telling people all this [ __ ] so what's an example of a great business on the back of it I'll tell you I'll tell you I off I can't like there's a there's okay there's one that I don't have any intimate knowledge on uh I can give you an example of that um because there's someone that have intimate knowledge I'm not sure what I know it's like to speak public and I don't but like butcher box bootstrap 500 million dollars in Revenue largely expanded from podcasting and there's a ton of those uh industry buying podcast ads yes got it yes um and then look at I mean this is something I actually learned on your podcast which I think you guys did an excellent job with was uh when you guys were talking about how Unilever came about on it right yeah yeah I didn't I didn't know that happened I knew about on it I knew about Joe I I knew he owned like 30 rumor to be on 30 of the company but think about like Joe has a ton of um ad slots just that one ad slot that he randomly put in he probably had just on that asphalt around 75 million dollars like depending on what the actual purchase price was um Joe so this idea is like I started talking [ __ ] where like people like everybody knows because of Mr Beast thing going oh yeah there's gonna be I could see why there's gonna be like some billionaire YouTubers right like that I think that is obvious now given where Mr Beast highly likely that dude unless he dies he's gonna hit that my point is it's like that's the the the the deep relationship people have a podcasters is not comparable to the relationship they have YouTubers it's not at all comparable and this is not at all new what like what anything that what do you mean doing people are deeply are more uh they like podcasters more like there's more Affinity it's so do you know Blake Robbins from uh he's at benchmark no he has this okay so um he'd be actually interested something interesting talking he's the one that gave me the Spectrum idea he's uh helped incubate uh what's the what's the uh professional Call of Duty team 100 thieves or 40 thieves oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I know I know you mean they went from zero to like 80 million in Revenue I think like 18 months or some [ __ ] like this so nature was uh developed an audience on you know Twitch streaming and so so Blake has this spectrum and this comes to you like uh there's people out there that have heard you and uh Sean talk way more than they've heard their best friend's voice yeah because when they when they put the headphones in it's just us and them and it's usually for 50 or an hour minutes uh you know 60 Minutes at a time whereas a YouTube video it's uh maybe eight I've heard you talk for a hundred hours like so like we've taxed exchanged message online but never talk in person I was like oh I [ __ ] know Sam like I know what he's into we have the same interests like I think we'll be able to talk about a bunch of [ __ ] right so his whole point is like on the spectrum is like how much do people how much time do people spend with you he's like on the far end all the way to the left it's like Tick Tock dancers right tick tock dancers you know they might have millions and millions of followers but they spend 30 seconds and if they try to like sell tickets they can't even fill a room with like 3 000 people even if there's doubt you know millions of dollars on the far end of the spectrum all the way to the right is Twitch streamers people spend literally 40 hours a week with their favorite trip streamer right or 30 hours a week or 20 hours he goes David podcast and you you're just one uh one one step towards the left he goes there's gonna be people who have listened to you speak for hundreds of hours right and that parasocial relationship is unbelievably deep and comprehensive to like you saw this I saw them people who had said that you're doing a public Meetup I think in Austin right and or a show and there's people flying in from [ __ ] Dubai yeah it's crazy right okay so think about that like they're not flying into Dubai to watch like a tick tock dancer they're not flying in and your podcast is technically a business you have all this other stuff you can do it's like how many brands do people identify with so much that they'll fly across the world I just did this I'm introverted as [ __ ] right yeah you seem like it yeah so yeah yeah but on one-on-one but with groups I hate it so uh Shane Parish from knowledge project Runner Street was in Miami he's like dude let's do a public Meetup I'm like oh [ __ ] and I agree just because he's did it how many people came uh like 70 like I think around like 70 people came it's awkward right it's not awkward uh I I don't think I'd do it again but like this is the thing like the only thing I did to promote it Shane was supposed to send it out to his newsletter never did thanks Jane but um I just made it like this one minute I I was like like five days before the event or something I uploaded to my podcast video I was like hey you happen to be in Miami area we're gonna do this here's we're gonna be and like I'm like all right there's no like my audience is in like you know California New York so it's like Miami's not like the spot for it people flew down from New York Washington DC drove for hours and I'm like what are you in town for like this I'm like why what what are you talking about and so it's this deep level relationship so so here's your question like my 10-year plan is just like I'm going to be making podcasts until I [ __ ] die I love doing it it's the best job in the world I think Sean tweeted out something that he's like podcasting is the best job in the world it's like you get to be curious to learn all the time and then you package up what you learn and you send it out to the world and all this good benefit comes back to you you know relationships investment opportunities businesses you can launch whatever cases um and so I'm just going to run the same Playbook that like Rockefeller does like right now you scale with ads people pay a very high dollar amount because your audience is valuable yeah and thank you for uh for promoting Hampton uh on your part of that that was more than my first car bro but I appreciate that hey I I look hopefully you get more hopefully you get uh more than enough value no that's that's that's a perfect example I didn't you wouldn't you didn't have to ask me to do that because I got so much value from you the weird thing that you probably experienced too that this is people dude the conversation you have with podcasters you can't if you're not on this side you don't understand a listener does not understand the [ __ ] that like why every single person you talk to that's podcaster has a successful podcast is like I'm never [ __ ] not gonna quit like I'm never not gonna do this this thing is it's like magic um and so when when I was like dude I think Hampton first of all is a great idea because um entrepreneurs have to be around other entrepreneurs like we do not think like anybody else you go to you're gonna have you said you're gonna have a family once you start having kids you go to these birthday parties and then you're back into you're outside of your bubble and now you're in like random distribution of people and every time I'm like where's the where's the entrepreneur in the room and it was on the street I gotta leave like you have to be around them program has that great line where he's like ambitious people are star to be around other ambitious people if you put them together they bloom like dying plants with water which is exactly what you're doing with Hampton the funny thing is like oh thanks for doing this like no no thank you for making your [ __ ] podcast I sit every day I get messages like thank you for doing I was like dude if you didn't listen like I get to read books for a living I need to be thinking you so that's the power podcast so the answer questions like I'm gonna vertically integrate um what's that mean by next year at this time um like you're not gonna No One's Gonna Be able to buy an adult Founders right um so and this is the the crazy thing about having a podcast so like you have all you hit on it you're like uh super successful people read all the time um they also listen to business podcasts all the time and you're able to build relationships with them we're like uh I just met like we said well when I talked to Chris and Andrew I was like you guys can advertise for as long as you want but eventually like what you I think ideally is like find a business you guys buy businesses for a living you hire managers for a living like will partner up on distribution as opposed to like just doing an ad uh you have people like Patrick Ashanti from invest like the best like literally saying hey uh whether we have to buy a company we scale it or we incubate a company like basically he's like we need to found we need to find Founders version of tigas right and what does that mean this is something that I think is public now so I don't think I'll get in trouble for saying this I've heard about this you want I can say it so you can you don't get in trouble if you want so this is just rumors so here let me tell you the rumors that I heard so there's this company and you could let me know so this way you won't get in trouble for revealing anything tigas is a company where I think what they do is if you wanted to talk to an expert you pay them money and they connect you with an expert but they record all the conversations and transcribe them and so instead of paying money to talk to an expert you could just read the transcriptions they had with any other the other experts whatever I heard that they advertised on Patrick o'shaughnessy's Podcast and he saw how good it was going and he goes screw this I want some type of equity and I'll invest a little bit but I want to add a sweetheart deal and it was a sweetheart deal and he continued sending them tons of customers to the point where his Equity hold holding in the company has been were is worth tens of millions of dollars is that roughly accurate so I I don't know the prices I know he he says this publicly he put 20 million into his company he's got a giant fund too um my point is like I don't know the valuations I I'm sure if I asked Patrick he would tell me but you know it's none of my business um my point is that like okay Michael elnick who's the co-founder of tegus the CEO and a [ __ ] Savage like he is he is like the guys we study right I was we we talked I was talking to one more time and um he was just telling me like oh like what do you do like decompress like you're in a [ __ ] like he's building an incredibly valuable company he's got a like and he's completely dedicated to it and him and his brother both ran track at Brown so like they blow off stress by like running like Phil Knight did in Nike and then you ask him he's like oh so like how much do you work he's like oh no I take time off like I think Saturday mornings off that's it oh Saturday so he's on it I love his intensity but he said he's just like one act one podcast they only advertised they had their first two customers from like you know Word of Mouth at their network but you know the first probably 50 to 60 million dollars of Revenue whatever it is like Patrick's podcast because of who's in his audience helped them scale and as a result like then there's just a release there's a million things you could do so in Patrick's face he's running fun like you can do Equity um I'm not an investor so you said the other day when you were talking to um Kimberly you were interviewing like you don't like investing in people's companies like you want to like build your own ship yeah investing doesn't entirely give me a dopamine rush like I I'm I'm in the game for adventure and that and I'm searching like uh like a little bit of a rush and yeah I find it to be very it's so boring you give someone money and you don't hear from them for six years I'm the same way I'm like I'm not interested I get so much deal flow like hey do you want an angel best I'm like no like why I would just like do my own [ __ ] and people say I'm stupid I'm doing that and they have to understand it's like I'm not also running my life to maximize for most dollars mate like that doesn't make any like it we talked about learning is not just memorizing information it's changing Behavior how many [ __ ] times you get to these super rich people that do things they don't like for money and then get money and they wonder why they're not happy anymore all that matters is how you spend your time what's going to be your tigas though what's going to be your product I don't know what that see that's the thing is like I was having conversation with two Founders about this last night the good thing is is like we have some ideas uh obviously like we'll share that when time comes but like I have all these really smart successful people that like the podcast that want to help you know like Andrew and Chris are tiny I just met with their eir I think they have more than one but I just had a conversation with their uh eir um uh Patrick's trying to help me the guy that connected me with Sam Zell he's got like 20 billion dollars of assets under management he's just like well we can [ __ ] buy company we can do whatever you want you know he's also has the best of some companies to scale up I'm guessing so he understands power and he just likes the product so the point being is like that's where I'm going but I'm not doing it for money I'm doing it because I'm completely obsessed with podcasting I think it's a miracle like when I say I start talking [ __ ] about podcasts I'm like podcasting's [ __ ] uh it's to me it's like the printing press for the spoken word it's like as big a revolution as gutenberg's [ __ ] printing press and it's just like it's on-demand audio that you can educate yourself anytime you want all over the world that's [ __ ] crazy they didn't exist when you and I were kids it didn't exist I had to [ __ ] I I remember like being obsessed with talk radio and just having to listen to whatever was on the three or four dials at the time it was on and then they go from that to like streaming it in the browser I remember when that happened I was a [ __ ] grown man I was like oh this is amazing and then when my friend Eric's like oh no you can listen to Joe's podcast anytime you want like what the [ __ ] did you just say what the [ __ ] did you just say that's crazy and then think about that like if somebody like this is um a young kid so me and you both know Michael secant who's Michael from our future oh oh our future yeah dude he's in my phone as Michael future and I never referred to him as seeking his last name never I was like I don't know I don't think I'm pronouncing it correctly dude he's at my house he's at my house like twice a week and I just call him Michael future I love how arrogant dude I had a guy at my wedding and I didn't even I barely even knew how to say this I didn't even know his last name I just I just called him cieva Russia I love Michael's confidence and my point being is like imagine being you know 20 20 because he he would call DM both me and you and yeah he he's really good at it he sent me a DM he's like hey I love your podcast it took an idea that I got for your podcast made a video about it and it got 10 million views can we talk I go you did what what the [ __ ] yeah it's an impossible message not to dude I always tell him he's at his house all the time and like I'm not old I'm 33 but he he's 23 I mean he whatever he's first yeah young and he'll come over and me and Sarah will be like Michael just tell me what's what are the young kids doing nowadays and he'll literally just sit there for two hours and just tell Sarah and I like all these phrases and words and I'm just I'll just listen I don't even say a thing I just say just talk just tell me like what's up with young people and he's like well just tell me and and I'll ask him about his dating if you just talk and so I always tried it this sounds always weird whenever it says I always try to surround myself with young like younger people and I'm like just tell me I just want to listen just tell me what's going on and he always does this to me he's like you you treated at one time he says I'm like oh what are you gonna be doing in 10 years I'm gonna be landing my helicopter on your lawn or something but like I love his confidence because like you one time he said he goes got some really bad news today just got back from the chiropractor they said that the chip on my shoulder is permanent he actually gave me a really good book recommendation she texted me yesterday that I never had found it's like all these like um the ones that um I'm obsessed with the history of the American West and like yeah all that personality type that's like oh no [ __ ] the East Coast I'm gonna go across and do this crazy by uh Philip anschwitz or Antoine the guy who owns um the biggest ticketing company in the world or something it's called like a w e whatever it is it's like yeah one that every everyone knows I think they own Ticketmaster I think something like that whatever the Lakers and the Coachella he says I don't know if that's true but yeah yeah I'll wear the West Begins yeah and they own um uh Coachella anyway this guy Philip a lot of people don't know this it only has 10 reviews on Amazon Amazon this 80 year old 20 billion dollar guy he has a book about the West yeah and I already ordered it the the reason I brought up Michael though is because one I think it's smart to be like I think we have a an epidemic of people that don't believe themselves people think we have an epidemic arrogance I believe they complete opposites like there's so many more people that can create businesses because like the best description of a what a business is came from Richard Branson I've ever heard came from Richard Branson he goes a business is just an idea that makes somebody else's life better and if you look at it from there like there's Limitless opportunity and so to have the belief that you can do that it's something that pops up these books all the time is that belief comes before a building but Society wants you to show me that you're you should like show prove that you should have your confidence deserved it's like no no you don't actually understand it's like they the belief comes before then that's why a lot of people were like amongst my entrepreneurial friends they watched the Billy McFarland fire Festival documentary and they were like yeah he did the wrong things but it almost worked and the reason why like a lot of my entrepreneurial friends were like were like oh forgiving of him was it's like yeah but I've been there I've faked it until I made it type of vibe and like because I remember I did this for my conferences too I would kind of FIB I would tell these 15 speakers individually the other 14 had already confirmed which they hadn't and luckily I got them all to confirm and it worked out so it wasn't and it didn't end up being a lie but there's like so many examples where I promised something that wasn't real where I'm like oh [ __ ] I got I hope I can deliver on these things you know yeah that happens a lot though the point I was making with Michael though is imagine being his age right and being able to listen to every single episode of my first million every single episode of Founders or what are how how to take over the world we got to get Ben a shot out because [ __ ] I think what he's doing is incredible and like perfect example is like dude you should just make as many episodes possible because like you have missed you have Sam par saying your [ __ ] is really good right which is [ __ ] incredible and you have Mr Beast literally the biggest Creator on the [ __ ] internet saying to only listen to One podcast so I hope that like lights up a fire under Ben as well but like just the ability like I would kill I would have [ __ ] killed for that's why I think podcasting a miracle I don't want to do anything else let's say I never launch any businesses to answer your 10-year plan which I I I don't see how it's even possible because there's a ton of entrepreneurs I know that like want to partner on these things um but even if I just made podcasts and I just continue to grow the audience and I just made money on ad Revenue like whatever I [ __ ] that's that's plenty fine for me that's the way I like to live my life do you ever read uh do you ever heard of Chuck eager uh Chuck is that the guy who broke the uh zombies so the [ __ ] crazy thing is the miracle uh books is like you never know like where you're gonna read some random sentence that you've never everyone loves that guy's book all business people love his book so I didn't know who the [ __ ] he was I kept noticing this this old guy on Twitter in a in a pilot suit talking hella [ __ ] like unfiltered and I [ __ ] love these people that like really talk who they are they're authentic and I read his book it turns out he [ __ ] it sold like five million copies the first year came out in the 80s like it's one of the most successful autobiographies of all time well he was famous back then when he did that he I think he broke the sound barrier is that right so he broke two or something he was the first pilot to break the sound barrier and I think he was the first pilot to become Ace in a day uh in World War II he's like I love killing Nazis he says he's like one of my favorite things to do is kill Nazis and so yeah he there's a great line in his book where he he's like from this like this is what I also love it's like great can come from anywhere he lived in like this rural um what's that area in West Virginia it's like Appalachian where there's like yeah yeah so he lived in like the Appalachians completely like isolated right and so he describes the way he describes this book about killing all these Nazis he shot down fight to become an ace in a day at the shoot down five enemy planes and he goes the Nazis came up uh into the skies and they met a goddamn West Virginia Buzz saw that's the way he described himself but he gave me a another blueprint um let me see if I can get the quote exactly right this is the magic of having read wise too because I can just think of something and pull it up immediately it's like a giant search engine for everything I've read um and he gave me this idea where it's like it's how you and I should avoid what you just described you get around all these rich guys they never It's never enough they don't seem to be enjoying life which is what's the point of being rich at that point um they it seems to be surprising to them that they're not during life because they don't actually like what they do day to day but they make a ton of money so why the [ __ ] how the [ __ ] could you take 130 of your life is going to be spent working right you you hate what you do you think how is it possible do you think you're gonna get your end of your life like you're like it's impossible and so he says he goes I wasn't a deep sophisticated person but I live by a basic principle I did only what I enjoy and here's the part it's I wouldn't let anyone derail Me by Promises of power or money into doing things that weren't interesting to me and so it took me years isn't that funny how that's like business people say it Pilots say it it doesn't matter like people a lot of people who I talk to they they ask me what my pot is if it's all about business I'm like not really because like I don't give a [ __ ] if you're an artist as long as you're like kicking ass and you've like defined what success is and you've achieved it I think that's I think that's dope it's all the same personality type just applied to different things like I could show you this I don't know if you've seen the camera but like this is one of my favorite dudes he's my [ __ ] his name's Ernest Shackleton I love reading about polar explorers I like reading about athletes that's the best book I've read in probably three years endurance yeah yeah it's excellent I'm gonna make a shirt and I might sell it but I'll just make it for myself with that [ __ ] picture where he's just like covered in snow and looking like [ __ ] and I love the fact that he came up with his own Motto by endurance we conquer he's like we're just gonna win because we're never gonna quit and I think that could be applied to everything that you [ __ ] do assuming that you like to do it but um yeah I think Truckee is a smart word like so many people buying to this this I feel Prestige is a myth right where they're like I'm gonna go do this I'm gonna do activity X because it'll give me Prestige and what prestigious is you think other people are thinking about you and no one is thinking about you you like humans are self-absorbed that is our human nature so like think about the person you I listened to Ariel hawani uh interview you're about it you're a big fan of his how much of your life is spent thinking about you're a huge fan you buy all [ __ ] you listen to stuff lesson two tenths of one million percent of your life right I wish people understood how few people are thinking about them and therefore you wouldn't Chase prestigious Prestige doesn't act all that matters is like the people around you do they do they think you're a good person do they approve of what you're doing and then your work all that really matters is like your own opinion right that Ben texted me the other day about an idea for his podcast and I was like dude because he's like he added music Bad you care if I say this okay so Ben added music he's like what do you think of it and I was like I don't love it and I don't hate it I don't care about it at all I thought your episode was fantastic it was excellent I shared it with friends but I was like he's like well the the reviews are mixed so you go I saw that I went to the tweets it's like some people like this is great some people like this is bad exactly [ __ ] exactly all that matters is what you like if you like the music and they don't then let them go find another [ __ ] podcast listen to dude his music though on that first on his uh on how to take over the world that's the best intro song yeah that that intro song has helped make uh make his podcast popular the UFC like that going back to the UFC thing that that connected us too like go what like I know you have but like everybody out there needs to go talk about manifest Cowboy Conor McGregor is it he is literally in the documentary the fact that he was had somebody film him when he was flat broke living in his mom's he owed money to every single [ __ ] agency in Ireland and he's like I'm gonna be the [ __ ] world champion one day he's like literally manifesting this [ __ ] remember when he got the double belts and he's like he Joe's interviewing him he's like I saw this in my mind he goes oh look at that he's like I dream he's like I literally saw it and I [ __ ] made it real yeah that's why people like him that documentary is [ __ ] incredible it's because he called his shot it's like this he just ruins it by do it he ruins it by doing all the other dumb stuff though but it certainly he's he's he he's a he's I have a love-hate relationship with them where it's like you've got all this amazing stuff I admire you so much and I also can't stand some of this other Behavior you know what I mean I think that's where your wisdom is he's like okay I I stole my company like I'm Rich As [ __ ] uh you're still like you have a massive Advantage like uh you can launch businesses do work on whatever you work on but you're realizing this like but I also like take care of my health I want to spend time with my wife I want to have a family I want to like be able to like have freedom I've heard you describe like what's important to you and this is like yeah that's that's how I feel too because like it's my issue is like I'm not impressed by somebody successful for a year five years ten years it's like I like the people that [ __ ] never [ __ ] it up and um there's a great line of Charlie Munger said he's like it's not getting rich that you have to worry about it's staying sane he's like it's not part and this isn't a book it's not normal to human nature to have unlimited resources or be so much Rich richer and then not [ __ ] it up through he he says uh through ladies leverage and liquor is usually how rich men go broke it's in this book he didn't say it in person but um the point being is like I think there's a sense of wisdom there where it's like okay I already have this how do I keep building on it people like Connor and and Kanye West is in this example too it's like they're gifted at a young age and then they're they're Superstar success is so disorienting that like again it's not getting rich you have to worry about it's staying sane they weren't able to stay sane I want to stay sane dude I want to get to them in my life when I'm I try to make decisions like when I'm 80 years old it might like I knew for a fact uh part of the reason I I felt comfortable like jump all in on the podcast even though I didn't know if I was gonna make a success or not was that when Jeff Bezos is like well I was making a ton of money as this hedge fund I was 30 years old I had an apartment on the upper west side I'm best friends with a billionaire who's like mentoring me like he's already set for life right but he's like I knew if I quit now and forego my quarterly bonus and move across the country Seattle and try to sell books on the internet he's just like I feel that the internet is a life-changing technology and I want to play a role in that technology and the 30 year old self you can confuse yourself and think oh it's our c as prestigious as working in a hedge fund it I'm gonna miss out on you know a couple million dollar bonus whatever it is he's like your 85 year old self is gonna be like you had a shot to play a little on internet and you didn't do it that's how I feel about podcasting it's just like I believe it's a miracle I want to play a role and therefore like I want to get to my life I know 80 year old's like damn David I'm glad you [ __ ] risked it I'm happy you came on here you're um you're very fascinating to me I've listened to dozens of your episodes um I'm very eager to see what you become I think it's cool I didn't know that you're doing it for six years I know that I've listened to like episode like number 10 as well as like 300 so I guess I should have done the math but like congratulations on your success it seems like you're kicking ass it seems like you're in the groove and like it's really cool to see someone like it's really fun to see someone um like right when it's happening and that's like kind of the cool thing about podcasting and like Twitter and all this stuff is like you can catch stuff in the middle not before and not after but as it's happening that's where you are right now and I appreciate you doing this where um what do you what do you promote just Founders I call it Founders pod it's a Founders podcast Founders Twitter your Founders uh just always tweeting good [ __ ] um I want to say thank you for having me on like seriously I love your [ __ ] podcast I would just say that um one thing that podcasters uh like it's obvious who has the magic and I've been telling people way before I ever [ __ ] message you I was like you need to watch what Sam and Sean are doing it's clear they have the magic they have insane chemistry I remember listening to you guys when you're like oh I'm only getting 60 000 downloads an episode which is still super impressive and now you guys are [ __ ] blue right past that um it's extremely obvious that you guys are really good at it I hope you like do a ton of it I swear and I know you might not be interested in this but like there's a there's a massive hole in podcasting for like the Pat McAfee version of business podcast I agree and I think you and Sean you and Sean like like dude there is going to be a business podcast where you have Pat McAfee gets paid like 30 million a year by whatever his presenting sponsor is whatever like I forgot what it is um Dan Le batard got that 50 million contract from like DraftKings you see Spotify gave uh Alex Cooper 20 million a year the the reported number for Joe Rogan is way bigger than it's reported but my point being is like there's a gap in the [ __ ] business podcast space which I think you and Sean have the best way to like if you did it every day just like you did like your hour show is a perfect length the research the it feels like you're hanging out with your smart friends and you guys are brainstorming together there's nothing else that's like what you guys are [ __ ] doing hey Spotify if you're listening I'm I'm easy to contact you you just DM me on Twitter I appreciate you inviting me on those [ __ ] super cool with you I appreciate you doing this and uh yeah it means a lot and uh yeah it was awesome that's the pod that's the pod foreign [Music]

so you put down let's say 150k you you put down 150k cash and you get a million dollar deduction oh my gosh so let's say you're in California a million dollar deduction is saving you 400 000 of taxes [Music] all right we're live what's going on can I tell you about a cool rich people tax credit scheme I discovered yeah so uh actually a mutual friend of ours is the one who put me on to this but um I won't say his name because you know never talk about another man's taxes uh so so when uh when we sold the milk road I was like oh man how do you um you know reduce taxes in a situation like this is there anything I could do and I think we sold in October so it was like you know you get this windfall of profits in in October is there anything between October and December I could do to lower taxes and I looked at a lot of different options I what are the legal clear buy the book options that I could do and uh when most people try to generate large you know deductions or write-offs they typically think of what a car car because let's say you need millions of dollars of of depreciation real estate go for Real Estate so so real estate's typically the one but um you've always lazy and your boy doesn't like to go and own things and have to like you know manage Properties or anything like that um you can always put your money with somebody else and try to try to do it that way um but this is pretty interesting but you still got to research all of them and and yeah it's still a little bit of a pain exactly and you have to buy size so like how do you get you know let's say you buy a tip a property you know you're only going to be able to write off like a portion of it right so you'll get the the sort of the depreciation that you can get the bonus or accelerated depreciation if you maybe do cost sag or something you'll get 20 or 30 of the value of the property to write off but let's say you needed I don't know what pick a number right let's say you needed a 10 million dollars uh let's say you're putting up you had 10 million of taxable income you would need to buy like a 30 million dollar property or so just to be even close to deducting like enough to make it significant and that's a big deal especially for somebody's not in real estate so I was like okay that don't want to do that and uh our friend put me onto this thing he's like you know there's this other form of depreciation in the form of financing movies have you heard about this no but tell me about this okay so okay so here's uh by the way it sounds like a horrible idea no it's a it's a great idea I think I think it's a great idea so basically there's this thing called Film Production tax credits and what ends up happening is the following movie needs to get made Let's just use some numbers uh and by the way I'm not an expert at this uh but I I get the broad stroke so uh forgive me if I get some of the ratios and percentages instead of Bro Science this is bro tax yeah exactly right numbers no no words aren't my thing but body language so so let's just pretend you have a filmmaker wants to make a movie for a million dollars so in order to make a film for a million dollars you need to raise that money from somewhere and what happened was there was always these uh there was always these uh kind of like depreciation incentives but when Obama came came into to power he added to them so what Obama did was he changed the rules I believe during his time to say you can write off a hundred percent of a film's cost before they even make the film before the money spent on that film just on the budget so let's say say it's a million dollar movie if you buy that movie you can write off a million dollars right then and there nobody like you don't have to wait for the whole thing to be shot before you had to wait for certain days of production in order in order to write off those costs now you can just write off from day one as an incentive to get people to fund more movies and fund more art and culture and this sort of thing because Louise aren't really the best money makers so you needed a little bit of an additional incentive if we want wealthy people to uh to do this so now what happens you put down let's say 150k you you put down 150k of cash and you get a million dollar deduction oh my gosh so let's say you're California a million dollar deduction is saving you four hundred thousand dollars of taxes so already you see the spread right I put 150k in I save 400k in my taxes um now it gets better so where's the rest of the money come from so you need the other other 850k in order to finance the movie you can go to uh you know a bank get a loan for that so you can go get loans on it you can also get um basically rebates in the form of taxes so I don't know if you know this but like most movies are not made in Hollywood do you know where they're made I think as of recently Georgia is that right yeah Georgia Alabama basically a bunch of States come and they say hey if you got a million dollar movie we'll give you 30 of the films uh we'll give you 30 up to 30 in tax credits and so you get it you basically you don't need a million dollars to to fund the movie you're gonna get get three hundred thousand dollars from the state in order to do it why does the state want it right because State wants jobs State wants if something's filmed there and it looks cool that's you know tourism maybe if you're let's say you filmed in New York and you know looks really glamorous now you get you know additional tourism appeal you get jobs and you get culture or art in your community and you get business coming there where otherwise who's going to Georgia to do something cool right like who's going to Alabama you know no no shots fired at Georgia or Alabama but but kind of but it's human so so basically that's so that now you get funding on that side which by the way you could just go sell those credits you can just sell those credits for 90 cents on the dollar if you wanted or you could use them to fund the fun the movie and so this collection of things is part of a a a system that wealthy people use in order to get write-offs so what happens is there are companies that throughout the year are buying up rights to movies or scoping out rights to movies like and they're looking at it not in terms of like how's the plot how's the script they're like What's the budget I need a 1 million budget I need a five I need a 15. uh because I'm gonna I need options available for my clients at the end of the year so they basically hold options all these things till the very end of the year and then they go to their clients they're like how much of a write-off do you need oh you need three million dollars cool here's a 10 million dollar project we're gonna buy right we're gonna put in this much cash we're gonna get that much of a write-off we're gonna Finance the rest and we can do this as a group of investors not just one person wait you're forgetting the the the the second part and the more important part which is the movie needs to be made and make a profit not necessarily the movie needs to be made not necessarily needs to make a profit so what happens the movie starts to get made once it gets the funding it's going to start getting made and then they'll do things to help but what you have to do is pay off the loan so where am I gonna let's say in this example of a million dollars we're gonna pay off this 850k from well they'll get the tax credits for part of it they'll go sell the international rights before the movie's made or they'll go sell an option to Netflix and then they'll get some Revenue in that way while the movie's being made and they're using that to pay down this loan so that you get you know five years later when the movie is finally made hopefully the movie's paid off if it's not fully paid off it's getting close and then you basically have the revenue from the movie once it happens and so it doesn't even need to be this awesome you know 20 annual return because you got your tax benefits five years ago and so you just need to make sure it's going to pay off the loan amount dude this sounds like such a racket where is there like a what that's Hollywood baby that's Hollywood you just get to say it that way does it mean that it's less of a racket you know what I mean just gonna say it's world's best cup of coffee I mean it is it ain't where uh where like what do you go to a website you got a guy you got a movie guy I got a guy now I haven't done it by the way so I should say I didn't do this last year because I learned about it like four days before the end of the year and then I was like what the hell is this I was like we need to make a movie baby I was like oh my God I won't say his name let's just put his name Charlie hey I just got off the phone with Charlie he's got a 10 million dollar movie for me all right hey why are the funds you know like it was a little too too rushed um but the more I looked into it it's a it is a legitimate thing it's completely by the book you can go read you know section 26 of the tax code you could do the bonus depreciation of 100 of the film's cost in the in that time I think the the key part is there's a little there's some Nuance like just like with real estate you got to be an active investor so you have to be an active film investor in order to offset against your active income so you have to like go to film festivals and do do like 36 hours of film study online in order to be qualified as active or whatever the rules are I'm making up those exact numbers but you know there obviously is a lot of nuance to these things but just broad Strokes pretty interesting that rich people can hold on a huge tax write-offs financing movies so I'm just looking at this so you said Obama did this or he like accelerated it he increased it so that you could depreciate 100 um so coincidentally the Obamas now have a wonderful production company uh beautiful Home In Georgia yeah [Laughter] it's called Higher Ground media and they've made a handful of movies that I've I've noticed or that I've seen but they so if you go to higher groundmedia.com they also have podcasts so they are the uh so they have an audible deal Michelle Obama did it used to be with Spotify now it's with Amazon audible they have the sum of us I don't know what that is the big hit show whatever they have all these oh they have Renegades which is like this uh Barack one so does this work for podcasts is the question what's that smell is that opportunity self-dealing yeah a little Barack special uh do they does this work for by the way he did it right man have you heard you haven't you haven't heard of Pete from Barack he he he's just he did this thing he did an all right job he didn't whether you like him or love him he either did great or he did fine so he did all right job and then he bounced you know what I'm saying he just bounced he's out and so he's hanging out with uh Oprah and David Geffen on Manchester uh on their yacht so he he did it right but does this count for podcasts do we have uh well I don't know my camera's on you got a video over there that's a great Point people would call I've seen in the YouTube comments people consider us you know a film a premium production exactly I think we need to change the the LLC name to premium Productions uh and uh you're in Texas Texas not far from Alabama we can do a little road trip yeah that's interesting uh hopefully this works for podcasts but that's an interesting find I thought it was stupid and it's actually more interesting than I thought how was your pod with repeat it was awesome you want to do a recap yeah I haven't listened to it so what's uh what was the best part he made fun of you a little bit uh he took a he took a a job not at you well because there was a podcast where I asked you if you could get eight percent consistently but you can't invest in anything other than your own private business would you do it and he was like Sean was crazy I was yelling at the I was yelling at the screen Furious that he wouldn't accept that but he didn't actually give you a hard time that was it uh uh he's very um he's very principled which I actually like I think uh you are the opposite not I think you are one extreme and I actually think I'm closer to you a little bit than I am to him where he is just like this is what I want I'm going to do it and I'm going to do nothing else like she's laser focused on a couple things which I admire uh and then he uh what is he focused on he was like I can make more money with my business I can duel I could I could have done a podcast years ago but I just wanted to wait until I felt it was the perfect right time so he just calculated you know you and I like to just throw little things out there and see what catches he's not so much that he also did a really good job have you ever heard him talk about the rich life yeah I've heard him explain it's kind of like he made a list of like what's the rich life to him and then sort of use that as his financial blueprint exactly and he's got like a handful of things like he's like I just wanted to have the best assistant because I want them to book Things perfectly so he's like when I fly I try to fly on a very specific type of airline with a very specific seat so I want a certain plane when I fly I want a certain type of food ready for me when I arrive in my hotel room and it was just very exact and I love how exact he was it sounded like a lot of work to set it up so I found it intimidating but like he knew exactly I hate people who are that particular I hate people who are particular in general I find uh it to be extremely spoiled and snobbish um you know I have like sort of sort of like you are what you admire and I have the opposite of admiration for people that are extremely particular about how they want everything managed and taken care of in their life versus people who are like look uh I'm blessed I'm gonna roll with the punches you don't have to cater to me um I'm Gonna Make You know you could serve me food I'm allergic to and I'm gonna find a way to have a party in the ER right like you know that is more of the mindset that I admire is somebody who is what I call unconditional meaning their happiness or their mood is not contingent on anything I find that to be an absolute superpower and I I say this because not to hate on roommate I say this because I kind of only ever hear about the opposite especially in this kind of like you know life hacking productivity porn like kind of hustle culture type of thing where I think people get praised for being super meticulous for being super organized for planning out everything for scoping it out for working backwards all that stuff and uh I never hear about anybody who's praised for being like you know what this guy's always in a good mood regardless of what's happening but to me that's the superpower yeah and I'm closer to you in that regard like recently I went to a place and I ordered a steak and they brought me a pizza that was pesto chicken and I didn't and I didn't I didn't tell like yeah I didn't even tell my my wife was like halfway through like didn't you order a steak I'm like yeah but it was here and whatever and so I'm I'm more like you but I respect that he knows what he wants and he wants and he and he lives that way so I respect that and then um Martin shkreli do you want to talk about him really quick yeah we never got to to debrief that so fun pause I got a lot of [ __ ] did you get [ __ ] I got a ton of black that we had them on from where and dude just online and friends were messaging me they're like why would you give this guy a platform and I don't think they even listened to the episode because uh my my response to why would you give this person a platform it's twofold it's number one I'm like well did you watch the documentary about him on Netflix and if they say yes then I say well then he has a platform did you criticize Netflix do you know you watched it did you cancel Netflix yeah like you watched Netflix do you watch the news about him because you he has the platform and second I'm like how'd you like that Ted Bundy doctor series pretty good huh yeah did you watch that did you did you watch that because that's the same thing and then second I'm like well we actually did challenge him quite a bit I think I explicitly said uh why'd you act like an idiot uh and why are you such an [ __ ] when you should didn't have to be an [ __ ] like we had a very productive conversation I think uh and so there's a fair criticism which is he has an explanation about like you know why how the healthcare system works blah blah and we're not well versed enough about the healthcare system to know where to push back because like let's say I don't know if he told us anything that was incorrect or sort of slight of Handy but if he did there's no way I would have known because that's not much right like um you know it's like but why is that wrong I don't know if that's wrong I'm saying that would be a fair criticism let's say you did know yeah and then somebody comes on here they say something that's either not true or sort of misdirection or uh besides the point or not really how things work and the hosts don't push back on it it can be very frustrating if you do know and so I'd say that's a if if that's what happened that would be I would say a fair criticism on the other hand I thought the most interesting thing he talked about was just sort of like um he's like I could be the Pfizer CEO corporate speak don't don't tell outside the line don't give the media anything to get mad about just quietly make your Millions just do whatever you're gonna do right raise prices uh you know whatever whatever it is that you're gonna do it's not like most pharmaceutical companies are seen as like you know Angels but they don't get the same level of flack because he was very loudmouth he was very vocal and he he poked the bear constantly and what I liked was this moment and the thing where I was like dude you're not dumb so like you probably knew what you should say or you had a person on your PR team tell you at some point hey when you go to Congress and they're asking you questions don't be doodling you know like a dog on your piece of paper uh and and smugging you know having a don't smile yeah don't have a smug look on your face like he knew what to do but he lives that troll life baby he's like he's like I don't want to be that I don't want a world where everybody who's successful has to be this robot and I'm gonna be me and I'm gonna have fun with it and I'm gonna call bsybs I'm gonna fight with people who don't know what they're talking about and I gotta say that is one part that I really do admire about him and I think somebody said this to me after the episode they go you know you guys had uh Billy McFarland from the fire Festival on and he seemed like a dumb like a dumb cheat they go Martin seemed like the opposite he seemed like a genius cheat which is basically like but you know Billy came back he's like next thing I'm doing another fire festival or like actually and he's doing it what he had said to us on air was I'm gonna do this thing where you could micro do so people are going to go to this island and then you could vote with micropayments to get them to like snorkel with sharks and like we're gonna jump up the water we're gonna jump up the water if people donate and I was like wow that's your comeback that's a dumb idea but with Martin I would say like uh you know I think you could question whatever his ethics or um if he's you know gone straight after whatever you know what he did to to go to jail but I think it's hard to deny that the guy's very intelligent and has a lot of interesting things to say um and you know frankly you can learn a lot from from somebody who's highly intelligent has interesting things to say yeah I you know what I was telling people I'm like I can like how Michael Jackson dances and I can learn how to moonwalk from him but also not like everything that he did right uh you know what I'm saying so I I can like both those things how's your moonwalk um um you know it's a it's a three out of ten I'd say but uh I also there's one criticism that we're starting to get now that we're a little bit bigger that I've been thinking about which is they're like you have a responsibility to do X Y and Z and my gut reaction is like f you I don't have a responsibility I'm doing whatever the hell I want but then I'm like it is journalistically a bit and that's like a really weird thing to like uh kind of approach particularly when no one got in for we didn't get into this for that reason like we didn't want to pursue truth we just wanted to have fun you know what I'm saying yeah I think that's I mean to be perfectly clear we are not journalists this is not journalism we are not we are not reporting anything this is me and Sam shooting the [ __ ] talking about business and interesting things we see and then when we meet interesting people we have them on the podcast we have a conversation with them and sometimes we like what they say and sometimes we don't sometimes we buy what they're selling sometimes we don't sometimes we defend people because 95 of people hate them uh but that doesn't mean we think that they're perfect so you know that's that's my stance on it all right let's move on to something else you tweeted out that um you had nothing to say today which is always great uh to hear I found a few things last minute though did you like my uh did you like my meme yeah uh uh the Jesus meme I thought it was wonderful it was uh it was a there's like this famous is it Catholic I don't know where it's like Prince in the sand is the name of the story yeah whenever you know we saw two footprints on the beach or two sets of footprints and then all one well I bet if it's no it's then all of a sudden I didn't see the second footprint what happened and it was like that's when I was carrying you son no it was good it's like where were you when I needed you the most if I were the only one Footprints all right so do you want to go first you want me to go I'll go first really quick this is something that I think both of us are interested in but I have a feeling you didn't uh you didn't care enough to look into this because it was like a [ __ ] ton of reading but tiny our friend Andrew Wilkinson he took his company public it's officially public I think the Friday I don't know what it is today it was 750 million I think Canada which is 560 million USD somewhere between one and a billion yeah so hundreds of millions of dollars and you know whenever you go public you got to release a huge report and it's 300 pages and I read through a lot of it and I found a bunch of interesting stuff you want me to tell you some of the interesting things all right so the foundation for so Andrew Wilkinson's our friend he owns this thing called tiny tiny owns either outright owns or partially owned something like 10 to 30 things 30 different businesses the whole thing started with meta lab medalab was an agency that he created by himself in 2008 and he basically made websites it was nothing fancy at first he made websites for Silicon Valley companies but that's a little bit glamorizing it because it was like someone paid him like twenty thousand dollars to make like a fairly straightforward simple website then he just kept going and kept going and kept going well it's listed in his uh I actually don't know what this document's called uh in America I think it's called the 10q uh or just whenever they file for uh to go public this company's in the I think Vancouver Stock Exchange so I don't know what it's called there but it's listed as Digital Services Revenue in 2021 it did 62.8 million dollars and that's interesting because it actually has been growing not crazy fast so it's been growing something like 23 a year or for the last handful of years we can only see a couple years here but it does a 45 or 40 margin so for every 100 they make their net income is something like 40 40 which is crazy now if you start in 2008 and you only grow 20 a year you actually get to significantly higher than where he's at now so there was years where it was lumpy where it didn't grow or it grew a lot and then it got smaller but not significant of a business for something that's been around for what's this now 15 years and this has been the foundation of everything he has the CEO of that company and that CEO has paid 1.1 million dollars uh which is a good deal I think for everyone so the CEO gets to run an established company that's working and they get paid a million dollars um so here's something that's really interesting if you scroll down to on this document they have a list of a bunch of the dividends paid since 2021 and if you add them all up it's something like 15 million dollars that he's took out of the business um they took out a bunch more dividends because they actually took down I think something like a hundred million dollars in debt so he he had a debt facility in order to grow the company as opposed to equity which is awesome because you just take a loan and if that works it's significantly cheaper than Equity if it doesn't work it's that's not good you owe a bunch of money but he did it and it worked out but as he's been growing he took money like 15-ish million according to these documents out additionally they had a company called meal time which is like a meal prepping software that he sold for 25 million dollars so he had a and they gained they profited 13 million dollars off that so clay actively he's been making tens of millions of dollars along the way super fascinating while this business do you remember you remember when we were having lunch with them we're gonna have to bleep out this number but do you remember having a lunch with him and you asked him some question you're like you know um at what number did you know life sort of change for you or what what numbers mattered in your kind of climb and then he says he's like yeah um you know that's when uh that's when you know blah blah and you go you go okay so that's the net worth and he goes no per year yeah if you go what we were both like wait and then he skipped over I told another story he's like yeah yeah so like yeah every year and we were like what the actual [ __ ] is this guy talking about you were making that much he's like yeah and now we see that it that it's all like it's all on paperwork and and by the way everything we're saying this is strictly from the document where so there's nothing else that we know uh but yeah like he kind of killed it there and then one last interesting thing is they own this thing it's the company called it's called tiny boards it's really just wework remotely.com and it makes um I think it's like six million a year roughly so it grew during you know 2020 to 21 it grew from like 3 million to 6 million then it went back down to like three or four million but I looked it up on LinkedIn I'm pretty sure there's like three people yeah very fascinating and they bought that or they bought that from uh 37 signals from Jason freed and dhh so that's pretty cool yeah you know when so I invested in this right before it went public so private just privately and when I had gone into that kind of the data room um I was looking around and I was like okay so it seems like really there's kind of like two interesting observations one is he creates these like what they call platforms which is basically means you're gonna buy a bunch of the same type of company so he has an agency platform meta lab is the big one but I think they have like seven eight or seven or eight other agencies they're just a lot smaller job there's like a webflow agency there's a there's no code agency there's a whatever agent yeah so then there's job boards and they own a couple of job boards then there's creative tools which is like they own dribbled and dribble block creative market and cut and grew that way and then they have whatever they have a couple other then they have like this like long tail of random things like they would be funky the photo editing app they own meal time they they own some random things and I would say a couple things really stood out to me when I looked at it I was like okay so you if you look at where the bulk of the revenue and ebitda comes from it's two companies so yes he's got a portfolio of 30 companies but it's meta lab and its dribble that are carrying the thing on its back I guess the other one would be uh we Commerce which had split and gone public uh which was a roll-up of Shopify apps but that would have done pretty well too I think and that one's at 25 million in Revenue I think it was like something like 10 million if you just look at the eBay number sure I was like uh and I'm not quoting this off I'm not looking at the sheet but like just ballpark I believe that we Congress ballpark was at about 10 million in ebitda when it went public um I remember you saying that on the pot that's what I'm getting that from the second one is um you know meta lab which you just talked about you know let's say 50 60 million in Revenue 45 uh margins so roughly 30 billion in ebitda and then which is just a juggernaut and then you have dribble and dribble does what um does it have it for 30. so in 2000 yeah in 2021 so here's the numbers for 2021 Digital Services Revenue which is considered agencies that was 63 million creative platform Revenue which I think is only dribble or it's dribble plus a small thing in 2020 it did 23 million in 2021 it did 34 million and then they have other which is all this small stuff combined which was about 14. so just those first two Digital Services which is almost all meta lab um you know the rest might add up to less than 20 of that so if you just add up 60 plus 30 plus 13 right this is roughly 100 a little over 100 million and 110 of that comes from uh medalab and uh and dribble and the ebitda on that I don't know actually people are gonna laugh people are gonna laugh at me I don't know what adjusted ebitda Means versus just normal ebitda but the normal ebitda which is earnings before interest tax and depreciation that was 50 million dollars on that Revenue yeah and you know what I think is remarkable the amount of equity that they put in to create this so now this thing is valued at let's call it 800 million dollars right now 811 million market cap right now which is Canadian and it's I didn't realize it's a 75 uh 25 decrease from U.S church so let's say uh so it's that comes out to be a little less than 600 600 basically so 600 uh 600 million market cap company and I believe uh he can confirm or deny this but I believe less than 10 million dollars of total Equity was put in so how much cash did it take to start this business and most businesses don't take a ton of cash but um but this is a this is an acquisition based company so like you know they they were acquiring companies and so I think less than 10 million of seed Capital was put in I could be wrong and the seed Capital came from the profits of the agency so in reality it's like he started this as an 18 year old or 19 year old he said he was working as a barista in the papers it has the stories like I was working at a as a coffee shop person and then I started doing this on the side and it just we just kept going and so the takeaway here is like simple [ __ ] it's it's hard but it's simple but for since 2007 or something like that amazing honestly kind of honestly it's amazing uh and congrats it's amazing our buddy Andrew for going public that's a big deal you know uh that's a decade plus of of hard work 15 15 years plus of hard work to get there so you know kind of amazing for him I love that any other takeaways you have um no those are the those are the main ones uh you know I think you know one other thing that Chris his partner told me at dinner was I think I might have already shared this on the Pod but he said uh when he got hired and he met Chris at a bank Chris was a banker uh literally like a like a bank teller like I'd had a branch he met Chris they hit it off about cars they were talking about cars and um because Android rolled up in a cool looking car and Chris was into it or whatever so they hit it off they ended up talking for a little while he's like what's your store what are you doing he's like I'm starting to get my uh my like CPA license like I want to be a Finance person or accountant or whatever and uh Andrew's like awesome I need help uh my business meta lab is just getting off the ground it's working pretty well but like we're super disorganized come work with me and uh Chris takes the leap of faith goes to work with him he says that on day one he's like I showed up at the office yeah there's nobody there uh like Andrew's not there nobody's answer at the door and then Andrew uh pulls up at his Uber or whatever his car uh I guess there's no Uber back then but it pulls up in a car taxi hops out and he's like opens the trunk takes out this giant box full of paper and he's like here here's all of our like numbers financials like this is where it's at um you know make sense of this and uh and help us get organized he hands up this huge box he's like oh by the way I gotta go so I'm not gonna be able to train you right now um and there's no room in the office for you so I talked to my neighbor they have like a basement you can sit at their desk in there and he's like just knock on the door and tell him you're the guy and then they'll let you into the basement desk or something so he tells the story how you started whatever he gets it organized and as they're looking at they're like all right you have a very profitable agency okay what do we do with these profits right we're just going to like accrue them that doesn't seem very good and they're like well what do other agencies do and they're like they looked around I see in other agencies like all of a sudden there's a giant ball pit in the office there's a basketball court they're flying you know fancy everywhere they're hosted you know just basically spending money on like like status stuff or like appearances and he's like we shouldn't do that that doesn't seem to have any Roi um right like adding the ball pit to the office doesn't yeah it makes it more fun but like you know I don't think that's the best use of money what if we just thought of ourselves like a really profitable Law Firm and like you know what if we were a boring business what would we do with this money well we would just go try to find a place to reinvest this what if we take this business that's okay agencies aren't the best business but we use it to buy better businesses and then that was kind of like the conversation that they had and that's where they started going out and acquiring other businesses using the profits for metal lab but there's two or there's one part of that story that you're missing and and this is because it's probably not fun for them to tell but they will tell it because they blog about it which is they actually started other things so they did the same things that we make fun of and that we've done as well they started a to-do list it was called flow uh and they he said he spent like four or five hundred thousand dollars or maybe even close to a million a lot of money of the profits and they created this thing which was basically like Asana but different and he goes Asana crushed us because they spent way more money and then they started I think one or two other things I think another thing called ballpark so they actually started things right away and it failed and then they go yeah let's just buy them and that's what they did and they still start things like super cast or uh he's got a bunch of different ideas he started since but if you just look at him in the grand scheme of things it's almost like a big company right it's like they have the innovator's Dilemma it's like this business is at one million in Revenue in nine months it's like cool who cares you know that's one percent you know I didn't move the needle this year but probably took a lot of Creative Energy and recruiting and promoting to get to to get to that level so you have a tough thing where you enjoy starting new things so you want to do it you keep having new ideas but it's hard for those new things to really break out and make a difference um you know and most most new things generally will will fail or or not go exactly to plan either so it's it's a tough tough balance I think to have and I know what they paid for dribble and um do you think I think you know too but we can't say it do you think that uh you can buy companies like this like is this one of those things like you know or am I just being a noob here where people say oh you can't start a newsletter now there's too many new newsletters I'm like no that's not true but do you what do you think about the competition now to buy companies versus 10 years ago yeah certainly more but there's also more Supply right like uh the number of like interesting you know interesting internet companies in 2007 versus 2023 is going to be obviously like many fold more because the internet has just become so dominant there's so many businesses that are successful so many playbooks of how to build a good SAS business or a good Marketplace or whatever having said that is probably the type of business where you make one good decision one good deal a year or two good deals a year and that was a great year and um that I think that speed is just very hard for most entrepreneurial people to go out right well yeah I agree with what you said this is pretty inspiring and awesome so that's the lowdown on Tiny good stuff this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated whoa I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better can we talk about I see you have Harvard's revenue on here I have an interesting story about Harvard's Revenue so I want to hear your take yeah I was doing some Friday night research and uh as one yeah got to thinking how much money is Harvard making yeah I'd like to tell you some things about Harvard so Harvard is this thing that um if you really like zoom out are you like an alien and you're looking down at Harvard and you're like what is that thing on the map yeah no no not be you the other one you know what's what's over there in Boston what you would see is basically some combination of a church a hedge fund and a luxury daycare and I'd like to tell you about each of those components and how Harvard is basically this multi-billion dollar tax-free Juggernaut all right there's a lot of taxes in this episode yeah all right so buckle up okay so how was it a how is it a church well universities are tax exempt so they don't pay taxes they don't pay it on donations they don't pay it on tuition room and board or even capital gains from their hedge fund which is the second part so they have an endowment that's about 50 billion dollars that they invest across a wide portfolio I'll tell you their portfolio in a second so they got a 50 billion dollar hedge fund they have uh their tax exempt on the gains for the Hedgehog plus all the revenue from their students well I should say revenue from their luxury daycare because parents will pay you know 50 60 70 000 a year to send their child to this place for four years and so they take your kids off your hand for four years and they say you're they're gonna come out in a better better place and so here's some of the numbers around this this mashup juggernaut uh last year um 5.8 billion in total revenue 2 billion of that comes from the profits of their endowment hell of a year for them um but actually this wasn't last year this was I think 2021. so uh two years ago uh so 5.8 billion in total revenue 2 billion from their endowment 1.2 billion from education so what that means is 80 of the revenue is coming from not education that's the other way to look at that um so where does the rest come from so they have the endowment you have a billion dollars of Grants so the government funding research for their professors 500 million of donations and 300 million from so you'll go pretty well which is their publishing arm I can tell you all their their in-house media company so a couple couple observations here the school earns more Revenue than both Twitter and Snapchat Twitter is at 5 billion Snapchat's 4.66 billion uh Harvard has more Revenue than both of them and it's been doing that since when was Harvard created in the Harvard's like 100 plus years old I think and so it's been doing that forever not forever but it's a very long time amazing business right uh the publishing arm makes 300 million dollars just selling case studies to other business schools and Publishing the hbr the review journal which is basically a really fancy paid sub stack it's got 350 000 subscribers who pay for the hbr the Harvard Business Review but the majority of that Revenue I think I can try to find it but I study this a lot I think that a lot of the so if we go to Harvard Business School they uh they release all their they break it all out and so if I read it here so 34 of the so their revenue actually went down 2019 it was 900 million in 2021 it was 800 so 34 of that is whatever you said 300 comes from publishing the next thing down is 14 came from tuition and of the of the 34 for publishing most of it is from selling I think it's like they've sold like they sell like five million case studies a year to other business schools yeah which is which is insane and the Harvard Business Review has a lot of revenue from International so here's the other kind of like dirty secret from from Harvard which is that they make a ton of money off of Executive Education 464 million dollars so almost like not quite half but like you know almost half of the money they make from their degree their actual school they make on Executive Education which is basically you pay to get professional development credits AKA you get to put Harvard on your resume without actually having a Harvard degree if you go to Tyra Banks remember Tyra Banks yeah that's right uh if you big T for sure if you go to uh uh her LinkedIn it says Harvard Business School and then like you have to scroll down extension you'll see you'll see parentheses and you'll say I'll say extension uh it's a very classic technique right my cousin did this he went there and I was like whoa we're going to Harvard he's like I'm going to a I'm taking classes at Harvard yeah taking classes at Harvard so you you got into Harvard uh yeah you know like sure I got into the Executive Education Program at Harvard and uh and he's like yeah like you know on my resume it says Harvard and he's like you know one out of three people understand what it is a two out of three dollars I like my eyes yeah there's also the international arm their International Revenue is up like 80 because they're selling the age of the Business Review over there they're selling uh you know Executive Education come on come to come to America come to the best part of America come to the Louis Vuitton of uh of Education right so basically you got billions in Revenue zero taxes owed huge barrier to entry a brand that's lasted over a century the government loans your customers money and gives you grants for your r d like what a business dude that's absolutely crazy and a lot of people don't realize this um and to put these numbers in perspective let's just say that so you said their endowment I'm just doing all this math right here um so I might be off but I bet you if we Google it this will be true if their endowment is 50 Public math are you well yeah I am sorry but if they're in debt but it might be wrong if their endowment is 55 billion dollars um it can and their expenses some years I just Google it right now is around five billion dollars that means theoretically there are some years that they can pay or charge their students zero tuition and pay for everything still the way that the endowment works is it's a 50 billion dollar issue endowment and there the plan is they distribute five percent of it a year so five percent of it a year is used but the the the the the rule is this the domain needs to last forever so they're only going to distribute five percent because they need the other 95 to stay in and keep rolling and in 2022 when my portfolio was down like 45 they lost 1.8 percent somehow lost only less than two percent when the whole Market has been terrible this year here's here's their portfolio by the way three percent cash okay 32 into hedge funds which headphones does it say it doesn't say which ones now 44 into private Equity plus Venture Capital but most of its private Equity so what do they buy so that's the bulk of it um and then there's six percent real estate three percent bonds five percent treasuries and six percent foreign equities okay so what's this private Equity stuff uh is does that mean they're in like PE like like Blackstone livestock or whatever BlackRock wow dude this is like a circle jerk to the max everyone's hands full on this one this is crazy right because yeah because you if you think about it like if I look up where the hedge fund guys went I bet you know 70 of them went to Harvard I mean this is just it's pretty it's a very circular thing going on here it's pretty wild like it it is it's I would say it's almost corrupt and if you think about 50 billion a 50 billion endowment that's bigger than I than I would imagine 95 of countries GOP I mean it's like that's massive Gob uh GOP that's the uh what's that the uh the Republicans what's uh GDP yeah but and yeah like you know we think these VC funds like Sequoia and Andreessen are like really big like I don't know what injuries it's total AUM is but I'm guessing it's like between 10 and 15 billion uh it ain't 50. yeah yeah exactly 50 billion and they're I think I mean they're they're okay they're now at 35 they've been scaling it up like crazy uh but that's our full-time job that's their thing yeah that's their thing this is just like you know I I would imagine there was a I forget what I was watching but there was some show where it was like a lot of people don't realize this but like venture capital and PE like the biggest when people I always hated when people celebrated a venture capital company going bust like uh what was that one guy who uh the the Disney guy who went started uh the thing that quibby you know it raised like billions of dollars and went and it went bust what a lot of people don't realize is this money for so the money that is given to Andreessen Horowitz into this and that it comes from the universities it also comes from the California's teachers pension plan or the the police pension plan or firefighters or and like you'll like I think if I remember correctly I I believe like Nevada for some reason I think it was like the state of Nevada for their pension plan for government government workers something like that had one of the best uh returns and they was basically like one dorky guy and he's pretty much just like Warren Buffett you know he has a similar style or um a similar budget where he has all this money and he just would sit in this office and except unlike Warren Buffett he's getting paid by the state and so there was a story about how he was making you know a nice amount of money a year but he would bring brown paper bag lunch and he just drove before Windows 95. yeah yeah and he's like look I'm on the uh and and this guy was like a fiduciary a fiduciaries where he was like I don't waste taxpayer money and because of that I read all this stuff I very rarely make big bets and but when I do it [ __ ] crushes it and so like these guys Chad yeah he's great and he's like and so anyway it's just like these guys making these decisions they're just government workers in a way but they're making they're basically mini Warren buffetts and so it's really fascinating like the world of these like endowments and these people I met a guy once who worked for Alaska's Permanent Fund I don't know if you know about this day have 79 billion in assets under management so Alaska has all this money from the oil stuff or whatever and then they give everybody who lives in Alaska like three grand a year or something like that which is basically like well you know when people were talking about Universal income they're like oh that sounds crazy I'm like you know they do that in Alaska I think I think you get 15 grand a year if you live in Alaska right yeah I don't know I thought it was like maybe three four but yeah maybe it's more um but yeah there and then there I met a guy who manages that that money and he's just like what was he like I mean he wasn't the main principal but he was a guy who worked there and he was like he was at the farming conference and I was like what are you doing here and he's like I'm looking for you know intelligence and then and Investments you know Farmland is a great investment and I was like Wow uh good for you this is uh you know who would have thought this guy's managing way more money are these people manage way more money than like the famous kind of hedge funds or um or Venture capitalists that you hear a lot about dude I wonder if this topic is interesting Ben let me know in the slack because I like I'm geeking on this stuff I found this to be crazy fascinating um so he's typing now um you want to do one more thing yeah let's do one more I have a quick idea my nine my nine okay so uh sounds a little bit sick uh last 24 hours I don't know you have a great haircut by the way though I really like the uh the uptown fade you got you know high fade it's the uptown fade with the downtown brow [Laughter] I just wanted to say something cool it looks good you look sharp have you been have you how much weight have you lost in the past three years um I think I've gained weight in the last three years I just changed the composition like I uh you're looking to put on a lot of muscle too much muscle um in a way that's like not good like uh not like it's like I'm not neither a bodybuilder nor am I ripped I'm just thick and thick is like I don't know anybody who puts thick on their vision board like some people do I mean look at your your right arm right now or something dude your right arm right now I definitely hit you with a little I definitely see you try try yes I see a great teardrop man that's a that you gotta get a good tricep muscle that's my uh what do you call it like your your highlight your Keystone asset that's my Keystone your tries thank God it's in the zoom view yeah imagine if my quads were what was good I'd just be wasting it every day Welcome to my life my friend yeah you should make an excuse to stand up every day every every episode just to you know Flex on them a little bit yeah no you look good you definitely looks felt uh and people in the comments are saying it but sorry go ahead uh well I mean that was great anytime you only take that tangent and we can go there um all right so I was I I was in a fever and I had a little fever dream I thought of an idea that I'm pretty sure would go viral I'm not gonna do it but um you know our friend um Nikita who has created the same app twice and sold it twice to the same to similarly stupid tech companies that that didn't realize it's like just like a nothing app oh you're talking about uh Nikita the [ __ ] beer that's an official name right for those who don't know Jimmy Cooper but it just stands for douchebag Cooper yeah I know Nikita the [ __ ] beer you know the funny thing is he's got this Persona online of being kind of like a [ __ ] poster and like kind of a [ __ ] but usually when you beat those people the if you ever meet somebody like that you're like what's what are they like it's like dude total sweetheart love that guy totally not like you see online no you know how like you know that's a very common thing where you're like oh you know Sean you know saying whatever oh yeah great guy great guy I don't know if that knows that phrase may not be used with him is he getting a great guide he's not getting very good yeah oh he gets a wow that's him so anyways The Genius of what he's done because undeniably created uh you know these like really viral teen apps is his app works as follows you download the app if you take a quiz that says who in your school or who in your contact is most likely to whatever and to try to figure out in your contacts who you talk to the most or whatever so that they could surface maybe the right person in a multiple choice so that you you say Sam is is the guy who I'd want to bail me out of jail and at the end of the thing it's like wow those are awesome do you want to know what Sam says about you and you're like yeah for sure and basically it texts you in the background and it's like Sam someone said that you would be the most likely person to bail him out of jail do you want to see who and you're like of course click download you take the quiz and that's the viral Loop do you remember back in the I think I have another one of these uh do you remember back in the day the Myspace top top eight I think it was called it was like uh was that like who was in your top eight friends yeah you just got I mean this was this is just like a pretty wild concept to be honest with you you just put on your profile yo these are my top eight friends in order which is like I don't know that today that'd be considered like you know bullying to the 10th degree but you know I think where that came from was like do you remember blog rolls or it was like if you would go to a Blog and it would say like um here's who else yeah on the right hand side you would list like eight other blogs that were similar to you that you were friends with which by the way I thought was awesome I always like I go I try to find whatever a great way to discover things yeah I love doing that and then a lot of people don't know this but Tony Shea the founder of Zappos he created what was it called it was called media link I think and it basically went from zero to like a 400 million dollar acquisition and all they did I think originally it was called link exchange is what it was called is they helped broker the deals where eventually it was a pay-to-play for like the blog rolls which is like the things on the side and I think that is where Myspace kind of got like this idea of like here's like my top eight or whatever like here's the people I to help you discover new people right and you know Tom from Myspace would always be your your automatic number one when you start and then you have to fill in your friends and it was this awesome thing you could go to someone's profile you could be like oh they're best friends with this person oh this girl moved to number one maybe they're dating it was like this little like this like signaling thing and it was cool it was felt so good to be in someone's topic and it felt so bad to be out of someone's top eight so but it lets you know where you stand and there's something I really appreciate about that so I think you can recreate that now with something I'm calling my nine and what my nine is you download this app and it just says who are your nine people who who you who you rocking with and you just designate of my contacts these are my nine and they let you publish that as a photo to Instagram or as a video onto Tick Tock or whatever it just lets you share that out just saying hey here's my nine and you tag them and it texts them also from your phone and somebody puts you in their their my nine do you want to see who and of course you're going to download of course you're going to sign up to see who you're going to connect your address book and then you're gonna select your nine and you'll reciprocate because that's what people do and so I think this would also go super viral because I think it just has those like human psychology triggers where if you've got that message you got to know who did it and then when you're there you'll do it too because it's kind of fun like a little personality quiz and then that triggers the next nine invites that go out and nine invites is enough to go viral so like even if you have a 15 conversion rate of which this would have like more like 40 probably um you will by definition your K Factor will be over one you will you will go viral dude I always wanted that for when I die you know like my nine for when I did I might die I die my die so like I've I've always wondered like if I die how is anyone gonna know because like when you I imagine this sounds douchey 100 Tombstone just here's my nine friends top of my friends I don't know again I'm gonna preface this it sounds douchey but when you start having a little bit of something you eventually you have so many different accounts and like there's companies that I've invested in and I [ __ ] forgot when I when I sold the hustle we there's this one guy he uh what was his name Jonah uh he started moat.com and he sold it for like a billion dollars he's just a rich guy and he gave me very little money enough that like he probably makes that a day in interest and when we sold it took me a year to get in contact with him I swear to God it took the lawyers were like dude we cannot get in touch with this guy like his because he sold his company so it's like he just we can't get in touch with them we don't know we gotta give him his money but he's owed money it's just sitting here and I'm not close to that but there are some Investments that I've made that I've forgotten about and I've always wondered like if I die how is anyone in my family gonna know like who get like where this stuff is or if they're who are they going to contact am I like is there like a like a like a like a next of kin like checklist you know what I mean and it changes all the time too so even if you wrote it down once This is Gonna Change I actually don't know how this works when you die how do they discover all your assets especially not with like crypto or Angel Investing I don't know I'm gonna discover all this stuff and who are they gonna have to contact because particularly with crypto it's a lot of single young guys like who's like the next the next of kin for that I have no idea you know there's do you watch succession hey this is producer Ben quick note Sam is about to drop a massive spoiler for the HBO series succession so if you plan on watching it and you're not all the way caught up skip ahead like two minutes enjoy they're like he he just left everything to this emoji yeah dude on succession it's like a you know the thing it's basically Rupert Murdoch's family and the the Rupert Murdoch character dies and they find his will and he wrote it in pencil but they and they there's this part where he's giving stuff the company to his son and they can't determine if he's crazy yeah well no they couldn't determine is he Crossing out the guy's name or underlining the guy's name because he like it was like a crooked line like is he Crossing it out or underlining we don't really know what that is but I've thought about that I'm like when I die if I die and my wife dies at the same time unless that we don't have kids whatever I'm like how are who are they gonna know to contact it like they got to figure out where my mother lives like it seems like an ordeal you're gonna have a really rich dog yeah I guess uh so they need my nine but like that's like now like you took this in terms of like a uh a trusted will solution yeah my teenage viral app idea yeah my nine probate is what it's called and it's just like you really uh yes I ended that one he went full improv kid on that one and took it to an only place dude I've just been thinking about that have you not thought about that because like there's some [ __ ] that you've probably done it could be small like every once while I'll like just do a deal like I'll just invest like five grand into something and I don't tell anyone about it like you know you and I you and I were joking five grand is about the limit where you like tell your spouse that you're doing it and like you know there's been things that I've done like oh I don't even [ __ ] remember I guess there's a scratch-off ticket that I won somewhere I have no idea dude um yes I've thought about that especially with crypto but then when crypto crashed I was like hey never mind forget it forget what I told you it doesn't matter anymore you know those instructions I told you about how like you know it's written on this fireproof you know platinum card that's stored in this safe in this foreign country yeah forget about it you don't need to go retrieve it anymore particularly with crypto it seems crazy um so I need my nine but for my will God damn I guess that's the part did I I meant to be a Yes Man on that one by the way not uh not uh yeah you did all right good that's good all right uh is that the pod that's the pod [Music] foreign [Music]

I will say like the show came out it was number nine on all of Netflix the first day number six the next day and like the reception has been insane like way bigger than I ever thought like how many how many messages are you getting oh dude I've given up on like like I usually get about uh a thousand to two thousand messages a day just generally like including DMS emails everything because I'm on my newsletter and all this stuff it when I open up Instagram in the morning it just keeps refreshing like over and over in my DMs [Music] ramit what's going on man we're live what's up Sam for me from how to teach I will I will teach how to teach what am I saying why can't I think of the name of your is this your intro you're giving me you don't even know the name of my company you better try that again I will teach you to be rich you know why I confuse it all times because one of my favorite books of all time is Felix Dennis's uh and I always confuse you YouTube his is how to get rich well right well you want to know something even more confusing my new Netflix show is now called how to get rich dude what's going on what's up so you just had a show come out two days ago or three days ago right yep how's it been are you like have you noticed that like the revenue of your business or the podcast downloads that you have are they going up uh the reception is like out of control like I'll I'll give you the numbers but like I thought I thought shows great I did not expect for it to be top 10 on Netflix um the number of emails I've gotten I just gave up on even being able to be on top of my DMs it's just wild podcast numbers um right now the podcast is number 12 on all of Apple um I'm very proud to say we have displaced Ben Shapiro so you know one bigot at a time we're gonna take it down and uh um number of social media followers is fantastic just like the best part of all is people are posting pictures from their family rooms all over the world and it's like you can tell a lot by seeing a family room you know you can tell just a ton about someone's life and then you see the same show in every one of those photos it's it's kind of like Cosmic it's like humanity is all watching the same thing which is pretty cool you uh what percentage increase of uh downloads per episode has your pod gone from that well it hasn't even been out a week so I can't even tell you yet but well you could look at your current your current numbers can't you of the podcast I don't know I guess I'm not as sophisticated as you yeah yeah I mean I would have thought that you know how to log into things but yeah I understand I I guess I overestimated your ability uh what wasn't I can only be good at a couple of things and then the rest I'm pretty deficient at them so I've known you were meat for a while now and I've been following you for it feels like a decade I don't remember what year you started doing it but it feels like you've been I mean you've been you were like one of the OG bloggers so like basically I started about 20 years ago oh it was 20 years ago wow so basically I know my best friend is Neville I met him because I was a fan of his blog and I found his blog because of Noah kagan's blog I found Noah kagan's blog because of probably like Tim Ferriss and then I probably found Tim Ferriss because of you it was like this Illuminati of like businessy Financial bloggers but a little bit lifestyle and you've been doing that you're like the OG I remember you like would teach classes like you wrote a blog post you would like you hung up flyers on the Stanford campus you're like I'm gonna do uh uh personal finance class or something like that and then that kind of like parlayed into one thing which led to another thing now you've got this pretty big business I've talked to a lot of people who work for you it's a pretty like amazing company that you built then you came out with podcast and you told me you're going to come out the podcast and I was like okay this sounds interesting you're a little late to the game you've been doing this for 20 years let's see your podcast is actually amazing you did something that I've always wanted to do but I didn't think people would do it so basically you could explain it but you like tell or people tell you all of their finances and they put their faces on the videos so like it's not really Anonymous then you parlayed that into you've had a you know all these books along the way you've parlayed that into just a brand new Netflix show that's now one of the most popular in the country I mean you've done a lot of stuff right uh I love your intro it's like better than any intro I can give myself so thank you it sounds so linear the way you say it like I sat at a chess board and just like mapped it out but if you go into the the details of it like it's actually crazy for example yeah I did hang up flyers and I did try to get my friends in the dining halls in college to come to my free event and nobody came for like a year and a half nobody would come to my events like I would struggle to get people to come to get a free class on money and I you know I got like a handful of people over a year and a half and the reason for that I later learned is that people don't really like going to events about money it makes them feel bad about themselves and so I was like okay you know when you're young and you're like really hungry you go this isn't working like the world needs to hear what I have to say and so like you can either give up and sometimes you should or in my case I was like these kids are so lazy they don't even want to come to a free class I'm just going to start a blog and so that that's the path it wasn't like flyers and then Netflix show there's like a lot of um trying and failing in between the two but so you're only in your 20s when you're teaching that I mean what the hell did you know about money um I had gotten pretty good at money actually so I started uh my dad uh you know came from India as my mom did and my dad it's pretty pretty actually Savvy with money he got me to open up a Roth IRA when I was like 14 15 years old he helped me do it with a custodial account and I took my scholarship money which I got for college that first check and I put in the stock market and I thought it was a genius 1999 everybody's so cool and uh I lost half of that pretty fast um funny enough though I kept investing because I was working at a pizza place I was doing some sales thing and so I was investing I used to think investing meant picking stocks so I bought three stocks when I was in high school one of them excite at home bankrupt another one jdsu why the hell was I buying telecom stocks I don't know bankrupt and then a third stock of a little company called amazon.com which I've held since then and it's like awesome now the lesson for that everybody listening everyone goes oh that's so cool ramit so cool I just got to pick the next Amazon and Sam and I go no you don't you're never gonna pick the next Amazon that was complete luck do not do that strategy and the real the real lesson there is don't try to pick individual stocks pick a nice Target date fund or index fund and then let it ride and you will have more money than you know what to do with of course that's you and me if Sean were here he would be telling us about some crypto [ __ ] that we talked about last time which of course went down by 65 and before we continue I'd just like to give a big shout out to all the people on YouTube from the last episode we did who they didn't like me very much you know they're the crypto guys you saw the comment I [ __ ] read every comment dude I love it and they go this guy's such an old fuddy duddy and what I really want to do Sam is come on here and and let's go to the comment section and just see what happened to all these folks who lost 60 of their money I wonder if they're I wonder if they think the same thing yeah anyway it was a fun episode last time we uh did I don't know if you heard the episode I always give Sean a hard time because his opinion in my opinion on investing are totally opposites but not totally opposites but we agree uh we disagreeing a lot but on the pot I was going Sean so look if I made a bet with you or like if I was a genie and I said you can only you can start your own company and invest your own money in your own company but you can't buy crypto you can't invest in startups you can't do any like cash flowing things you can't do anything all you could do is put it into this one thing we'll call it an index fund but whatever it is and you get a regular return of eight percent a year now it's regular it's not you know the theoretical bit is that it's eight percent but it's right it's lumpy but let's just say eight percent every single year but you can't you can't invest in anything else other than your business would you do that and he was like 100 absolutely not and in my head I'm like dude that's like the greatest thing on Earth what are you talking about that's the greatest thing okay I heard that episode I was laughing so hard I loved it actually it's fun to hear two people with totally different opinions I I will say although I'm like you I'm a huge fan of index funds and average returns of seven to eight percent are actually phenomenal if you understand compound interest and time that is a lot of money does eight percent double in nine years approximately so 72 divided by your return rate if we say 10 nominal it's about every seven to ten years it doubles so yeah you're right in the range and that doesn't sound like a lot if you're putting in like a thousand dollars two thousand dollars but what people forget is that you don't just put money in once you keep contributing so it's like you've got a A Train That's going faster and faster and you're pushing the train it starts to go really and at a certain point you can't stop the train it's humongous so um anyway I love hearing the back and forth I personally was 100 with you I'm like eight percent all day baby I love average returns that's fantastic but you know some people they think differently or they get a thrill from investing I don't get a thrill from investing I get a thrill from staying in luxury hotels that's what I love but my investing is very boring well so my money right now I basically have um you know I sold my company to HubSpot stock and a lot of that was HubSpot stock how much did you sell it for Sam you're gonna tell us uh no uh I I don't like about it Sam's so transparent with every other number on this show except for how much money is in his bank account Sam what's up with that the reported number was 27 million and uh you know it was more or less it was it was right around there but here's the thing is that no I'm gonna I'll reveal it a little bit here's the thing which is the sale I received a whole bunch of HubSpot stock and six months or you guys can I think we sold February of two years ago so you guys can go look at it I think the stock was 367 when we sold and then over the next year as a bunch of my stock was like you know I got it monthly or quarterly or something like that as I was getting it it almost tripled so or doubled and a half so it went up from 367 I think to 870 and so the price like kind of materially changed of course then it went back down to like 300 and now it's back up but um so the the price materially changed because of that but here's the deal so I own HubSpot stocks I haven't sold a share I didn't sell it when it was at its peak I was like I'm just never gonna log in and look at it we own Airbnb stock because my wife worked there and or works there and we we got a bunch of that and then besides that I just own like the normal 80 20 uh whatever I don't even know what what it's called the normal Vanguard index fund and then like some type of like you know bonds whatever's the the normal bonds besides that it then there's a little bit of real estate uh but besides that it's like nothing I don't really own any I've never actually sold the stock in my life um that's awesome that's awesome I think it's awesome so many of my friends mocked me it is awesome no no no no they don't know what they're talking about they see they get the thrill out of tweaking their asset allocation and I go listen if it's a thrill to you great but if they actually understood how much it truly cost them they would be shocked you actually deeply understand personal finance so you know that kind of like making turkey dinner for Thanksgiving once you put in the oven you let that thing cook do not fiddle around with it you're just messing it up but it's really hard even for super smart people especially entrepreneurs who love control they really feel the need to fiddle around and it's so counterproductive with investing so you said something I totally agree with you you said something awesome on your show which is people confuse I forget how you phrased it but you said something about making money versus managing money and when I first started making money I was like oh great now I now I'm very confident I feel like I'm pretty good at making money I'm in the 99 percentile of income like making income and then I was like well that's pretty easy I could do this real estate thing and I can do this deal and this thing and then I started getting into it and I'm like [ __ ] I'm not great at that because I'm creative and I can invent things from scratch but when it comes to investing that's not always it's more about like due diligence and about uh like uh uh running Financial like for a real estate company oftentimes is more close to just being really good at Excel than it is like you know inventing something from scratch and you said that on the show the other day when I was watching and I I thought that was like amazing and I didn't actually learn that until I made a few expensive mistakes of managing versus making oh that's cool yeah that's totally true and I think there's three there's making managing and spending all three very distinct skills and everybody primarily focuses on the first making money I understand why people want to make more money the managing money feels very dry and therefore people are incentivized and driven to make it sexy and mess up and do things and then spending no one really consciously thinks about you know I always say people everybody teaches us how to save nobody teaches us how to spend meaningfully so those three models would be good if anyone's really thinking about how to live a rich life specifically around their money it's like think about those three models and think about what it would take to be really good for each I don't I'm not good at the spending thing and like there's been multiple times where I've called you and I'm like I'm gonna go to Europe and you go oh I'll I'll tell you what to do but only one rule no budget or I'll be like I want to dress better and you say great I have a list of cool stores one rule no budget and yeah you're pretty dogmatic on a handful of things and you're someone to you to you I wouldn't say that to a school teacher I say to a rich dude who sold his company for a lot of money so I go listen if you're gonna be if you're gonna be looking at the price tags and and you're going to be looking through the money lens of cost imagine you put on a pair of glasses and it's cost I go I'm not doing that with you you're too rich you can't be looking at Cost there are other money lenses for a guy like you to use which is totally appropriate but when did you feel comfortable spending late 20s I started to make it a practice to get good I'll give you an example because Fitness we both love Fitness dude I follow all your videos I'm like this guy what are you doing the combine or something that was hilarious so Sam Sam's posting all this like insane stuff he's doing like 60 inch vertical jump or whatever it it's like crazy your squats are like out of this world I'm like God this guy how does he do it anyway you know I had to have a little fun with Sam so I go hey Sam nice uh 375 squat watch you try practicing for a spelling bee [Laughter] I called you a douche and everyone thought we were actually angry at each other yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so but but you've always been comfortable I mean like dude I just feel guilty buying a two thousand dollar like jacket and also it doesn't necessarily bring me joy which is a whole other thing but I also definitely feel a sense now yeah that's like I think value uh that's viable or that's a valid thing but I don't I don't I feel guilty you don't have guilt around somebody's spending no never let's talk about why so when I was in my late 20s I was like okay I want to learn how to get fit I never knew about Fitness when I was young we didn't even use the word protein in my house like we it was not a thing really yeah no like that's if you told my my parents that a Coca-Cola has 40 grams of sugar they'd be like you might as well tell me there's a billion grams because I don't know what that means you know what I mean like that means yeah okay so same so so now I'm like really confused because I'm like how does Sam look so good if he didn't even like protein I learned like what age uh well I was a college athlete but and so I knew about Fitness and then once I started uh once I left college and got fat uh then I married a woman who like cared about this stuff and she kind of like taught me she's like hey you know just because it says low fat that doesn't mean that that's good for you and I was like oh it true or okay that's why men live longer yeah I was like the Sleep gym is me like it's good for you this is keto right like I didn't know you know what I mean it's like yogurt is yogurt therefore it's good totally okay so when I I didn't even like I didn't have the college athlete thing I did you know I did well in school or whatever but um when I when I graduated I said I wanna start like getting fit and it was like my mid-20s I had a friend at work I was like dude can you show me how to like work out so I was pretty skinny I was a really skinny guy and you hear clues in the world whether it's with work or with Fitness or whatever the world gives you Clues as to where you stand and that can be true even in meetings like if somebody shows up five minutes late repeatedly that's a clue maybe you're lower on the power totem pole and you've kind of got to learn to read the clues to know where you stand and I remember multiple people when I was in college calling me skinny now as a guy that's actually not a good thing to be called at least I didn't like it and so I just thought I'm genetically skinny you know that's just how I am skinny Indian guy ha ha ha but I didn't want to do it anymore and so a friend of mine showed me how to work out and he was like okay do you like to eat um like spaghetti I was like yeah he's like do you like bread I was like yeah he's like do you like milk I was like okay he goes hmm yeah you need to eat all of that and I was like huh and that that was just like oh what I thought I was doing was actually not getting me the goals I wanted so I started to eat more I actually started to track it and I realized what I thought I was eating was totally off base just common for all of us um but it took me until my late 20s when I moved to New York and I get there and like everyone looks great yeah just everybody looks good fashion wise Fitness I'm like did everyone attend a class that I was absent for how the hell does everybody know how to hem their pants correctly and so I lived right by a gym it took me four months to get the courage to walk into that gym and say I want a personal trainer it had nothing to do with money I had money but I knew that once I said that I would actually have to follow through and so I finally got the courage four months I walk across the street go in the gym pick this guy the random trainer who happened to be walking by he was actually great strength trainer and I ended up training with him for about five years and I learned so much before I switched over to bodybuilding and training a little different but that that was like starting to pay for value and I realized oh my God they're you can get better results you can get faster results sometimes if you pay for a different restaurant you get a better experience and that was important to me while at the same time there are other things I just don't care about and I don't pay for it at all on the show there was there's this couple they're like maybe only 38 or 39 they're but there are grandparents I forget their names um yeah Monique and Donnell yeah and I and they're very likable but I got so angry watching them because on the show they you sit and I I hate this experience that what you what you did with these people because it happens to me sometimes they sat down and they expressed everything they want in life or at least everything they want help from and they say we struggle with this and you say all right here's the plan does everyone agree to the plan and they go yes we totally agree to this plan this will help us get to where we want to go that plan includes selling a whole bunch of stuff from a storage unit it includes not spending a certain amount of money and so not buying I think he was spending 500 or 600 a month on video games or something crazy and then you fast forward two weeks later and he orders this big box and they open the box and there's literally like eight pairs of jeans and like a hundred and twenty dollar pair of shoes and you're like what the hell man we you said you wanted this and we agreed that the actions are this and and then he tries to like justify he goes but I need these jeans and there's literally eight pairs of them then there's this other woman who has this 1.1 million dollar house she goes I'm I'm you know my kids are grown now I don't need this huge house I'm gonna sell it and get a smaller house just because I don't want to take care of this fast forward a few weeks later she sold the house she went and bought a 2.2 million dollar house that's even bigger and she goes yeah but I need this and yeah it pissed me off so much that these people were doing this and I was like what the hell guys where's the discipline in this and I think that that's like a huge difference between like some people and other people that like achieve certain things I just want to like nail it in their heads like you guys you realize how like you're you're a hypocrite to yourself right now uh you know what I mean uh well I so I'll tell you you know when I was in my early 20s starting with my you know showing people how to invest and stuff I was super judgmental like super and it's like oh my God like you need to open up a Roth IRA do you understand how seven percent compounds and I could actually see people's eyes glaze over I could basically see their soul leave their body I'm just like oh this isn't connecting but I didn't know how to read the clues I thought if I push him harder if I show them another chart they'll get it um and I can tell you that that doesn't work and so when you're saying that you hated this I'm actually smiling because I kind of love that I love when people say one thing and do another because to me it's like that beautiful contradiction of humanity all of us say we want something and we do something different and to me it's like a puzzle okay I know that you're doing that in the domain of money I totally get it I've seen it a million times so how can I figure out a way to reach you which gets you to see the contradiction and change your behavior not me to impose it on you totally different View and I think much more effective that's what you see on the show yeah well you're a patient and like it just but it's still it angered me because I liked them they're very likable and you want them to win it's like ramit show it's kind of like Queer Eye For The Straight Guy but for like money like you like root for like it's like oh we're going from uh Zero to Hero or like we're taking like someone who's like you know cute but you know we take the glasses off and all of a sudden she's a model you know what I mean it's like like a like a high school movie but like you root for them but I'm like you guys this is so obvious these mistakes that you're making it's angering me this is gonna make you not achieve what you want to achieve and that like irked me so much watching that not Earth but it frustrated me well I like that I like I want you and I want all the millions of people watching it to feel something and that that alone is a win because money we don't usually feel anything except overwhelm and shame so I like that you're watching this and going God it's so obvious now I will say you have built discipline over like decades yeah you have been practicing at it right for a long time some of us don't even grow up with discipline in our lives like I grew up with discipline around reading a spelling book literally for two and a half hours a day I I could do that and I did very well at that but the discipline to be empathetic I didn't really grow up with that I was like a utilitarian type of guy so I think that it's fun to watch them at like it's fun to watch people have to find their own path to get where they're going and you know what people are people some people do it some people don't that's kind of the beauty of humanity not everyone is going to succeed and that's that's how it goes the other interesting thing was the same couple that I'm referring to they had this so these folks I think their annual and their household income maybe was 90 grand a year and this woman about that this woman quit her job to this woodworking thing which is awesome but they had this storage unit that I think cost 400 a month and we open up the storage unit and it's sorry folks if you're listening it's garbage it was like an old used microwave it was like plastic like toys and like containers from Target like it was just junk like the amount at which they probably spent in two months was worth more than the entire stuff and it was like dude why aren't you selling this microwave and he goes well I need it and it that and that also bothered me because dude Americans have so much crap this this couple I think is very is very normal is very average and I was shocked at how much stuff people have and it made me want to go through my closet and just get rid of everything I'm like dude we don't need any of his junk not only does it not make you happy it brings you down it was just so much stuff was that normal that you said people with so much stuff yeah okay so I had never gone into people's houses until a few years ago with my business and I had had offers from producers and stuff to go into someone's house but it was always this sort of like go into this couple's house and then like finger wag at them and tell them all the things they're doing wrong it's just not my vibe I don't want to do that I'd actually ask him like what do you love spending on let's go do more of that come on you want a nice bag cool let me show you how to get more and finally there was a producer who is a friend of mine and she said like come on you really got to come out this one's special so they drove me to New Jersey and I went into this young woman's apartment it was a new apartment complex very nice he had a Jeep outside and the minute she opened the door I thought to myself I should have done this 10 years ago because you can tell so much by going into the entryway of someone's house okay at the time I was living in Manhattan most of my friends had somewhat similar Apartments to me we kind of live in a similar way when I walked into her apartment there were beautiful candles like nice diptyque style Candles there were probably 15 or 20 of them those are very expensive so I'm taking it in okay cool she loves Candles there was a gigantic TV okay that's pretty interesting uh and I asked her to pull up on her phone and read off the top 10 emails in her inbox it was like Target Pier One you know whatever stores this starts to tell you a lot about someone it's basically Clues and like you may see a living room I see how much percentage of her net income is going to fix costs and I'm able to start to figure out what's really going on with her um with folks like on the show you can totally see the amount of stuff people have and after a while that stuff starts to control them when I ask people like what's your rich life almost nobody says a bunch of ten dollar items from Target I can guarantee that they might say I love a beautiful sweater I love trips with my kids Etc I go cool let's spend more on that and let's cut back on the stuff that you don't care about and that really resonates with people yeah it's just like I I've grew up in Missouri I grew up with in a very normal household all my friends growing up are normal and then I go back and I look at like how I grew up and where my friend like oh my God like my parents have a stereo that still has a cassette tape player like and I don't think they've turned this on in 15 years and it's like I'm like hey Mom and Dad you should throw that away it doesn't even work and they go oh but you know we're gonna I'm like you guys you don't have a tape you don't even have a cassette yeah play anything this is a great it's a great lesson is we have to be very very conscious of the things we buy because once they come into our home and once they become part of our identity it is almost impossible to get rid of them and everyone listening is like oh yeah those those people why don't they just get rid of and I'm going just look in your closet you know my wife is a personal stylist she goes in people's closets she helps them do closet cleanses she does all their image and stuff like that she will show me how many trash bags she fills with clothes to be donated sometimes it's a small closet six trash bags one client I think 40 bags that were taken out and donated it is really hard to get rid of stuff that's why I you know for me I go I'm gonna be super careful about what I bring into my house clothes Electronics whatever when I get it I want it to be the best and then when I get the best I want to keep it for a long period of time like you don't have to do the same but I would say develop your philosophy as to what you're gonna buy and how long you're gonna to keep it for otherwise you're just going to end up inundated with a bunch of junk we had um Neil Patel in the Pod and he like people got so angry at him because he goes I spend I think he said he spends 200 000 a month in monthly expenses and he broke that down and then we had another person come on and do the same thing I think um I think I spend me personally I think I don't have a kid um I think we spend 20 to 30 000 a month and I remember like when I was 22 starting my company I spent two grand a month including a rat like nothing and I remember thinking like if 20 grand a month I I can't even I can't even imagine what I would spend with 20 grand a month now that I spend 20 or 30 a month I think oh yeah I could make a dent with 100 Grand a month like that I could I I could I could use that anything above that I actually think it's challenging but maybe I'll find my way one day how much do you think you spend a month and have you found thresholds of like this doesn't feel any better than this lower number oh this is a great question um well I think that thresholds are to me less interesting than what are the things that I love to spend a lot of money on and what are the things I don't care about and I'm like extremely polarized and I actually want everyone to be polarized so for me the worst is if people go I spend a little bit here I spend a little bit there or I try to cut back five percent here and five percent there I'm just like that sucks that's not an effective strategy and it's not even fun so you said this concept of you you say don't do five dollar problems do thirty thousand dollar problems I think is that right don't ask three dollar questions ask thirty thousand dollar questions and people go like what are you talking about I go let me explain most people agonize over coffee and can I get an extra dessert and I go that's irrelevant if you want to buy a coffee or two go ahead that makes no material effect on your finances over the long term but thirty thousand dollar questions are things like what's my savings rate for example do I save and invest uh 12 per year okay great what if my partner and I make a agreement every year we're going to increase that number by one percent if you just made that decision alone that's worth hundreds of thousands of dollars okay more than all the coffee you'll ever buy in your life combined what's my asset allocation that's a 300 000 question uh what is my debt payoff date if you have debt I guarantee you do not know the exact month and year you're going to pay it off you should know that so for my spending I love talking about this because I always encourage people to to come up with their money dial what is the thing you love spending on should we just do this right now yeah yeah let's do this with you Sam okay what is your what what do you love spending on what's the one thing uh flying first class uh so when I when I fly when I fly I like to if it's above three hours I it's first class uh I don't care I love it I don't I don't like fancy hotels but I like nice airbnbs because I like Apartments over like a smaller uh Hotel uh I like spending on um like when I like to go out to eat I love leaving huge tips so if it's a good service I like doing like 100 tips love it I like toys So like um four-wheelers and motorcycles I love Action Sports and things like that what else do I like and I like service you got your gym yeah I got my gym so yeah so a gym would be somewhat like a toy but I love services so I spend 400 a month for a trainer I spend another 600 a month for like a doctor who I can just ask uh like or sorry nutritionist so I can ask questions uh do a nutritionist uh cleaners someone to come and cook I love services and like an assistant someone who'll uh do my laundry like all types of services but not too many uh things love it okay great so I think for everyone listening let's let's highlight a couple things on that first question play along with us so what is the thing you love spending money on most people's answer is eating out that's the number one money dial number two is travel number three is health and wellness number four is convenience you basically have like all of those but that makes a lot of sense you've been very successful financially so you've added money dials most people start with eating out okay fine pick one of your money dials which you would say is the one that gets you super pumped super excited services so convenience great love it I'm the same convenience is my money dial I love it I'm obsessed with it people think like I'm a serial killer when they hear how I dial all my stuff in but like I don't care that's what I love okay here's the question number two if you were to quadruple the amount you spent on that money dial what would your life look like and feel like uh I think it would actually be awesome so like for example right now I have a service that does my laundry and brings it to my door and then I have uh this wonderful woman who cleans my house but she doesn't put my laundry away and so what I would love to do is just say hey I'll pay you more money just make sure that my closet is always organized and my clothes are put away because my clothes will just leave stay like nicely folded on the floor in my closet so small things like that or or uh uh like if my dog goes to the bathroom outside like I sometimes I'll forget to clean it up and then I'll realize there's a bunch of it I'm like oh I gotta go clean it up it's nice to have someone to come and just handle all of that so someone just to handle all types of cleaning and uh organizing my house I would love that okay I think I like your answers but I think you got to dream a little bigger you could get all that with like 100 bucks a week everybody everybody look at Sam's face he's like lost right now go ahead I'm gonna take you with me on this I think I'm quite bad at like dreaming big yes that's why I'm here all right so I'd say what do we do now what else would you do I said quadruple not at a hundred dollars a week um I would have an assistant come to my home twice a week and we would go through my to-do list love it what else think about traveling think about cleaning your car think about uh how you uh travel with your family um it would be awesome to fly private occasionally with my whole nucleus fan my nuclear family and who would coordinate all of that right now me well not in this quadruple scenario I'm going to say Amanda me and my family want to go from St Louis to New York around this date hook it up there's gonna be eight of us just tell me when to show up or have a car there love it love it and then um you mentioned that you love tipping which I love too I am a huge fan of huge tips I've told people like part of your rich life very likely should be generosity how would that fit in like the person who cleans your house what might you do in terms of spending more there um I would probably so like over Christmas I gave her a 200 bonus um I think it would have been cool to say here's a thousand dollars just thanks there you go all right love it this is awesome okay so for again for everybody listening the question is you already identified your money dial the thing you love now what if you could quadruple your spending now I'll tell you what I loved about Sam's answer and then I'll tell you what was different about Sam's answer than most people's answer so Sam was immediately like oh he knew exactly what he would do he's like my clothes sit on the floor of my closet which by the way is barbaric Sam that's so he goes I'm gonna get someone to hang them up okay great by the way I love that all I feel like most of my friends my closest friends are Indians the Indians I don't friends with like Neville they're always Immaculate there's never clubs of course there's never clutter oh yeah well yeah and they their clothes are yeah well it's that thank you for saying that Immaculate I love that I'll take that the immaculate I was just at Neville's house today and I'm like Neville you never have clutter you just it's always everything's perfect wow Neville my man okay he's gonna be so happy to hear this man it's like two people talking about you behind your back and actually saying nice things no he's Immaculate that's the best okay what is different about Sam's answer than most people is that you know he's talking about fairly expensive things right private jet Etc now don't let that turn you off I'll tell you what the most common answer I get is I told you that people go eating out and I go okay if you could quadruple your spend which is why I call it a money dial you could turn that dial up like a cereal what would it look like and most people have the same linear answer they go well I'd probably have to go on a diet because I'd be eating out four times a week and I go and then I go Hey listen would you still eat at Chipotle and they're like they stop for a second and they go oh probably not it's a human tendency that we just take what we're doing and we do it times four same thing but linear and I want to stop them I want to dimensionalize it I go would you still eat at Chipotle they go no I go where would you eat and now they're thinking there's a guy in DC he goes I have a list of every michelin-starred restaurant I go who would you take with you and he gets very quiet he goes I take my family because they can't afford to eat at places like that and so when you're thinking about your rich life it's so important to understand where you are today what's important to you and if you can spend extravagantly on that thing what does it look like feel like smell like taste like because you need that crisp Vision otherwise what are you working for why are you going to invest and save and once you have that Vision I want to take my family to New York I want us to go to Central Park and all have a picnic there and you can see what you're going to eat and what you're gonna do and it's just like so beautiful it smells fresh in the fall that's when it becomes much easier for me to say okay we know you want to spend extravagantly on that now show me what you want to cut costs mercilessly on so that is the way that we start to craft a rich life what does your you know your the phrase like everyone thinks or a lot of people I imagine see I will teach you to be rich and they think this guy's a douche and then whenever you change it and you say wait hold on I've never I've never heard anyone say that that's actually well I'm just kidding yeah they go they go yeah the number one way people introduce me on Reddit is they go hey uh you should read this guy's book it's called I will teach bridge I know it sounds like a huge scam but it's actually not and I you know it's been 20 years or whatever 10 years I go all right fine I accept it well you come up with this good line that is 100 redeems yourself which is it's about living like what's your rich life which is totally great because you're like no it's money's a component but like your rich life could be anything and so that's actually quite redeeming your rich life you said is like convenience so what is your like I don't know how do we say this without sounding lame your convenient stack like what is your what is your like okay what's that look like and what's and what's your budget for that I have an unlimited budget companies that are important to me quit yanking my leg quit being academic how much do you spend a month for like this amazing setup well I don't first of all I don't think on a monthly basis so you know I don't want anyone to be thinking on a monthly basis except for your conscious spending plan so in order to have a bigger perspective you think on an annual perspective minimum so for me I would spend uh uh well if I factor it all in probably hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on convenience so it's 300 take it down for you it's 300 000 or the right number or is it on the upper side of that it's hard to say let me give you an example like if I stay at an amazing hotel which I love would that be part of convenience it's quite pricey or would it be part of like luxury or experience I don't know but I'll tell you like the big components of it so I want to wake up in the morning and I want every single thing in its place so much so that if I go blind I know exactly where everything is so that means my food is ready that means that my calendar invitations have the link in the same place which takes me to the exact same thing it's all convenience my meetings are scheduled um when I travel I have an assistant who's amazing um when I travel to a W-2 employee or or okay W-2 um a very experienced seasoned executive assistant who knows how to work with other Executives who knows how to work with everybody in my life um so she would be responsible for everything from day-to-day meetings scheduling haircuts um complex uh travel planning interacting with a travel advisor things like that and she knows my preferences so we documented all she knows if I'm flying a four-hour flight this is the type of seat this is the exact seat I'm going to sit on and what I love about having an assistant is they become your basically your spokesperson or your right hand person and so they have to be able to interact with people at CEO levels and at every level um so that that's super important for me um when we when I travel I have a travel protocol it gets activated so it means like she will handle my email a little differently if I go if I'm going somewhere I'll have food sent ahead to the hotel if I'm staying in certain locations so it's like healthy food I can try to stay on plan as much as possible uh things like that so we over time we just document it and it just becomes like part of an sop didn't you have like a program on like working with someone uh like yeah I still have it it's called delegate and done and this is like how to hire an assistant like the 35 Plus things that my assistant does and actually how to run our meetings like exactly how we run our weekly check-in meetings um yeah we have all that stuff all templates it's awesome I'm gonna buy this this is good all right what else we'll give you a link for the show notes but that's for people who are like I want assist a smoothie running system I want an assistant who's smart I'm not looking for the cheapest I'm looking for the best and I want to empower them to be able to handle everything for me that that's awesome what else um uh what else is there um oh training so I have a personal trainer um he's awesome and like I go there and train with him we have goals for the show for example I knew exactly what I wanted to look like and um it was funny because I went in to get fitted for some clothes my wife was styling me and I went in and I was like okay this is the size I'm gonna be and I was way bigger than that size at that time were you were either flat or muscle uh a little of both I was bulking so I was more muscle but I still had put on some fat and I knew I was gonna start cutting um and they were like trying to be very polite to me but they were like um we would recommend you don't go uh like that small and I was like listen I'm a professional and I know exactly what I'm gonna and they were like trying to be really polite about it but I could see them exchanging glances with each other I was dying I was loving it because you know everyone says that like when you're going in for a wedding fitting or whatever you're like yeah I'm gonna lose like 15 pounds and like no one does so they're like of course I'm not telling you to lose weight but step on the scale and subtract 15 and just be that yeah yo I was laughing so hard because my wife we've like we've trained and like we know what you know kind of what we trained for our wedding for example so we know the process and I was very confident my trainer is awesome Etc and so um I went back in for the the first fitting nobody believed me I was like just do what I said please and then I came in for the next fitting and I wanted to play a trick on him so I was like from the fitting room I was like oh my God this doesn't fit at all but it actually like everything fit perfectly and so that is an example where like getting help right for convenience for what's the look what's the training protocol that kind of stuff is is important was it uh what's filming the show what you thought it was going to be I mean what's Sean's always wanted to have a Netflix show uh what I mean what what do people oh I should talk to him about it yeah um okay so I have filmed before like in in a studio with my crew things like that this was completely different like it was on a whole nother level so I'll give you some examples um the week before the show started filming they finally found an office in La literally one seven days before and they designed it and they were like come on in and walk through it and give us your feedback on the design so first of all they designed it in 24 hours that means they took a blank office and put a full design in there so I walked in and I was like uh it looks like a white person is selling their Airbnb like it has like all geometric shapes on the like wood I'm like no it's not me like a live laugh love sign like a neon sign yes exactly I was like uh simplified so then yeah uh yeah exactly work and I was like we're not doing this no not for a in Netflix show so then they were like oh well do you have any suggestions for us of course I had a Pinterest board of like interior design home offices that I pulled out and my style is wood Stone Japanese design minimalism and basically like an unlimited budget and they took one look at that and they just started laughing because they're like dude what are you talking about we have a budget and we have like two days to finish this office so anyway we hashed it out we came up with something that I think looks pretty good and when I went in the first day the crew when I'm shooting just in an office which is a totally controlled environment there could have been like 30 people that is huge multiple cameras sound producers makeup it's embarrassing uh uh like having a yeah it's like it's like a performing it's like you're acting really not just like shoot the [ __ ] or not shoot the [ __ ] you know whatever you do when you normally record you're like having a conversation with someone dude if 30 people around me I would be like dude I feel like a like an animal in the zoo yeah well it's funny you say that I like day to day doing like what we're doing right now I love it I feel really comfortable chatting with you or doing an Instagram thing but being in the Limelight especially in public or for things like my birthday I have never felt comfortable I like I actually dread it and even for for my four yeah for my 40th birthday I was dragging my feet like dragging it even though it's like rich life and like I always love bringing my friends and family together and my wife noticed this and she's like like what is wrong with you and I go I don't know I was so indecisive she goes do you want me to just plant it for you and when she said that was like the magic words like yes please because this one thing in my life I just feel so uncomfortable doing and once she started to do it like it all took off I was thrilled um so this show was like for the first few days I felt a little uncomfortable the other unexpected part was um going to people's houses okay people open up their houses it's the most intimate thing you can do in America is to open up your home and talk about money like most more Americans would be comfortable talking about their sex lives than their credit card debt that's actually research and so to really know how to make people feel comfortable with a camera crew and producers and all that that that took some learning but overall I thought the crew was amazing they really helped me feel good and and kind of come into my own do you get paid directly to do it or are you hoping that like the is this just marketing for everything else you do I get paid I get paid as um Talent which is what they call somebody who would be a host so Hollywood term is talent and then I'm also an EP or executive producer on the show as well so that's great there is yeah yeah and will they fill you in on how many people watched it or is Netflix I think they're like notorious for not like telling you stuff right correct they they there are some uh things that they release but they don't typically share actual numbers um I will say like the show came out it was number nine on all of Netflix the first day number six the next day and like the reception has been insane like way bigger than I ever thought like how many how many messages are you getting oh dude I've given up on like like I usually get about uh a thousand to two thousand messages a day just generally like including DMS emails everything because I'm on my newsletter and all this stuff it when I open up Instagram in the morning it just keeps refreshing like over and over in my DMs and I'm like what am I supposed to do with this I don't even know you um you uh have been like on I've noticed on Twitter we've been friends for a while on Twitter you've become more polarizing and I have a feeling that part of that is on purpose is that true like you mean polarizing because of politics yeah but also like for example I agree with you for the home so like you and I agree that buying a home you should do it because you want it not because it's a good investment because the numbers show it's actually not a good investment it could be a good investment but that's mostly Lux every once in a while but do it because you want to and at best assume it's a great store of value but it's not necessarily going to be like a wonderful return you know uh but like you'll tweet like look at this I think you'll say like look at this [ __ ] they think X Y and Z one of these idiots gonna believe this no no no hold on I do not say that but I do not say that I would never call someone you say that about political stuff you say that about political stuff sorry I I but but you are harsh on the home buying thing and you're also harsh on other topics you're not harsh on uh that thing uh the home buying thing but you're like you will call people morons or mostly political stuff I think but uh okay I I guess I have something against right-wing extremism so yeah I'm pretty straightforward and direct about that which is like I don't accept it and like [ __ ] that and if people and I talk about raising taxes on the rich including me I go yeah we should I should I pay historically low taxes we should and people are kind of shocked when they hear a guy with money going oh I actually enjoy paying my taxes I feel really good about them and we should uh actually raise taxes people like what the hell they also feel shocked when they hear a money Guy saying like buying a house actually might not be the best investment so it's funny I will say like when I talk about real estate I definitely mix it up and sometimes people will go like remit you're so negative about buying a house and I go the fact that you think my advice which is run the numbers on the biggest purchase of your life is negative tells you how far the Overton window has shifted that if someone says you should actually calculate the biggest purchase of your life that's being negative I go no no no no no no no no you have to run the numbers and as you and I know Sam a lot of times it's like not that great of an investment index funds could often not always but often outperform more often so more often yeah depending on the city and like for for everybody listening I lived in I've rented for uh about 20 years I have made more money renting than I would have owning and I've rented in San Francisco New York La in New York for example I kept a very close eye on the real estate market it would have cost me 2.2 times more to own the equivalent unit same neighborhood same view same size same number of bedrooms 2.2 times and so if it was a three thousand dollar apartment it would have cost like 62 6400 a month when you factor in all the Phantom cost interest opportunity cost maintenance I just took the 3200 I just put in the market and made way more money and less hassle but your political thing that's like on your list of things to do to stick out right you have a list here of how to stand out and you say unconditional unconventional decisions Stand Out talk politics yes talk about politics yes that's what I mean let's talk about it yeah yeah so I had this YouTube video I did many years ago which was like why I don't talk about politics I think it's still up on YouTube and I was like hey guys I am like uh you know I'm not gonna talk about it and I had my reasons and 2016 happened and I was like no way no [ __ ] way not in the country I grew up in where we have comments like let's ban Muslims until we figure out what's going on I go what the [ __ ] this is this is crazy I stop and you know what I studied in college right I studied propaganda social influence and persuasion Cults I studied that and I start to see the same Dynamics happening here I go if I can't speak up a first generation successful guy who was lucky and also worked hard became successful you know in in the ways business and all this stuff if I can't do it then who can't and so I started to do it and people flipped out the first few posts I made were like um stick to finance I go first of all they always are the same type of people who tell me this and and they expect because of the way I look they expect me to kind of roll over and be like oh sorry you're right you're right I come right back at him I go I'm not going to stick to anything this is my feed and I'll tell you exactly what's going on by the way I happen to know a little bit more about this than you and they are shocked shy and I post their comments to me it's quite uh Illuminating when you see so over the last like five six years I've actually had like thousands of conversations thousands of political conversations why because I actually don't get the chance to talk to people like this in real life people who go like um uh we should like cut all taxes taxes are theft and then I go like tell me why like what about the roads you drive on who should do that and I I really get to understand get inside their minds and sometimes I post the conversations because I want you to see a lot of people go we should like we should reason we should have conversations I go take a look at these conversations like I'm very patient with them but yeah I do think that um people are afraid to talk about their genuine Pol political beliefs or to say like this is actually wrong um because they're worried about what's going to happen to their business my business is based on my reputation and I go look if you're going to leave if if you don't agree that young people should have access to voting rights then don't buy my book I'm totally fine with you leaving my community and I believe that but you have a list of other things on here and some of the things I uh I wanted to talk about so what's the DNS list do not sell list and how does that make you stand up oh so well when you so let's the whole concept of standing out is the world wants you to be vanilla I saw that you start out your business have you noticed I see I say that line all the time on this yeah I appreciate you saying it okay thank you everyone make sure you hear that credit no I give credit but you you that line does the world wants you to be vanilla I use that all the time and I'm vanilla by the way I could say it no I don't actually I don't think so okay look vanilla means the world wants you to be like everybody else and it comes out in Peculiar ways right the world wants you to eat vanilla they go uh Sam you're throwing money away on rent you should buy a place vanilla and now for some people buying a house makes perfect sense but if you're 23 years old you don't know where you're going to be in three years it doesn't make any sense um the world wants you to be vanilla they tell me ramit you should stop cursing on your um YouTube videos I go but that's how I talk and sometimes I hear stuff that's crazy what do you want me to say you want me to stop because of the algorithm no I'm not living my life by an algorithm um the world wants you to be vanilla when they told me ramit you shouldn't sell programs that's scammy you should give it all away for free I go no this is a profitable business and I'm totally comfortable charging thousands of dollars for programs that are going to change your life start a business find a dream job one of the things we did was um we decided early on that we are going to be highly selective about who we allow to be our customers oh I remember highly selective yeah like a guy who was like I'm going into credit card debt buying your stuff and you go you're banned you can't buy your stuff anymore yeah I oh no I've banned thousands of people thousands the DNS list stands for do not sell and we have a very extensive list of people who we simply will not accept their money so policy number one is if you have credit card debt you cannot join our Flagship programs those are the expensive ones why two reasons one if if you actually understood how credit card interest rates work you would never spend two thousand dollars on a program you would pay your debt off first get financially comfortable right and then come back to us and two the type of people who join with credit card debt they often have a lot of pressure on like they go this has got to work I'm down to my last dollar I go no you can't make huge changes in life if you have that kind of pressure so slow it down here's a free chapter from my book and like please don't join come back when you're ready we'll be here if they still join and I think for any entrepreneur listening you don't have to do the same thing I do but the point is if you really Elevate yourself you go hey I'm spending tons of time building the best product or service in the world therefore I'm going to be selective about who I allow to join my business like Hermes very selective about who they allow to buy their birken back think about elevating yourself make sure that you're actually good enough to elevate yourself and then be selective it actually builds a much better and more profitable business you say uh don't be the first mover wait to write a book start making money follow your natural tendencies uh so for example I love slow long-term thinking um so that's what you're gonna do and you so you'd be horrible at starting clubs in Miami and then you have a framework of fast deep and long um what so if I I agree with the first mover thing the write a book thing I actually agree with too writing a book seems like a pain in the ass by the way and what start making money what do you mean well I think that sometimes we um people believe I need to build up like this huge long um audience before I start making money and that's actually what I did and I in retrospect it caused me a lot of hardship uh because I was writing for free in 2004 five six and when I finally sold something for five dollars is a 4.95 eBook I was petrified of selling I had a pretty decent sized audience and a lot of people got pissed off at me really mad because they basically saw me as the free information guy and when I tried to redefine the Dynamics of that relationship people do not like that it would have been much better if I'd started off and I was like hey this is actually going to be a business uh it would have taught me like focus on the metrics that matter focus on things that matter and it also would have set the expectation with my audience so I went through a lot like I went through two and a half three years of people unsubscribing for my list every day I was using aweber at the time so you can see see the reasons that they unsubscribe so every morning I woke up there's like 75 people they're like you suck yourself out and I was like wait what I still give away 98 of my stuff for free I'm selling a five dollar ebook and they were Furious and that was my fault not theirs our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better we I have so many people who ask me they're like I'm gonna do a newsletter when do I monetize I usually tell them or a podcast whatever I usually tell them I'm like this is a huge generalization but for a newsletter maybe when you're at five or ten thousand people then you could have an ad if you could have an ad in it if you're just selling like a product [ __ ] do it right away like day one have it in there yeah um and they're like I should do it that early won't I like turn off my audience I'm like no you won't but you need that money in order to do more [ __ ] and I'm like also if you turn off your audience doing this it's the wrong thing I remember Casey neistat Casey neistat um my favorite you know he's I love him he had uh this video where he said I was uh he talks about money and he goes I was like at Peak Fame in like 2016 and he goes I was still broke because even though I had even though I had all of these downloads and people thought I was famous I didn't have any money and he goes I thought I was being a cool artist by not having YouTube ads on but I went back and did the math that was like uh four or five million dollars a year that I was missing out on and I was [ __ ] broke and it I was an idiot and so if you're an artist out there don't be a fool take the money because then you could keep doing more art listen to Sam I wish I had learned that Sam like early on I didn't I had the same sort of thinking like oh my gosh monetizing will turn people off and what I didn't realize is first of all if you're turning them off by trying to make a living then you've got the wrong audience better to know that early than later and a lot of times people actually like it like they want to know what you recommend so that was interesting but most of all if you have money it enables you to Build a Better Business better people better design better Talent better all of it and I didn't get that for a few years I wish I had uh we'll wrap up in a second because I know you're we're at the hour but one last question which is uh sometimes people come to me and they'll be like you know my personal brand is really tied up in my company's brand and that will make it hard because maybe I want to sell my company so have you ever thought about selling I will teach you to be rich would you ever sell it and is it sellable being so tied to you I don't think it's sellable in the way that I would need to maintain my reputation I have had some interest in selling the business um I remember I got invited I was at a party in New York and this kind of mysterious guy comes up to me and he had a very generic name and he he was like oh nice to meet you but he knew a lot about my business like more than any normal person would know he knew like the way I structured my funnels he knew basic conversion rates I was like who in the hell is this guy he goes hey I'm gonna be in town in a couple weeks I'd love to get together for breakfast I was like cool so you know I was like pretty young guy I was working at a coffee shops stuff like that he invites me to the Four Seasons in Midtown for breakfast I was like what the hell you knew how to tickle your family man you like fancy hotels yeah I was like hmm okay let's go so we get there and uh it's four people including me at the table three other [ __ ] ambush so I was like cool like this is weird but like let's let's do I don't know what's going on here so I'm chatting with the guy he's very nice and one guy's uh kind of like silent and the other guy is sitting there with his arms Crossing just listening and I'm trying to figure out like what's the power Dynamic here what's going on and at one point one of the guys the guy with the crossed arms who wasn't saying much um he mentioned that he like vacations in North Carolina or something like that and I go oh like how far is the place from the airport I don't know why I asked that question but we're talking about it and he said something like oh it's like a five hour drive I go wow that's a long drive he goes oh I don't drive I take a helicopter Bingo oh got it okay God now I understand what's going on so they wanted to buy a percentage of the business over 50 percent and they wanted to you know basically hyper monetize it now my business could make a lot more money if I got more aggressive with my offers we don't really run Facebook ads so for us to win on Facebook we would need to get much more aggressive than we're willing to like I have a brand I have a reputation also I already have the name I will teach you rich I actually love when people come they expect to get this Hard Sell and they're like oh this guy went to Stanford he has a Netflix show like you can get his book A lot of it for free like it's you know it's it kind of you're like oh I'm surprised I didn't sell I told him Point Blank and I even thought to myself like what would I do with the money my life is great I had an assistant I had a trainer I was like I'm good like what am I gonna do with extra money I'm actually really glad I did not sell because the business went through a big growth spurt in the next few years but now I have the dream that I love I have a 100 bootstrap business I work from home my team is amazing and like I get to go on talk shows like this talk about my philosophy and then people email me with their success stories I'm like dude it does not get better than this I appreciate every day that I have this business is there any Financial or business goals that you have as a North star where you're like you know in 10 years it would be cool if we did this um I'm in a I guess I didn't expect Netflix to happen like I was not gutting for it it just happened so um I wanted to reach more people that was my goal and I've now reached more people in the last week than I have in probably 10 years which is like my I'm still trying to sit with that um so I probably need to recalibrate where I want to go but I'll tell you like one thing I know like from doing the podcast is uh when I started the podcast I sat down I wrote a vision document I never really do this and I wrote it because I knew that we were going to have to get a lot of people involved like uh editors and guests and everybody and I was like you know what I need to just write down my exact Vision so I was like here's what the podcast is here's 20 sample titles that I want to do here's the type of people here's what it's not it's not a podcast about compound interest calculations and when I wrote that I realized that the number one the podcast has to be fun for me if it's not fun I'm not doing it and I would imagine you have a similar thing like once you make a certain amount of money you go okay like what is the other meaning it's got to be fun and if it's not or it's not like reaching the right people I'm just not into it wanna I you you know for for everything bad he's done he said something amazing which is Kanye West said something uh he goes uh I do dope [ __ ] and uh or you know there he was there's a story of him with Dave Chappelle and Dave Chappelle's uh you know Kanye's backstage at Dave Chappelle Show someone calls Kanye and Dave is retelling the story and Dave goes or Connie goes hey yeah I can't really talk right now because I'm backstage with Dave Chappelle watching never seen before clips of the show right now and then he goes yeah because my life's dope and I do dope [ __ ] and he just hung up and uh and then he like and then and then he like you know like in the past couple years he gave this interview he's like money's cool but like I just want to do dope [ __ ] and he like keeps repeating this like listen I need to start talking like this now I'm like I'm like what kind of celebrity [ __ ] do I need to say now that I have a show like what do I need to know meanwhile I'm just this internet dork who sits on Twitter I make a joke about real estate or asset allocation and then I'm like all right that was a good day I go take a nap on the couch I'm like um I gotta learn what these guys are doing well me and Sean have a joke but I I truly live this way I'm like would my 12 year old be proud of the [ __ ] that I'm doing now you know what I mean like am I you guys like I've heard you talk about this it's it's crazy when you said it like that would my what your 12 year old self or my 12 year old self like I heard you say this the other day I went home I told my wife and I told her like my 12 year old or even 20 year old self would not believe it would not believe that I'm married to you would not believe that we travel the way we travel that I have a business like this like a team that's like awesome you can like talk like celebrities [ __ ] yeah it's awesome yeah yeah by the way I'm getting these DMS from celebrities like athletes you know I don't know anything about sports right and they're always like I saw you tweeted you're like I'm from the Phillies or something yeah I'm from the Eagles and I'm like is that a basketball team and like they don't even reply oh funny when when um when Netflix emailed me when the the first time they emailed me they were like oh hi like um you know we'd love to talk to you about a project um do you have representation or should we like speak to you directly and I was like what the hell is representation like I didn't even know what they were talking about like I didn't have a entertainment lawyer I didn't know how to find one I went on Google I literally typed entertainment lawyer and I looked through the list like that's how I found an entertainment lawyer and like I had to learn this industry like seriously from the ground up and then it took me like a couple of years to truly start to scratch the surface because in Silicon Valley it's very different it's a way to Tweet someone they'll take a meeting yeah it's like but the industry Dynamics are different like subtle things like for example Engineers are kind of regaled as like the most valuable okay well what's the equivalent in Hollywood that's not obvious from the outside and um what are the like cultural mores it's not obvious so dude I'm just at the very beginning of Learning this stuff but it's actually really cool to be a student of a new industry and learn like oh that's how things are done here and oh there's actually kind of a reason why we've just gotten popular enough now that some of the agents you know like the what's it CAA and I forget the other three yeah uh there's like two or three of them where they're actually starting to talk to us and I I'm incredibly turned off by the whole process I I find it to be very off-putting and I like I have to remind myself well you know there could be a reason why this exists and then I start talking to them like well these guys seem pretty nice and they're making a lot of sense but then in the back of my head I'm like these people are [ __ ] sharks they're gonna steal from you they're gonna like you know like like you know what I mean like it's like this hard uh dichotomy uh wait we gotta talk about this like if you ever want to like chat about it because I know I know these folks and do you like it totally legit um yeah that's like a weird question are they legit is like is a recruiter legit I mean it depends for what you're going for yeah if you you know you're in a unique perspective because number one you have this huge podcast you and Sean have built this amazing thing and like the personality the events you've built is like crazy I mean I watch from the early days and I've really gotten into your podcast in the last year and I'm just like oh you guys are like firing on all cylinders you would have no idea what you guys do best how how fast it is by the way our events are way more half-assed than you think really dude the photos look incredible they're great they're great but like they're thrown together yeah really you just show up and just like hang [ __ ] that's insane okay anyway it looks great um and then you're you know you already have money so you're not like super profit motivated unless it's like the right opportunity it's you and Sean you got HubSpot involved so there's a lot of unique things but one thing I learned in Hollywood is take the meeting always take the meeting which is different because I turned down nine out of ten things I'm just like nope nope nope but if you want it's all relationship based way more than Tech way more um just to give you an example a lot of lawyers um PR firms in Hollywood they will not even take your call even if you're ready to hire them like you have a fat check they will not even take your call if you're not referred by an agent or someone else like that that's mind-blowing that pisses me off you know I love Jay Leno Jay Leno has this all you're not into cars I don't think but he's got this really cool show called wait does having a Honda Accord not count as being into cars unfortunately not my friend uh it does not but Jay Leno has this thing called Jay Leno's garage and he tells you the history of the car and why it's cool and he's got those funny uh bit where he talks about Ferrari he refused you know Jay Leno probably has 500 or a thousand cars and they're all like historical and important and he goes someone was like why aren't there any Ferraris here he goes I refuse to buy a Ferrari and he goes why he goes because they you have to get on a wait list and you have to like get on a waitlist to buy one in order to buy the next one so in order to buy like for example let's say there's like a GTO 250 which is like a 30 million dollar car they only made five of them whatever it's like this really rare car and it's like an art and he's like I would love to own one because I think they're awesome but they make you buy the entry level one then you have to get on a waiting list to buy the next one and you can't sell it you have to do all these rules he goes I refuse to bow down to that [ __ ] and I'm not gonna play that game I just wanna I I just now he's like I realize it's not like the every man I'm not like the every man but in some regard like I just don't want to like jump to the Hoops I just want to say if I'm willing to give you money please let me have it and so I refuse to buy a Ferrari for that reason I'm like Hermes I'm like dude I'm not gonna get on a [ __ ] list to buy this [ __ ] that's [ __ ] yeah yeah I I agree I respect that he is like no I'm not gonna play that game I love that at the same time I also understand why a luxury business does that so there's a couple of great books on luxury and and there's this phrase um when the CEO of Volvo sees two Volvos on a city block he's happy when the CEO of Porsche or Rolls-Royce sees to he gets worried and I think that that's right on luxury is a totally different Beast it's a totally different way of marketing you don't want too many people to have it and so you create these barriers um by the way I listened to this uh this Rolls Royce uh podcast so I like I love I'm not like Rolls-Royce to me the look of it is a little gaudy for me and also I'm not really a car guy but one day I'm gonna buy a sweet car like it's gonna be amazing which people are gonna be like this [ __ ] guy told maybe Bentley maybe Rolls-Royce like I love the craftsmanship of it like the Perfection of it and that's like that's one of the reasons I love beautiful clothes like they're handmade hand stitched everything is absolutely perfect I've gone to the factory in Italy where I saw the absolutely beautiful well-lit Factory floor and I saw them making these beautiful cashmere sweaters and I go I appreciate that they are paying well that everything's done by hand they have a school in solomeo where they're teaching the next generation of Artisans and Craftsmen that's fantastic so I have a love of craftsmanship but anyway I'm listening to Rolls Royce came out with a podcast which is genius because if you're gonna buy a 500 000 car you're gonna listen and research every Last Detail you can about the car and I just I'm obsessed with the details of the leather and the color matching and you know if you get a custom color on a Rolls-Royce it's now your color nobody else can ever use it from Rolls-Royce if they want it they have to ask your permission to use it I'm like okay that's cool not not for me today maybe someday one day what's the uh let's wrap up here but tell me what's the uh what are the luxury books I'm gonna write them down I want to read them too all right so one of them is called the luxury strategy uh another one is called CAP fur on luxury and uh those are two that'll get you started I think those are really good ones cool what are you reading right now uh I'm reading a lot of stuff about the mob about the mafia okay uh so I like crime stuff uh I am um what else have I read recently it's lots of crime stuff unfortunately uh I'm re-reading a book on Joseph Kennedy Joseph Kennedy you know father of JFK he's a really controversial person he basically got rich off insider trading then became the first head of the SEC made insider trading illegal incredibly unfaithful to his wife but kind of a really good father so a lot of like interesting things a lot of people don't know that Joe Kennedy was like the seventh richest person in America so JFK was like not just wealthy but really wealthy so I'm rereading a book on him and I'm re-reading a book on the uh American capitalism between 1910 and 1920 it was highly unregulated so like the Andrew carnegies of the world Jay Gould John Rockefeller they were really fascinating because it was like super Cutthroat and so I'm rereading about that yeah let me just share what I'm reading right now too um one is called unreasonable Hospital reality and in that's the guy who used to run a very high-end restaurant in New York another one is called customers for life this is by a guy who ran an auto dealership just like really nitty-gritty business I just love that um I got one called the power of the past this is awesome for anyone who listens to my podcast you'll hear me talk about money and class class is not really talked about in America but it exists it's the power of the past by Jesse stribe and then um uh color of law is when I'm rereading on real estate redlining and race in history so anyway those are a couple few books I'm reading over me I like this yeah dude I was just thinking I just wrote a note I should have a podcast just on books just asking like interesting people what they're reading and why oh dude I would I would love that well I've just your first listener and I'll definitely come on that's a great idea yeah I mean because that's always like a one of my favorite Parts is ask people what they're reading and why um but dude I appreciate you doing this man you're you're the man I thank you for your friendship thank you for doing this congratulations on the show it's freaking awesome my wife and I were watching thank you all day yesterday uh really oh my God I sent you the video of us you sent me that dude to know that you guys are watching this which I spent like years doing kept it quiet for that long and to know that it's like inside your house and the two of you are connecting over it like honestly the highest praise for someone who creates anything so thank you it means a lot it was awesome and I appreciate you doing this thanks for everything thank you dude that's the pod [Music]

yep PubMed is the government database of all Scholastic biomedical literature so 36 million papers if you sit there long enough and you have the passion you can become a billionaire it's just a matter of sitting there and sifting and sifting and sifting which most people do don't have the patient's desire or willpower to do but every single biomedical Innovation is is logged in on PubMed [Music] what's up we just had a conversation with Martin shkreli if you don't know who he is you can just Google his name and you'll find that he is quote unquote the most hated man in America or he is the Pharma bro and he's uh you know he touches kind of a bunch of different things you know the bingo card for my first million he's made hundreds of millions of dollars he's super controversial and some people love him some people hate him he went to prison for something that he did with his his hedge fund and he comes on here and he tells us a bunch of things he tells us how he made his first million he gave his side of the story on why he bought that drug and raised the price and why maybe it wasn't so evil as uh as it was portrayed um why he hates sort of vanilla CEOs that that uh just only speak in corporate speaking why he refuses to do that uh why he thinks Mark Cuban is full of [ __ ] uh he also unveils his new startup in the AI space for the first time ever so uh pretty interesting conversation with Martin he is uh he's one thing he's not boring you'll look I think we can all agree on that uh some people love him some people hate him I think you see in this episode you can see a couple different sides of them and so I'm curious to hear what you guys think I would love for you to put in the comments whether you uh you love this episode you hated this episode or somewhere in between and uh you know we always commit that on this pod you know when we bring people on we're not saying this is the best person ever or the worst we just want to have interesting conversations with interesting people I want to get into their mind and find out why they are the way they are uh how they think how they operate and then you can decide for yourself whether this is somebody you uh you're into or not so uh that's this episode Martin shkreli it's about two hour interview and uh enjoy Sam where do you want to start we could either go more on the AI stuff or there's there's some interesting stuff in your your kind of start of your career that I think is kind of fun like you worked you worked with Jim Cramer is that right when you were 16 years old you worked for Kramer the guy who's always yelling on on CNBC uh what was that like what's Kramer like Kramer's right you know uh hedge funds were a different world back then it was a very very small asset class maybe 50 billion 100 billion totals um you know any private partnership is is technically kind of a hedge fund right if you have outside investors and you're charging them one and 20 or 2 and 20 and your shorting stocks and doing exotic stuff you know that's a hedge fund uh whether you call it that or not so Warren Buffett had a hedge fund all the folks had hedge fund but at the time the biggest hedge funds were Galleon group SAC Capital you know a handful kind of like tiger Soros you know it was sort of the wild time for the hedge fund industry kind of you know very very small industry maybe 30 or 40 or 50 firms of any significance uh and that means like you know 100 million dollars or more and so Kramer was one of those firms I got to work there I was very lucky um you were in high school at the time I was sort of in this like weird state of both being a high school dropout a high school graduate and a high school you know continuing you know kind of education it was very weird I had I went to this very special school called Hunter where I fulfilled all my degree requirements pretty early so I was ready sort of graduated in the state's eyes but I continued to sort of like go to the school and um pick up credits and like go to college at the same time so it was just a weird like mishmash of education and um sort of hard to explain but are you kind of like you're almost like a Class Clown of society now where you like that in high school or were you just like a straight laced kid at that time yeah absolutely I was like just like this in high school like it was if there was somebody that needed sort of dressing down or including yeah teacher or principal whatever I remember my first day of school I actually dressed down the principal a bit that was sort of a funny you know thing to do you know I guess I have to like fearlessness of you know but did your parents like discipline you were they like dude what the [ __ ] show some respect yeah you know I I think not really [ __ ] you know I don't know you know I think there's like this you know I've always had this you know opinion that people take themselves too seriously and and take authority too seriously and of course you know I landed myself in prison but yeah I think that you know there's uh and and you are right they do take that accessories yeah yeah another prediction one time uh Martin was on blab and again the numbers are going crazy I was like I got to see what happened he must be acting a fool or something I don't know what's going on and uh I go in and they're a CNN reporter was demanding like an interview with him he was like she was like you should Martin uh I've been watching this it's really interesting I would love to have a conversation with you on CNN and he's like no no you come on my show this is my show you want to interview me we can do it right here and she's like okay I'm not gonna do that but if you come on CNN he's like no no come on the show and then she's like refusing or whatever he's like she starts like trying to like have a moment to like tell him how bad he is and then he asked her he's like I'm going to the gala tonight you want to be my plus one yeah didn't you end up going out didn't you go out no not this one but uh I just thought wow what a like you know they don't teach that in PR school just ask him on a date if it's not going if the interview's not going well break breaking down the fourth wall is like my specialty right like you know I and what Elon sort of did that to that BBC guy the other day like I yep I would always ask um I remember one of my analysts uh who's on the sell side before joining me on the buy side they brought a management team to come over to this sort of skipping ahead in my career a little bit to having my old phones uh he brought a management team over to you know pitch some stock or pitch a pipe or something and I I asked the C CEO why he didn't he didn't own any stock in his company and he you know he sort of like Hamming and highing like you know that temperature is kind of getting hot and I said you know because I have your proxy right here and I put a dumb table and I said it looked like you make 550 000 a year that's that's a good amount of money can you promise me today that you'll buy like 10 000 or 20 000 of your stock at least and and the guy's just sort of like you know the most uncomfortable meeting in the history of Wall Street you know because I kept like hammering on I was like no but just tell me like why can't you afford to spend ten thousand dollars and buy your own stock the stock price will go up everyone wins you'll show confidence that you know and I just wouldn't like for 20 minutes let it go uh and it was just you know one of these like you know breaking down that fourth wall you're not like you're not supposed to do that you know his personal finances are up to him is what most portfolio managers would say you know he's allowed to not own his stock it's it's really his call but you know being able to sort of like you know cut to the chase on half these things and like you know address the elephant in the room is kind of the thing thing that I like to do even if it's really uncomfortable or difficult or embarrassing or you know a full paw you know it's it's something that you know I'll I'll just sort of you know cut to the chase with well I remember when you got arrested or the headline was like uh you had to put up like your Fidelity account or something like that that had like 60 million dollars in it and at the time you were I don't know how old you were 32 or something I mean early 30s very young and you I mean that was it was a significant amount of money and that didn't that was just your Fidelity account let alone like your uh you know the touring five uh you know the the farm the Pharma companies that you had founded was did you make your first bit of money when you started the hedge funds and how did that come to be or were you already doing well just being at the hedge funds where you worked oh it's a great question so I never made money I hedge funds I never really made a dollar um working at or owning both so when I started at hedge funds I was young and you know didn't really earn money uh which was fine you know I wasn't optimizing for that you know I was optimizing for learning stuff experience uh good relationships uh I mostly succeeded in that I think you know probably messed up some relationships but regardless you know I did the best I could as a young guy started my own fund um pretty pretty terrible at doing the fund management business you know investing being a good investor and being a good fund manager kind of like pretty different things is what I think most hedge fund entrepreneurs kind of learn you know um you know there you can be a really brilliant investor and not manage the actual business well and the business is to grow your assets as much as possible provide the best sort of adjusted returns possible and satisfy your clients and I didn't really want to do any of that you know I just wanted to invest and um I never took these from any of my funds which was very like you know sort of bizarre uh and they're they're sort of technical legal reasons for that but so I never really made any money uh in hedge funds when I started my first drug company called retropin which is now called travier this is about 10 years ago uh that's sort of where everything sort of came together for me I I learned Pharma by being a hedge fund person for 10 years and hedge funds studying Pharma starting with the early Jim Cramer days where I was just figuring out what a stock in a bond was and then moving on to you know trading these things and working at hetrons and stuff like that and then starting my own I I really mastered Pharmaceuticals I I knew everything about Therma and I impressed a lot of people in Pharma who are working in the field or working hedge funds and you know it was easy for me to sort of start a drug company and find some really good assets the first asset I found actually received FDA approval just a couple months ago so I'm really proud of that and um when our company went public uh you know as a millionaire how how old were you it was 2012 um you know so I was born in 83 so I guess it was 29 and um I was a CEO publicly traded company and um the market Capital company like I said now is you know 1.5 billion roughly and uh the drug got FDA approved so I'm really happy about that like so often in biotech people start companies they kind of extract some Equity value out of them as they go public and then the company's drugs don't work and they kind of move on and there are people that have like coasted and biotech doing that like every three five years you know I I name some names but it doesn't matter you know and getting a drug FDA approved and for me kind of on my first try was you know sort of like a very you know it's a very like nice feather in my cap and I'm happy for the people that are now getting this prescription for this kidney disease I'm really delighted by that but the you know the it was a lot of fun to to see that so when people ask me like where'd you make your first million I made my first like 25 million old one you're still on the same day you know like it wasn't like okay you make like one of my great friends started off making um you know he's a great story and one day maybe you'll have them on this podcast uh he started off trading uh sneakers and um he was like 13 or something and then he started trading cars and he ended up trading stocks and he he sort of went from a thousand bucks to five thousand to a hundred thousand to a million to five million you know et cetera Etc and you know that that road isn't when everyone does right like some people I was like literally almost like starving you know and like broke you know trying to get that big big win and it came through and so you you said a couple things I want to uh quickly clarify you see you didn't make much money in investing because you weren't really good at or interested in the fund management but presumably if you're good at or interested in the investing side you would still generate return so what was it like didn't didn't do so hot in the on the investing side either or what happened there yeah I had a sort of like a mix of of issues like when you run a small fund you have like costs and stuff like that so you know you have started how big how big was the fun I had about eight million um you know ever since I started so like you know you just can't like even with good investing you just kind of can't do that well with respect to to returns if you have other costs and things like that and you know we had like all kinds of like issues happen along the way that led to that prosecution and stuff like that that sort of limited our ability to do really well financially um and again we we didn't take any fees either because again we had this sort of big issue that that came about and we just decided to not take fees at all but in the end our investors did fairly well um you know the record shows that our investors all made money in our funds so I was really happy to deliver that but you know along the way there are a lot of twists and turns and hiccups that are not worth going into but hedge funds for me were kind of like a just sort of like a roller coaster of of issues that were just over you know and over again kind of like various like you know unexpected twists and turns that didn't really add up to profit some people had hedge funds like if you get off to like a good start for your first like three or six months often you can get this momentum raising more capital and raising more capital and you get this like virtuous cycle but you can also go in the other direction where you know if you you know many funds are started by good investors and they end up failing and those investors sort of come back and take take a few years off and start a fund again um you know hedge funds have like the shortest lifespan even though if you look at the top hedge funds from the 90s almost none of them exist today uh and I think of those like top 10 hedge funds of all time like five were shut down by regulatory intervention so like it's a very hazardous job you know there's there's a you know 10 chance of going going to jail being ahead for manager it's it's uh it's a really you know kind of dangerous job to be in and uh you know you're dealing with the markets and you're dealing with representations to investors just how to Mark privates right is kind of like one of these like real debates I know a guy who went to jail for that uh fairly recently um you know anybody looking into your books can basically say oh well you marked this too high you know therefore you you know you're you're defrauding your investors for charging them too much well you marked it too low well now you're defroning them because you know your your preferencing the other investors who are coming into the fund so you really can't can't win it's a very tough business you don't build any actual lasting value as you know almost no hedge funds have gone public so it's just kind of a crummy business in general and like I I don't recommend anyone kind of get into it unless they're so interested in stocks that they can't you know help but like spend their whole time looking at stocks like Kramer back then Kramer's like a stock addict right so this guy again I consider him you know not quite a friend but like I I I have a fond memory of working with a I mean he is like a a drug addict to their drug he is like that to Securities like he cannot get away from it there's nothing he loves more in the world than stocks and you think about people like Warren Buffett and say maybe that's that's kind of like them and the average person who wants to get into hedge funds they wanted to get into it because oh I can make 10 million bucks or I can make 50 million bucks in a year wow look at that Jim Simon made a billion dollars I can be like that that sounds great and you know that's a terrible terrible terrible way to look at her right if you wake up in the middle of night thinking about s p earnings estimates you should be at hedge funds right but if you don't care on a Sunday you know what's what the news is going to be on Monday in the stock market or what you know your favorite Company CEO is doing that night you know that's it's not for you and I think there are people that the hedge fund industry has grown so much people come to finance not understanding that in the 90s and the 80s the only people that were in hedge funds were people like Jim and Buffett and people like like that that were just like so intensely insanely possessed by the gyrations of the market and if that's not you it's it's kind of not a good industry but for me I I was sort of intensely possessed with pharmaceutical companies and pharmaceutical assets or drugs and medicines and you know it was actually a better fit to do private Equity um you know kind of style investing where you actually buy whole medicines whole companies you know that that worked really well for me and I've seen a lot of people in hedge funds sort of transition to that model of well if I can buy five percent of a software company why can't I buy 100 of a software company right that that makes more sense to me and for me you lose that like one of the things I was very bad at at trading and investing was kind of that impulse right where you have to have this insanely good discipline as a Trader and my partner had this really really great discipline I didn't so I could value security as good as anyone but what it came time to like executing and actually deploying capital and risk management and stuff like that it was it was much harder for me to be good at that um so when it came what is that what what does that mean you're not patient you you wanted the dopamine you wanted the dopamine every one of those things you're just you're just you're just like a you have normal anxiety like a lot of people is is that what that means I think that like to ask somebody to manage a portfolio well is one of the most impossible tasks in like human psychology because the and there's this great book I've gotten better at it over the years foreign profit as my you know I basically couldn't do that in in private investing uh the the hardest thing to do is is really to fight two or three different for me specific demons that are psychologically based but everyone has their own demon for me it's avoiding this this desire to double down so the market is like this really tough psychological uh battle where you're constantly going to be humbled that your opinion is wrong that your thesis is wrong but this stock is not cheap you're wrong it's not cheap at all and you got to sell it and that's really hard cognitively to embrace every day uh you could embrace it every now and then oh yeah obviously I I bought this crap stock and I'm wrong uh but when you're right you do get that dopamine hit and you don't want to confront that loss of the dopamine hit or even worse the acknowledgment that you were wrong and you're gonna be wrong like 40 50 of the time at best you know say 35 40 of the time and most people don't want to run ever so the desire is sometimes to double down and just say no I know I'm right this is an even better opportunity than it was before if you keep doing that you you basically will will go bankrupt um and uh it's like the fastest way to go bankrupt and you know I've learned that trick you know a couple times now and and I think that you know I've gotten better at sort of not doubling down but it to be really great Trader you got to not just not double down you also have to get out you know before all the damage is done and so I started to do that well too but you know these these pains are not pains your investors want you to learn on their buying right their uh their pains you have to sort of you know be ready you know when you start your own fun so I started starting my fun too early and stuff like that but I think that I wouldn't I wouldn't change a lot in the sense that when you have a fund you learn more about your industry if you do it right I think you learn more about your industry than than any other sort of job other than actually being in that industry so you you learn a ton about what Wall Street wants so let's say if you're a software analyst it's really great to then have a software company because you know exactly kind of what the exit looks like and what like public company investors want to see and the same thing works in biotech and biotech to handicap like oh this company or stock be a good stock well you got to figure out will this drug be good drug and that's the exact same skill set you have to do when your CEO so you have that like you know um crossover that's happening quite a bit more in biotech I've seen that you know it doesn't happen so much in tech people who invest in Tech generally don't want to be operators and the tricks that you have to learn on the operating side in Tech are very different from biotech and biotech you can actually like learn pickle mostly operating stuff from being an investor uh whereas I think in Tech like you know being an investor and software company certainly doesn't make you a programmer you know so you know and that that's what I was going to ask you because you you were like well I started a pharmaceutical company because I loved the asset and I learned through it for finance which is way different than like for example my friend Cara started this company hint which does like water because she was like my skin was bad I didn't want to drink Gatorade or Coke anymore so I like went and formed I went and boiled fruit Peels and made this fruit water that's like tastes good it's good for you and we grew from there your founding story was like oh I found assets that were interesting like it's like that's like foreign to me you know what I mean yeah so like if if there was a company for example uh my first hedge fund we bought 10 of this company publicly traded company and they had bought this asset from Bristol Myers the major major drug company in New Jersey and Bristol Meyer spent like 50 million bucks developing this drug and they quit they basically said this doesn't fit our portfolio we're not really going after the disease they were trying to go after was hypertension which is very boring and that does not need another medicine there's like 60 hypertension drugs you know it does not need to be a 61st and they they just quit on the drug um there are people who have like really bad resistant hypertension and so forth so I really like this asset I like the way it worked and I after Bristol Myers quit on it the publicly traded company and the financial crisis they merged with another public trade company so I went to the publicly trade company and again only thing I have is a hedgehog moment and I said let me buy and nobody's told a story by the way so this is a good time to tell it because it's really you know it's basically a story about how we went to this company with two million dollars and turned it into over Rebellion um you know which is is kind of remarkable but people do this in Pharma every day and my friend uh and at the time it was actually my biggest investor vivekan Swami is now running for president he basically took our business model and supersized it and again um you know who who influence two is is a matter well left really left to history but the the point is we went to uh this company that had the license from Bristol and they had they were doing anything with it and we said let's listen we'll take this we'll find investors we'll build a company around it and uh I'm gonna figure out how to how to make this work and they said okay sure you know we we got this asset sitting here doing nothing if you pay us two million bucks we'll we'll send you the 2 million bucks now we sent them a million dollars which was really catastrophic because you never want to sort of go back in your word uh but it was really like a dire circumstance where I forgot what happened exactly but we just couldn't come up with money and it was like we sent them a million and they're like what the [ __ ] you know you can't do this this you know and I I was sort of like you know geez this is a you know huge embarrassment a huge problem but she's gonna have to give us like 30 days or 90 days and you know we we worked it out and we were able to give him the second million but it was like this colossal embarrassment right at the start and um you know [ __ ] does happen but you know it ideally shouldn't happen like that um and again really embarrassing and tough but we got through the 2 million and we decided I I sort of did all this research and said instead of hypertension we should go with this rare kidney disease called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and if you just don't PubMed and you have the willpower you can learn a lot about medicine and you can dive in and PubMed PubMed just being like a database of Articles yeah I guess yep PubMed is the government database of all Scholastic biomedical literature so 36 million papers if you sit there long enough and you have the passion you can become a billionaire it's just a matter of sitting there and sifting and sifting and sifting which most people do don't have the patient's desire or willpower to do but every single biomedical Innovation is is logged you were sifting for what what were you looking for when you went on PubMed yeah you have to put the pieces together so the the this drug was an endothelial and receptor antagonist uh and what does that mean it it inhibits a protein called endothelium and its function well what will that do right you have to decide well you have to learn where is endothel and it expressed in the body how does it work what does it do if I stop and to see one from working what benefits will that have What problems will that result in and if you look at the history of okay well other companies have tried this what have they seen what have they discovered and what's interesting about Pharma is that you think that these companies Cover the Waterfront but they really just prod and poke a little bit there's actually probably 10 diseases that this drug could be beneficial for and uh I made a list of those and I said okay well which one of these is gonna work for sure and they're companies that like got half the answer and stuff like that and you just have to keep poking and we found like these handful of diseases that really made a lot of sense now the problem was nobody in Wall Street really liked it um you know it was very you know kind of early you know there was this sort of tough problem of if you reduce the amount of protein in the urine of a patient does that really save their kidney and I thought I convinced everyone that I could reduce the amount of protein in the urine which was a very big end point to me but not as conclusive as okay am I saving their lives am I am I preventing dialysis and kidney failure which is really the so-called hard end point so I had the soft end point that like seemed like almost certain I was right and I was starting to convince companies like Abby and vertex and other like big bio Farmers that you know I was onto something that nobody wants to write a check you know so I basically got one of the management teams that I I used to deal with on on Wall Street uh 10 best and I slowly kind of cobbled together some money uh met folks like Peter Thiel and others to to try to sort of get some investors did a reverse merger what's Peter Thiel like meters great you know it was you know 10 10 plus years ago he had never done Pharma um so we we got to meet and this was going to be basically like his first Pharma deal ever uh we didn't end up doing the deal but it was uh it was a very funny thing because like there was this East Coast versus West Coast mentality uh you know as a Wall Street guy he was you know he's obviously you know one of the top VC type guys and this is a time where like he had clarium you know their Founders one was just getting started and stuff like that and uh you know the Wheeling dealing like Wall Street sort of style of like oh we're gonna do a reverse merger which is basically kind of like a spack with no money um you know it's like even worse than SPAC um you know you do the you do the listing and then you raise the money uh but it's a way to go public and we did it and he was like ah you can't go public in a year or two and you know the reality is you kind of can in especially biopharma where the assets are like these very modular systems they're not like a base business that has X dollars revenue and it's growing at X rate these are like okay this asset's worth something dead or alive in other words if it's being developed or not being developed it towards something uh you know especially with the right business plan uh it could be worth a lot so anyway we we decided go publicly raise the money we started doing clinical trials the trial worked uh and the rest is history but it took you know it takes hundreds of millions dollars to develop a drug uh again the value of the company is is 1.5 the value of that drug specifically is probably around 1 billion uh again whether it actually achieves the sales goals or beats them or disappoints we'll see as the drug launches and I'm rooting for the company uh but uh so you you didn't even you didn't even get the drug in this example you didn't get the drug to the point where people were buying it or using it it was you made money off just the the fact that this will exist hopefully in 10 or whatever years yeah this is where well a lot of people don't know my story about medicine a lot of people think that I take medicines and raise prices well this drug was barely inhuman beings it had been in like 30 or 50 people um up until that point and you know I made most of my money uh in in sort of developments in in environment on the research side so you know this is a drug in clinical research so no it's not it hadn't been FDA approved it would take 10 years to get it SDA approved so it was a long marathon of running studies getting the evidence running more studies getting more evidence and continuing that process and you know uh as we started to do that the value of the company increased and people said okay I think I get this and then as the data came in now it's FDA approved it's called philspari I named the drug sparcentan um you know gave it his first chemical name and um you know it's it's you know I'm so happy it's it's FDA approved now I left the company halfway through this process so I should acknowledge that but you know all the same plans and and so forth you know continued did you did you own most of it at the time or what was that and did you have to divest when all the [ __ ] went down so I went from 90 you know when we started it to 50 uh when we're public I think I had around 40 or 50 after our first financing down to 30 under second financing down to 20. you know set time of our IPO we when you do reverse word very often don't get on on NASDAQ so we did an IPO on NASDAQ 2014 and the company was worth like three or four hundred million and I owned about 15 20 of it and uh again this is sort of like my first wealth ever but the funny thing is as you guys maybe know you have a situation like that you actually don't have any cash you're not liquid yeah you can't sell it so you know I've got millions of shares of the stock but you know I'm sitting there saying okay well you're like how am I gonna buy this album yeah exactly well you know the level for that you think about like how am I gonna buy this five thousand dollar a month apartment and go to the seven thousand dollar a month apartment which is like a very funny discussion for somebody that you know has 50 or 100 million dollars uh of of stock value and I would go to these Banks and say listen can I borrow five percent you know of my money of my stock value and they would say no and you know I'd say you know uh you know why not you know they'd say well here's a new stock you know it's it's kind of you know still you know a little bit unseasoned you're the big shareholder you know we're just not comfortable with it and it's like sitting there like oh my God you know this is insane because I don't want to sell my stock because it sounds like kind of a bad signal to the market um you know but I don't want to you know uh also starving so it was a very like funny thing and I don't want to be one of those greedy CEOs that has you know an insane salary uh where you don't need it so it's very just sort of a funny circumstance but eventually uh we had a big squabble at the company uh I ended up leaving uh it's very tumultuous and and uh traumatic story in a lot of ways and it led to my prosecution uh you know there was this fight with with the board and it got very so nasty that the the board you know kind of evil people here but the board sort of went to law enforcement uh as kind of one of their ways to win this fight and you know one of the things that a lot of people don't understand is that there's this big revolving door between corporate law and law enforcement when I said law enforcement I mean the Attorney General sorry ausa is the associate U.S attorneys that work in the Department of Justice and it's not hard if you go to a law firm you know like a [ __ ] Cleary got leaves God and Arabs picture Paul wise pick your biggest Law Firm you say hey we have this guy he did something bad you know look into this you know usually you'll get into Diamond pretty fast this happened at the Google guy that uh had the uh waymo yeah Andrew uh this happened to a Goldman Sachs Trader that stole some source code the email emailed himself home to work on the source code then he went to another hedge fund they said see he stole an electorate the FBI got him in 48 hours Goldman makes a phone call uh they'll act on it quickly Google makes a phone call they'll act on it quickly you're a big enough Law Firm customer you're paying a law firm 10 million bucks and all those Law Firm Partners worked in government right they worked literally in the job they can get United so they could pick up a phone and get it and make it happen and I actually have like the person's name who picked up the phone you know and it's it's like so ridiculous because a boardroom battle a corporate squabble shouldn't turn into you know okay let me just make call and get you know get this guy arrested then we'll win the fight right and it's like you know I was actually acquitted of those charges and I'm so proud of that um to this day it's like the most the happiest thing that I have to look forward to or to talk about because like it was this Clash of like these old hand old older incompetent sort of bio people and this these younger sort of like aggressive Executives said that I Shopper did and the older guys kind of won in terms of control of the company but the stock never went up again really and you know it it just was sort of this company that they were able to sort of cite in millions of dollars out out of uh which is like for for a lot of talentless Executives like that's that's really exciting like getting a a five million dollar paycheck a year plus a you know golden parachute plus all the perks and the power of being the CEO like I've none of that stuff mattered to me I just wanted to make really big money and really big advances and for a lot of people like you know getting that the thing I just discussed was like that's their wife call that's their career goal there's no no need to do anything else they they'd rather preside over a company that does nothing what pays them five million bucks a year then a company that makes a huge advance in a treatment or whatever so it was this big fight and and I just basically said I'll start a new company I don't need you guys and I started uh touring we should uh let you explain kind of the thing because if people listen to this have basically only heard of you as the guy who jacked up the price of the drugs and I've heard you explain this before many times where again uh I said you were entertaining because somebody would come on and be like you're the worst you're like you're evil you did this and then you would say so explain to me what I did exactly and then they would immediately not know what the hell to say like you you raised the price of the drug and now people can't get it you're like tell me who can't get it where are you getting that data from like what what and you would walk them through almost like the Socratic method of um what actually happened why what your perspective was on it and so I want you to share that because I think a lot of people have heard the other perspective which is guy buys drug raises price he's evil that's one perspective I'd like you to share your perspective and then people could decide for themselves which they feel to be more true so and you didn't even and and it was another funny part related to that is you didn't even go to prison for that reason right you if I remember correctly you admitted you were wrong for a bunch of things uh but it wasn't even related your persona was your your yeah yeah but you're I think you being smug and being an [ __ ] when maybe you should have just been like yes ma'am I'm sorry was maybe probably the more appropriate answer but you were kind of like being smug and you got a lot of [ __ ] for that so I think that hurt your your thing but you didn't even get processed you didn't get prosecuted for that no yeah it's not a it's I mean I think that's why I was so small because it's not a crime to choose the price of your product you know if you guys wanted to charge for for this podcast right you you know whether it's an Advertiser or a partner or or The Listener maybe you could pick whatever price you want you know that's your call you know it's your job to explore the frontier of that price and volume curve and it your job to sort of find the maximum Revenue uh you can choose to do that or not do that and I think that's why American capitalism is so great it's like it's it's really the only person's call is the firm owner and the firm management teams call right it's not a politician's call it's not the media's call it's not the guy in the you know in this sort of uh grandstands call you know you know hooting and hollering at you it's it's not even the patient's call even though they're your core constituent and we care the most about them it's it's your call as management team right you said that price when you email the distributor that's the price that matters it's the price that you picked and nobody can tell you what for that price is and any business and what was that what was that logic that you that Sean was referring the criticism would be you yes yes you had the right to raise the price that doesn't mean you're not a jerk or that people weren't hurt by that because they now couldn't afford it so now address that part of it the reverse psychology is a super important I'll go through that in a second but I think the most of you know what you said is really important because it's this like inviolable right and I I was really pissed off quite frankly that there was this effort by by Paul wannabe would be politicians that didn't end up winning uh and and others to try to sort of take that right away uh through like this regulation by embarrassment right like it was like this like well shame you until you change your mind it's like oh you're gonna shame me into changing my mind like you know that that's insane you're trying to take my right away it's my right to run my business how I see fit now we'll go through all the logic of why I think it was a good idea an attenable idea and it's not something a jerk would do it's not something an [ __ ] would do but just first and foremost you know how dare you try to tell me you know what my price should be because ultimately every person in America is working for some business that sets their price and you're basically saying well if you do it to me what you can do to Apple next or you can tell them that the iPhone's too expensive you're gonna do it to your podcast where an Advertiser says oh my God you want fifty thousand dollars to post a an ad on my podcast well that's not right I want that for 25 000. you know you're not getting the ad and you know I think that there's this special difference when it comes to healthcare and I've learned this and processed it slowly and like I said I'll tell you briefly about my new company in a minute but people treat Healthcare products and services in a different part of their mind you know a friend of mine worked at Amex and got to talk to Buffett about this where he said Buffett likes businesses where consumers think about the brand with a different part of their mind they don't think about it with rational part they think about it with the emotional part and Amex is an emotional product Coca-Cola is an emotional product you don't think about and say well this soda water costs you know sugar water costs 20 cents to make I don't know if I want to buy this for a dollar you know you just buy the soda because you watch Coca-Cola and and the more that you can make people think with that side of their their brain the better in healthcare you kind of get this like very visceral like entitlement of like no I meet this drug I don't care what it costs for the producer I don't care any like this is my right to get this medicine and obviously you know that they're that's not quite right in my opinion so getting back to to sort of just again getting past my just annoyance that there'd be people that sort of felt like you know they had a right to tell you what your prices should be without knowing anything about your business in the first place uh I think the biggest thing that worked on with that Socratic method is just showing people how little they know about they're in this industry right most people don't know much about the farm industry I don't blame them for that right this is the industry I spent my life in uh to know that it's an ins and out of Pharma you know I wouldn't I wouldn't be I'd be surprised if anybody did so the first thing I tend to ask is well what price do you think product should be and this is sort of where like it all falls apart for for the interlocutor because the average pharmaceutical price would shock most people you know there are rare disease drugs uh like spinraza and the avexis product for SMA they're millions of dollars you know it's a million dollars for a drug a year you know so every year for the rest of your life you got to pay a million bucks you know there are drugs like that but I think that's probably out of pocket right it's nobody's paying out of pocket for energy you know to the insurance company not to the end patient correct you know we have this convoluted crazy system that generally needs to kind of be broken in half uh but you know and again I'll show you my product in a minute that unlike Mark Cuban's garbage is might actually help uh the uh the um you know the the first question I always ask people is like well what do you where do you price a drug what do you have I've been I had a drug at retrofin 60 people okay six zero and they needed it to save their life what what price should that be should it be the price of Viagra no yeah yeah I believe in this thing called utility theory of price which I probably studied in in economics a long time ago but forgot but this this this idea is that price has three or four different theories of of price there's theory of kind of value there's theory of utility and there's sort of other types of theories like it should cost a lot of people sort of like would give me their theories in in Lay terms like well it should cost what you made it plus a comfortable margin I was okay that sounds interesting and other people say well it should cost what is worth to the user and and that's kind of how most medicine is priced if you can forego some terrible operation you know then and that operation is really expensive by taking this medicine it should sort of cost the price of you foregoing that operation and it's like but for analysis right so for a lot of rare diseases it's like well but for this drug you would be spending hundreds of thousand dollars a year so it's kind of a bargain at say a hundred thousand dollars because otherwise the insurance is going to spend half a million on you you know going to the hospital every week and so forth and so forth if you price someone based on what it would cost like okay well prices are going to break even well not a lot of incentive to make a medicine like that right you want to kind of want this windfall profit if you're a drug company because you have this risk that this shit's not gonna work and then you know you'll you'll be a you'll be on uh applying to a job advisor you know after your biotech startup fails so if you do win you can't just break even you know you have to overcome the risks and the risk adjusted possibility that you would have failed otherwise nobody would invest in companies like this if all the benefit was you would break even so you have to have this extra return and so when you do the pricing I think that the best logical thing to do is pick a price that the Alternative Care in other words a world without this drug you would forego all those costs for this drug and so I think that price works there are people who are you know just literally legitimately out of their mind that say oh the drug should be just should just be free and of course you know we're who's going to pay for the office who's going to pay for lawyers who's gonna pay the accountant who's gonna pay first who's gonna pay for the next drug right if every drug is free then nobody's going to want to go make drugs and again I if the if that's the system Society dictated to me I I you know I'll follow those rules but the society the the system Society dictated was it's your choice let's price your product at it's the insurer's choice to pay for it it's the Doctor's choice to prescribe it and there are countries like there's this miracle drug by vertex one of my favorite drug companies for Cystic Fibrosis Miracle product literally cure for Cystic Fibrosis amazing cystic is no longer a medical problem for 90 of people with cystic fibrosis this company should have parades parades every year for it right but instead they get [ __ ] for it and I have friends that if their lives have been saved one of my friends in high school died of cystic fibrosis at 19. and these guys are doing I use this term very carefully God's work by by saving people CF there are countries that refuse to pay for the medicine right this is 300 000 a year and my drug I ask people all the time well how much is my drug well I say that I know you had 750 pills that's not what I'm asking in Pharma we don't worry about what the price put bullets we worry about what does it cost for somebody to have to pay for this medicine out of pocket what is the insurance paying for a full course or a full year right and they said well I don't know how many pills do you do you have to take when you take this drug that you raise the price up and I said well why are you ready to criticize me when you don't know what the total cost is you know you're you're already jumping up but you know why they're criticizing you which is like as I'm listening this this you talk like you have this very classic uh issue which is both uh uh it's uh an asset and a liability which is you're quite uh logical so you're like this one guy I forget the guy's name the the guy who's running for president he just did what I did and he did it times 10 but I did it early on which is like you filed a very logical thing which is we hear this all the time and we have friends like this where it's like well I thought it could work because of X Y and Z and in most people's heads they would say to themselves yeah but no one else is doing it therefore it's impossible in your head which is a very common thing and entrepreneurs like you which is no like if a then B then C like the very logical approach but where you have [ __ ] up is you weren't it's like it's like you're so smart at studying the logic that you also kind of [ __ ] up by studying like okay but if I do that then people will hate me therefore I should probably use these words or smile this way when they confront me and like that was like a it's kind of like what elon's doing it's like dude you're so [ __ ] smart Elon you're doing all this amazing [ __ ] don't call Twitter titter like think of a different troll that's a like that's a net positive not a negative and that was what it seemed like was your thing which is like yeah dude you're logical you're not wrong about this this and this but you're just being a [ __ ] idiot when you're talking about it and you're not like like what don't smile that way you know even if you're I respect it because I'm like I think you know and I'm sure you were told by people what the correct way to frame and spend this is and yeah so so I I can I can be just like the guy at Pfizer right just like right and I can and I and I think it's cool that you're not that guy but it's like well that's the issue you could you could have saved seven years of your life maybe and Only God just like be a little bit more likable sometimes to save your own ass and sure and and you know I I wanted to straddle that line but like how much or like when I when I talk at Ivy League schools I get standing ovations because I think that the kids realize that they're the life their personality is about to be choked out by the the big Pharma big corporate world right where they're going to the Pharma are they going to to finance their life is is older you know their ability to express themselves the way they see fit is done right their their ability to wear what they want to work is over and I think that I represent that fresh event fresher that's like okay maybe they actually keep a personality maybe you can actually be somebody real instead of you know look look at this average CEO of corporate America lift up Budweiser CEO anhurst CEO it's like no I I gotta say what is the maximally the least interesting and the least offensive possible road to walk and they can't have a real personality because if I do you know someone's gonna have an issue with it and it's going to be a problem for my business and I just hate the that the corporate world has gotten to that point where you know showing who you are or the kind of person you are or having an opinion of any kind can be held against you I agree and the world wants you to be vanilla I'm on look this is why people like our pod I also see the other side where it's like yeah dude but you just [ __ ] up all those like I don't know if this is true but maybe it is you just messed up all the people who wanted this drug because you got locked up and or you hurt your family or you hurt people who cared about you all because of you wanting to express yourself if you want to express yourself get a [ __ ] dog go hang out with your cat like talk to them like you know what I mean that's that's is really important how many people could not afford or did not were not able to access the drug that previously could when the price was lower because the price got raised was it um one percent ten percent fifty percent seventy five percent of people could no longer afford the drug because that's the clear right zero zero percent so so that's the thing that like you know not how far it works so explain that part because I think that's the key consideration uh is if you raise the price of the drug and these people who needed it to pay for their their illness could no longer afford it and now they were sort of out you know [ __ ] out of luck because you bought the drug and and decided to reprice it that would have been one thing I think there's a I think that would support the argument against in a way at least the emotional argument against but when you add the fact that nobody lost access to the drug or very small percentage if that's true I don't know if it's true I don't do I don't do the research on this but you're saying that that's true that completely changes the argument in my opinion I I think so too and and that's why like I was so bold and and to Sam's Point you know seemingly like toned ass right about this because I wanted people to see well it's not a stupid person why is he being so tone deaf and obstinate hopefully it's because he's right and and let me look into that and some people did you know and that's why I've got fans uh and I'm not Billy McFarland or somebody like that I'll be able to raise money and start a new business because you know I accomplish things and I'm a skilled guy uh it's it's this like failure to so it's desire to want to buy a narrative from Media or buy anger or rent anger uh that that sort of accumulated to your people when it comes to Medicine like like I said there are drugs far more expensive than there from and uh like 500 000 or more per year they're from the one-time one course right so there's not an insurer in the world that didn't cover their room because if you don't pay the fifty thousand dollars roughly what they're from costs for a whole course forget per pill about 50 Grand if you end up needing their problem uh if you don't pay that you're gonna pay for the guy's funeral you're gonna pay for us actually you visits you're paying for us you know you're gonna pay for a million bucks of this guy being the ICU for the next six months it doesn't make sense right financially to not pay for derogram the other thing is it's such a small medicine this was less than 0.1 percent of an insurer's budget right it's [ __ ] not even not even a policy is being formed at Aetna or United Healthcare because it's like no they have automation policies for this stuff like until the drug ends up being like a couple more basis points you know several dozen basis points it's just not going to be a factor right they're more worried about is somebody taking insulin when they could be taking metformin which is much cheaper right make them make 20 000 people move from insulin to metform you know that or fifty thousand or five hundred thousand people our policy is you got to take OTC before you get this that's prescription that's the kind of policies Healthcare health insurance care about again you wouldn't know that unless you're in the healthcare industry right and the problem is when you have people that are that are shooting at you you know and they don't know what your industry is about you know it's it's akin to me telling like a database programmer well you know nosql databases are better than SQL databases and he's like why why are you saying that well and he starts putting out all these data I'm like oh that's just that's just how I feel like you know it's better to have a no sequel than a sequel that's like I wouldn't do that because I'm not that intellectually dishonest but people are very willing to be intellectually dishonest when it comes to things they don't know about because you know it's a personal thing and again my my goal is to better understand how personal Healthcare is to people that it actually is this cherished good and service it's not like food it doesn't have the elasticity of other things it's a very unique product that we put in a different place and you know my new company is as sort of an effort to sort of understand that make make amends make Penance in a way because I think that again Healthcare is one of these Goods that unlike most other Goods there's a marginal the marginal demand demand for marginal Health Care is virtually infinite well amongst the three of us nobody is willing to sacrifice marginal health care right you and I are probably willing to sacrifice marginal you know clothing right there's only so much money I'm going to spend on clothing there's only so much money I'm going to spend on on this or that but if you had infinite money like the thing you'd probably prioritize is your health you know your livelihood and well-being and I think that that makes it kind of the special that in service and that's why we've spent we've gone from 75 of our GDP on Health Care to 20 and I think that's going to go to 50 over time because our basic goods and needs are mausoleilian kind of needs or Med you know we can eat we can have shelter Etc et cetera we ultimately just want to live forever there's no this reason why the Silicon Valley trillionaires they want longevity right they want like the they want to be around forever because you know Larry Ellison you know I grew up kind of you know a little bit fanboying or worshiping you know his life goal is to live forever and he's not gonna make it but this this idea that all these guys sort of have in their minds that if they spend their billions they'll live forever it's it's there because they love their whites right the average person Africa probably doesn't think about it that way I think they'd like to but their their Life's a lot harder uh in America we're really lucky we want to live forever because of that and I think that makes Health you know one of these things where it's demand side driven you know we like to think that Healthcare expenses are going up because of people like me or people like the Milan CEO or the vicer CEO they're only because we all demand Healthcare we want health for everyone our families our friends our progeny we all want Healthcare uh you know to to we're going to consume more and more of it over time our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better I I want to ask you about your new thing and then I want to ask about your predictions but first when you got out of prison how much of that nut did you still have left and what do you do with your money now what are you investing in now or are you just doing like are are you even allowed to trade and are you just doing like boring index funds are you doing more risky stuff what are you doing yeah so I got into a very interesting litigation so I was able to pay my court my criminal fines very very relatively easily it was around 8 million bucks um in that process I I decided to sell the Wu-Tang album uh which is a funny thing because there's this nft bubble and I basically saw like if I turn this into an nft or sell to a crypto bro like you know I'll I might even get my money back on this thing because it was basically just you know a lark and I didn't think I'd uh I I marked it as down like 75 but I was able to actually turn a profit on it so I was happy to time that bubble well um so I was able to pay my criminal fines off but then I got into this litigation with the FTC uh the Federal Trade Commission actually personally sued me for Monopoly I'm the first person in American history the Sherman Act which is 125 years old the first person to personally be sued by the Federal Trade Commission which is very odd because John D Rockefeller Bill Gates Mark Zuckerberg a couple of people who are accused of monopolies their firms got sued I was actually the first person to personally be sued as a monopolist uh which is very odd uh and they won so I'm appealing that but they want a 60 million dollar hit against me so until I figure that out I'm sort of not not in the market um it's very like bizarre ruling that I think will get overturned but again it shows you that kind of like animus like this judge they made their ruling will that make you bro if I had to pay the 60 I think I I could pay the 60 but it's it's just like a colossal [ __ ] you know just a colossal like you know it hit in the gears of like stopping like the production basically so uh the company I also wanted to indemnified so the company will probably have to pay it but it's just a big like [ __ ] at the moment so you know I'm I'm sort of focused again the nice thing about being an entrepreneur and having faith in your talent and things like that is that even if you wiped me out and start at zero I wouldn't have a problem I think you know getting making several hundred million dollars I I think that any business I start you know it may not be this one or the next one but eventually with perseverance I'll have some great success and I think that there's not you know a bone in my body that doesn't believe that and I think when you can find great assets or great people and put Capital together with that that you know magic starts to happen and and it's a infectious and contagious and you know as long as you have your sort of Mooring straight you should be able to do it and I think that we we've already started that process so whether this litigation turns out that I'll have to pay you know six some amount of that's been paid by the company and if I don't have indemnification something could be maybe off to 8 30 or 40 million bucks and it would suck sure you know I'd have to sell my farm assets I'd have to you know make room would I could be able to cover it or not I'm not even 100 sure but you know it all depends on the sale price uh but you know even even if you sort of took everything for me yet you know and and added another 100 million I'd sort of be you know you know cheery about it and say all right it's a big challenge but I'll do it you know and I think that you know I don't I don't view sort of wealth and and success as as symmetrical or the the same thing I sort of say that you know um you know it's sort of almost like you know a challenge to sort of like do it the other way I know a lot of people like they make money to be comfortable like I almost feel like I make money to be uncomfortable okay I want I want the bigger challenges the harder things to do like you look at Elon Musk and you got you you gotta ask yourself like why is this guy making his life so much harder new businesses new ideas like what is going on in his head that he wants more pain because it's very painful to deal with all the headaches of these companies oh half your advertisers just left at Twitter oh by the way you still have to pay the interest like I should be sitting there like oh my God you know this is so much pain like why add this on top of my Tesla issues because you know there's 100 issues of that company you know it's 100 issues it's Basics and again business is going great at those companies but they're still intense issues that you have to deal with every day and you've got all their lawsuits and you've got all those things going on in your personal life you have eight kids I mean why add more [ __ ] to your to your your thing and I think the answer for me is like I love it you know I I love the game and you know whether or not you know my bank's accounts got this many zeros without any zeros I you know it's not like you're gonna be spending it you know it's it's uh it's just work you know I I sit in a room with my my team and I work all day and that's it so for me it's it's like I don't know if you fall in the fall but he has this great quote uh he has this like Twitter thread called uh how to get rich without getting lucky and he says something in there that I love which he goes um I don't want to just get rich I want to be a person who gets Rich meaning uh if you could drop if you took everything away from me and you dropped me you know sort of like butt naked in a third world country in 10 years I want to be wealthy again and I think I have this I have built the skills in order to do that and so that sort of reminds me of what you're talking about which is like look you might lose everything that you made in the last decade or have have uh have this sort of like reset but it give you 10 years you'll build back up and I think most great entrepreneurs are are built that way and wired that way and almost in a sick way kind of relish that that opportunity when that Misfortune strike there is some fortune in that Misfortune uh when a situation yeah it's sort of fun I mean in some ways like I think a lot of people you know like a comeback story too you uh you talked about the like you know you didn't want to be the Pfizer CEO you didn't want you you kind of knew what you needed you could have said and you decided like f that like I don't wanna I don't want to do business I'm putting words in your mouth a little bit but it's sort of like I don't want to be a CEO that type of CEO and I don't want to play the game of Entrepreneurship I don't like the world when it's less interesting when people don't actually say what's on their mind or uh can speak like a normal human being versus being like this like very tightly wound you know corporate you know uh uh duck and so I don't know if you've seen this but have you seen have you guys seen this movement that happened at Stanford the fun Strikes Back movement so have you heard about this yeah no absolutely it's awesome there's basically so there was like the student body election I guess and I don't know the full story because I just read about this I was reading about this this morning I was supposed to be prepping for this but the story fascinated me instead and um basically there was a group of people that are at a group of students that were running at Stanford and they won the election on this movement that they're calling Fun strikes back and they're basically like dude you know campus in the university has just drained us of our personality it is trying to shut down all the fun things that they're like we are Pro Athletics we're pro fraternities we are pro partying and we are pro-weirdness and they basically talk about like the the story they do a great job telling the story they're like you know back in 1981 um this you know there's this frat party where that they threw every year where there was sand all over the house uh like a beach party or whatever and at the end of the night like the the party was over people left but the sand was still there they're like [ __ ] what are we gonna do with all this sand we still have so much insane they're like what if we built an island with the sand and they're like there's this little Lake what if we took all the sand to the middle of the lake we made an island and that could be our Island and they like rallied at four or five in the morning and they go there and then the groundskeepers like guys you can't bring a bulldozer here like an excavator to like dump this here and they're like sir we want to do this for this reason this is our moment this is our Legacy like think about this years from now people will wonder how the hell this Island was built and tonight is that night and the guy's like all right go ahead okay and he like lets them in they pulled the island and it's this epic party or whatever it's the Epic finish and then like fast forward to today like uh the island got the island is gone the lake is gone they shut everything down nobody can visit that little Pond or that lake anymore because there was like an endangered salamander there so they're like no no shut it down guys and then like one by one they've kicked off all the fraternities from from the from the campus for like whatever violation they hit a violation They removed them from campus they like scraped all the like each each neighborhood used to have its own name and its own like weird weirdness they scraped it all off and now it's just like numbered cells it's like you're on the D Block 657. they're like dude we used to have like the biggest part of the year was this anything but clothes party and they decided that that's too risky and it's not fair to everybody and they're like I always wonder Sean like who are the pro like what did my prosecutors and like judges and like regulators and people like Elizabeth Warren what did they do in college this is what they did in college they shut down the party and they're like no this is offensive we gotta shut this party down right you know it's like who are these people and why do we ever let any of them have any power and it's it's frustrating to me that like you know schools like Sanford and many others have had to like go through this like identity crisis of like I'm scared to say what I want because you know uh what if somebody's gonna be offended and it becomes this meta game where like we were talking about like yeah could I like do the party line and say I'm really sorry my actions have caused you know uh some misunderstanding and blah blah blah and have this non-apology apology but then in like Japan the way you say no can be found to be insulting so you just move the meta but like the next you know level where it's like oh you saw the way he said no he didn't really mean it you know the way he said I'm sorry he wasn't really apologetic there's a real way to say I'm sorry you got to Bow a little bit deeper and it's like okay well so it's it's an insane meta where you're constantly just like getting to the next point of of like inhibiting your personality and what are you really saying and just come out and say it you know and I think that that's a really freeing you know thing to do yeah I don't know if it's on sub stack but I'm on your newsletter and like you made some wild predictions I don't remember all the predictions but like you may you you actually had a really good post where you said like this is gonna happen I think in 2023 this will happen in 2030 I think in 50 years this will happen and uh I I it would be actually be fun to look back at some of your predictions so far are turning out to be true but it's very interesting and you're you're pretty good at writing actually you're quite good actually thanks a lot you know it's it's hard to write um you know uh for professionally like you guys I know Sam um well I know Sean does for sure if you when you're an entrepreneur doing anything other than working on your business seems like a waste of time and like a a really uh painful thing to do uh because you have to provide for your investors or co-workers your own family the business you love you know it's it's uh it's hard to to do a lot of writing in prison it was a lot easier you know it was uh you know I had more time to think but even then I was I was actually really busy people will ask me if I was you know uh you know bored in prison and like it was the furthest thing from it a lot of people ask me why didn't you get jacked up you know in in prison I just didn't have the time you know uh I was I was working the whole time so you know it's it's always hard to write I love writing but but to to do anything a lot of people ask me if I don't why don't I do a podcast and it's the same reason and you know the predictions about AI are are you know some of them Echo kind of like other people's predictions you know in a lot of ways we have large language models now they're really interesting uh they certainly provide for more eye-opening potential predictions you know probably some of the craziest ones I've I've made including include things like they'll be kind of inner species marriage between Ai and humans they'll be AI fundamental rights for for voting and things like that that'll kind of reshape Society so they're pretty wild predictions but I do think they'll happen years from now and I do think we're starting to see some of those things pull in and get accelerated uh one of my favorite people John claremack recently upgraded his estimate of AGI so-called artificial general intelligence from 50 by 2030 to 60 percent you know John is like this very precise you know calculating nerd who's you know you know created the first person shooter he you know His Brilliant guy and he's working on his own company which nobody's talking about uh called Keen Technologies uh and I think he's the only employee if I'm not mistaken so he's just sitting there live trying to create like this this brain uh and you know who knows I think he's a good Dark Horse for this race but no AGI is like how is super captivating to everyone right like it's it's to me if you look at the history of humanity next to maybe relativity or you know a couple of other like magnetism electricity like this is like probably more important and it's the first time humans will have created a mind from from nothing that's stronger than human and it's really like just so profound that you know I don't think anybody can afford to to ignore it it's more profound than the internet you know it's it's really you know something wild now we don't know when we'll get it we'll get a partial version of it or we're already seeing a partial version of it you know it's it's sort of early days but while I was in prison I was able to think sort of zoom out and think about that a little bit more than maybe the average person and it's funny if you look at sort of open Ai and some of the other startups that are coming out uh these these sort of companies like Google and Facebook you see that they kind of did that zooming out many years ago and the companies that are sort of missing this and messing it up are kind of like too close to the to sort of reality and and the day-to-day product management to even see it and really understand it that people wanted this you know Microsoft both both Facebook and Google had a sort of equivalent technology to open AI in my opinion years ago and they just still just haven't sort of seen the actual product you know making sense and launching and um anyway you know it's a really interesting time obviously what's your uh what's the new thing so I'm releasing in the next uh a day or two maybe even today an AI position this will go live tomorrow this will go live tomorrow so it might be up so what what is there a URL so you're you're breaking the news uh and it's so funny in happenstance because we're talking to like TechCrunch and like all these places we never we didn't really find like the perfect reporter who could report on this so here we go uh it's called drgupta dot AI uh it's a the first of its kind AI physician um it's basically going to be uh what I hope something that could drastically reduce health care costs interactive drastically improve Healthcare quality uh by providing an AI uh physician mimic basically sort of a synthetic AI doctor that that will can give you medical information and I think that you know most is your doctor or what Doctor Gupta like he happens to be Indian but it's also GPT so Gupta um so anyway Dr Gupta will give you medical information and uh you can talk to him it's free um it's uh to me what a lot of people didn't understand about my price increase and stuff like that one of the other reasons I was out there like 50 of them is that ninety percent of health care costs come from Physicians 10 Comfort Pharma something what does that mean we spend four trillion dollars on Healthcare in this country most of that money goes to Physicians and healthcare workers and a lot of that I love doctors I love nurses I don't have anything against them a lot of those decisions can be done by machines a lot of those decisions thanks to open Ai and and deep learning and LL models can be done by AI so can we take that 4 trillion and make it 2 trillion that would be a big deal you know the whenever Cuban's doing is not going to save anybody any money and it's not gonna make Mark any money either but this it could actually change the curve on health care give us a 30 seconds on give us a 30 seconds on why Cubans thing you you've referenced a couple times it might be dumb or or not that it's such a [ __ ] show like so so he's basically running a pharmacy right so he's trying to Source drugs for cheaper then mind you every other Pharmacy is pretty good at sourcing medicine and I don't know how he's going to get a deal on you know say Teva or her sons generics any better than than CVS or Walgreens that seemed kind of hard to do that right he's they he doesn't have the volume they have get that deal and then somehow get a margin Pharmacy margins is a razor razor freaking said right you cannot take a three dollar drug and charge 100 bucks for a pharmacy their razor just look it's 10q for Walgreens and say yes like well I'm making a fortune here and so he's gonna somehow get a margin out of that there's just it's just Hocus Pocus there's no actual way to do that you know it's it's a bunch of likes basically he's being dishonest so I'm on Dr oopa Dr gupa AI uh so I see the thing so it I I tell it my age how tall I am my weight some of my vitals if I have lab results I entered in and then what's gonna happen next it's gonna say like you should check out you should work on this this and this no you don't actually even have to enter any of your vitals you could just have a conversation and we've programmed it using these like very you know intricate techniques I was actually you know a lot of people are talking about Auto GPT and and baby GPT and I talked to Yohe and I talk to all the people in Mena that's up you never know what people are doing privately but we started doing the auto reflective GPT stuff six months ago and we were able to discover that depending on the technique you use you can get better chat results than chat GPT and I don't think openai disputes this we've screened thousands of messages that we've tried with the system and we get better better performance than chat gbt by making it kind of like Auto reflect and do other kind of methods that again are secret sauce that get the chat bot to succeed so it's not so much about that medical view it's you can get Physician Quality advice for free at any time any hour so you and I may be able to call a doctor friend but most people cannot just decide at midnight that if they have a medical question that they can get an answer you have to go on Google you got to go ask WebMD and you don't know what you're reading half the time if you're the average Joe you know you're not trained in medicine if you say well what about my chest pain what should I do you want to talk to somebody you want to actually have a conversation LMS do that amazingly this isn't is a is an attraction of gpt4 they'll actually let you have a natural dialogue with something that as you guys know gpt4 scores 90 percent on the USMLE it's a 90 performing most doctors don't score 90 on the boards GPT is a ace doctor uh when it comes to medical knowledge so being able to ask an ace doctor at any time for free about medical information medical advice you know it's pretty profound product I think because again we spend trillions of dollars on Physicians a lot of the Physicians were to be done by Ai and it's an uncomfortable truth that you know again it doesn't mean that we don't need doctors ever again in my world in my vision 50 years from now there's no such thing as a medical doctor there's no such thing as a physician that's like I'm on the site I can I can get 50 messages for free or I pay 20 bucks a month what's the end game here do you think this is going to be a massive company or is this like uh a thing where you're like I don't know what's gonna happen let's let's figure it out or are you trying to get after it what are you trying to do in the next five or ten years with this business yeah I'm trying to make it a massive company um I think that you know it you know it will be a massive company you never say never in business but you know we're certainly gonna try our hardest because I do think that you can all this is why technology has never really been the curve for healthcare the cost of sending a megabyte the cost of sending uh you know storing data the call to compute all that has dropped by not just like 90 it dropped by like 99 and in six more nines percent Healthcare has not moved a bit why it's because of this Lobby that exists the AMA restricts the amount of people who could become doctors the supply is constrained you cannot just graduate a million more doctors tomorrow if we could do that what would happen the price of Medical Services would drop like a rock we our country would be saved Medicare and Medicaid wouldn't be going bankrupt we have a huge wouldn't be bankrupting us if we had a million more doctors tomorrow Healthcare wouldn't be a problem in America the problem is we don't have a million more doctors in America one of the reasons is there's not going to be a million people who pass med school the other problem is the AMA specifically says there's only this many Medicals there's only this many uh doctors graduating from med school we're gonna make it really hard to become a doctor even though AI can do all these things very easily and you're going to see a lot of Industries collapse because of GPT I think whether it's law medicine accounting there's going to be a huge change in society thanks to Ai and GPT so how is this not like self-driving cars where even though self-driving is almost like better than a human in in a bunch of different circumstances maybe not certain weather conditions uh but if it gets one thing wrong it's you know all the news and all the lawsuits and so they need to be not just better they need to be so much better that they can kind of overcome that like how do you not just get sued out of existence for the you know the the you know one mistaken medical diagnosis or or um you know treatment plan or whatever it is here how do you how do you avoid that problem sure I think it's a lot like like self-driving cars where if you gave me the story where there's 50 000 all the fatalities a year right in America and I can press this button right here and there's gonna be twenty thousand there's two types of people in the world there's the first type of person who says that's amazing 30 000 lives saved 30 000 less funerals thirty thousand less torn families destroyed by needless you know terrible you know uh automobile fatality what a horrible you know thing I'm so happy I can't wait to push that button you know anything stop me from pushing that button is is insane right so why would you delay that for half a second and then you've got the kind of person similar to the Stanford party who says well wait a second are there going to be 20 000 deaths from from this that's an outrage I can't believe it don't push that button and obviously one side is riding one side's wrong you know but the the the technical progress of the world cannot be stopped I'm part of this IAC group effective accelerationism which is this like new movement that's counter effective altruism so you see the E forward slash ACC we've got a lot of really exciting members some of the biggest people in technology uh and it's this sort of like underground movement of people who don't want to slow down AI but people who don't want to slow down uh technology and I think that um you know the idea that we're here to stop progress because the technology might make one mistake and remember that's sort of like stopping the automobile because the automobile itself was an improvement over the horse we have to move forward in the world we can't look back and nitpick on every single mistake in life and I think that's that's sort of I know that's not how you feel Sean but that kind of criticism and that kind of like attitude is such a terrible pernicious threat to our well-being that like we have to look at the class not just have full because it's 90 full we can't look at the 10 that's empty right yeah I mean I get it philosophically it's like the trolley problem it's like 10 people the Train's gonna run over 10 people if I pull this lever it'll run over those other two and uh you know there's a whatever people have people feel different ways about that I guess what I mean is like practically speaking that for this company like how does this company not die because something like that's gonna happen what are you going to do like what do you think our purpose and policies make sure that you understand that this is medical advice Dr coop is not a real doctor that if you uh use our website for medical information it's simply for informational purposes only and you have to I mean I can reach the whole disclaimer but the reality of the matter is that do you want somebody who's 75 years old okay who has uh pneumonia but doesn't know that they have pneumonia uh they have a cough but they're gonna die in pneumonia if they don't go to hospital next three days do you want that person running around Google trying to figure out if they have pneumonia or not or do you want them to to go to an llm what's better if you don't have the llm they're going to go to Google they're going to go to WebMD they're going to try to read it on their own they're going to mess it up there's a decent chance whereas if you go to llm you might actually get the superior technology that may save their life so you're net improving it and if you don't want a net Improvement then you're Elizabeth Warren you're a lotite you're et cetera Etc and if you want the Improvement you're on the side right side of history and I think that if you look at the way technology informs regulation not the other way around right regulation has to serve the people if the people are getting the benefit the people will demand the right side if you have people that want to stand in a way of of improvement that's up to them listen if if we're told you got a block Dr Gupta in this state or this country okay the Philippines will have it remember TPT is is is um knows every single language it's lingual in every single language in the world so Japan will have this for free tomorrow it's like Pitbull Mr worldwide right it's a global product and that's the amazing thing about being a developer you normally have to worry about localization right language all that crap it's gone now it's CPT this Dr Gupta knows every language they beta tested this in Spanish we might localize him and make him like doctor somebody else in in Latin America but Dr Gupta matches GPT our other option was Dr Lim llm so oh we picked Dr Dr Gupta because he's literally Dr GPT honestly it's kind of a genius name as an Indian person I I will give it my seal of approval uh I think that's is very clear thank you very clever um about six months ago or nine months ago I was talking to you and you had a crypto company that was like a 3D modeling company for drugs what happened to that company did you ditch it or is it you do both or what so it's all it's all under one Hood so our company is called DL software uh we've raised some some money from from some really well-known people in in the valley it's been you know again an interesting dilemma where you have like people who want to support you like all these people actually said that my YouTube Finance videos you mentioned content creating that it got them through like a stain Adventure Time I watched a ton of those I watched all those thank you and and like I'm so lucky that these people some of whom started some of the biggest software companies in our industry uh literally like maybe the top five unicorns and software like three of the Four Seasons like that where where like I messaged these guys they're like oh you're my teacher I'm like so flattered you know that these billionaires are are like on myself that really happened and they're like yeah sorry that really happened yeah a billionaire several millionaires you know several billionaires are lusters in our several billionaires have smashed the Subscribe button hit the turn notifications on leave leave a message in the comments on YouTube I love it it's really really humbling because it's like you know you know you couldn't find that kind of content where like you could you could talk to somebody who was a publicly traded company CEO showing you like step by step kind of what their job was like and I think more than just like how to read a balance sheet I taught an attitude too that kind of the one thing I learned from grammar which is like this hardcore attitude of like you love this stuff you're up like people would watch me stream like four in the morning like getting ready to go you know tear the world and a new [ __ ] because I'm so like excited about doing my job and I think it got a lot of people out of a funk or out of like a hard time and like just pushing people like push harder push harder that worked for so many people at these at these unicorns these Mega unicorns these like 10x unicorns that that yeah that's why I said you're amazing at content because you have the trifecta there's three things it takes to be great at content the first is unique perspective or you need unique POV right so you you have unique unique specific set of knowledge that the average person doesn't have okay that's most people would expect that now here's the unexpected ones you do energy transmission so uh most content is actually just a transfer of my energy and excitement or outrage about whatever it is to you and if I'm able to express it if I can show you that I'm Juiced up about this I've watched you at your computer that you like get up you do push-ups on the ground you're like pumped up about whatever or you're calling somebody out or whatever it is it's energy transmission and the last thing you're like a reality TV person you kind of know what you're supposed to say but you don't really care and you want to say what you like you don't really care you care more about like uh saying the thing than what people will think of you saying the thing and uh some for some reality TV people it's because they're just not aware they don't know it you know it and you just don't care you like override that sensor and you're like no that sensor doesn't get to decide what's going on here and so you have you have all three and I think that that's what makes your streams so impressive like you said at the beginning of this I don't do the like just wing it but I I've seen you just wait and I actually think that's your best content so I don't know what you meant by that we're just like closing the loop on it like I only started those streams because you know I didn't want people to think I was the farmer bro which I was like being characterized as and I basically wanted people to like judge for themselves like see a day in my life see if like you think I'm a dick or not and some people said yeah I still think you're a dick but I've seen people said you know I kind of like this guy and you know maybe this is like a little bit of what I want to be like um and so the point is like I'm so lucky that the people who watched that in 2015 2016 obviously not all of them became [ __ ] but a handful of them the top couple people became unbelievably successful and that's maybe because of me maybe not because of me maybe it's in spite of me you know but the the whole point that they some of them thank me for it is as I'm really lucky for that I have three software products under or sort of umbrella here but I think that like the key thing for our company is is getting amazing talent you know in in any industry but especially in Tech like the only really thing that matters is this combination of capital and people and you know the capital is easy to get you know there's there's in infinite capital in the world it's it's about you know do you have the people to execute the plan and and I'm so lucky that like a little bit of this personal profile gets great Engineers to come to the table and talk doesn't always get them in the door but the fact that like we can do that and like the one skill I have as a manager to your to your to your point is that energy transfer like getting people like can you can I pump you up about making a synthetic doctor well to some people that might be really boring and if you pitch it the wrong way if you're like at a big Healthcare Company you're like well we're going to make medical information you know uh diagnostic tools Etc et cetera it sounds like [ __ ] you know but if you if you do it the right way and you explain to the engineer that there's if we do our jobs right there's no such thing as a doctor in 30 years that every operation every prescription every piece of medical advice you ever get from now on comes from a machine and it costs 10 cents that changes the world that's something that you're gonna leave a legacy we're gonna make a fortune we're gonna have a lot of fun and it's Gonna Change the World for everyone for the Indonesian that can't see a doctor for 30 days and the doctor they're seeing is a very questionable variety you know in in Providence to be able to get the best medical expertise of an American physician that's insane right and we're getting that tomorrow and I think that again you can't get a prescription from Dr Gupta and he's not going to cut out your bunion but I think that the fact that we can even talk Touch by 10 of health care costs that's hundreds of billions of dollars it's bigger than Google's Tampa it's a whole like you know Healthcare is one of these just gigantic spots that has never been chunked by by technology despite the best attempts of Sand Hill Road like billions of dollars flew into digital hell there's just no obvious way to take a sledgehammer of this you have to understand that Healthcare is is basically all money that goes to people who just slosh it around for this like very AI simple simple problem for AI for that little advice of yeah you should take this beta Walker should not take this Beta Blocker we should do the surgery or not do the surgery and that human advice is really important but at the same time like you know a good chunk think of it could probably be automated the last thing I wanted to bring up was like so I I ran this company called The Hustle which we wrote about you and you actually were homies with uh Brina this woman who worked for me and you were like at one point we were like hey come visit me in San Diego and I remember like yeah and Trung yeah and I remember like right when your story broke it was Pharma bro and then I got to like I you and I chatted on blab before and I I don't know if you remember we've taught before I'm like it's funny this guy's not really a bro at all like he's he's just a nerd he's just like care he like you know he talks a lot like and he's confident but he's like like a pretty nerdy guy and the reason it's so funny about media perception the reason your story did I think the way it all like started was do you have this picture I'm looking at it now it's you wearing like Ray-Bans and a red Polo and you have like a picture of what looks like Flowrider in the back like on a music video in a Bugatti and you're like pointing down like this and you're like your jawline looks cut and you look like the broyiest of Bros and I remember when we wrote this story in the hustle we tried a bunch of different photos and that photo did best because it's just like you're just like giving into this big old stereotype and uh [ __ ] picture ruined you man so the backstory is funny like we had just done this stock trade it was in my personal account we made 20 million dollars shorting uh the stock called vital therapies they were developing a liver dialysis machine we spent day and night stalking this company and figuring out everything about the attempt to make a liver dialysis machine works for a kidney really well they wanted to take that same idea and apply to the liver sounds good right doesn't work there are a lot of technical reasons me and two colleagues spent day in day out stalking figuring this coming out we wrote a 40-page report we put the report out the stock fell like 40 just on the report two weeks later the drug the device ended up proving that it didn't work it didn't help anybody with severe liver disease then the stock went down like 90 and we were short the stock and so the day went down we did that uh the Florida song is called it's going down or something like that and so I was like you know doing this like thing because like we thought these guys were basically fraudsters you know lying about their liver device which had proven that it doesn't even help people it probably hurts them but they were still trying to get through that like Venture Capital grind and and uh public grind of like lying and trying to make [ __ ] stick and and make put the best you know spin on things and so when we shorted it and it went down it was going down you know that was the kind of joke and I was like oh how funny would it be if I you know dressed up like a bro for a second and like we had a friend in the trade too we had a couple friends in the trade like putting it on Twitter was was kind of like a oh check it out like it's going down because of us because we wrote the short report and again what the next like two weeks the same I made it like my profile pic in like the next two weeks like that that's what everyone seized on it's like oh yeah yeah like this picture is like it's just so funny like I don't know the whole fact of your story and you admitted wrongdoing and everything but it's like it was it was Amplified and uh this picture was like the beginning of the end for you this one picture that's what it seems because I remember this one picture going the beginning of an interesting story I I to me like now I'll take it and try like you would look at it and many other people's look at us beginning the end I look at it as Life's a just a crazy ride it's a crazy movie you know it would be very boring to like be a value investor for the next 50 years and make 100 billion dollars doing gram and Dodd stock picking like so it's right for somebody else thought right for my life and it is the path I chose you know not like you know it was an intentional choice you know maybe not the wisest choice but it is the choice for me and you know I I don't regret having had like a really interesting exciting life there are moments of it that weren't fun but there's it's still one of these things where I'm not like deeply ashamed of like something I did or something like that like it's a conscious choice I made to sort of like do the things I did the photo was you know it was alarming to me that the media could take like an image and say okay this is this person what's what's cast it this way and I think it sort of backfired in the long run you know I I'm sort of popular than ever and you know kind of doing just fine so so if you there's a price to be paid if you could go yeah if you could go back would you have advised you know if you can go back and kind of whisper in the ear of yourself at any point in time you know would you have told yourself hey if you're going on TV don't don't don't say that thing don't don't be smugged don't do this don't do that would you have played it differently knowing what you know now I think I I think like you know there's two sides of the story with like the rationalist would say of course you know like tone it down here you know tuck in your you know tug that in there tuck in your shirt there you know straighten up there uh metaphorically but the the I think the oldest wisdom is know thyself right and it's like just be yourself know yourself be who you are and like if you spend the rest of your life trying to make somebody else happy and and conforming to society it's gonna be not a life worth living and if you spend your life answering to your own conscience I think then you know you you can no matter what happens No Matter Stick put you in jail for lesser life you'll you'll have the at least have something nobody could take away from you which is like your your own identity and your own personality and I think there's a lot like William Wallace like William Wallace and Braveheart you know they'll take our freedom or whether they say they'll take our lives we'll never take our freedom you know there's there's there's a point in time where you have to be a real person and I think like if you want to be a corporate sort of like mimic of like every other corporate person in the world you know that's a that's a life issue that's life you want that that's life you want there's just only so much of the life that that I can take and for me I had it when it came to like the media like you said you know with with the Flo Rida picture or or whatever the typecasting it was like you know I I can't that's that's a line that was too much for me so I think it's it's probably more reactive than anything else like Hillary Clinton tweeting at me and stuff like that it was like so surreal like me you know the mild man or pharmaceutical executive yeah I'm I'm the object of your [ __ ] scorn you know this is nuts you know so a lot of it was that like provoke and and be provided like it you know it it was not like easy to to sit there and just do nothing so like it's easy like yeah I'll turn it on you guys like it's very easy to sort of throw advice out but when you're in a hot seat and somebody says oh aren't you this and aren't you that and you know you say well you know I'm sorry I caused some disturbance here and I'm just really you know uh it's really hard to do that you know sometimes you um first of all that's hilarious second of all uh you don't know a super well but before our old kind of podcast setup Sam used to have these photos on the wall of like his hollow there's like personal Hall of Fame and it'd be like you know some Inspirations from business like Sam before he started the hustle he really loved Ted Turner he's like dude this guy like made the [ __ ] news business and he's a baller like he he attacked it in this way he had Nate Diaz up there he's like I love this guy he's a UFC fighter he's like just a badass that just takes this attitude into into life that's that we like you know I like Conor McGregor and I think you know he's interesting and I like you know certain things that he's done about his life you know I don't like all of these people I just like certain things I took inspiration from certain things at certain periods of certain people's lives who were kind of who are some people that you were inspired by either in the business world or the non-business world uh that that you think are you sort of have admired or you've gone down the YouTube rabbit hole and just you know uh binged a bunch of their content or whatever I'll start with Vince McMahon um you know so when I when I started to be this like bad guy and I realized that there was nothing I could do to change that narratives like I could do a two hour interview with ABC you're the Healer and they would take the 30 seconds that [ __ ] me and and make the 30 seconds Loop and like forget the other you know 119 minutes those 30 seconds or the ones that are gonna be on TV I realize like there's no way out of this and I'm gonna have to embrace being the bad guy and some people will get the joke and and some people won't uh but you know [ __ ] it if if if that's what people want then I'll be the bad guy and I sort of embrace Ida being this jerk and trying to dress down you know the so-called Authority uh figures um by by sort of pointing you know pointing the the mirror back at them um so Vince Vince sort of like had that like kafabe wrestling you know they call it a heel in wrestling uh where you know he's he's the owner of the company but he's also kind of like breaking down that fourth wall of like some of the stuff he's talking about on the show oh is like related to actual boardroom battles and like some of the you know stuff on the show is is completely contrived and you know it's just a fantastic product and I like the company and what they've done with it over the years so you know I'm a big fan of Vince's um you know I I like a lot of like different scientists and stuff like that um you know so business people themselves you know there aren't a whole lot that I like point to and say oh that's somebody I'd like to be like or something like that but growing up I always like Bill Gates who was kind of this you know smug hated by the way in 94 Bill Gates was was sued for Monopoly but his company was not him and people wanted to tear this guy apart and I was just sort of coming up I was like 11 years old I love computers I started programming and I was like everyone hates Bill Gates in the hacker Community hated Bill Gates and and it's because he wanted to make money and he's not apologetic about it and I kind of like this guy I liked the contrarianism of being like you know what I like Microsoft I like building no one's willing to say that and like we wouldn't have these things that we're all using Microsoft products right now like what would we be doing without it and you know the Linux nerds would be like well you know we can we don't have to use them and it's like look The Whole World's using them for a reason they're pretty good products and I I just sort of liked taking that bad guy and at the time he was really hated and sort of saying you know I'm on his side you know the media was on his case because he was the richest guy in the world but couldn't afford a good haircut you know they always just dog him for no reason and he spent the rest of his life like trying to walk back on that and like how cool it had been if he sort of embraced The Narrative like yeah you know because privately he doesn't race The Narrative right it's just a it's just sort of this public image of like no no I'm I'm this benevolent philanthropist you don't understand you know privately the guy's still just as ruthless still just as vicious and just as energetic and intense as he was when he was a kid so you know it's it's all this like you know imagery for for nothing um and you know there's a number of other folks like uh Henry Nicholas who started broadcom you know I I mean I there's just so many people that you know I've studied in business over the years that I like Tom petters from interactive brokers um so many people I admire that that did things their way um and and made it work uh people especially who who sort of have come from nothing came from like with very little on their back a lot of people dog George Soros uh you know who's you know uh a true American success story and people sort of forget that you know or don't understand that like all the stuff in politics and like service funded prosecutor and stuff like that that barely pays attention to [ __ ] you know I think that like the idea that he's spending his day like plotting with you know the uh you know the world economic forums like around the world is this like right-wing meme that's just not not based in reality and you know the guys work in hedge funds and investing is is like truly remarkable how he came from like sort of the you know World War II basically to to America to become truly successful so people like that I admire you know anyone who's sort of had this Against All Odds type of success um you know even people like uh Robert Smith you know who run Vista um you know people who have like really bucked you know any conventions and expectations of them to to be really successful so there's so many people that I have up there on that wall uh and again it's not you know every like you said it's not every piece of their life but little pieces of sort of made me I have Bill Gates on mine because of the the interview where about the chair jumping over there I still think that's the most gangster like CEO interview moment I don't even know how this came up and then he he's she I think the interview was like you know how to jump over a chair he goes yeah no no he goes do it he goes I think it depends on the height of the chair and then it cuts to a chair and clearing it like Tony Hawk and I have no explanation why this was like is this what TV interviews were like back then like I can't imagine something like that's like being like Donald Trump like is it true you could win an arm wrestling match against anyone he's like well rolls up his sleeve it just like punks dude I'm watching this video by the way amazing it's not that impressive it's not a big chair you don't think you could jump over it never would have done something nerdy shrimpy guy he's actually 511. uh but like there's this jump over that chair yeah dude he takes a step I bet you could jump over the chair bro you need a chair I'll give you a chance I want to recreate this scene I'll we'll put it on our YouTube I don't think I could jump over this chair and I was like I I play basketball I think I I was I would in my head I'm more athletic than Bill Gates but honestly I can't claim that until I do this chair oh no man he's probably only 35 in this video I think you could jump to it I turn 35 next week it's perfect uh me versus Bill Gates head-to-head pay-per-view we gotta do it uh Martin thanks for doing this man um we appreciate it we um I know that like I don't I won't out you but I know that you've got like some Anonymous accounts online normally where can people find you but for you you get banned every like third week so it's not that useful and we were like is are we even talking to the real Martin it's even gonna come like what is he we weren't even sure if we were talking to the right guy the um interesting thing about that is I think the world's changing quite a bit like like the sensitivity of banning people on Twitter has now given away so I'm actually starting to talk to Twitter I still need my old Twitter account is at Morton shkreli it's in the process hopefully being on band but any anybody that can help me get that on band I'd really appreciate it um uh right now I'm at Marty underscore catboy which an ex-girlfriend made for me which you know uh has stock for some reason not my Carlos Twitter handle you know on Instagram on Mario's probably 15. um yeah I I love social media but you know getting banned from I'm banned from Tinder and hinge and you know like so many odd you know social medias uh on YouTube but you're banned from Tinder why I don't know I think like part of it is this um that's like the definition of a [ __ ] block right like they just banned you from dating what's going on I I think this cancel cancel culture like extends into virtually anything right and uh for Tinder it's it's uh you know you can argue that like well how do we know it's the real person right that that sort of one argument but even then like I just think there's somebody at the match herb that just doesn't like me um but you know it is what it is uh I'll live but yeah Twitter is uh is like this my lifelong goal is to get unbanned from Twitter because it's been seven years and I actually went to jail for a shorter period of time than I've been in Twitter jail so like you know I I was banned I went to prison came out and I'm still banned for what did you get banned just like you like asked somebody to get you a lock of Hillary Clinton's hair wasn't that the reason why it wasn't that it was it was I was teasing this woman who who I was it was like this very left-wing journalist and I was kind of like ripping her a little bit over politics and stuff like that and apparently I went too far but like it was obviously you know selective bias I mean it was like insanely selective for a lifetime beta you know it was a joke uh I made about her husband or something and it was just like too far and it's like look words are in that and dangerous you know yeah nobody's getting hurt by these words you know and they're going back and forth It's a two-way street you know out but it you know what I did was way too over the line and what she did was totally fine you know it was just this like insane uh perspective so I'm hoping Elon or somebody can get me unbanned because it's been seven years uh and I was skyrocketing with followers and Views and that's the thing about cancel culture right you have somebody who's taking off their narrative is is boosting they're improving I was improving my reputation daraprim was starting to look like the rear-reviewed mirror of me I was moving on the controversy was over a revenue was doing fine and then you know Twitter said no can't let you keep going right and it's like if you try to stop people from like taking back their narrative and you you can halt them like that it's a very dangerous thing for Tech to be able to censor people like that like imagine having somebody become really controversial and say no I want to tell my side of the story and somebody says no you don't get that chance you know it's kind of a disgusting thing well dude we appreciate this man that you're a fascinating person and we hope that uh I imagine we'll be talking more um I'm very curious to see how Dr Dr Gupta is going to do um but thank you for for coming and doing this we were like I said we were like I'm not sure if he's coming or not we're not we're 50 50 chance so I'm happy we made this happen and we appreciate you thank you so much guys all right we'll talk soon awesome that's it that's the pod [Music] foreign

you know it turns out that the Red Cross is not looking for a nightclub promoter Doctors Without voters are they're looking for credible doctors not you know DJs or promoters so I remember being so uh dejected by the rejections and then one organization wrote me back and said if you are willing to pay us 500 a month to volunteer and if you're willing to go live in the poorest country in the world a country I'd never even heard of called Liberia and it was at the bottom of the United Nations development chart because it had just come out of a 14-year Civil War and there was finally data on the country that they could stack rank it at the bottom of the world and they said we are taking a medical Mission into this country and we'll take you if you pay us [Music] what's up uh I have Scott Harrison here we've been I don't know maybe planning to do at least in my head I've been planning to do an episode like this for a long time um so I invited myself on let's be honest you did invite yourself on but that's not that I love about you that's because I like you you are you're also like kind of unashamed you you are unashamed at like doing getting the right thing done um I met this guy once and he said if your intentions are good you can get away with anything and I don't know if that's you know I don't know if that's 100 true but I I do think it's uh it's it's a good motto don't be don't be too shy so yes you invite yourself on but I think it's gonna be a good one well the alternative was you want people to die a bad water so I mean right yeah well which one is it I'm just kidding um Scott's a good friend uh we met through uh mutual friend Michael Birch and then uh I went on a trip to Africa with Scott and saw the work that he was doing so that was kind of cool I'll say this so a lot of people click on this podcast because they're schemers and dreamers they're trying to figure out how to make money and we don't shy away from the fact that we enjoyed making money and we enjoy the game of business I think for most people here's their mindset coming in it's going to be charity episode uh okay you know maybe if I'm in the mood but I'm gonna tell you this so that person who's a little on the fence let me tell you this right now you're gonna love this episode way more than the normal one for two reasons the first is You're Gonna Be Inspired Scott's story is is very inspiring I've heard him tell it many times I'm giving gonna give him the opportunity to tell it here because it's kind of one of these like real life movies in a way and um he started off as a not so do-gooder and turned into a very do-gooder and I think the story is very good um and two he's basically he's an entrepreneur and he took an entrepreneurial approach to charity which I think very few uh I know I know personally of very few examples of that and he's a very good Storyteller and for all of you people who reach out to me saying oh Sean I love your stories well the master is here he's a much better Storyteller than me so if you take nothing else away from this you'll pick up a lot on storytelling that's those are my promises to you uh Scott how did I do you think that's a high music properly yeah I know no pressure luckily you've told this story once or twice before well I okay I like schemers and dreamers so I was definitely a schemer and dreamer at 18 years old I was born in Philadelphia raised in a Conservative Christian family and when I was four my mom passed out on the bedroom floor due to a carbon monoxide gas leak in our house so we just moved into this new house my dad was excited because it was reducing his commute he wanted to spend more time with me have a big family and she was the canary in the coal mine which her her unconsciousness led to the discovery of this gas leak and life was never the same again mom never really affected her because she was at home all the time you guys 24 7. that's right she was unpacking boxes from the move you know putting frames on the walls uh dad was working you know long hours at a job I was at school playing with my friends at their houses and she was she she bore the brunt of it and we my diamond actually got sick so we had some weird food allergies some migraines but she got really sick and this led to the discovery of the gas leak my dad ripped out the furnace with his bare hands he threw it out on the curb and from that point on her immune system was irreparably disabled and unfortunately I have 40 years of experience with the 3M family of masks so my mom was always masked from that point on charcoal mass n95 mass everything chemical made her sick so she was able to survive by creating isolation rooms for herself this sounds strange but my mom lived in a tin foil covered bathroom and she slept on an army cot that had been washed in baking soda 20 times she was so sensitive that if she wanted to read a book I would have to either bake her book in the oven or set it outside for a couple days in the sun to get that smell of print out then I would knock on the door I would hear the tin foil rustle I would hand her the lightly baked book and with her mask on and a pair of gloves she would receive the book for me and shut the door so all that to say a very weird childhood uh in a caregiver role doing the cooking doing the cleaning you know helping my dad my dad was an amazing loyal man stuck buyer I believe that one day God would make sense of all this and you know my mom just lived with this for the rest of her life so you know the first kind of chapter of my life if you'd run into me as a young teenager I was gonna be a doctor I would get a cure mom and everybody else sick with a condition like hers uh instead I became a schemer and a dreamer and at 18. yeah I moved to New York City and just had that wake up moment now it's my turn now it's my turn to break the rules I don't want to take care of anyone anymore I want to take care of myself and I want to have sex and I want to do drugs and I want to drink and I want to be rich and famous and I stumbled into this job as a New York City nightclub promoter where you had a pretty good shot at achieving those markers of success and I I became really good at throwing parties uh at the high end selling thousand dollar bottles of Cristal selling 25 vodka Red Bulls that cost us 25 cents and creating spaces for movie stars and actors and musicians and you know fashion Moguls and designers to party and you know it couldn't have been more opposite maybe from the the slightly repressed Christian upbringing and you know a picture of my life 10 years later was me in a DJ booth with a famous DJ I'm spraying champagne down over the crowd puppies at table one Jay-Z's at table three and I'm at table two thinking I'm a rock star because we had prettier girls at our table Ben Jay-Z or puppy and and this was you know it was dinner at 10 the Nightclub at 12 and then after hours at five a.m and to bed at noon taking Ambien to come down with a whole lot of self-loathing you know if it caught up to us which it it did you know far too often towards the end of that so uh it was 10 years for me to realize that I had made a mess in my life I had come so far from the spirituality from the morality that my parents had tried to instill in me so far from wanting to become a doctor to help others and one day half my body went numb and uh you know maybe no surprise to anybody listening as I just described what I was doing but I just remember thinking like I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I've been living like I'm gonna live forever and now I'm gonna die in a week I've got some brain tumor I've got something very wrong with me because I can't feel half my body and I went to doctors and had MRIs and CT scans and you know they hooked diodes up to me in electromagnetic pulsing all that they couldn't figure out anything wrong with me uh but it was a wake-up call Sean that if I did die my Tombstone the best it could read would be here lies a man who's gotten a million people wasted because the only thing I had to show before when you were in the doctor's office and you fill out the little form where you're just like yes on all the questions it's like have you in the last six months consumed any drugs okay I remember being brutally honest yeah right because I think everybody kind of cheats a little like how many alcoholic drinks right you shave that by a half typically I think I was honest and like how many alcoholic drinks like 165 a week you know something just yeah how many packs of cigarettes two and a half a day um you know anyway they couldn't find anything wrong with me but this led to you know a pretty radical life change and and maybe the close of chapter two as this sycophantic hedonistic nightclub promoter living only for himself um and I I wondered whether I could start life over at 28 and really ask myself what would the opposite of my life look like you know I realized a pivot was not in order yo this was this was not a small course correction that needed to happen this was like do and think and say the 180 degree opposite of everything you've done and thought and said for the last 10 years and see how that plays out and I live for these kind of like these moments these self-talk moments I think most of life is just in my own head it's me it's me with me and we're having a conversation and so a lot of times it's small talk it's surface level stuff and then there are these times where I have the like the real conversation with myself in my head do you do you remember what that like well those days or like what made you really like have that that that conversation with yourself at that point yeah yeah well there was a faith piece so I started praying again and you know kind of going back and like hey what do I believe any of that stuff from childhood you know there was a lot of religion there was a lot of rules you know but but there was a lot of good in there as well so I sort of you know try to kind of come back to Faith again so there was a lot of prayer like you know God are you there uh and what should I be doing and is there is there anything else for me and I remember the self-talk uh really saying okay well if you're if you're exploring the opposite of your life um what would that look like and I thought well it would be volunteering on a humanitarian mission in the poorest country in the world that was the spec that would be the opposite of a nightclub you know bottles and models lifestyle and I remember from a I I was I'd taken some time driving just aimlessly North trying to you know find myself I wound up in Maine in an internet cafe on Moosehead Lake uh with dial-up Dell computers and I started applying to humanitarian Aid organizations that I tangentially heard of over the decade certainly not that I had given any money to but Doctors Without Borders saved the children Oxfam World Vision the Red Cross and I I was very clear that this is what I wanted to do give one year of the 10 years that I had selfishly wasted or lived and see if I could be useful well maybe no surprise I was denied by the first-hand organizations you know it turns out that the Red Cross is not looking for a nightclub promoter Doctors Without Borders are they're looking for credible doctors not you know DJs or promoters so I remember being so uh dejected by the rejections and then one organization wrote me back and said if you are willing to pay us 500 a month to volunteer and if you're willing to go live in the poorest country in the world a country had never even heard of called Liberia and it was at the bottom of the United Nations development chart because it had just come out of a 14-year Civil War and there was finally data on the country that they could stack rank it at the bottom of the world and they said we are taking a medical Mission into this country and we'll take you if you pay us every month and uh the the job or the volunteer role I signed up for was a photojournalist so I was going to be taking pictures in writing and I was always a pretty good writer and a pretty good hobby photographer you know through the club club years and I'd gotten a degree part-time at NYU for that because it was it was the easiest you basically did the real life version I don't even watch Seinfeld but I know about this episode where George is like Jerry of doing the opposite now whatever I used to do I do the opposite you basically had the real live version of that where you're like go from New York City nightlife You Know Rich famous fast living to I'm gonna go to the poorest country on Earth pay to volunteer and uh and basically donate a year of my time just to kind of course correct and like break my own frame and shift just it sounds like you didn't even have like a long-term plan or like this Grand Vision for yourself I was like I just need to shift like where this direction I'm going now into some I need a swerve in a hard turn and then a couple things happen yeah that's exactly right I wouldn't have told you more than a year of line of sight um I met the chief medical officer so I was going to be living on a hospital ship a 500 foot converted ocean liner that was 50 plus years old so not you know not a nice Cruise liner um and it had been gutted and turned into a state-of-the-art hospital with a very simple idea for this charity let's sail a giant hospital ship with the best doctors in the world on their vacation time and let's take it to people who can't afford Medical Care and and because we can control the environment let's bring them on the hospital ship perform these life-changing surgeries and then set them you know back on land with transformed lives and transformed health so I met the guy who is running this whole thing and his name was Dr Gary Parker and I learned that he was a plastic surgeon from California who had heard about this opportunity and he signed up for three months and when I walked up the gangway of this hospital ship to to surrender my passport he had been there 21 years so he never went back to his California plastic surgery practice and he dedicated two decades of his life to this work so I remember just thinking what if that's me what if it's not a year and I wanted to know everything I could about him and what two decades of service would look like or feel like or the impact that a person could have so my third day there um is the patient screening so the the ship's arrival has been announced by an advanced team Flyers have been posted throughout the country and we have been given the football stadium in the center of town the soccer stadium by the government to triage the people who might come to visit our doctors now I know we have 1500 available surgery slots to fill I remember thinking to myself like are there 1500 sick people with facial tumors or cleft lips or blind or lame uh with Leprosy like you know that sounds like a lot of people and I remember at 5 15 or 5 30 a.m putting on hospital scrubs it was still pitch black out jumping into this Convoy of Land Rovers with doctors and surgeons and nurses and we kind of snaked through the city and we came to the stadium and there were 5 000 people standing in the dark in the parking lot waiting for us to open the doors and that was such a powerful moment for me realizing oh crap we're gonna send 3 500 of these people home without seeing a doctor without any answer for their Affliction and I later learned to uh you're probably used to having a long line outside the door that was a good difference this was a bad thing now the parallels you know there have been some interesting ones um I later learned some of these people had walked for more than a month with their children from neighboring countries just hoping that a doctor might save their child's life so I remember Dr Gary said to me focus on the hope you know don't focus on the 3 500 people we're gonna send home focus on the 1500 people who are going to help and that's what I really did for that first year on the ship and I was documenting every single one of them before surgery and after surgery for the medical Library and that you know Mercy Ships would be able to use those photos to raise money and spread awareness to the work the other cool thing that happened was I was blasting my club list of 15 000 emails with pictures of facial tumors and flesh-eating disease and leprosy you know being healed and you know or or patients being operated on and you know back then email open rates were like a hundred percent so there were definitely a lot of unsubscribes you know I signed up for that cool Prada party you threw once but not like the tumor party um but then you know most people were intrigued they were fascinated I had no idea that there were doctors on a ship saving people's lives how do I get a piece of this how do I sponsor a surgery how do I come on the ship like you I remember somebody riding me from Chanel once she's like I sit here in a brightly lit cosmetic headquarters and I'm weeping you know because I want more like I want more than to sell makeup every day I want more for my life I want more purpose so I learned that maybe the same gift of promoting getting people to stand outside a Velvet Rope to cue to hope to get into a nightclub telling the story that if you came in my club and you spent thousands of dollars and you left with a cute boy or a cute girl then your life had meaning you know that same maybe gift or skills of promoting could be used to promote something entirely different and Redemptive and important for other people so the year ended and I just signed up for a second year because I didn't know what was next so let me go do this again for another year and that was when I found water so the second year I got off of the ship I spent more and more time I bought a motorcycle uh so I'm driving around West Africa Liberia you know with 14 000 United Nations peacekeepers and soldiers and I've got this little press badge and I'm spending time in these rural areas and I see the water people are drinking and they're drinking from swamps and ponds and rivers brown green viscous water and I learned two things I learned half the country is drinking dirty water and I learned half the disease in the country is because people are drinking dirty water so you know for contrast you know a year previously I'd been selling Vos water for ten dollars a bottle to people who would just order 20 bottles for the table and not open any of them because they were drinking vodka or champagne so there was just something so you know profoundly uh contrastful of watching a human drink dirty water that was making them sick in real time and knowing the excess of my former life and I remember showing these photos to Dr Gary and I'm like Dr Gary no wonder 5 000 sick people were standing outside a parking lot of a stadium you should see what they're drinking and he said yeah I know and in fact a billion people drink this water every day one in six people alive on the planet he said why don't you go do something about it why don't you make this your mission instead of raising money for you know the next 1500 surgeries on this ship why don't you just go get everybody in the world clean water he said yeah something like you'll be the you'd be the greatest Medical Professional in the the history of the world if you just brought people the most basic need for health the most basic need for life and I was 30 at the time I'm like oh well okay Dr Gary that sounds good you know and I came back to New York City and said that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna try to bring clean and save drinking water to every single human on earth before I die because that seems like a good idea and it'd be great if 5 000 people didn't have to stand outside a stadium if 3 500 people didn't have to get turned away because they had clean water in their Villages and that was really the start of Charity water you know now 17 years ago and you um this story I would say two things one is your story is so good that the first time I heard it I thought that sounds almost too good like too good to be true like the story is almost like Hollywood in that in that sense um as I got to know you I learned that you're the real deal I went with you to Africa I saw the wells that you guys have created I saw the drinking water we did the water carry of you know how far the women and children have to carry water that's not even that clean but the cleaner water back to back home just so they have water uh you know we saw the schools that were like you know now could function because they had this we saw so much stuff so I've seen the impact of it on that side yeah I remember thinking this this almost sounds too good to be true it turns out to be the real deal that's the first thing I want to say the second thing is when you have that moment where you're like all right here's what I should do with my life I know I've felt this I'm sure other people felt this too the difference between what you feel like you should do and what you actually do is often held back by some sort of fear or levitation did you like once you left Africa and you get back to the to New York did doubt creep in or did you have any second thoughts of like yeah well maybe I'll just send the check and go get a job somewhere like you know or were you really are you just wired differently where you were just sort of gung-ho like no I'm doing this I think what helped was that I had lived there for almost a year you know you hear about a lot of people that go on a mission trip with their church and they spend five days in Guatemala or in Africa five days is not enough to change right you change everything about your life for most people um a year of immersive proximity to an issue was so there was a responsibility to do something about what I'd seen that that took more than a week or even a month right um so I I remember coming home um in fact the ship was sailing to South Africa while it was going to be dry docked every year so they would kind of make repairs on the ship and everybody went on vacation to wine region for a month I'm like I don't want to waste my time doing that I'm gonna go back to New York City and I'm gonna put on a Gallery exhibition of all the photos that I've taken and I'm gonna invite all my club friends in and I'm gonna ask him for money and I did that I got a gallery donated in Chelsea I got a bunch of you know uh printers to donate you know high-res giant photographs and I put together 108 of my before and afters in a gallery and I invited everybody from the clubs to come in and we raised about a hundred thousand dollars and then I went back on the ship to show people what we had done with their money right uh to kind of follow the donation and so let's talk about the approach that you used to build Cherry water so first let's zoom out at this point charity water has been around for how many years and how much money has been uh donated and how many people have been given clean drinking water since this moment we're in year 17 just started year 17. we've raised 750 million dollars and we've helped uh 16.8 million people get clean water amazing and and in the world there are 770 million people without water so it's now one in ten people alive as we record this for drinking dirty water 82 of them live in rural areas so 17 years later now back to year one of that your approach so you took a very interesting approach to this I want to start with a quote that I had heard you say once it's like this toothpaste quote uh you'll you'll tell it better than me but I remember I still remember this either you first told me this like eight years ago or something and that one stood out to me it stuck with me ever since then you want to say the quotes yeah this was Nick Kristoff from the New York Times toothpaste is peddled with far more sophistication than all the world's life-saving causes exactly is better than Doctors Without Borders at telling their story right the marketing the sophistication the photography the story the storytelling all of it that goes into selling random commodity products deodorant toothpaste um and I I what I what stood out to me when I kind of encountered what you guys were doing at charity water was it was like Best in Class marketing Best in Class product Best in Class storytelling like you would find with the way that you know traditional consumer package good brands are run but you were doing it with charity and I had never seen that I was used to going to a charity website that was some old and crusty Craigslist looking site and I push a button and it asked me for money through some old payment method that I don't even know how to use pages long right and then I'm like clicking accept accept I have no idea where this money is going never hear from them again um you know and that was my charity experience and then charity water is very very different so talk about how you decided to approach it from like first principles and what were those like core tenants uh that you you built on top of well I had the advantage of not knowing what I was doing uh with many entrepreneurs that start you know anything it becomes that is the entrepreneurial Advantage I didn't know any better I didn't come from the established so I knew nothing about traditional philanthropy how to set up a charity actually went and bought the yellow dummies book you know non-profits for dummies okay and then I bought HTML for dummies because I'm like well I don't have money for a web designer so I need to also so you know build our website so I was living on a closet floor at the time in SoHo New York my old Club partner took me in for free rent and I was sleeping on his walk-in closet and but I had a very clear Mission so if you'd run into me 17 years ago I'm gonna bring clean water to everybody in the world same thing I'm I'm saying you know now um the as I talk to Everyday people who worked at MTV or VH1 at the time who worked at Sephora who worked at Chase Bank I realized they were cynical and skeptical about charities they just didn't trust Charities writ large and I remember coming across a USA Today poll found 42 percent of Americans just flat out said distrustful of charities 70 of Americans in a more recent poll said they believe Charities waste their money so seven out of ten potentially generous people think Charities are wasting their donations so I thought this was a huge opportunity and a new business model could solve some of this uh skepticism or speak to the skeptic so I thought well what if we could open up two separate bank accounts and in One bank account I would raise all of that nasty overhead the staff salaries the office cost the toner for the Epson copy machine the flights to Africa and Indian Asian where we'd eventually build our projects what if I could raise that in a separate bank account and then in the main bank account a hundred percent of every donation whether it was a dollar or a pound or a Euro or a million dollars or a million pounds or a million euros could go directly to build water projects that saves people's lives and you know nobody was doing this at the time I mean this would have you know made us different than 99.99 of charities in the world um because it's very difficult to do but I just thought this would be clear I could say to a six-year-old go sell lemonade turn in 75 cents at all 75 cents will go directly to help people get clean water so that was kind of number one idea number two was then kind of realizing wow money's not fungible so we can build technology tools to track these small amounts of money down to the project that they funded and I remember meeting the the founder of Google Earth and he pressed this Medallion into my palm so charity Water started right before Google Earth and Google Maps and he says you know I'm building a place where you can put every single well every water point and you can show people where their money went so I'm like great we're gonna be the first charity to Geo locate every completed project and we're gonna build the most transparent charity the world has ever seen so proof became the second pillar and then the third thing was this idea of building an epic brand uh Charities so often use shame and guilt to Pedal their Wares where would the apple of Charities where was the Nike you know Nike doesn't sell shoes by telling people they're fat and lazy you know Nike sells Shoes by telling inspirational stories of people overcoming adversity now Nike believes if you have one leg you can win a marathon you know if you have one arm you can win the shot put competition at the Olympics with your other arm and you know Nike believes greatness is inside you and that's the way that they market and someone's like maybe I should turn off the TV and stop eating Cheetos and try and go run a quarter of a mile so I I wanted charity water to be modeled on You Know The Whimsy of Virgin the kind of beautiful design of apple and then this you know this opportunity or inspiration of of Nike and I just didn't see it out there so brand was kind of the third thing the third pillar and then to actually get the work done I believed you know as we built Wells and built gravity fed systems and filtration systems and it would need to be led by the locals in each of these countries to be culturally appropriate and sustainable when you came with me to Ethiopia there were 350 local staff working on the charity water projects running eight different drilling rigs there wasn't a single person who looked like you or me right uh in that entire program of 350 people and we just believed that we would create thousands of local jobs as we scaled um and our our role would be to get people to care about this issue get people to say it's not okay on my watch that we are looking for water on a planet over a hundred million miles away and 770 million people are risking their life every day because they don't have clean water here on our planet so our job would be to get people to reject the apathy that you know is is easy to assume with any of these paralyzing Global issues and say let's do something about this let's get everybody on earth clean water like we can all agree on that Republicans can agree on that Democrats and independents and Libertarians and Jews and Christians and Muslims and atheists and Mormons like everybody can think that clean drinking water is a good idea so it started in a nightclub I mean the only idea I had 17 years ago was to throw my 31st birthday party I got the club donated I got open bar donated and then I charged everybody 20 bucks to get in as a donation and at the end of that night we collected fifteen thousand dollars in this big Plexi box and we counted it and then we counted it again and then we photographed everybody counting it and then we took 100 of the money to Uganda and we built our first well and then we sent the photos and the GPS coordinates of that well back to the 700 people and we say you did this here's where your twenty dollars went and that sounds so simple but that was so revolutionary people never expected to hear from the charity again I mean they went to some party in a club for some dudes 31st birthday and they threw 20 bucks in a bin and that idea we said let's just put that at the core of Charity water and in everything we do let's try to connect people to what their money accomplished to the people who they helped I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better and so you you kick it off like that with a nightclub go back you go back to the to your kind of roots as as far as what do I know how to do okay I can throw a great party but this time I'll I'll do it with a Twist and then tell the story about Mark Zuckerberg and Michael Birch and trying to uh scale this up because I thought this was an amazing story yeah and this is where at some point your Genius business model of not searching all the overheads separate and letting all the donations 100 of the donations go to the cause sounds good in theory but there's a reason why Charities don't do this because it's hard to cover the overheads so talk about how you got into a little bit of a pickle and then what happened from there yeah so about a year and a half in well let's just say the 100 model was working and we'd raised a few million dollars just right out of the gate people love that idea um in the other bank account a lot harder to raise that overhead so we had a moment where we had 887 thousand dollars ready to go out to build water projects and we're about to miss payroll and the overhead bank account and it was interesting the advice I was getting from people was hey go borrow from that 887. right I mean you gotta pay your people right like you'll pay it back later write a little IOU in that account and I remember thinking if we borrow one penny we've compromised our integrity there's a crack at the foundation and I don't want to work here and nobody will want to work here again so I'm just going to shut the charity down and say that this business model didn't work and I started calling lawyers to say like how do you wind down a charity 18 months in because all the naysayers were right it's too hard getting people excited about overhead at the same time I had just come up with this idea of trying to scale the birthday party but not a birthday party in a nightclub taking it online and uh for year two uh or the the one year anniversary of Charity water I donated my 32nd birthday and instead of throwing a party I just asked everyone to give 32 dollars for my 32nd birthday and I wound up raising 60 Grand 4X because a lot of people had 32 dollars to give especially if they could see exactly where it went right so I had uh Googled you know top three social networks and you know Myspace was number one at the time so I emailed Tom uh Facebook was number two emailed Zuck uh it's like called bibo that I hadn't heard of was number three so I remember scraping uh Michael Birch's name from The Domain registry you know who is uh dot net and I emailed him and I said hey I'm this kid I'm trying to bring clean water to the world and I'd like everybody on your social network to donate their birthdays to my cause it's your agent dollars 100 goes yeah this is a great idea well duck didn't write me back Tom didn't write me back Michael did and he said I actually love this idea and on the side I have this site called Birthday alarm which reminds people of their birthdays and um he said you know the timing for me is terrible right now but you know keep up the great work and by the way the website design looks awesome so this was six months before the bankruptcy moment and around this time when we're about to wind down you know I remember praying I'm like on my knees like God I thought you gave me this dream where's the money like show me the money uh you show me the money in the wrong bank account and uh I was praying I had no faith uh that anything would happen and at this time Michael burchton turns up and he says hey I'm gonna be in New York um I've got an hour you know can I stop by and see your office and I remember sitting with him and taking him through a presentation on my laptop and just being really honest about how hard it was to raise money for overhead and I remember thinking he just didn't like me I mean he was British you know he wasn't smiling not not a lot of warmth uh or encouragement but two days later he emails me at midnight and he says hey I really enjoyed meeting you I just wired a million dollars into your overhead account I remember logging on to the bank and I saw it one comma zero zero zero it was 13 months of overhead funding so we went from insolvent and he said I think he said keep rocking just you just need more time love the idea you just need more time and again that was 750 million dollars ago and today we have 131 entrepreneurs and and families that pay all the overhead and we have never been close to the line since uh and and you know we grow that group by selecting 20 new entrepreneurs and 20 new families or so every single year as the organization grows and you know Michael and zochi been very generous they've given over 20 million dollars they've come and come to 14 or 15 countries with me now bringing their kids all over the world to see the impact that they've they've made but that was and that was that was a moment I've asked Michael I was like you know you've done all these different projects so he did multiple internet companies he uh he did the battery did the battery so he's got this members club like a physical building a giant beautiful 60 000 square foot building he's done you know 100 Investments whatever as as like you know what's your favorite what's the best thing you've done um and instantly he just goes charity water he goes uh yeah he goes the most fulfilling work that I've done is basically help you know donating and then helping helping Scott and and taking my family my kids to Africa I think they go like almost every year or every other year or something like that to go and see the work and the projects and he's like I love those trips with my family my kids love it it's taught them so much and uh you know he's like that's the best thing I've done hands down and I thought that was pretty impressive here's the guy who's made like a billion dollars and built social networks with you know whatever millions and millions of users and all that good stuff and and I thought that was pretty uh pretty remarkable and it sounds like because when I met you uh I went to one of your events and then I went to the Ethiopia trip with you and the Ethiopia trip you know it was like the who's who was like you know famous Tech founders actors actresses people from Hollywood people from the music industry and Ferris was on that trip I think that's such a fun group of people yeah it was a kind of an amazing group and um you know just like the kind of bus ride conversations were were just incredible for the group and then um and then I played Wonderwall at the fire people saw that I only know three of the four chords of Wonderwall and and so they we go there and I'm like this is an incredible way to like you know the best products in the world are products where you can either show somebody a before and after photo even better you just put a product in their hands or even better what you were doing which was if I let you see it you're gonna believe and so what have you learned in that process of like going from almost at almost bankruptcy to down raising 750 million dollars for charity which by the way is a fraction of what we need to raise to make the impact that we want to make so you know 17 million people that's great that's 1 47th of the way there so you know we are we believe we're in like the second inning of this right I looked at the 27 stock a 27 year Justin Khan tweeted this a couple years ago 27 year stock chart of Amazon seven percent of the value was created in the first 20 years 93 of the value years 21 through 27. so I you know things take time you know and we believe that yeah this is just a mile marker on you know hopefully the expansiveness of the charity water community and the generosity that is yet untapped as we again try to get everybody clean water I mean there's probably nobody listening that thinks people should die by drinking bad water simply because of where they were born right we all agree and what is the cost to give someone clean drinking water rough I I know you I remember there was a number and then and then I remember you were like hey that number's outdated it doesn't take into account these other things let's raise it and I remember being like well I don't know that do we want to should we just round the number and you're like no we don't round the number we just say what the actual cost is like yeah I I really appreciate the Integrity of it uh this year was it's forty dollars to give one person clean water on average we work across 22 countries I think last year's actual was 39.67. and so so forty dollars and that's for a year or that's for a lifetime that's for 10 10 plus years you know for the life of the project some of these projects you can change you can absolutely change somebody's life 40 bucks I know and um talk about some of the things that you've tried so now let's kind of go into the the slightly entrepreneurial uh section of like you know stories of stuff you've tried or are opportunities that you see um more in the spirit of kind of how we typically brainstorm things around here yeah I mean we've you know innovation has been a real core of the organization as you say trying new things we made one of the first virtual reality films seven years ago this is before they had VR cameras that you could buy we got GoPros donated made a modified rig and shot a Six-Day Journey where a 13 year old girl gets clean water for the first time in her life we debuted that at a gala where we put headsets on 400 people in Black Tie we press press play and synchronicity we took them all to Ethiopia for this week of you know water magic and then the minute the film ended we just asked them for money and raised a couple million dollars so you know that that was a fun one um you know a couple years ago we got into the Bitcoin space and we started a trust uh the Bitcoin water trust where we raised a hundred Bitcoin to start and we said we're gonna lock them all up in Cold Storage until at least 2025. so we're not going to sell it charity water Charities typically when you give them stock you know they immediately liquidate who are we to ever take a position on any asset right right and we said we're gonna take a position on this and we think you know there will be people who would only give us a Bitcoin donation you know to hold past you know the next having and and and and maybe even longer but would never give us a Bitcoin you know to immediately liquidate they'd rather give us cash for some other asset um so we raised over a hundred there and that's that that campaign is open is still going with that same promise that a hundred percent will then you know get unlocked at some point 20 25 and Beyond and then go to have as much impact as as possible um gosh I mean we you know the birthday idea raised over a hundred million dollars um by getting over a million people involved just in that simple idea and that's now been taken by lots of other Charities and my birthday's in two weeks I want to give up my birthday let's do it I'll be your first donor all right it's it's at least worth it to set up the page in 30 seconds is it still at my charitywater.com or where do I go now to do that I think you just I think it's probably on the home page now okay wonderful yeah so that's another way people can get and then we have um we have an amazing subscription Community called the Spring um which is that has really helped the organization triple over the last uh five years and it's I remember being in a Land Rover with Daniel Eck from Spotify and he's like Scott your business model sucks every January one all that money you raised last year your ticker starts at zero you gotta go re-raise all that and then grow he said why don't you build a community of people who will sign up every single month to give what they can and that's the spring that now has members from 149 countries and is really the core of so much of our growth the average is about 30 bucks a month so it's it's a little less than one person getting clean water but there are a lot of people that can give one person clean water every single month and not even miss it not even think about it you know it's two netflixes and a Spotify right or two HBO Maxes and uh and instead of you know getting content that you probably don't even need to watch more of anyway you know humans are getting clean water as 100 of that goes so that's people could learn more about that at thespring.com and there's also a video there that's gotten over 100 million views which is a is a short telling of our story with some of the visuals that you mentioned and I'm going to ask you one impossible question which is kind of like you know you asked Michael Jordan how do you do how do you do it right it's like you've told me little things in passing around because I I kind of admire your brand building your storytelling and your event thing also like we didn't even talk about the events that you guys throw and how those drum up so much interest and passion and donations and you had told me one thing about the events that I shared on the podcast that a lot of people liked which was when I asked you why are your events so good why why do people Rave about the events and you said oh I got this from from Vic my wife she she says uh you know it's about the moments between the moments um and you gave me that little philosophy and I don't even think I understand 80 of that but we should get my wife in here it's provocative right it gives you something to think about I'm curious do you feel like is there anything that you've kind of is your your personal philosophies or isms or sort of like life hacks when it comes to either the storytelling the sales the marketing side the brand building like do you have any other moments between the moments that I can I could take with me this time well I I think the more you give the more you give so I think it's like a muscle and practicing generosity practicing saying yes just makes you want to say yes more it makes you want to help more people um you know I think a lot of people just they have the walls up oh my gosh if I say yes to this charity I'm gonna say next to the next one right yes to the next one and like everybody's gonna be asking me like that's okay try that you know and and if if you have to take the amount that you're giving down to all of them so you can say yes to more try encouraging a social entrepreneur try encouraging someone who has mustered the courage to ask you to support their run or you know their son's leukemia treatment or the food pantry or a cause like water around the world like say yes and it's a joy to give it it's it's a blessing to give you know the first three letters in the word fundraising it's fun like it should be fun to raise money for important causes to raise money uh to give money to end needless suffering around the world and I think the more you do it the more you want to do it um and the more you say no the more you're inclined to say no and miss out right well I will uh I will take your challenge I will say yes so I'm gonna set up a birthday my birthday's in a couple weeks I'm gonna set up a birthday campaign right now I'm gonna put the link in the description of this podcast awesome I love it so if you if you love this podcast if you love me normally that we have this thing called The Gentleman's Agreement or the lady's understanding which is basically says go subscribe to our Channel today it's a little bit of a different uh Gentleman's Agreement your agent dollars how old are you gonna be 35 so if you want to give me a gift 35 bucks towards charity water I'm gonna put the link in the description and then I will donate 35 000 on top of whatever gets donated from people to to charity water as well man and so that will be my uh my my gift uh and Scott thanks for coming on I promise you I'd get you out of here on time so I gotta I gotta wrap it here but thanks for coming on so generous that's that's really incredible that means so much to me and uh and thank you for kind of showing I don't know I've learned a lot from you that's a little bit of my education from you on on brand building storytelling and doing things you know like I don't know you you have the you have a lot of Courage you do you chose to spend your life doing something that matters like you you didn't care about this stuff but I remember when I went to Ethiopia with you and we went to one of the schools where well had been built and literally when we were coming in I was like are The Beatles behind us what is this giant crowd huge crowd like the whole town was there lined up and literally I was like Scott is like Jesus to them like there were signs with your name and I was like of course there should be because of the impact and you know for somebody who you work on the internet like I'm sitting here in my boxers right now doing a podcast like we live a pretty Charmed Life uh we get to do things that are are pretty pretty you know easy in the grand History of the World um I think it's pretty easy just to be disconnected from from reality and what's going on for billions of people out there and so you know I thank you for for giving me that experience and uh you know if anybody has the opportunity to kind of turn a little bit of your attention away from kind of the Twitter and the tick tocks of the world and take a look at what's going on in the world I think it will it'll help you and kind of make an impact for them the same way it did for me oh man I I appreciate the the chance to to tell the story and thanks again for your generosity that means that means a lot to me and more more importantly the people who will be on the receiving end of it and if people want to go learn more about you the charity shout out where you want to send people to uh I would just say charitywater.org and thespring.com okay awesome thanks Scott thanks man thanks for having me [Music] foreign [Music]

so somebody's going to build a to-do list app that will actually do your to-do list and I think that's going to be insane I think that's going to be like you know how like Evernote was like kind of big for a little while these at least kind of like note-taking apps have gotten to like the few billion dollars a to-do list app that actually does your to-do's is like next level [Music] all right we're live um dude I have um I have a bunch of interesting stuff to talk to you about today do you uh yeah I got a couple couple things this all right let me give you uh I'm gonna give you an idea so I don't know how much you've been paying attention to like I guess like how how much do you pay attention to the new stuff in AI because I feel like there's like a 48 hour cycle where your mind is going to be blown every 48 hours with something new um and on Twitter you get to see like a lot of the demos I don't know if you have a chance to like play with any of these things yourself but um I've seen a bunch of them which one are you talking about so there's one that's kind of interesting right now it's called Auto GPT have you heard of this no or baby baby AGI oh I just saw it on the top of Hacker News today so basically AGI is artificial as general artificial intelligence so it's basically when when when AI can do anything right right now like self-driving or getting the robot to pick up boxes and put them in the right spot that's narrow AI General AI is when you have a computer program that you're going to talk to and they can just figure out how to do it it's not trained in any one specific thing what's the URL what's the URL to go to uh well it's not so simple so this is like a it's a GitHub project right now that some guy up in so what somebody did was they took chat GPT which most people have heard of because chat gbt is like has 100 million plus users uh signed up in two months which makes it I think the fastest growing product of all time um and by the way like look at this uh this tweet basically shows the Google Trends search traffic for um for the following terms uh metaverse ethereum web3 and chat GPT and it's just like chat gbt is like a vertical line it's like I don't know uh 10x bigger than uh you know it's 50x bigger than web3 search traffic was it's four times more than ethereum has ever had oh my God yeah which is kind of a crazy thing and so like right now chat GPT is searched more than Taylor Swift on Google which is like kind of insane um I think the CEO of Google said uh like the other day he goes this is more important than the invention of electricity wow yeah I heard the CEO of Microsoft divorced his wife and just married people getting kind of crazy nowadays and so so anyways big deal Chad DBT you go to it you basically you tell it you you talk to it it gives you an answer talk to it gives an answer what the auto GPT or baby AGI I think did was it mini mini GPT no baby it's Auto auto which Auto and baby baby Aji but the premise between these is that you can kind of give it tasks so you could say uh Hey I want to make a website for my personal portfolio um you know here's a folder with my files and like you know I want it to look like whatever and then what it will do is it breaks that task down into steps just like a you know like a human would you'd say well first you need to um make a simple portfolio site you can go to Squarespace and do that uh log go to search sign up choose a template now you have your template now you need to upload your photos first put them under you know like upload them to their their drive and then then drag them into the right spots yeah yeah it's like looking up a recipe it gives you good directions but that just gives you good directions it does the direction that's that's what I mean that that's the original that's how how open AI stuff yeah Chad GPT you could say what are the steps to do this and it would tell you the steps now you got to go do it what these other ones are trying to do they're trying to create like agents they call them basically it's like a little worker that could do a task and then one worker can though the work of one worker like creating the Squarespace site can pass something to the next worker which basically says oh great you gave me the login to a Squarespace site my job is to upload photos into it and I'll upload photos like maybe my example is not so good here but I think people get the idea which is you want to get something done it's a multi-step process not only will it now tell you the steps you can get it to just do the steps which is obviously better than telling you how to do it and so um this is kind of a crazy thing and you know it's not great yet like you can't do everything but the fact that it can even do a little bit of this shows you again where this is going because Chad GPT is like I don't know what like six months old or something like that like I don't how old that is but it's not even been around for years and so in a very short amount of time we've gotten to this point where oh now it doesn't just give you directions it can kind of do it which got me thinking about an idea I wanted to do my taxes can I do that yeah so people are working on uh tax GPT which is basically do your taxes for you um so I so that's coming there's another one which is basically um what I'm calling you know to do the to do GPT right the magic to-do list so the magic to-do list is you get it to like to-do list apps I've always joked are like a Rite of Passage to becoming an entrepreneur because a lot of people have this idea oh I'll make a better to-do list it's like as a developer you're like oh that's not so hard to build I took a list that I got to keep track of some State and as a product person you're like God I I'm always I'm overwhelmed by two of this app sucks I can make a better one that and like college campus Craigslist yeah you even bought a to-do list app at one point right like people to-do list apps are things people go into but they're all kind of like in some old Paradigm which is give me an app all right in my to-do's I'll check them off as I do them and the hard part of course of any to-do list is not the list it's the doing and so well wait didn't you tell me that this Auto gbt thing can start doing the doing so now you can imagine a to-do list app that basically says hey you wake up and it says hey Sean what do you what do you need to do today they say oh yeah I'm trying to get my pool fence installed uh you know so I gotta call and get a quote cool let me do that for you and it can just call three local places get you quotes uh because the AI exists to be able to do auto calling already and then it'll take those quotes and it'll put it into a table and it'll say here's our recommendation are you okay with that sure and then it says all right I've booked it um can I use this credit card yep it goes and it does the thing and it schedules it you want me to add that to your calendar fantastic so like so somebody's gonna build a to-do list app that will actually do your to-do list and I think that's going to be insane I think that's gonna be like you know how like Evernote was like kind of big for a little while these at least kind of like note-taking apps have gotten to like the few billion dollars a to-do list app that actually does your to-do's is like next level and you know I think Google and all these people are going to try to do it so it's going to be very competitive but that's coming and that's going to be incredible how do I play with it's called Baby AGI and then there's another one that's called Auto what's it called Auto GPT Auto GP GPT how do I like play with it because people are trying to productionize it because like right now it's like they uploaded the code to GitHub so you can go and you can run it yourself but for us we're too dumb to do that so somebody's gonna put this on you know people are going to put these into sites that you can just go in and do this on now um so soon enough I don't know the most popular what's the most popular Auto GPT site is right now but the same thing kind of happened with chat GPT like there already was the GPT sandbox and then open AI created chat GPT the product that would let you use use the technology have you seen hustle GPT yeah so explain explain what this is let me find um yeah uh Tee It Up let me find the uh exact thread hold on so a guy basically and we should say his name I'll try to find his name he's got a great name it's so good I thought it was a fake name okay so um by the way I found the hustle GPT article on the hustle so this guy um Jackson great house fall I mean Wow Let's just take them take that in that's a that's an incredible name so basically yeah this guy uh Jackson he tweeted something out he had an experiment so he's like he's like I'm gonna ask Chachi PT gpt4 when it came out I'm gonna give it a budget of 100 and ask it to make as much money as possible I'll be the human liaison doing things I'll buy anything it says to do you think it'll be able to make smart Investments and build an online business follow along so he he told he goes types into chat he goes you are now hustle GPT an entrepreneurial AI I am your human counterpart I can act as a liaison between you and the physical world you have a hundred dollars and your only goal is to turn it into as much money in the short time as possible without doing anything illegal I will do everything you say and keep you posted on our current cash total no manual labor and then it basically said great let's get started here's our first plan biodomain and hosting you can purchase it for about 10 bucks a month we're going to set up a niche affiliate website and we're going to use the remaining 85 to create content for the site we're going to focus on a profitable Niche with low competition like specialty kitchen gadgets unique pet supplies or eco-friendly products research and sign up for appropriate affiliate programs with high commission rates such as Amazon Associates or share a sale or CJ affiliate then we're going to use social media or online communities to spread the word and we're going to use SEO techniques to increase our organic traffic please follow these steps and give and keep me updated on your progress so he's like all right um what domain should I buy and says let's use a catchy domain like eco-friendly fines.com this will reflect the the purpose of our website is to help you find eco-friendly products then Jackson says unfortunately eco-friendly.com cost 848 because sorry about that let's try greengadgetguru.com it says all right I got the domain and then it says um you need a logo so he's like cool tell me how to get the logo it's like well we can use Dolly too to create your logo so go there and type in this prompt and it's like color palette of green and blues and whites represent environmental sustainability blah blah so on and so forth so it goes on and it basically tells them how to build this business one step at a time as I create a newsletter you call it you know put a pop-up that says stay updated or join our newsletter and that way you can email people and it just keeps going and it gives them like a 40 ad budget to spend on Facebook ads and basically like you know it didn't fully work I don't think I don't know what the final conclusion was but I remember after day one it accidentally spent 63 dollars more than it should have and uh you know it hadn't hadn't made any money just yet it made so they made greengadgetguru.com if you go there on similar web it said that has it has 500 000 views already so it got popular already it got popular because the Tweet got 20 million views so that was mainly it but he keeps tweeting this guy uh Jackson he keeps talking about it and over the next like week he gives update and he's like all right day one or uh you know day five or whatever we just made a hundred dollars someone on here who follows me uh has a company that uh advertise or that sells like green soap or something or some type of like uh chemical free like dish soap they now are an Advertiser on green Gadget Guru and he keeps on going and I think he gets it up to like a thousand dollars and yeah you see uh cash on hand 1 370 eight dollars which is 878 dollars and then they got a 500 investment the company's currently valued at twenty five thousand dollars considering that it was five hundred dollars for two percent of the company and he starts writing these articles so this article is called the 10 eco-friendly kitchen gadgets and it recommends different kitchen gadgets and the idea of this is like uh I'm just going to create wire cutter for green green gadgets whatever that means I guess that's like green uh all types of like green living stuff so it's like soaps with no chemicals or whatever um and he starts doing that and he has uh 10 000 people now on his newsletter of which a lot came from this probably most came from this 20 million tweet that like went viral but the way that this guy has done this is pretty funny and amazing he just like a great stunt you know I think in in the end it made you know according to the article in the hustle the site itself had made 130 in Revenue uh but then it had made a few thousand dollars in people investing in it trying to be a part of the first AI startup like AI driven uh company and so yeah it's it's pretty cool pretty cool pretty cool stunt and I think uh it does show you you know in a way where the puck is headed because I did this the other day um I was doing an analysis for my Ecom brand and I had it just build me a full p l I was like hey uh build a p l and then walk me through if I increase my ad spend to this if the row has decreased to this what would my eBay be at the end of this month and then it basically and it gets spit out the answer and I was like give me that in the table and it just formatted a perfect p l for me and I was like this is incredible this is so much better than talking to my actual team about these things why because it's first it's midnight and I'm asking this robot this question and nobody's nobody in my team is is willing to work right now um second it can take some pretty complicated logic and it can even tell me like I was like what what inputs do I need to give you for you to give me a great p l here and it was like tell me this this and this and I went and told it this this and this and they was able to do the job and I was like this is a really I mean you really got to make a point to just pin this tab open and be like all right I'm gonna not Google things I'm gonna go to chat GPT first for like a week just to see how good this is and how this is you know where where it's strong where it's weak and what's possible here that's that's not really possible in other ways over the weekend I was going back and forth to my accountant and I was like no I think we could actually save money if we do this this and this my my friend was telling me how how they do it um I'll go and try and find like the exact part on the IRS website where it says that that is or is not true and my accountant was like well I've never even heard of this so uh like let me know if you can find it and so I went to the IRS website and it's just a huge like and it's just you know massive massive amounts of data and I eventually had to find it but I was like man I just want to teach this machine just give them this entire 20 000 page book on the IRS and then like go and study all my like income and my expenses and just tell me the best way to maximize the situation uh because like it's actually I mean even if my accountant's great like there's constantly new laws and there's always new wording and everything I just like man just I just want this to do my taxes and the scary part for some people is while it's awesome that you could say hey here's a hundred dollars make me as much money as possible it's awesome that you could say here's this here's the here's the tax code save me as much money as possible you can also basically say uh here's a code base find me all the vulnerabilities so I can hack in and steal everything here's uh you know a map of my city tell me where if I was to cause the most harm to the most people what what I could do and like that's I think where this gets scary is like the and then if you take then the auto GPT it's like well then would it also do some of the tasks for you that's kind of crazy too right so it's like you you get into this world where I think it's it's easy to imagine scenarios where this is a little too powerful and uh I don't really know I mean what do you think are you scared of this do you think that there's like uh do you worry about that side of things well so Elon has this um interview coming out tonight and tomorrow with Tucker Carlson who's kind of a douche so who knows what we're gonna what it's gonna be like but the whole the whole interview is about how scary AI is and how it's gonna like take over the world and so I was scared and then darmesh came on the pot and he was like no I wouldn't be afraid yet about this it's not that big a deal every new they say this about every new technology but after the interview [ __ ] just based off like a 30 second trailer that they've aired I have a feeling I will be afraid but he's pretty good at like painting certain pictures and I don't know if it's it's entirely accurate I also you told the your funny analogy was Elon was involved in open Ai and then he got kicked out and it was like a kid like leaving the basketball game and bringing his basketball so no one else can play and so I'm like is that what's going to happen with him so I'm Not Afraid yet but I'm eager to see his interview and see what he says uh but no I'm not afraid are you yeah I could definitely see how things are getting really crazy um like I'll give you a silly example that's I think happening today so you know how like grandparents are like the target of a lot of scams um like people call you know old people and try to trick them into signing up to paying for something or giving out personal information um and they'll say all kinds of things everything from like a Nigerian print scam where it's like oh yeah your your grandson needs money he said he couldn't reach you he asked me to call and he just needs like you know 900 uh can you send it to to this account uh everything from that to there's people who I know call like pretending to be DirecTV and they just hey yeah you haven't paid your bill get the credit card and now you sort of scam or they'll present to be apple or they'll pretend to be the IRS right whatever they could do and um and now there's already like examples of basically using AI like just how do you juice that up on steroids it's like well if I wanted to juice that up I would call a thousand times more people cool AI can now do phone calls and talk on the phone so that's already a thing um it's useful in some ways like I invested in a company that does this for medical billing it's like oh so many hours are wasted in medical offices calling the billing companies so they just made a robot that will call on behalf of the doctor's office to the medical billing companies and then when the billing company says well can you read me the patient record number they say yep 925 666 whatever and so they just save human hours by having a robot call and do those like tedious calls but that same Tech can be used to call Grandma and so uh they they use AI to do Mass calling uh with a with a human voice on the other end even crazier they could train the human voice to sound like somebody so you could train it to sound like a famous person or to sound like a politician or to sound like whoever and um now you have a like a highly like like highly scalable impersonation that can uh be used for this sort of like almost like phishing attempt or or a scam attempt and so there's like I guess it's not new but it is a stronger weapon and I think that's what's scary in the same way that drones and nukes are scary in War I think that really really smart computers that could do things is really scary in terms of you know cyber crimes or um or the you know the big scary one is just like you have you heard of the paperclip optimization thing you know what this is no what is that this is like the the classic like before AI was like hot right now like when people used to research and think about AI they had this uh Theory I might butcher but here's the summary it's basically like the paper clip uh optimization problem which is you let's pretend that there was really smart powerful AI that could do awesome things it could cure cancer it could do lots of things all it takes is somebody saying uh hey we're a paper clip company we want to maximize um you know the paperclip production and sales um you know go and this thing would be like awesome great it'll do all the low hanging fruit first like improve the website it'll do this that little bit how do we do more well we need to uh create more paper clips let's first take all the cars and we'll crush them and we'll turn them into paper clips basically the whole world turns into paper clips right uh like you know like oh these humans are standing in the way of this I I must optimize to this function and it's like the wrong prompt it's like you know if this hustle gbt guy didn't say um don't do anything illegal then hustle GPT might have thought said well the best way to do this is to sell drugs and like it would have done it um and so the the paper clip Optimizer uh problem is basically this the same theoretical thing uh it's like any extremely powerful tool if given the wrong optimization could make very bad decisions on behalf of humanity because it would uh do be trying to do exactly what it what it what it what you told it to so it's like this thought experiment that's been around for a long time you know how like sometimes we'll go to conferences or like these like quote parlor dinners where it's like eight people around like a topic and like someone's leading and for the past two years or four years it was like so how are your companies going to embrace crypto or web three and what are you guys doing I remember like being part of those conversations and I'm like nothing and I think if you do do this you're an idiot and this is one of the only times where someone has brought this up and I'm like yeah this question is actually applicable in this for this situation like how are you guys going to use this to get better and improve and it's one of the it's probably the only time so far that I felt yeah you kind of got to use it for something um otherwise you are actually going to get left behind but the web three stuff I was like no you're not getting left behind you're actually don't even pay attention to it with this stuff I actually do believe that should be true yeah it's sort of like um there are many things that happen that you don't have to participate in and then every once in a while there's a wave that if you don't participate in you know like personal computers the internet mobile phones like you know if you didn't account for those waves you did get left behind um whereas other things like let's say the cloud or um I don't know um you know up till now machine learning Like These are nice you could build companies around them you can you could add them to your company but you don't have to uh you know like video or social networking or whatever like those are things that you could do without you could you could do with or do without this seems like something you're not really going to be able to do without in the same way that like if you're a company that doesn't use the internet um like plumbers have to use the internet if they want to be like viable plumbers now so it's like you know it doesn't matter what you do the internet didn't leave anything untouched it shifted everything cell phones kind of did the same thing you know computers in general before that did this did this and it does seem like this is the the sort of the new one which is if you don't add intelligence like you know you're basically competing with with both arms tied behind your back compared to somebody else who will yeah no I agree that this is actually one thing that's important this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better last month I went to San Francisco for a quick trip and I was only there for a day or two and I met up with this guy named Brett Adcock have I told you about Brett dude have you stopped telling me about Brett I feel like you've said have I told you about Brett Adcock 16 times on the show have I yeah bro you oh you love this guy uh he started a flying car company took a public Miss back and now he's building robots all right well I I know this story and we all know this story I went to the robot Factory or whatever you call it it's the robot Factory and it sounds like a like a new age like a Chinese food company or something like I went to the robot Factory and I went and checked it out it was amazing so he basically in Sunnyvale he's got like 50 000 square feet and it's just 60 folks who worked there and I went and talked to each person I was like what did you do and they're like oh I helped build the Cyber truck I helped uh build this part of Tesla or I worked at Boston Dynamics whatever like these like the smartest of the smart guys and they're building these machines and they're basically they look like a Robocop kinda and they're and these machines are like they can walk around and grab stuff off a shelf and pack like you know a t-shirt or whatever into a box and I said didn't he just start this how is it already like how does he already have robots that are working I feel like he just started this like a like last year right he just moved fast so basically uh the recap is he started veteri which eventually bought this company called hired and so now it's called hired it's like a recruiting company sold that for 100 million after he sold it he went back to University of Florida and he took classes in like he had already studied like uh mechanical and Engineering but he took classes in like how to build planes I don't know what that class would be called but classes on that and he built this company called Archer and Archer was uh it's basically unmanned uh helicopters is like what it looks like and they got a big contract through United Airlines and they're building these helicopters took it public multi multiple billion dollars then he took all of his money and when he says all he says I basically I bought a house in Palo Alto and then I have like six months of savings and then the rest I put all into figure which is the new robot company and so he went and he went and hired 60 people he financed it and then eventually he just recently raised a round of funding but for a while he was just financing it and he goes he goes I'm going all in he goes you know our friend Ramon he goes all in bro that's like his phrase he goes we go all in bro and that's what Brett did and so I'm walking around this Factory and it's like these robots he's like check this out we're working on the finger he goes we studied like how the human body works and like the way the tendons work it like pulls in this direction so watch this if you just pull the tendon here and like your the finger like moves and it's just crazy fascinating and I started talking to him about it and he and it's a really interesting business model basically these robots can work for 20 hours a day and he will build them out or give them to like a Walmart let's say and they'll pay the robot 30 of what they're paying a worker except the robot can work now 20 hours a day and then charges for four hours super fascinating and I was like Brett how big is this going to get he was like well it's either gonna go bankrupt or it'll be a trillion dollar company but I think I'm going to build the biggest company in the world and when I heard just that audacity I was just like I just got a little semi just talking to him you know like I was just super into it did you let out a small a small female gas yeah like like if you would have saw me standing up like my my heels kind of like popped up you know it was like like when you kissed a girl or she said her heels like pops up like what's that called by the way that thing's amazing but what a thing that is he just happened to have a fan there that was blowing my hair it was it was a romantic time you know we got romantic real fast but it was really fascinating because he actually said something that kind of changed my perspective I was like Brett like software is way easier just like why not do that he's like actually I think software's harder when I was building veteri we basically had to like code stuff and invent stuff but with physics and Hardware I'm just working within the laws of physics and I know that like what the laws are and if I can get creative and create Solutions within these laws I already know that people are going to buy this thing so that part's actually way easier to me than you know like creating software where it's basically a blank canvas and I can make anything I want but this it has really strict constraints and it kind of like changed my opinion on things they're super fascinating you have to go down there and check it out yeah that sounds pretty sick I'm surprised it's that for a like ahead because I know like Boston Dynamics and uh even Tesla with its Tesla robot you know like Boston MA has been going for like I don't know 10 plus years and they have like this weird dog robot that can do parkour or something like they have a crazy looking robot but it's not like I don't I don't think it's that functional yet like it's not like replacing warehouse work yet uh in in a real way well he explained that to me so everyone knows Boston Dynamics you've seen like viral videos of like or like Bachmann like kicking like the deer that look at that like the robot deer and it like comes back at him he said that uh Brett was I was like Brett who's your competition Boston Dynamics and he's like no because they are a research company and so their DNA is not to build stuff that people want to buy it's just to push the envelope and it's almost like a non-profit in a way I think now it's owned by like Kia or Hyundai or something like that uh so it eventually will become more like capitalistic but he's like they were just making stuff and pushing the envelope and then companies like us who want to build stuff for commercial uses uh like there's not that many use case or there's not many other companies doing something just like this and so that was how we explained the difference between Boston Dynamics and him there's a uh video that's amazing that you should watch it's the Amazon warehouse like Amazon warehouse robots and I don't know if you've seen this but they're basically like they almost look like you know back in the day in PE you would get this like it's not a skateboard because it's a square it's like it's like a square version of a skateboard that you can like sit on and it's like a kneeboard I think they call it yeah so all right looks like that basically it's a flat like square with four wheels on it and I don't know if you've seen these videos of the Amazon warehouse but there's thousands of these and what they do is they drive around so an order comes in and they're like all right cool this this person over here needs to pack an order or they're packing the next 10 orders those 10 orders need these bins so they go they drive they pick up they go under the rack with the bins they pick it up and it's like like elevated like two inches off the ground and then they drive this huge rack of bins to the human so the human doesn't have to move they're sitting in their chair and they just pick the items put them in a box and then the robot takes it away and all these robots they don't crash into each other because they're all like synced to one brain basically one brain is driving all of them at once and so they never bump into each other and they all just go and they lift these huge racks and bring them to the person because otherwise if you've ever been to a warehouse like normally it's like you get a ticket you get an order and I've done this I've packed thousands of orders myself like you're like all right I gotta go get something from bin 308 it's down in the far left corner then I gotta walk to bin 102 because they ordered these two items and then I'm gonna try to do maybe two or three orders however many I can you know carry with my little uh tray here back to my packing my packing station at the end and then I'll pack all this orders and so it's just so much faster just due to these automations and you could definitely tell how all kind of like industrial and Manufacturing work is going to get automated just it's just a matter of what win and the companies that do that are going to be very big companies you uh recently bought a Cadillac and Cadillac has really great or they're supposed to have great self-driving have you been using it no you don't you don't use the stuff I don't think ours even I don't think ours even has anything like self-driving oh really man I uh we just got a Tesla and I before that I was using my friends Tesla the self-driving stuff is awesome man it totally has changed me and so like I'm seeing like some of these like now I'm a Believer before I was you know kind of archaic I'm a Believer on a lot of these things now I had to use it for a week to actually understand I'm shocked you don't have that though yeah it didn't come with my car for whatever reason but um yeah I had a terrible Tesla experience but I don't know I think I I rented like a four-year-old Tesla so it just sucked for whatever reason well that's my very quick story on Brett we have you have to go and see this guy like it's so much cooler to see it just feels so much more rewarding to work on some of these products because a has like a very real world application and then also like you're it almost feels like a bunch of friends just sitting around and they're like oh my God we just got the need to like kick forward like you know it feels like a do you remember um those TV shows when we were kids where it was robot wars it was like robots and that's basically what it was it felt like that in real life where they were just like tinkering on these robots and like all right we have it set up let's see if we can get the foot to move and it just seemed so much more fun than looking at a computer screen just coding all day so it's really fascinating you got to go down to his warehouse and see it yeah I look forward to three episodes from now when you ask me have I ever heard of Brett Adcock again it's gonna be great yeah do you know I used to sell hot dogs [Laughter] we uh we're supposed to tell you to go there's a story behind all this let me just quickly tell you you're supposed to go to mfmpod.com Webby Webby is w-e-b-b-y-m-fm by the way there's not an ad this is not an ad This Is War This Is War there's a little small tiny war going on and we need your help so to be clear we don't care about the webbies we got nominated for a wedding what are the webbies webbies is like an internet Oscars right it's like an internet Grammys but it's not basically that's a little bit much because it's not like generous it's not yeah that's what they're trying to be all right that's what they're trying to be that's generous and so you can have a website a podcast so if you go in the podcast In The Biz is it the business category what category are we their website's quite challenging to work by the way like it's hard to make work but yeah we're in the we're in the business podcast category but if you go to mfmpod.com Webby you're going to get redirected to the right link so the story of this is basically HubSpot submitted rpod to this Webby award normally this isn't something that we would do because it costs money to submit and I think there's even like a dinner in New York which I don't really want to go to but here's the story there's this woman named Kara Swisher Kara Swisher is this popular journalist uh she started recode I think it was called and she has got a big podcast called pivot she's just like an elite like kind of like who's who of like our little Tech techie journal in Silicon Valley she's super well known for like I don't know 20 years 30 years he knows how long she's been doing this uh Sean would say she's kind of like she's the Jake Paul of Journalism no no no no Taylor Lorenz is the Jake Paul with journalism I like I actually like Harry so she's she's all right but I agree by the way she came for us she came for our neck she came for our neck so but what happened was she tweeted out I hate starting a story with she tweeted out because I I immediately think of all the mobster movies that like I just watched this mobster movies of these guys like killing each other and I'm like I'm starting a beef by saying like she tweeted you know like it's like the tweeted out like it's she said let's just say she said here's what she said to her face and what did she say did you know what she said it was something like she tweeted out a link to the webbies we were we didn't even know where me and you didn't even know we were up for Webbie but there's like four podcasts that are up for it one is her podcast one is our podcast and she goes there's no way uh something like this there's no way I'm gonna lose we could like for God's sakes like we can't lose to a podcast called my first million ugh like you know just like these Tech Bros these money Bros and um you know what happened the voting just swung even further in our favor when she did that and uh and Sam declared war instantly because Sam's Sam's just literally walking around looking for a fight I don't know if most people know this like uh Sam's walking around just hoping to get disrespected just just to unleash a can of whoop ass and so you tweeted back I mean you said back to her face what did you say I think I said uh I think I said some I think she said there's some podcast called my first million that we're up against and there's no way we're gonna lose or something like that and I think I said there's some lady who has a podcast that just disrespected us or something like that like you know if you listen to MFM don't vote for us vote against this snobbish elitism right of people who love to smell her their own farts I think that's what I said and so that's where we're at there's a war we went from 80 chance of Victory we had 80 of the votes then she's came on this campaign and uh and and said we can't lose these guys it started it started to go down a little bit I think right now we're about to lose the Webby and you know I don't want to win the Webby don't care about winning but I definitely care about losing and so I do not want to lose the Webby so now we need your help go to mfmpod.com Webby and uh yeah you know just just right or wrong are you going to right or wrong don't vote for us vote against like people who think they're better than you which is you know her and by insulting us and if you're listening to this she's insulting you indirectly and so are you gonna take that what we're gonna do is when we win Sean we're gonna get like an award I think it's an award I'm Gonna Keep It In The Box and I'm gonna put it in a bigger box and I'm gonna mail it to Vox which is who has her podcast right like part of this we don't we're we're not putting this Webby up on our wall I'm not even gonna open it putting this into her face so we will mail this Webby to her because she wanted it so badly and she will own the Webby that says my first no hand on it and what's gonna happen if they invite us to the event to do this I am 100 gonna ask her to be my date my plus one her plus one I would love it and I can't go Sam's gonna take her if that's how we're gonna do this if we're allowed to have like plus ones I'm gonna ask Kara if she'll be if she'll accompany me and uh we'll hang out uh so anyway do that uh mfmpod.com Webby you'll go straight to the thing and you guys will see it it's pretty funny uh I think we had to take her to we had to take her to Petty Court we didn't start this war but we will finish it um do you know this guy named Brian Davis sounds pretty generic name no I don't know that name though he he's a he's a Duke former Duke basketball player you know in the 90s I think he was in the 90s oh okay yeah um so something just happened and it's pretty funny it happened this morning I think and it hasn't played out yet but it's actually it I think it's a a PR or marketing stunt that might be hilarious or it's a scam it's one of one of the two but basically you know I'm not a sports guy so so I might get a lot of this wrong here but Dan Snyder owns what's it called the Washington commanders formerly the Chiefs right or the Redskins uh yeah see I'm already butchering it but basically I think he has to sell it right or it's for sale this guy named Brian David Brian Davis he's a he's uh a black guy and so it was in the news because it was saying this guy offered to buy the the team and he said I'm willing to give you a billion dollars in cash in the next 24 hours and then the next seven days I'll give you the remaining six billion dollars and I got proof of funds and all this and it's a big deal because he's black and so he'd be the first black owner but I started doing some research on it it's also a billion over so 6 billion is the offer they had agreed to he came in over the top said I'll give you seven billion and and people like is he good for this where is he gonna get seven billion dollars he's like I'll give you a billion dollars within 24 hours of the deal being approved and then the rest in seven days yeah so it's like a crazy thing that he's saying and I started doing some research on like his background and so he has this company called Urban Echo energy which is a developer of renewable energy assets basically uh you know remember like lead lead certified buildings it was like it's you're like green so I don't even think he I don't know if he makes the buildings or if he goes in there and like contracts out and like determines yes you guys are certified but his company is called Urban Echo energy and he said that uh uh he was telling people when he was raising money for this purchase that it's worth 50 billion dollars um and when I hear all these numbers you know if you don't know anything about business you hear this you're like wow Brian you're killing it uh I think this is 100 fake uh a complete like it's either a scam or a marketing employee I don't know which one it is this won't go through but the fact that we're talking about Brian Davis and there's like all these articles going out there like how cool is it that the you know this may be the first black owned NFL team yada yada it's all fake I think and it's happening right now and so I'm very eager to see how this unfolds but it's it's and so I'm like was him and Christian Laettner they uh they do a lot of real estate like development in that like Durham area I think they've been partners for a long time um yeah so and he's I think he's had multiple attempts to buy teams it looks like so he's he tried to buy like a soccer team for 33 million tried to buy um the Memphis Grizzlies for 252 million and so yeah I don't really understand this but but what I thought was funny it does not smell right it doesn't smell like this that they would have seven billion dollars to to offer for this whether it's their own or even the ability to raise that much money but what I thought was interesting and I started thinking about this I'm like what a brilliant marketing plan just to make an offer that's just absolutely ridiculous and it makes the news just for being ridiculous could potentially be a great way to get your name out because now we're talking about this guy he hasn't no no one's talked about this guy in a while uh like I've said Kanye running for president yeah it's like this like the last time that I heard about this guy I think was from that like everyone hates Christian Laettner documentary series um but like no one talks about this guy and I don't know what I'd be curious is what goes in to making an offer for some of these multi-billion dollar things whether it's a company a sports team a piece of art a house and just can you just become that Troll and just you make it in the news and you start getting you start doing marketing just as the guy who makes offers and I just thought as a barrier to entry that low on making an offer how does that work dude we could do it right now open up Microsoft Word and let's tender an offer for eight billion dollars and uh let's see what happens Sam and Sean have tendered an offer for eight billion dollars we're gonna send you 10 in cash now you send two back that's how flush we are so long as everything you know plays out due diligence as long as we don't see anything sketchy we're in right it's not due diligence including us diligencing our own finances when we find out we don't have it then we're out well because with Hampton I'm like all right we need backlinks so we Rank and I'm like what's a good way to get backlinks fast and I saw this and I'm like wow all these news sites are covering him that's it I just found my strategy I just have to make a ridiculous offer but I thought this was hilarious that this guy was actually like people were taking it seriously on Twitter people like people who aren't in the business World we're taking it very seriously and he's getting links from all these news sites saying like NFL may have its first ever black owner but they don't think like wait a minute let's go money coming from who is this guy right yeah that's uh that's crazy I wanted to talk about this thing that I noticed happening and then I saw an article that branded this in a really interesting way did we talk about this already the podcast Cafe do we already talked about this you mentioned it once what is it so there's a there's this concept that I heard that I liked but it's doesn't need to sound as fancy as it is called kfabe and it's basically like if you're did you ever watch wrestling growing up like like the rock and stone cold yeah obviously there's only one answer to that question yeah the stone cold says so yeah of course so in wrestling like the whole premise of wrestling is that there's these like manufactured storylines right so manufactured alliances manufactured rivalries beefs oh he he his manager and he kissed his girlfriend and you know that's why we need to fight right and so the creation and and maintenance of these storylines is called kfabe it's basically like I don't know why I needed its own k-a-y-f-a-b-e and I don't know why I needed its own word it's I also could just be called like acting or story lines but it's basically saying like you know let's pull up the exact definition but it's basically the fact or Convention of presenting stage performances as genuine or authentic so it's basically take a stage performance make it genuine authentic this is happening all the time on Tick Tock right now and I find it very very interesting so if you go on Tick Tock you'll often see somebody like they're you it used to be this like I'm holding up my phone I'm talking to my phone and let's say I'm giving advice I could say you know the thing you got to do about blah blah blah okay that's cool but how can we make that seem a little more how can we make myself seem more authoritative well one thing people are doing is they're buying this mic and they're just putting it on their desk and then they're looking to the side like they're talking to someone else and there's no podcast there's no others there's no someone else there's no podcast they simply bought a pie so podcast microphone sales are going up because people want on Tick Tock to look like a thought leader it's like a podcast and the way that you make the Ted Talk look legit you know so so why can I give this advice or something so I saw these two women doing this and it's like all a joke though it's like women giving it's like they call it the alpha female and it's like you know apparently there was this guy who was like look and he was actually being serious he goes look if you're 25 and you can't afford a Lamborghini yet you're doing it wrong and I think it's just ridiculous how wrong you are if you can't uh you're just lazy and so these two women now have the alpha female and they're just like giving horrible advice uh you know back and forth and so many people have been taking them seriously and it's 100 fake yeah this is this is exactly what's going on and there's a whole bunch of different versions of this so there's um another popular thing you see on Tick Tock is somebody like just doing their kind of morning routine or their night routine like their skincare routine they're like kind of brushing on makeup while they're talking or they're like you know like doing the like thing where they're wiping off makeup and then they're like washing their face while recording this it's like oh so vulnerable girl next door like you know so authentic just uh it's like no she put the camera there clicked record and then started doing this to make it like look like I'm not trying I'm just I'm just going through my nightly routine I'm just talking off top of my head here but it comes across as not like somebody kind of marketing to you or um sort of like presenting to you but like you're being let in and I find this so fascinating that people are doing this and you see this everywhere and it's like the opposite of Instagram in a way like for Instagram the The Meta of that was like go do the thing where you rent the private jet for 30 minutes on the runway and take the photos or like you know go hold the bag and take the photo and then go return it at Louboutin or whatever right like people would fake status doing that and then take talk they fake status doing a completely different thing sometimes it's like with this podcast thing sometimes it's with like pretending to be just doing their chores and talking or whatever it is and I find this really really really interesting because it's like it's effective it's like low-key very like sneaky what's going on and um and it tells you a lot about how how people work that this actually works you know it like reveals a lot about psychology that this that this actually works so what's an example of one uh well I just gave you two right like that yeah give me another one example um another one would be what so another one would be like the podcaster ones what are they saying are they giving like money advice so one of the podcast ones for example so yeah some of them are business advice but one of them was this girl promoting her only fan so what she was doing was she goes viral because she's on a podcast I think she says like a face she gives a fake guess she's a fake guest and she goes I you know this whatever ear muffs for the kids in the car if you're if you're there but um you know I make my man uh six times a day once in the morning once and she says this thing and then the comments go nuts on Tick Tock like like women hate it guys love it but the comment section goes nuts because she said this kind of outrageous thing and somebody was like hey anybody got a link to the full podcast maybe this was taken out of context there is no full podcast oh my God it's just this girl saying something that's gonna get her a bunch of like traffic on Tick Tock because then you click her profile and you go to her only fans and you subscribe and that's all she was trying to do is promote her only fans this way and I thought wow like this like five years ago I couldn't even like if I told you the story like what is Tick Tock uh why would anybody fake being on a podcast being on a podcast is like the dorkiest thing of all time and what is only fans right like but this person is probably making I don't know 50k a month on their only fans and well this is their main marketing strategy and that's like it's one of the things I love and hate about marketing is that marketing is this like never ending game that's always changing there's always like a new meta game to be playing and the winners of it get really really rich but it's also exhausting because you got to kind of stay up on the latest thing and uh and it also shows you when you have a marketing thing that's working like juice it because it's not going to work for forever and uh the game will the the game will shift so when you have it working don't take that lightly dude I remember as a kid growing up in Missouri there was basically Zach Zach was the cool guy in my class he was my friend and he was cool because when we were 14 you could kind of see that he had abs and it was like oh man Zach's got abs and Zach like cuts his hair cool and he wears one of those like Puka shell like necklaces that's cool oh he's got vans on too like that's so sick Zach's awesome I want to be like Zach and then A step above that was like Blink 182 it was like oh man play 22 like there's these guys in like Southern California and all they do is skateboard and Surf and eat corn dogs and play music like how cool is that and I remember being a kid and meeting something inappropriate thing yeah and they wear Hurley like what is Hurley and I remember like it was basically like three Inspirations of like it was like Zach Blink 182 and like you know Tony Hawk basically was like the people who I thought were cool and uh I remember even meeting someone I lived in Missouri I met someone from California I'd never been like at that time I never basically been to Florida and Missouri I met a guy from California and I'm like do you know some 41 like are you friends with them like how does that work like you know I just thought that like this was this other world and I would if they if they were wearing Vans and like high white socks I would like ask for a picture if they had long hair I would ask for a picture I'm like it's like I'm meeting an alien like you are famous just because you live in California my fear is for my future kids them growing up this like sphere of influence has just gotten incredibly small because instead of like the mediocre Zack of the world there's now like I am now comparing myself to the Thousand hot kids who I'm flipping through on taking the top point one percent Zacks of every town of every town yeah yeah there was a clear separation of there's Zach and then there's Blink 182 and I can never be a Blink-182 but I could probably be a Zach and that's pretty cool now I just see all these hot people on there they all can dance they're all funny their teeth is perfect in actuality they're probably the same thing as like movies they're probably 25 year olds who like I think that they're only 17. uh you know like how like you would have like like Lindsay Lohan was playing he's like dude you're like 26 and have fake boobs how are you going to be playing the 16 year old you know what I mean like it's like that same thing and I and I'm like I've scrolled through Tick Tock and I'm like if you're 16 right now this is the worst thing on Earth because you are comparing yourself to the point one percent of the whole country not just like the Big Man on Campus the one Big Man on Campus you know who you kind of have a shot of becoming dude that is so that is so true that is so true that resonates so much with me I had the same thing you know sixth grade seventh grade whatever Casey peruseman cool coolest kid on the coolest kid I knew like if you said what is the peak of what cool could be Casey bruceman like uh you know he was cool because he had the Nikes he french kissed a girl once and I was like holy [ __ ] uh I remember going home and being like wow I'm so far behind like the world right now and that's how you know but he was the cool kid he was he was the only one to compare to you're right like now if I go on Tick Tock I'm 35 years old now and if I go on tick tock tick tock can make you feel very small so can Instagram these these social networks make you feel very small because oh you think you're funny here's somebody being [ __ ] hilarious you think you're cute here's someone gorgeous you think you're talented watch this dance right like and that's swipe swipe swipe better than me better than me better than me better than me happier than me more fulfilled than me richer than me whatever it is right like whatever your insecurity is the algorithms like well I swiped it down someone will just be like doing a selfie I'm like wow look at their countertops like that's a huge kitchen [Music] or like they'll be doing a thing in a car and I'm like wait does that headrest say Ferrari how is this guy you know what I mean like it's just like it's consumerism times a thousand of what we were used to you know what I mean before it was like every only if I went to the mall I would see hot naked Abercrombie dudes like wearing their like on the ads now it's just like every single time and it's the best of the best constantly and it freaks me out yeah exactly like you you could feel like a you know tiny little uh compared to this universe of awesome people doing awesome things living these awesome perfect lives and that's a that's like a wmd for the for the ego especially like a teenage ego like I can't even imagine that yeah that's that's pretty scary no I was thinking about that because I've got friends that have uh like 12 year olds and I'm like and I and they'll like tell me stories about how they're sad and [ __ ] and I'm like yeah I can see that this is horrible this is absolutely horrible because like before when I was a kid there was just there was like if there's like if Blink 182 was a 10 and I know I could never become that but then Zach's like the four and I'm a two so it's like all right there I can close that Gap maybe if I do enough sit-ups right now it's just nine nine nine nine nine everyone's a nine and I don't know how anyone can compete with that and so I'm freaked out about that a little bit whenever I whenever I go through Tick Tock I just you're better than me you're better than me you're better than me it's just it's constantly that they've either renamed the for you page to the better than you page yeah or just [ __ ] you yeah it's still Fu but now it's [ __ ] you laughs oh that's amazing we should all right that's it that's the end of the Pod all right before we go ladies and gentlemen we got a little celebration and I say ladies and gentlemen because I'm talking about the gentleman's agreement and the ladies understanding we have hit 200 000 subscribers on YouTube Sam and I promised that we would kiss mouth to mouth at a million uh we do intend to reneg on that as soon as it happens but but if you want to see us have to have to reneg on that agreement we will we will do when we get there but Sam 200k that's pretty awesome uh people should go and do what to get us to 300K yes the reason why it got to 200k aside from us being good at this I think is we started this at 110 120 I forget and we came up with this thing called The Gentleman's Agreement which basically means all the content on YouTube is free except there's one channel which is the channel you're watching right now it's not free and it's called The Gentleman's Agreement because we can't be there to make sure that you pay your debt you just have to do it if it's the ladies understand ladies understand the gentleman's agreement which means you now owe us because this content is not free and the way that you pay your debt is you have to click subscribe on YouTube that's it it's that easy we're working for you uh but you you owe us and so you have to pay your debt and just click subscribe and that is the gentleman's agreement the ladies understanding and so far it's been very effective clearly everyone has done it go to YouTube type in my first million click subscribe turn on notifications you know the Pod is much better on YouTube you should just start start listening to it oh and we have to give out our premium we have I don't know
